												From a player that's played this game since release back in 2007, playing across 3 servers, founder account, over 15,000 hours logged over the years. I can tell you that my feelings for this game are very genuine and it's taken me a good two months to write this review after leaving the game. I'll be honest, the game truly has fallen from what it used to be, it's become, let's say, easy from what I remember years ago. Angmar content is probably on par with what vanilla WoW was for me, The massive amount of meticulousness that had to go into every single character that you had. From the start of character creation, you were in danger of getting absolutely smacked by landscape mobs if you were a certain class and pulled mobs badly (I'm looking at you hunter). The way you had to play a class was very different from launch than it is now, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing at all, things change, just me reminiscing over times long past. This is just the tip of the iceberg so to say.Now, on to the content. The developing team behind LOTRO has put out content consistently that appealed to the audiences up to Rise of Isengard, which in my opinion, was one of the best expansions I've ever played in any MMO. The content before and including Isengard (Angmar, Mines of Moria, Seige of Mirkwood) are incredible, everything from the instances, zones, questing, down to the ambient sounds, it was amazing. Now this basically talking about the expansions as a whole, (I consider Angmar an expansion in this list, but it was vanilla content more or less) but the zones in between the major content areas were amazing as well, North Downs, Lothlorien, Evendim, Enedwraith, If you have never experienced the night in Forochel, you are missing on one of the most amazing game sceneries ever. Great instance designs in all of this content, from forging into Carn Dum with your friends and overcoming the managerie of bosses and Mordirith, to conquering places like Barad Guldur and the Tower of Isen along with toppling Saruman in an incredible battle atop the tower itself. Many many memories will never be forgotten that pertain to such events that took place in the game. Alas, many new players will never get to experience this content simply because the game has progressed far beyond all of this. Most of the players that I met during my final year and a half or so were players that were there to rush to level cap and do ""end-game"", that's the joke kids, there is no end-game. All it is at level cap is a daily grind for your daily reputation factions for that ""highest tier raiding set"" that you will never put to serious use because most of the players that play the game now will NOT run content that will challenge them. It's that simple, I led pug tier 2 challenge runs on my main server of Windfola for years for players not in raiding guilds, and people would rather run Sambrog 6 man spams for crap rewards than spending a little more time in a bigger, more challenging instance for big reward. It pained me to see that the game populace had declined to such a lazy group of ""give it to me without the challenge"" group of people, because let's be honest, anyone that played in vanilla LOTRO can tell you how bloody hard it was, JUST to get your resistances right to actually stand a chance in Carn Dum, let alone actually fighting the bosses. But don't be let down, there are groups of players on many servers on both EU and NA that play around the level of that old content when it was released so they can specifically run that content and have it challenge them, they are great people and they organize themselves in server world chats and forums still.Now on to the ""current"" content. After Isengard, the game started to decline, Rohan was a let down for most players, the introduction of mounted combat looked fun on paper, it was ok, but it was buggy, and it never really fit in with most players. The landscape was pretty for a bit, but you got used to the rolling plains. The instances were sadly a joke in terms of difficulty, aside from the raids in that cluster for the expansion, the three raids that were introduced were pretty fun and challenging at the highest difficulty of tier 2 challenge, Fires of Smaug and Battle for Erebor were great fun, but the third, Flight to the Lonely Mountain was pretty much impossible at release because it was buggy, it got fixed, but far to late for such a simple problem. Then you had the the most outrageous rep grind in the form of Hytbold reconstruction, something that would take around a solid month to complete if you were very diligent about your dailies, something that had to be done to aquire your level 85 class set pieces. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but the real knife in the back really came with the area expansion of Wildemore with the atrocious rep grind at the end of finishing every quest in the zone, it was terrible, an everyone that I knew hated it, and it was all for a shiny epic accessory piece that didn't mean a whole lot. After this Helms Deep released, Big Battles came with it, I won't go into detail about it, but it was something to see, especially as a player from the beginning. All the classes were redone, traits were completely overhauled into tree progression, basically the game was stripped and redone in most aspects. No new instances were included, no raids, nothing except the battles that most hated, I did my progression through them, did A LOT of bug report testing for them over the months, some say to this day that they are still buggy. When they released update 14 I called it quits, said my goodbyes to many, and uninstalled.As for players that really enjoy playing PvP, I STRONGLY recommend you watch videos and visit the official LOTRO forums and read through the PvMP threads. Personally, I think the community for PvP is toxic and players are simply looking for who has the bigger E-Peen at any given time. On any server you will find flavor of the month players that jump from class to class every update so they can destroy you with minimal effort, it's just terrible habits that a fair amount of them have and it's nasty, one of the main reasons that led to me leaving the game, considering there really is no PvE endgame anymore.Now, don't get me wrong I will recommend this game to anyone that every asks me about it, it's very good looking, classes play pretty well, questing isn't a total bore, crafting can be ok, there is amazing RP opportunity. Just remember that this game has been around for a good while and is going through it's decline because of recent content release, but there are still servers with 200+ player login, people still play this game, I leave it up to you to decide whether to drop subscription money to do a large amount of things that this game has to offer in terms of content. I've made many dear friends because of this game, maybe you will as well.As for the players that have never progressed anywhere near the end of a character's leveling path and experienced a large amount of this game, they truly have no opinion of the game. They haven't gone through anything that would give them any right to judge the game in any way shape or form, it hurts greatly when I read a review from someone that hasn't even logged an hour and down votes this game.Aa' lasser en lle coia orn n' omenta gurtha (May the leaves of your life tree never turn brown) :)			"

												I played this game from the time when Evendim was first introduced up to when they released the Helm's Deep 'expansion'. In that time, it was my primary game. It was great. Kins, raiding, PvP. It was all I wanted in a MMO, with a Lord of the Rings theme. Unfortunately, the game went down hill.The first expansion was Moria and was a good expansion. Probably the height of the game. We got loads of instances, a lair raid, a legendary weapons system and two new classes. They even gave us a few more updates with some instances and a couple of raids.The second expansion was Mirkwood. It was marketed as a 'mini-expansion', and though it was smaller than Moria was, it was still much larger than anything we had later. We got a new instance system called 'Skirmishes', where we got soldiers and about a dozen instances to fight with them in. It was good, it filled it out. Mirkwood also came with 3 x 3 man instances, 1 x 6 man instance and a 3 boss raid with a gauntlet at the start. It wasn't as good as Moria but it was cheaper, so we accepted it.Then came the biggest issue: Turbine was bought by Warner Brothers. Only a couple of months after this, the game went 'free to play' (you can play for free, but it's heavily restricted and you need to pay to unlock things). The community was a little concerned, thinking that it would mean the reduction in quality of the game or finding lots of 'pay to win' items. Turbine assured us it would be alright.They released a large update with about 4 or 5 instances and a raid. It was a good instance cluster, but it didn't come with any level cap increase so loot wasn't that desirable. It also came about 6 months before the release of another expansion.Rise of Isengard was our first expansion since F2P. And cracks were beginning to show more and more. They released it without any instance cluster initially. Only a single buggy lair raid that was originally promised as a free update and later tacked on to the expansion to fill it out. Then, slowly, we got the instance cluster and raid. It was an alright raid but it felt hollow. We'd waited a long time and then got nothing more than a mini-expansion had provided before, especially when it cost twice as much as Mirkwood did.After that, we got Riders of Rohan. This 'expansion' was the biggest joke of all. Originally, they didn't tell us what was in it when they released pre-purchases. Then, after people bought it, they revealed it wouldn't have any instance cluster. No raids. The only end-game would be a daily grind to rebuild a town. That was it. The community kicked off. Eventually, they gave in and said they'd include an instance cluster. But the instance cluster was about Erebor (the mountain in the Hobbit) and not anything to do with Rohan. It was clear it was intended as a cash grab for people who watched the Hobbit films. We got the first half of the instance cluster a few months after the expansion first released. Then we got the second half. Both times they gave us these instance cluster halves, they called them 'updates'. Usually, updates had new content in. This time, it was just delayed content that was supposed to be part of the expansion. The downside being all of the instances were terrible, the raids were 2 lair bosses and a gauntlet (so less than the Mirkwood raid), and people gave up.By this point, Turbine had also gone out of their way to monetise what they could. They ignored complaints about lag, grinds, and broken old content. Instead, they began selling more store-only items. They milked what they could from the playerbase without caring what sort of content to deliver. It got to the point where the community was so divided between fanboys and people hostile to Turbine that the forums became a propaganda-fest. The CM banned dissenters left and right.With customer trust erroded, Turbine finally announced their next (and my last) expansion. Helm's Deep. They didn't have any instances, only these things called 'Big Battles', which took away any importance of class and relied on generic big battle upgrades. They also did the thing that killed the game for many people: Trait Trees.Before, you could trait your character how you wanted. It made hybrid builds viable and widely varied. You could make a class built for survival, or DPS, or whatever you wanted. But Trait Trees took all of that away. They gave generic builds to everyone. Now, you couldn't run a hybrid build because you could only choose one line and the skills it came with. They literally locked our skills behind 3 different lines. Where a person might have a few healing abilities in their DPS build, they were now locked behind the healing line only. Sure, you could put points in other lines, but it didn't give you the skills you wanted like before. In effect, they took everyone's characters and made them generic, cookie-cutter builds.After this, they said they had no plans for another expansion. A few small updates here and there, but it's basically maintenance mode now until Mordor. A cash cow to squeeze, not a game to please.And now we're at the point where they've driven so many people away that they're having to merge servers to save cost and to make the population look busy again. 29 servers cut down to just 10; 5 US servers, 5 EU servers. It says a lot when a game is forced to make such drastic changes, while pretending it's doing fine. Not only that, they've been unsuccessful with actually transferring characters between servers, so in true Turbine form they've got no clue what they're doing.TL;DR: Do not play this game. It's no longer what it once was. It's a broken, hollow, generic shadow of its former self, and Turbine are only using it now to milk the few remaining loyalists for all they're worth.Edit: To clarify, I have a Lifetime account. I get full VIP perks forever because I paid a large amount when I first started playing. So my complaints are from the perspective of someone who doesn't even need to pay for it, yet still can't bring themselves to play it.			"

												I've done nothing but farm work, help hobbits set up a festival, chase animals and beat up brigands for two hours, and I loved every minute of it.It's strange really, I've played practically every major MMO at this point, and the only one to grip me alongside WoW is LOTRO. Personally, I'm tired of being treated as the SAVIOUR OF THE UNIVERSE as soon as I hit level 2. Hell even by level 20 in LOTRO I still often help ordinary folk with ordinary things, and I enjoy that. If I want over the top epicness there's a million and one games that do that, but LOTRO keeps things level headed for the most part (Excluding a dream sequence that was hamfisted in at level 5 where YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE or some crap, but that's generally disregarded by the community and even  the devs as it has yet to be brought up again). This is greatly aided by the fact the MMO is based on the -books- and not the films, which is a great relief as Radaghast for example isn't an insane lunatic and there's no mention of a rabbit sleigh just yet.That said, when the drums of war sound, and orcs and goblins march, the game isn't afraid to take a turn into the dark and foreboding. The sky goes from a clear blue to a grim dark grey or even red as I approach Angmar, the woods and wildlife growing more desolate. I can't help but feel I've only made a small scratch in the surface of the adventures that await me yet. The mundane quests are gradually being set aside in favour of ""Oh god,♥♥♥♥♥♥s going down, halp pls"" from townsfolk, which suits me fine.Having sunk money into the expansions and quest bundles as they were on sale (Fairly frequently), I have all but negated any -need- to subscribe. A subscription at this point would only give me a few more character slots (Which I don't need, already have five), access to PvP (Which I have no interest in), a daily XP bonus (Which doesn't last very long) and an allotment of premium currency (Which I don't really need either).I subscribed for a single month a while ago, and that has removed currency limits, given me more character slots, and even removed the lock on my class, race and virtue trait slots on all characters I played back then.A lot of people are put off by the in-game store, yes it does pop up now and again, especially after level 30 or so if you haven't bought any zone quest packs, but really at the point I'm at I don't really see it all that much. Additionally, you can grind out premium currency in a fairly adequate amount, hell last time the expansions were on sale I managed to get one -purely- by grinding. It was a bit boring, but it was helped by a lovely bunch of max level players offering to help newer players like myself farm out the currency. There's even guides on getting said currency in a quick, efficient manner, if a little repetitive as it involves making characters and doing specific tasks over and over.Is the game perfect? No, it shows some signs of age, namely in the graphics (The Beoring race/class is a fair grade higher quality than the other race models), some could argue the combat was clunky. But it's otherwise well-preserved, namely with exquisite attention to detail. Weapons make different sounds on hitting enemies based on what the enemy is or what they wear, rather than the same generic SFX being heard for hours on end, to name just one example.As a frequent role-player, LOTRO holds the crown as the most RP friendly MMO I can think of, cut down only by it's rather archaic housing system, which is very restrictive in terms of decor (Seriously, you have to place furniture in fixed locations, meaning my bed has to be in the middle of a room...). Which is a shame, as the RP community has shrunk significantly, to the point where the only prominent RP takes place in the prancing pony inn. And obviously the quality there can often be... lacking. A great shame, but the game is niche so a tiny RP community is expected.tl;dr: The game is good, try it. Premium currency can gradually be gained for free. Wait for zone quests and expansions to go on sale before buying them. if you like the game, considor subbing just for one month to remove the worst of the limitations on your account and characters (Remember to login to each character to unlock their traits etc while you're a VIP).

												So I have played this game a lot (even more than Steam says I have) it was the first MMO I played but I have played others since I started playing LOTRO I have always been Vip and have all expansion packs also I play on the Withywindle (EU) server.There is a lot to love about this game even if you know nothing of Tolkien' work and just want to try out something a bit different or try an mmo for the first time.I personally know people who are lvl100 with all expansions and quest packs and they have never had to spend a penny of there own money but it truly is an epic grind to do that I personally recommend buying the quad pack of expansions to get you up to date and help you in speed of lvling.Pros  One of the best PvE experiences I've ever had in any game. The world is massive with thousands of quests and thousands of hours of game play with plenty of instances/raids/epic battles to get involved in+ Great community.+ There's always something to do.+ A good wardrobe system allowing almost endless cosmetic options.+ Great crafting system with the ability to make epic weapons clothing etc.+ Festivals in which you can unlock items such as mounts, clothing/gear, pets and more.+ Almost endless exploration if your into finding new stuff in game you won't be disapointed.Cons+ PVMP needs a bit of a reboot you can have some epic RVR action but varies by server.+ Can feel daunting sometimes due to size of the world.+ Virtues can be a massive grind .+ Crafting needs an update.They are my pros and cons I really love this game infact I have loads of games in my steam libary unplayed due to my love of this game try it out you never know you may love it.

												Since my gametime (off Steam hitting around 10k) is ridiculously high i figured i'd give an in-depth review of the game both on a leveling and end game basis for both new players and potential returning players as well. This review will be done on a positive/indifferent/negative basis.Positives: + Class variation and static roles: . You play as a Minstrel, you'll be healing. You play as a Guardian, you'll be tanking etc. Some classes such as Beornings and RKs can do multiple jobs, but the game follows the old school MMO system (as expected given its age). Over 9 classes to choose from all with unique roles both end game and unique abilities and playstyles while leveing and questing.+ Graphics:     The game graphically has aged like fine wine and is still appealing to the eye, especially in the more recently released zones. The revamped zones in low level areas and the new regions in Gondor are more up to date and places such as North Ithilien are breahtaking. The artstyle that LOTRO offers fits the game perfectly. + The Main Story:   The overarching plot is fantastic at least in Volume 1 + 4, with Volume 2 being good and Volume 3 being 'okay'.  There are currently 4 volumes (the latter still underway). + Music/OST:     This has always been top notch and they've done a great job, especially in places such as Moria, Angmar, Rohan & Gondor to truly capture Tolkiens works in the flesh through the music that is played while venturing around.+ The Lore:    This is without doubt the closest to the literature source you can find in game or video form. Fantastic job in sticking and expanding upon Tolkiens works. + F2P:   I could go on about this for hours but looking at it from the perspective of a new player, and the ability to buy the content with in-game currency and not pay a single penny (Unless you want to PvP) is pretty astounding. Naturally it's grindy as hell but it's free, so you can't really complain. + Raiding:  At the time of this review there is plenty of end game content to keep you busy, some more difficult than others that require a kinship (Guild), voice communication as well as understanding the instance and your class respectively. + Landscapes/Open World: This speaks for itself. LOTRO is huge, and the atmosphere and immersion in some locations is phenomonal. Places such as Moria, Lothlorien, Minas Tirith, Mirkwood etc really stand out as the pinnacle of world building in this game.Indifferent Points:=Optimization: Game crashes are a thing as is lag, especially in highly populated zones. Can be game/immersion breaking.= PvMP:   PvMP (Player vs Monster Player) has so many positives but also a few negatives (as well as lack of any development pretty much since its release from the Developers in 10 years except for attempted balances between classes). The skill level for PvP is insane and that makes it both fun and enjoyable. If you enjoy a challenge PvP is definetly the hardest part of the game to play well. There are plenty of great and friendly players in PvP on both sides, but also a very negative and childish community that ruins it which can potentially  make you lose interest if you don't learn to ignore the chat. That's PvP for you. There are, as in many MMOs 'flavour of the month classes' that are OP with updates, the only issue is that given how small Standing Stones team are and the lack of monthly updates (Updates are released less frequently than in bigger MMOs such as ESO, FFXIV, WoW etc) it's an on going dilemma. = Developer Interaction:   This isn't really a positive or negative but in comparison to how the game used to be (under Codemasters in Europe) when developers and GameMasters used to interact with the community very frequently, the lack of actual interaction between players and the Dev Team (outside of the Community Manager through Twitch & Forums) leaves room for improvement and more engagement. Despite this in recent months this has improved slightly, so hopefully we'll see more involvement from the team with in-game events in the future.= Roleplaying:     I'm not someone who roleplays in LOTRO so i can't offer much feedback on this. The community is, for the most part really friendly and welcoming and there are servers specifically for Roleplaying, so it must be good!.=Crafting:     Crafting is something, in most MMOs (with the exception of ESO) that i've never really enjoyed. I don't mind crafting in LOTRO when i need too but i don't take any particular pleasure in doing it.. If you enjoy crafting in other MMOs you'l likely enjoy it in this game as it has many viable purposes (from leveling gear, to consumables to end game relics). It's also part of questing as many of the crafing items you need can be found while playing and leveling through the game in each area. I'd stick this as a positive except it honestly isn't anything overly special that stands out. It's just 'there'.Negatives: - End Game Grind:     While people seem to enjoy leveling alts (and while you can skip it with Valar upgrades to boost your character, bearing in mind you'll have to go back and do your deeds and learn your class anyway so it's pointless) you will pretty much have to go through the exact same content again from 1-105. While you can level in certain different areas for some levels you will have to venture through Moria, Rohan, Gondor on multiple toons. The issue isn't so much leveling (which is fun) but the grind you need to achieve a playable character for end game content. I could write an entire paragraph detailing how bad grinding to be 'raid ready' is (in an effort by Devs to keep people in game between major updates i assume) if people want an overview, but in a nutshell you have to; Obtain 83 Class Points, Get around 10+ Virtue Traits to level 20 Each. You'll have to level, upgrade, reequip and grind items for your legendary weapons. You'll have to grind essences and then craft them by obtaining crafting items from many different sources through grinding them to get the required essences you want, and even then you aren't guaranteed the best essences. ^ If Standing Stones made this less grindy (especially the essence and legendary item grind) for ALT characters, it would make the end game grind more approachable for people to do it more than once without making it feel like a chore. - Class Development:   In a nutshell; Beornings were released and are a broken mess and have been with only one patch since they were released. An introduction to a new race/class and little changes shows a lack of care, at least in my eyes for the finished product or player feedback. I haven't seen a new skill (or ability) on my main class in years. What happened?! Further more there are now MANY useless skills on multiple classes that haven't been made viable or addressed in years. This also goes for legendary legacies on legendary weapons. An example on Loremaster (My Main) is; Gust of Wind on Loremaster. Completely pointless. Ents go to War is no longer as viable as it used to be and Natures Fury is pretty much pointless as well in class rotations except for its pretty animations. - Side Quests/Missions:     This is more nitpicking but the sidequests in LOTRO (There are exceptions) are.....typical MMO fetch or kill quests. While some of the side quests have interesting stories and background with the lore, nothing has ever really stood out when questing in LOTRO outside of the Main Quest and stories. The actual stories that go along with the quests have improved considerablly since release, so perhaps i'm being abit harsh here. Despite this if you've played through Minas Tirth and done the questchain there, you'll know where i'm coming from when i say it's far from enjoyable at times. It has its ups and downs..- Mounted Combat:   Speaks for itself. It wasn't asked for and hasn't been used since Rohan effectively or at all outside of a couple of scenarios. End: Recommended :)! Thanks for reading			"

So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game? Then LotRO is definitely your bet.2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for). 7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game. You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)Total score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.

												As a huge huge Tolkien fan, I must say this game is extremely appealing. First off I want to explain what's fantastic about MMO's and that people have forgotten they're for: They're not just for rushing to endgame, they're not just for PvP. They're for fully enjoying a well-fleshed world and essentially living a second life in said game, and having a variety of experiences. Something alot of MMO players have forgotten in their impatient rush to end-game and gear. The best MMO's make a rich, versatile, alive world for you to explore and experience.Let me explain and tell you a very recent scenario that actually happened:In preparation for the 3rd Hobbit installment, my girlfriend and I travelled to the Shire to enjoy the sights and sounds. We ventured up to Bilbo's house, and explored it a bit. We saw a humorous painting of Smaug, and a few other notable things. Another traveller walks in as we were staring at the painting, he bows to both of us and tells us he is from Dale, and came to thank Bilbo for his assistance so long ago. He informs me they've rebuilt well, and he will travel back soon after attending to some business. We tell him we were simply exploring, adventurers who wanted to visit the unlikely Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. He invites us for a round of ale. We walk down to the Green Dragon, discussing the dire business going on South. He buys us a couple pints and we have a smoke and talk more (more real life things at this time.) He adds us as friends, gives some gold (at the time we weren't very rich, so it was very helpful), invites us to go fishing (of which we had to decline for we had other matters to attend) and is away on his own journey.There was no combat, no hobbies, no crafting, no end-game, no raids, just good ol player community and interaction. Add in heroic combat, interesting and fun crafting and hobbies, raids, and you have a fantastic MMO. That is essentially what you're getting with this. A tight-knit VERY friendly and awesome community. LotRO does a fantastic job of letting you experience Tolkiens world in a wonderful setting. The music, the graphics/areas, the overall feeling is very immersive. Countless times I have stopped and enjoyed the wonderfully presented and created zones. Yes the graphics are a bit dated, but it is a somewhat older MMO. The graphics are still decent and even in some spots beautiful enough to not be unenjoyable.Yes, the F2P pricing model is very bad. But does that remove it's pros? No. Most MMO's have subs,  can you *really* mark off this game so much for it's new pricing model? Just sub, and buy expansions for the most enjoyment and unhindered experience.  You can't really expect them to not want money, they need it, and you need support.The combat is normal and decent. The story is great for fans of Middle-Earth.  The music system is truly innovative and new, even to this day. Overall, I highly recommend this game, ESPECIALLY if you're a huge fan of Middle-Earth. Enjoy the experience, live in the rich setting.. Stop rushing. Enjoy it.			"

												It has a slightly different view on the genre than WoW, more story-orientated, and slow paced, but still a very fun game. I can only recommend it to LotR fans, because it features faithful renditions of the original locations, characters and monsters of the books/movies. The skills, talents ('traits') and upgradable legendary weapons give more depth to the already satisfying combat.			"

												A well-balanced mmorpg based on the works of Tolkien. You'll recognise many places and people from the novels (or movies).Until recently I played, very happily, as F2P. There are several regions which have their quests unlocked and other quest packs and services can be unlocked using Turbine Points which can be easily gained ingame by completing deeds.A lot of people pay for 1 months VIP subscription for the permanent unlocks it gives, but I love the game so much I decided to go VIP to put some money back into a game that satisfies all my mmo needs. Awesome cosmetic/wardrobe options, great crafting system, beautiful places to explore and I love achievements & titles!  I haven't covered the raiding/endgame or PVM (player vs monster) as I haven't been involved with those. But the PVM, where you can create a monster race player & fight other players in the Ettenmoors sounds like a lot of fun.			"

												Where do I start with this game? Once upon a time, it was a thriving title with a fantastic future. Somewhere along the line, the Riders of Rohan pulled away, Gondor's Men retreated back to Minas Tirith, The Hobbits holed up in the Green Dragon and the Elves left for the West. To put it honestly, the change to free to play is what started the death toll for Lord of the Rings Online. Instead of being able to be a part of Middle-earth, you are met with ""BUY THINGS FROM OUR STORE"" every chance Turbine can get. This is not a ""free to play"" title. Quest packs are required in order to progress and with the new expansion you are also required to pay for the epic quest line - something Turbine once promised would never be part of the pay to play experience. It's a shadow of what it once was. The engine is in desperate need of upgrading and the feeling of being a part of Tolkien's Middle-earth is gone. Even the cosmetic, housing and music system feels old and outdated. Give LotRO a skip and hang your head for a moment of silence for the game it was.			"

												This review is for the Steam Awards Nomination. I am nominating this game for the Test of Time Award. In April, LOTRO will be celebrating 10 years and players will be preparing to journey to Mordor alongside The Fellowship to destroy The One Ring. While such a declaration may make give the impression that things are drawing to a close, that is hardly the case. The fan base for LOTRO remains one of the most dedicated in terms of an MMORPG's popularity, right up there with World of Warcraft. LOTRO has been featured in Atlas Obscura, a college course in Tennessee has featured and been inspired by it, and new players are joining the game everyday. With the tenth anniversary coming up, this is the absolute best time to either start playing LOTRO or return to it. In no other game can you so througly immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth. No matter what games I play in my Steam library or consoles, I still login everyday to chat and play with my kinmates and lose myself in this beautiful world for an hour or two or five. These reasons and many more are why Lord of The Rings Online deserves the Steam Award for The Test of Time.			"

												DISCLAIMER: Due to the evolving nature of MMO's, the described content may have changed by the time you, the reader, see this.LotRO... well.To start of, I've spent more time on this game than I ever thought I would spend on a single game, be it MMO or not.(I started playing LotRO through the confines of Steam only recently, the game hours I speak of can be found on my Raptr Profile[raptr.com] under ""Most Played"")What is LotRO? It's a ""Hotkey-MMO"" similar to Everquest 2, RIFT and World of Warcraft. Focusing more on a player storyline that goes through-out your leveling experience. Don't be fooled by that last bit. It's not a 100% in-a-line story RPG experience in a Massively Multiplayer world, there will be level gaps where you'll take time off from the story and do the good ol' MMO questing. That's the short description I can think of.Aside the basic questing and the Story-line, known as the ""Epic"", we also have instances (some scalable with your level with a minimum level and some with a set level), skirmishes(scalable to your level starting from the level you unlock them at), raids(same as instances) and PvMP(Starts around lvl 10ish. Scales to cap.) among some here-and-there lore, references and the like.The F2P model. Well this is something that rubs a lot of people the wrong way. To be frank, no one likes that a game, advertised as free, has the cash-shop surprise. However one should keep in mind that there's a difference between Free to Play and Freeware games.Is it bad?It's better than most, but then again, all F2P games should be taken with caution.What exactly is available to you from the start?The flat out free content includes the majority of the classes (with the exception of Rune Keeper, Warden and Beorning), all the starting zones (The Shire, Ered Luin and Bree Land) and 1 post-start zone, Lone Lands, which ends around level 32.Account limitations:No level limitations. (Aside the level cap, of course)3 bags out of 6. (Static 15 slot bags)All crafting tiers are available, but you only have access to the first 2 reputation tiers in a crafting guild. (Or something like that.)Gold (100c = 1s, 1000s=1g) is capped at 2.You have 2 character slots on each server.Each character has 2 free virtue and race trait slots out of 7 and access to the Class Specialization tree, but not the specialization bonuses (an extra bonus per 5 points in the chosen ""main"" specialization tree).Main Story/Epic is unlocked/free up untill the start of Helms Deep (Roughly around lvl 90).Is this really it for a Free player? Just this?Well, yes and no. You are able to gather the cash-shop currency through gameplay. There are deeds, which are the equivalent to achievements. Majority of the deeds reward the player with the cash-shop currency known as TP (Turbine Points) allowing players to unlock further content for just playing the game. In my time on LotRO I have ran into more than a few players who have been unlocking their way through the game via just that. At times it does feel like a grind, but it is a viable way for a Free player to expand their experience.Where's the, you know, PvMP talk/stuff/review/whatnot?I have no interest in PvP.Is Lord of The Rings Online Pay to Win?Well, LotRO focuses mainly (but not only) on PvE and the Epic questline. In that regard, I have not seen a single thing on the VIP features list, nor the cash-shop that would indicate that this is a P2Win game. It really isn't. Yes, it has PvMP (Player versus Monster Player) meaning PvP is in the game which in its essence is endgame Raid PvP and not your standard Arena PvP. Even there I don't see it being P2Win in any way. This is my point of view on this, opinions may vary.What is my stance on the F2P model?It feels like an extended trial, infact it has enough content to be considered as something more than just a trial. I haven't seen a lot of games with a F2P model as fair as LotRO has. Which is partly why I've stuck with the game.My experience so far:Why such a long time?I started playing a few weeks after LotRO went F2P.What have I achieved in the game with that time?To be entirely honest. Not as much as one would expect. I've never been a fast leveler. I like to explore a lot and alt-oholism takes its toll. Which is why I generally prefer to work on deeds for TP, instead of throwing money at Turbine. My highest level character is capped at 100 (provided there hasn't been a sneaky cap increase I'm unaware of), I have a total of 10 character slots and various convenience upgrades, most of which I've unlocked via Deeds rather than real money.So, am I a VIP or?Premium. The status between VIP and Free. The player who has spent some money on the game, but isn't sitting on a subscription.Do I love it?Yes, a lot. I'm a LotR fan and so far I have not been disappointed in this presentation of Middle-Earth.Is it possible that this form of gameplay will tire me and result in me leaving the game?It's possible. I am quite surprised I've been with it for so long. However I do believe that this is highly unlikely and if I recall correctly the Epic questlines goal is to reach Mordor which is something I would love to personally witness.Final verdict if such a thing is possible with an ever growing MMO (it really isn't in my honest opinion):It's F2P, try it. If you don't like it then at least you have experienced something different and are that much wiser.EDIT(s): Grammar and section arrangements for a more sensible format.EDIT(s)2:Updated information. Increased the amount of sense made and such.			"

TL;DR is at the bottom of the review for all of you who didn't want to read the whole thing!It's been 350 hours as of this writing and my main character has hit the level cap of 100, quested through almost all levelling zones, participated in raids, instances, big battles, is a guilded tailor, and has been a long-standing member of a kinship (known as a guild in other MMOs), in addition to a whole host of other things. So, needless to say, I think I'm finally qualified to write a proper review of this game.Even though this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews listed for The Lord of the Rings Online (or LOTRO, from here on out), I still felt like it was important to write a review for this game because I feel as though it is a vastly underrated MMORPG. There is so much to love about this amazing game but people often dismiss it in their early minutes of playing because of its appearance or other factors, and I think that this game deserves so much more than that.I want to try to keep this review short (which will be difficult because LOTRO is an enormous game, so there is a LOT to cover if I really wanted to touch on everything), but do keep in mind that from hundreds of hours of playing I have a lot to say and am strongly opinionated on some things, so I won't shy away from going in-depth when I need to.PROS:(+) - GAME WORLD: This point, right here, is what really makes this game so magnificent for me. I've got to hand it to the devs at Turbine, because you can tell right away from your first moments in Middle Earth that there was some SERIOUS time and effort put into studying and implementing Tolkien's visions from the famous Lord of the Rings series into a vibrant game world. The scale of the game itself is incorrect (if it were correct then the game would be terrible, because crossing the map would take forever), but what IS mostly correct is the geography and topography of Middle Earth in video game form. From the icy peaks of Wildermore to the lush and colorful forests of Lothlorien; every zone is intricately crafted to match the descriptions found in Tolkien's masterworks, not only so that the areas are accurate, but also so that they are absolutely beautiful and lively to play in.(+) - SIZE AND SCOPE: I mentioned earlier that LOTRO's scale is largely inaccurate, but Middle Earth is still ENORMOUS. Seriously, it's hard to understate this. I've played open-world games like Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and LOTRO puts their game world sizes to shame. This, in turn, makes the game so much more immersive and memorable because there are just so many areas in the game, each with their own unique aspects and characteristics.(+) - ART STYLE: The devs at Turbine decided to adapt a more realistic graphical and artistic style, and in my opinion it really paid off. I will touch more on graphics in the ""cons"", but one thing that newer players to the game have to realize when playing LOTRO is that much of Middle Earth's charm isn't found in the textures and pretty effects, but rather in the creative and artistic direction that it aims to portray. LOTRO is such a beautiful game, and you can really tell throughout all of its scenery. It's difficult to talk about art direction for very long because everyone has their different interpretations on artistic superiority in video games, but in my eyes, LOTRO's art style should really be appreciated because it makes the game world stand out from many of today's newer MMORPGs.(+) - SOUNDTRACK: Another feature that makes LOTRO such an immersive game is its epic soundtrack. There's a wide variety of songs here (like, hundreds of themes), and each compliments their respective regions fittingly. Although I can't describe in detail what the music is like because I feel as though players will get a better handle of it by playing the game themselves, but I feel like the music is not only strong and melodic but also very atmospheric, which develops an even higher quality gaming experience throughout LOTRO's Middle Earth.(+) - COMMUNITY: LOTRO has, by far, the best online community I have ever experienced in ANY multiplayer video game. As a League of Legends player who constantly encounters toxic, rude, and straight up disrespectful players, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that LOTRO has a welcoming and kind community of many different members. I'm currently in a closely knit kinship with many different members that always speak to each other and take pleasure and helping each other out with the game. The thing is, it's not just my kinship! Among the ten servers, there are many awesome kins that are not only helpful but also very friendly, which just serves as a testament to why LOTRO is such a joy to play with others.CONS:(-) - PAYMENT MODEL: LOTRO's payment model remains to be my single biggest problem with the game and it's structure. I don't want to go too far in-depth because the model present here can be very confusing, but essentially, LOTRO is free up until you hit about level 30. After that point, you have two choices: you can either cough up some money (in some cases it can be quite a lot, I paid about $80 to unlock all of the game's questing and expansion packs), OR you can grind yourself into misery and depression as you do a bunch of boring tasks called ""deeds"" which range from ""Kill 360 of these monsters which you can only find in one concentrated area!"" to ""Run throughout an area and try to find specific locations!"" The problem is, even these tasks aren't unlimited, so you can only do so many until you run out and you can't earn any more premium currency. Don't be confused, this doesn't mean that LOTRO is ""pay to win,"" as there are no gamebreaking items or anything that you can buy with premium currency, it just means that instead of being ""free to play,"" as LOTRO advertises itself as, it's really more of a ""buy to play"" game.(-) - GRAPHICS: I hate to say it, but LOTRO just isn't a graphically pleasing game anymore. The game has been around since 2007, which makes it 8 years old and it really shows. Textures are muddy, distant objects are pixelated and the character models... don't even get me started. The character models are mostly just flat-out ugly and when most people get into the game, the deciding factor of whether they like it or not is going to be usually determined by the graphics, which is a shame, because I believe that LOTRO should be looked at not for its graphics, but rather for it's content. However, it's inevitable and I understand how people feel about it.(-) - COMBAT: Not much to say here. Some skill animations are cool, but the combat of LOTRO consists of very simple key combos and doesn't really provide much difficulty. When it takes you as long as I did to get to max level, this combat can get to be EXTREMELY monotonous and boring.TL;DR: If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings and of MMORPG games, maybe even if you're not a die-hard fan like I am, there are still plenty of things to enjoy about LOTRO. It's gorgeous, it's lengthy, it has an extremely friendly community, and it's great for anyone who has ever wanted to explore what may be the best iteration of Middle Earth to ever be portrayed in a video game. However, if you're not crazy about The Lord of the Rings, there probably isn't much for you here. The graphics are very dated, the combat is often monotonous, and the payment model is arbitrarily confusing. There are plenty of other MMOs on the market too, and I can even recommend some! Go play RIFT, or TERA, those are modern day MMOs that do things right. Overall, if I could say one thing about the game that applies to all kinds of players, it's that you should at least try it out. It is free to start, and if you like it as much as I did, then you can buy the rest of the game and still have a great experience.			"

												The Helm's Deep expansion is disappointingly sophomoric for a game of LOTRO's artistic pedigree. While the epic quest/storyline continues to be interesting, the rest of the questing is saddled with tedious chores as players help various towns prepare for evacuation, or to resist the advance of the orcish hordes (while that OTHER fellowship goes off to do the exciting stuff); boars, barrels, and inane activities abound. LOTRO's questing content as literary work also seems to have been an age long past and beyond return. The text is mostly banal, contemporary, and ineloquent.Classes have been revamped, complete with unnecessary, WoW-like spec trees that restrict choices rather than give more. Players interested in overpowered classes will be glad; those hoping for an engaging overhaul will find combat over too unobligingly soon. Item levels have also been introduced/exposed; itemization inflation is set to soar, at a time when the MMO that popularized loot porn is contemplating an item squish to reign in the absurd circumstances they find themselves in. It's as if Turbine hired ex-Blizzard developers. It's difficult to recommend this expansion at the current offered price (US $40). If you can afford it, and are invested in the long range to seeing Gondor, Mordor, and the ending of the Dark Lord, then you're probably willing to endure the bad for the good, in which case, forth into ruin and a red dawn, and all that. Despite this expansion's insipidness, LOTRO remains one of the few verisimilar fantasy MMOs available, and the opportunity to experience it with new content is plenty and good enough reason to get Helm's Deep.

												Updated: 15, January, 2015 Does not reflect any additions or changes made in Update 14. Review:The Lord of the Rings Online as an MMORPG is one of the more polished one and has kept up with the times visually. The gameplay is very similar to you if you have played MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Everquest and does not offer anything on this front you could not find from another game. Where LotRO shines is the lore, story and world design.The Lore stays true to that of Tolkien's works for the most part and, usually, what deviations exist usually are still in the spirit of the professor's works. The story follows the Lord of the Rings book trilogy's story mostly, with lot's of additional content that portrays events during the War of the Ring which are not delved into in detail in the books. The world design and art direction is great, what the game lacks in pure fidelity it well makes up for in design. Lord of the Rings Online offers an unrivaled experience when it comes to exploring and immersing yourself in Middle-Earth, from the burrows of the Shire to the plains of Rohan. The game will hit home with Tolkien fans who enjoy exploration, roleplaying and solo/small group oriented adventuring.Pros-Great Story, that follows the books faithfully and explores additional lore friendly events.-Good solo experience, the games focus has during the years switched to cater to solo players.-For fans of the Middle-Earth Legendarium-Very friendly to Roleplayers.-Gorgeous world.Cons-The game feels somewhat dated by now.-Lack of raids and traditional instances in later expansions. ( which might be alleviated if you are interested in alternative instance types, like the Skirmishes and Big Battles.) -Weak PvP-content. The PvP has been relatively stagnant and there doesn't seem to be much improvement on the horizon			"

												First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent.			"

												I've played this game since 2007 autumn (way before it was added to steam) I know that i clocked over 6-8k hours of it on xfire when i played it as most, that does not include the time i was also off-xfire and my steam hours.But to be fair i probably got over 10k hours in this game. I've seen it from it's early release to it's current days.Since i live in the EU i started playing this game when the EU part of it was run by Codemasters.My first memories of the game are probably some of the strongest memories i got from any game out there, it had a enourmous depth in the game world, i remember running around in Ered Luin and questing (this was before they added quest trackers, so you actually had to READ the quests to get directions of where to go - this was a key thing for a immersive exploration that this game world deserverd.)As you crossed borders in the game the music tune changed to something bit more dramatic or peaceful, i ran around for hours just exploring casually, stumbling across named mobs that dropped ""rare"" crafting materials. At some quest you had to group up to complete them, it took some waiting time but it was a lot of fun doing so - some even remained grouped and decided to quest together after these instance quests. An easy way to develop friends in the game at a early stage.Once the first area was done you were to set off to Bree, the current main city of the humans back then (while Rivendell was for elves, Thorin's Hall for dwarves, The Shire for Hobbits) My first time i did this i had no clue about fast travelling, this was my first MMO after all. So i ran through the entire Shire and Western Bree-Fields, this is nearly the size of two maps and it did take some time doing so, but it was amazing!I later tried out all classes and i got very attatced to being Captain, i raided and did high lvl instances with it. Carn Dûm being one of the best instances ever in my experience, it was massive and it took a decent amount of time to do it not to mention the loot you could get from it and the challenge it gave. (this was before GlobalLFF was born and way before world chat was born, so you had to use map chats to recruit people + no instance finder was there)The raids was Rift and Helegrod, both were amazing, Rift being 12 man while Helegrod was 24. There was also open raid bosses out in the world that could drop thropies, a fun addon.So, why dont i recommend this game after the experiences i've had with it?Well it all started with Mines of Moria, Turbine added something called ""hope gear"" (later renamed to radiance) this was something crucial for Moria raiding, without it you would die nearly instantly since your morale would be -80% at worst or so. This could be considered ""tiered gear progression"", you need to achieve tier one to be able to raid in tier two (tier one being instances). But the major fault here was the ""Legendary Weapons"". This eliminated all other weapons in the game more or less, crafted weapons became completely useless, normal weapon drops? Useless that too. Classes that could dual wield had a purpose to get a normal weapon, but your main focus were placed on Legendary Weapons.At a start, legendary weapons was a massive grind, massive RNG. You wanted it to be perfect, so you had to be lucky when you ""identified"" them to see your legecies on them (legecies being stat boosts like boosting certain damage on skills, crit damage, cooldown rate etc etc) and the maximum legacies was 4 when you identified them + 3 reforges after you would be on 7 legacies, then you had to be lucky that you would be given the right legacies. (back then there was no store to buy legacies off, if i remember correctly you could not farm other legendary weapons either and deconstruct them for their legacies to put on your main weapon, the legacies you were given were then ones you had to live with, if you did not like it then you had to start over on another weapon).This entire system was extremely time consuming, and it became very crucial at certain points in raiding.Turbine later decided to trash the radiance system in later Mirkwood i think or early Enedwaith. This was a GOOD move.But the legendary system remained as a plague and even exists today, every update, 5 levels extra, our legendary weapon was uselss and you had to upgrade - endless gear treadmill at a maximum level.But then it came, the major issue. And there are only three words for it.Free to Play.At this point, many of us lifetime players were very uncertain at this, microtransactions was a thing too since the store got added at the same point. This was added with Enedwaith or Ost Dunholt raid.So what happend after this is how i could call it ""the huge war between the casual players and the raiders"" - raiding gear started to became non unique since everyone could get them easily, turbine eliminated the true challenge for raids and gorup content. Suddently you could not see the difference between a decent raider and a shire potato farmer.They added skirmishes with Mirkwood, this became a massive disappointment, now it's a forgotten content, entirely. In the end, the casuals won this war. We raiders got more or less not wanted anymore, our voices was not heard. And of course, if your major playerbase are casuals then you develop more things for them, add more pay to win items in the store to please them, you could be working 20-40 hours on your first age legendary weapon, grind those legacies, max it out, make it perfect. While the guy next to you could spend 40 euros and max it out from store within 10 minutes by buying the legacies he wanted and relics even. Turbine started to revamp the old areas we had in Shadow of Angmar. Making it more easy for new players, ruining the immersive feeling in those areas and instances, eliminated exploration entierly and made questing linear, it became like following an invisible red line through the maps, more dead then alive.They butchered the first instance, by splitting it up in three wings, it became faster to complete, but the feeling died with it too. They butchered one of the most glorious mid lvl instanced called Fornost, and that was my final straw. I personally dont find it funny to have one major boss in each instance due to they simplifying them. The old dungeons had many minor bosses you could run into (sure you could get lost many times but you will learn local direction as time goes by, now a hamster could do it)They ruined pvp by adding ""Audacity"" a specific pvp stat, that killed many builds since we were forced to wear pvp gear (that was mediocre compared to our raiding gears). Turbine have never been able to balance pvp beteen the Free Peoples and the Servants of Angmar. (freeps and creeps)Most balanced was during Shadow of Angmar, and even then it was not entierly perfect either. We was promised a new PvMP map in 2008 i think, we got it 2015 - and i don't think they worked on this for 7 years, if you have seen it with your own eyes you can see for yourself that 7 years work was not dedicated for this.LoTRO's reputation has sunk entierly, most of us that loved this game is waiting for it's killing blow, the announcement of  the servers being closed so it will die with some dignity and honor, but thats too late now since everything is gone.Many new players, those who began after f2p might still love this game - they never got to experience it's true glory.Now LoTRO is just a p2w exploited game. The developers have run out of ideas and just sprinting to reach mordor then end it. They copy paste old structures in new content (minas tirith got the wall textures that are around isengard, the white city, with a black obsidan wall protecting it - call it what you like, but thats not acceptable.I highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's not worth your time, trust me.

												One mmoRPG to rule them all,one mmoRPG to find them,one mmoRPG to bring them all,and in front of their pc bind them!...A must for the fans of Tolkiens work, everyone else will find a technical (well) aged MMORPG with a beautiful (and overall realistic) artstyle and superb storytelling. The microtransactions hurts the atmosphere a bit, but you can get alot for free and choose what you pay for, overall I think it is one of the best f2p mmorpg systems on the market. The game offers alot of possibilities for true RPG players, and the community is mostly mature and helpful. And there is no PvP, only PvMP on instanced battlefields (Player vs Monsterplayer = one side controls creatures of evil), whatever that means to you (to me that means no ganking or griefing, alot less flame, and overall a nicer atmosphere and less to be worried about ;))			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online, a wonderful open-world game. Freedom and quests are great but when you first start you can't just roam free... Well, you have to do the 'Prologue/Intro' where you do many quests for either the hobbits, dwarfs, elfs, men or beorning but once you have done that, you are free to roam. I found the 'Prologue/Quests' not too irritating but it does take longer to level up the higher your level gets. The races you can chose from are:~Human~Dwarf~Hobbit~Elf~BeorningSome classes include:~Champion~Hunter~Captain~Guardian~Minstrel~Warden~Lore-Master~eceteraGreat game! 11/10			"

 Heads up, my review was too long for the review box so I will post the remainder in follow up comments Comments include Pay Model and Summary Well, I feel its time to give this game a fair summary. Lord of the Rings Online is true to the T to Tolkiens Trilogy: The Lord of the Rings. Bare in minds this means a lot of differences if you expect there to be assimilations to the movies. That being said the books h definately delved deeper into the lore and ideas that Tolkien wanted to explore when creating the world of Arda.A little backstory:Lord of the Rings Online is now a little over 9 years old as of the creation of this review and is sadly speculated to be taken down in the coming  years due to lack of funding and rights to the ownership through warner brothers. Many many players have come in and out of this game over the years to experience myriad updates and journeys. I myself started my journey into LotRO 3 years prior to now. And I found what the definition of an MMO truely is.I have witnessed but a third of LotRO's life span but in that time have finished the story up to update 18 with my hunter reached the half way mark in leveling with a Rune-Keeper and had fun exploring and challenging other classes along with friends to the rough mark of level 20. With this I can tell you LotRO is a wonderful game.Why?LotRO provides and caters to all types of players. Hardcore MMO players can bash out levels swiftly find tough solo and multiplayer challenges at end game and the casual gamer who is in here for the experience can still sink many hours enjoying the combat and content the game has to offer.What are some of the things you can do in LotRO?Craft: Choose a proffession with 3 crafting skills within allowing you to create gear for yourself and harvest materials for friend that have different skills you can cater for. Hunt for materials, gather and make. Its simple and rewarding.RolePlay:LotRO allows players the freedom of doing what an MMO was designed for and it hits the mark harder than any other game, as a hunter I can make a campfire just out the town of Bree, smoke some pipe-weed, much on Lembas bread and listen to my kin play their music. By this I mean you can litterally do player made music and it is wonderful. People will spare time to listen to and you feel like a star when it happens.Fight:When you start the game you have the option for quite a few classes such as Guardian, Minstrel & Lore-Master. Each inspired by characters from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. They each give you a unique play style and can be customised down trait trees to a specific deriverative of the class. Build yourself to play alone or to fight aloneside friends almost all classes can be brought to many different styles of combat and it does not get dull. The combat will set you up with a few working combo's but nothing really true, it leaves it up to you to fight the way you want and build abilities how you like. The combat itself feels smooth and satisfying, sound effects are on point and really feel good. Animations may be a bit dated but they still work well and feel fairly suited. You cans tart fighting weak enemies in your starting region. Move on to groups of mobs and eventually come to fight some that learn to buff themselves or gather squads to group up and take you down. The enemies change themselves up as you play through the game and it feels good learn to take your new opponents down. Or to crush them beneathe your heel when you have out leveled them.UI:The HUD and UI of LotRO has to be hands down the most customisable interace I have used in gaming... ever. absolutely everything can be moved and scaled EVERYTHING and it isn't difficult to do either.Audio:The audio is astounding rarely do you get a game that really slots the soundtrack perfectly into place but by the Gods if anything will be remembered about this game for year to come it will be the music. No you will not here the iconic shire theme or theme of the fellowship but they are replaced with equally memorable unique and above all amazing soundtracks. If you don't believe me wait until you enter Bree and tell me you can forget that wonderful rythm.Atmosphere:Now LotRO isn't exactly new and some fault it immediately for lack of texture quality or too little amount of polygons simply to forget the appeal of video game graphics when they are OPEN WORLD. This might be hard to get by at first but you can quickly come to appriciate how wonderful Middle-Earth actually looks. The design is for the big picture, zoom out your camera run into the distance the world is created picture perfect plains are open, hills steep ruins are run down and towns are bustling its all how it is meant to be in an RPG and mostly it feels like THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Gameplay:LotRO gives you a few things to do in the gameplay area. Quests the main scenario will take you through your own story as the saviour of Western Middle-Earth; Eriador and your fight against the shadows of Angmar. Later scenarios take you on the story to follow the Fellowship and fight for your life along side Rohan and Gondor. Side quests offer real rewards that are worth your time. Neatly set up so nearby quest objectives are as they should be, close to each other for convinience and a lot of enjoyment when handing them in by bulk. There is other stuff available to you as well such as deeds and skirmishes. Thse are the staples that make LotRO LotRO. Now most MMOs have their conventional dungeons but Lord of the Rings Online changed things up a bit with small enemies engagements similar to that of a dungeon. You may sometimes be running into a camp blind to wipe it of enemies take position fight counter attacks and be rewarded with loot but you might sometimes be defending and have some groups of goblins or tough Lietenants of the enemy pushing your ground for control. These are great fun to do with your friends on and can be done at all levels and for good rewards at that. Deeds are the second staple. Deeds allow you to go out into the world fulfill your duty as a hero and explore. Some are tough but they can be worth your time if you put that time into them. Deeds ask you to do a set number of tasks in each region of the world such as kill so many enemies, find certain objects, explore different places and help people out (quests). Each deed rewards you with Turbine points [which I will get to in the next section] & hard deeds will give you virtues which can be put towards buffing your character. Some give you marks a currency for trading to buy new gear and crafting recipes. Some give you loot-boxes you can open for free stuff. It ends up being worth it and seeing you have completed deeds in your log for an area is one of the most satisfying things in gaming I have experienced yet.			"

												Ive got a love/hate relationship with this game. Love:- Its lord of the rings, with all the epic story, characters, locations and events from the books (or films)- Huge world that has vastly different locations to play in.- In depth game systems and mechanics that dont treat you like a brainless idiot gamer, actually requiring you to learn the game and how to master it.- Its free (well, sorta.)- Due to its dated graphic engine, I can run this game completely on ultra high maxed out settings, and still get super high performance (and most things look pretty nice, especially the world graphics)- Its got dwarves, my favorite race.- Its got years of content to keep you busy.Hate:- Dated graphics engine. While i can max out the settings, and some things look nice, other things, like character graphics, are just UH GLEE. Dwarf beards look awful. Most hairstyles look awful. Many textures in the game are super low res/blurry, even using the high res texture pack. The game can also suffer from bad ""pop up/pop in"" in areas, especially with trees. (would love it if turbine would update some of these things)- Unintuitive mechanics. Especially when it comes to quests. So many quests (especially early on), not only dont really tell you what they want you to do exactly, but really dont even point you in the right direction. The UI sometimes helps by saying ""go in this direction"" but not always. And when you get in the general area you are supposed to be in, you are still left trying to figure out exactly what it is you are supposed to do. Ive played The Secret World, and THAT game required a LOT of investigation and brainstorming to solve quests. This games quests, have simple objects that are simply cumbersum to complete due to bad design. This isnt an issue of ""hand holding"" or making the game easy. Its probablly one of the things that drives a lot of new players away. Factor in the horribly worthless and unhelpful game map, and new gamers are going to feel like getting even a simple delivery quest done to be a major frustrating chore.- This game really clings to the ""You have to wait to you are higher level to do the fun stuff"" mentality.  Its seems like all the improved gameplay, better design content, group play aspects, and cool events are designed for players level 45 and up. They also require the paid DLC like Moria and Helms Deep. (which is fine if you like the game. One time fees arent an issue). This ""low levels are boring and slow and you just have to endure through them"" mentality however, is yet another thing that will drive away players. (which is probably one of the reasons why the game is suffering from server population issues.- Super boring and grindy quests (especially at low levels). Short of the epic storyline (which makes up about 5% of the low level content), most of the quests in this game fall into 2 categories. Fedex quests (especially if you are a hobbit), and kill quests. No attempt is made to really stray from these either. If you HATE fedex (deliver this item to steve for me!) quests, I seriously recommend NOT starting out in the Shire.- Lack of low level group content. Pretty much everything low level can be easily solo'd. Even most of the elites you have to fight. The games first dungeon isnt until 20+, and due to the lack of low level players, good luck finding a group for that. In fact, the group finding tool is 99% worthless to low level players. If you are wanting to play this game for the multiplayer aspect, to group with people, its not something you will really experience until you reach much higher levels. My advice, bring a friend or two along when you start playing this.- Not as Free 2 Play as some other more recent F2P games. Lotro is more of a ""Free to try"" game. More than a demo, or a 2 week trial, but dont expect a DC Universe or Neverwinter experience. If you dont plan on spending ANY money, its impossible to get to max level in this game. (100). Starting around 35, you will find yourself out of areas to quest in that are free. This will require you to make 1 time purchases to get a ""zone"" of content which will get you through the next handful of levels. At a certain point, you will most likely need to spend money on some of the games DLC. However, the DLC is priced decently. In fact, you can get the first FOUR (out of 5) DLC packs together on steam for like 40 bucks. However, if you are looking for a completely free playthrough of the entire game, this is not the game for you.SummaryOverall, this game is well made, and full of content (some good, some bad). There is a lot of choice and variety to be had, and a set of mechanics and gameplay that leans more towards old school mmo's rather than the simplistically brain dead mechanics of some newer games out there. However, be prepared to google/wiki/forum search for answers about things in the game, because there will be plenty of things you will need to learn.If you are ok with spending SOME money on the game, my recommendation is to play to about 20-25 first to see if you enjoy it. Then pick up a VIP subscription for a couple months (30 bucks for 30 months last i checked), and eventually grab the 4 pack of DLC. That is probably the best bang for your buck, giving you as much of the game to experience without it feeling like a paywall is locking you out any further.			"

												I would have recommended this game a year or two ago. But they keep adding stupid ways to get people to pay and complicate the game. They keep adding several new things to character development and makes it so complicated i wouldn't even bother with learning it just so they can get you to spend more cash to unlock upgrades in them. They break promises about the main questline remaining F2P. Quality of quests are also dropping.In short: AVOID, this game was good but now it's just becoming a pay to win fest.			"

												I have played  a lot of MMO Games intensely over the years. As every fan of the genra kows, most have major flaws, or are just bad copycats of World of Warcraft. This game stands far aside of the common I call it standardised MMO. It's a game I can recommend to anyone that does like the Lord of the Rings story, because that's where this game has it's strength.If you are seeking for fast paced action like MMO's like World of Warcraft has become nowadays, then this is the wrong game.When should you give it a real try?- If you are a player that enjoys the original sense of an RPG: exploring a world, without the target to rush your character to a crazy maximum.- If you like storytelling, because the world with it's combined storytelling is what makes this game, there is no other MMO around that merges these two things and presents them to you while you play like this.- If you want a real relaxation, I could never lay back and chill out to an MMO that well as to this, while definately not being boringAltough it's a free to play title, there is no such thing as pay to win, nor would it even matter. I absolutely hate common f2p models, because they ruin all the fun because you feel like being begged in any point at the game.Here, you get your expanision, pay a month of vip, have a lot of stuff permanentely unlocked, such as character slots and goldlimits, and there you go. If you want to advance, get an expansion and keep on. There is no need for starters to instantly buy any expansions, because you can have a lot of things to explore if you play the game with the aim to enjoy the story.			"

												Lord of the Rings online was a lot better back in 2007 at launch or up to 2 years after it. But time has changed as did Lord of the Rings online, so I will comment on how the game is now.Lord of the Rings online is almost a MUST PLAY for every Tolkien fan. The developer always works close with the Middle-Earth Enterprise (the license holder of Tolkiens legacy) to make sure that the game is very close to the lore. A lore that's one of the most richest ones in the whole Fantasy genre.The game world is very well done and gives you a very good feeling of how Tolkien meant Middle-Earth to be. Weather you visit Bree to take a drink at the Prancing Pony, take a stroll across Rivendell or walk through the Mines of Moria, the world feels quite real.One of the best features of Lord of the Rings online is the epic story. At the start of the game your character is about 3 months behind the Fellowship. While playing through the 'original' game (the one that was released in 2007), you'll stay behind the Fellowship, only to catch up with them in Rivendell at some time.The epic story does not tell the story of the Fellowship or your character though. Instead it tells a story of what's happening all around Middle-Earth and reveals things that are not written in the book.Game play though is an other thing. For a MMORPG there's very little player interaction in the lower levels. Mainly the last 2 expansions (Riders of Rohan and Helm's Deep as of this writing) are the places where you need to party to get your progress in the epic story. In the 'older' expansions the game has been modified so that you can actually play the old party content all alone, which I think is a sad thing.In all, I think Lord of the Rings online is still a very good MMORPG for it's age and I hope that Turbine will be able to extend it's license (about to expire in 2014 and no word about it so far) so that we can play the game for an other 5 years			"

												There are a ton of MMORPGs out there.  I admit, I got into this one after it went Free to Play.  Well... what sucked me in for 4000+hours, was the fact that you can earn in the game, the same points you need to purchase with cash money, in order to get the expansion packs.  So... even though you can purchase your way up the levels faster, by spending money on the quest packs that pay off in XPs and level development, you can also grind your way to those same level packs.Meaning, it truly *is* Free to Play.There are benefits to making a single cash purchase of some Turbine points... it changes your status permanently up one notch... this gives you an additional character slot.  LOTRO actually encourages the creation of a character created soley for the purpose of grinding the early Turbine Points that are far easier to get (deeds where you have to kill 45 enemies to earn points... as opposed to the deeds not that much further on in the ""pay"" areas where you have to kill 150... or 450 to earn the same number of Turbine Points).  You create a character, run through those deeds... hopefully with a friend or two... and delete that chacter.  Then... make another.  It is a great use for the third slot... until you earn enough Turbine Points to purchase another slot.That, and you get to try different characters and builds.The crafting is very detailed.  You will be creating characters that are good at one thing.  It is even possible to have a character that you don't actually know how to play well... but that you have levelled to great heights only through crafting.  You can also increase a character's crafting skill far beyond their capacity to survive in the areas where they would need to gather the raw materials they need.  This makes the in-game player store system... the auction house... much more of an integral part of the game.  That.. or you use your second character to go out and gather materials, and then store them in your shared bank... or your house storage.The fact that it is set in the Tolkien Universe is a huge bonus.  Everyone should play a hobbit once.Maps are large.... and the scenery is great.  It is fun to ride around when you are high enough level not to attract mobs.  Many players go into the game, to spend time in Bree and hang out with friends.Add it.  Play it.  Costs nothing but time.  Definitely worth more than that.			"

												I will start off with a few good points as to why i would recommend this game (Only slightly) to people who enjoy mmos with a already created universe. The game does a pretty good job at recreating  the lotr universe of Middle-Earth or at least it did at one point. For you see it would seem the worlds are almost empty, If you are thinking of just playing cusually then get ready to grind like hell to get the turpine points to buy most of the items you need in-game. For example you need turpine points to buy the riding skill early game and alot of the other good cosmetic items, but dont get me wrong i like how you can actually get the coins with out having to pay real money it will just take a long time to get them. With the Semi pay-to-win out of the way there is the problem of the servers drying up, beacuse if you are wanting to get into this game now unless you are starting with someone get ready to walk the halls alone. There are a good amount of pros and cons to cover aslso-Pros-well crafted maps-decent gaming community-not entirely pay-to-win-story with an interesting twist-crafting is rather good-Cons-close to empty servers-lots of grinding for ""turbine points""-some glitches (though what games don't)-armour doesn't have the greatest apeal in the looksThe lists can go on for both but that is always up to the indivual person, because i have found you can't always go off of reviews you have to figure out if you like the game yourself. That being said i wrote this just to educate the people who might want to start playing this game and hopefully turbine might see this and lay off the pay-to-win a little but. So all in all it is rather fun, i guess i might have something to do with my love for Lotr.<Just clearing up i have played this game for humdreds of hours outside of steam>			"

												I've been wanting to write a review for LotRO for a long time, but every time I attempt it, I find that I cannot do the game justice. Nonetheless, I love it enough that I owe it one.I have played LotRO since 2007, and save a few hiatuses, I still play to this day. With that much history, I am sorely tempted to go into a long-winded tirade about all of my experiences with this game, how I feel about all of the changes it has endured, and share my thoughts about how it ended up where it is today. It is difficult at times to get across your point and enthuisasm without including the aforementioned. However, as this is meant to be a review and not a novel, I will attempt to refrain from that and keep my focus on the point. LotRO is a very story-based and driven game, as you might expect from an MMO derived from Tolkien's works. While it does have the common fetch-and-kill quests and sometimes redundant feeling tasks that you'll find in every MMO, by and large the quests are compelling and fulfilling. This is especially true of the Epic quests, which deal with the members of the Fellowship of the Ring and their actions. The world is expansive and highly immersive, and there is adventure to be had everywhere, in many different forms. With a few exceptions, the development team is incredibly loyal to and respective of Tolkien's writings and based the landscape and heart of Middle Earth off of the books, not the Peter Jackson movies. You will not find another game, anywhere, that has as much love for Tolkien’s works as the Lord of the Rings Online. It felt warm and grand when I first started, and it still does today.That being said, LotRO has been around for a very long time. It has numerous bugs and suffers from issues you might expect from a game of its age. Speaking strictly in terms of MMOs, it does not have the end game content or high numbers of raids that you might be looking for or expect. It is limited in what it can implement for mechanics and flashy gameplay; It runs on an engine built in 2002, originally used on Asheron's Call 2. It has numerous bugs and flaws that continue to harry it despite attempted fixes and updates. Those who feel so inclined can purchase many perks and advantages through the in-game store, which is obnoxious in its attempts to get you to notice and use it. Its population has waned in recent years, as have the resources devoted to it. Likewise, its focus on group play has lessened. Essentially, if you are looking for the more common focuses of MMOs these days, meaning lots of raiding, end game and group content, PvP, top of the line graphics, flashy gameplay, etc, you will not find that here in levels that will satisfy you.Nonetheless, the game looks impressive - running it on high graphics, it hides its age extremely well. The community remains one of the friendliest and most helpful to be found in MMOs, and whether you enjoy RP or not, there are plenty of tools and resources available to cater to both casual and extreme role-players. There exists plenty of humor and easter eggs hidden around for casual players or huge Tolkien nerds to find. To steal a quote from a blog I read recently, ""It has a heart and soul that very few games can boast of having, and those looking only at the graphics, technicalities and the gameplay to judge an MMO won’t be able to appreciate its true worth, ever. LotRO is not a trendy game, possibly never will be, and it’s most likely better for it. .... we fans get to have a game that is worthy of Tolkien’s work, despite any and all flaws."" And there you have it. If you're looking for story and exploration, love Tolkien's works, or want a friendly and reasonably casual MMO to tinker around with, LotRO is an amazing choice. Despite all of its flaws, it is a gem amongst games, and is the most faithful and successful attempt at visualizing Tolkien's world. I have, would, and will strongly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Tolkien in any way.			"

												One of the older MMO's but if you love the world of Tolkien you will love this.  This game as loads of content so theres plenty to do and see at your pace.  The deeds/achievements give you turbine points to spend in store so if you are playing on the ftp you can unlock expansions & content by grinding these out.			"

												For everyone wondering wether to play or not to play this game. I think there was never a better time starting this game. It has loads of content. Combat system is really good. Leveling is awesome in this game. There is so much to do. It is not just a game were you log in and play questing non-stop. You can craft, play skirmishes or just hang out in bree and chat. There is alot of end game content and surely lots more to come.The game is completly free. You get the areas from 1-30 for free. Then you need to purchase quests packs with turbine points. You can gather turbine points in game while playing. It is a little grind but it isn't that bad cuz you would do those things anyway eventually.If you have any questions then you could send me a private message. I will gladly help			"

												The number of hours that I have played this game through steam does not even come close to the actual number of hours played as I've also played this game through turbine's own launcher.This is the one MMO which I always come back to. Over the years I've taken a few breaks from the game but I always crawl my way back, and am welcomed back with open arms. The game is showing signs of age and graphically it can struggle, especially in the newer areas (Minas Tirith for example) but throughout this I still come back and love this game with all my heart.I have recently completed the epic quest line where the riders of rohan comes to the aid of Gondor, riding through the pelennor fields - Riding side by side with Theoden and his riders - OMG my heart was in my mouth for the entire instance and I only wished it had lasted for longer.I originally started on Withywindle and with the recent server merges have moved to Evernight. Everyone will have something different that draws them to Lotro but for me it has always been the social aspect. Finding the right kinship for me changed this game to something that I look forward to playing. This is a game that if you put the time and effort into can be completely F2P - There are plenty of TP farming guides around and if you have the patience to grind you can buy almost everything from the store. Saying that I would recommend going VIP at least once within the game. There are a few perks that are unlocked (swift travel for example) that you cannot purchase through the store, and the amount of love and time turbine put into the gameplay and story it is worth giving a little back to them - They can get a lot of negativity but if not for them then I would not have this game that I so love to play.

												As a veteran of MMOs (and MUDs before that) I would have to recommend this game for several reason.-F2P: Its actually free to play. The RMT (real money trade) store items are mostly cosmetic. There are some that effect gameplay convenience wise. However, the RMT currency (Turbine Points) can be also earned in game in many different ways. Basically, the game gives you RMT currency as a side result of playing.-The Community. The community is not the typical MMO trollfest. MOST players you come across are more than willing to lend a hand, give advice or even (sometimes) free items etc. They are very friendly and generally tend to help the new players out.-Social MMO. Despite this game having boatloads of grindy combat like any other MMO, there are many  unique social aspects to this game. Making/playing your own musical instruments in a band, player/guild housing etc.-Massive world. The gameworld in this is rather big. While certain areas are locked out until you purchase the expansion, there are equivalent zones for the free (budget) player.-Customer Support is very ... human. And tends to be helpful with the player rather than absolute sticklers to policy.-Mounted Combat/Legendary Weapons/Raids/Dungeons/Crafting/Typical MMO stuff etc., etc.,CONS:-I had performance issues on my budget laptop. The game can get very laggy with xpacs and infusion of players.-WoW ruined any mmo without flying mounts ><TL:DR give it a spin if you like mmos. While it doesn't break any new ground in the genre it is a solid game with unique social aspects.			"

												I'm going to make this quick and simple.  Play lotro for the world.  It is the best realization of tolkein's Middle Earth in a video game, period.  The early level questing up until level 60 or so is a joyous experience either solo or with friends.  End game the grind sets in and if you like min maxing you certainly can, but be prepared to devote some time.  Don't play for pvp, it's essentially dead.  The world and community keep lotro moving along, and as long as that holds true I will never leave it.			"

The best community in an MMO by far, everyone willing to help and teach you with a Shaolin Monk patience, they would even talk with me in portuguese (my main language) using Google translator so i would feel more included in the community.The best MMORPG i've played so far.And it comes from a guy which have played all the top MMOs for years (such as Tibia, Runescape, MU, UO, LineAge 2, Ragnarok, WoW, PW, ArcheAge, TERA)			"

												LOTRO is a wonderful MMO by any standards, but to fans of Tolkien's works it achieves something far greater than any other game. A huge recreation of Middle-Earth, with a lot of it's characters and plentiful lore to be found amongst the beautiful scenarios. The game is free, so you might as well try it, even if you're not into MMOs or Lord Of The Rings (who knows, maybe you'll get hooked?) and unlike most F2P games, it is NOT pay2win, and you'll probably have no need to pay any money to keep playing until arround level 30-something, when you need more quests (people usually complain that you also need to purchase the riding skill, but this is false, as the game rewards you with store points very often, for completing some actions, and by the time you are able to buy a horse, you'll have more than enough for the riding skill.).So, bottom line is, a truly wonderful game, that remains true to LotR lore without sacrificing gameplay in anyway, with a great community and pretty inexpensive to play for a really long time.Oh, you can also slap people with a fish.10/10			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online bears the name of one of the most famous books in the English language. If you are a fan of the aforementioned books then LotRO has a lot to offer you. It's rich in material from the books, and despite its age still offers a detailed and beautiful rendering of Middle-Earth.If you are a fan of MMO's then LotRO is probably not the best bet. It is lacking in PvP (only one region allows for PvP, The Ettenmoors) instead opting to focus upon co-operative play and PvE. At the present point it is difficult finding beginning region play, with most activity occuring at current end-game level. This makes the beginning game play tiers somewhat lonely and more akin to a generic offline RPG than an actual MMO, just another reason why those wanting a true MMO experience will probably be put off.Another criticism (as with many free to play structured games) is the increasing reliance on Pay to Win structures in order to make money. This has somewhat unblanced the game and makes it especially difficult at lower tiers. The ability to buy most weapon enhancements and skill increases means those who pay will quickly outstrip those who do not.That said the community is wonderful. By and large most of the players are helpful and happy to proved assistance in various forms, with a level of maturity that is fairly uncommon to MMO's. It is also a fairly active community, it may not boast huge subscriber and player numbers but the players by and large are people who play regularly and consistently. In terms of roleplaying the RP servers are quite active, and regular events are held and arranged by players, yet further evidence of why the player community is one of the friendliest and active around.On the whole I would definitely recommend LotRO especially to those who are fans of the world, as it provides an extended experience of the literature. It is by no means a perfect game, and it is fairly old now. but seeing as it has lasted so long, is testament to not only the love of Tolkien's works but also to the dedication of its player base.

												I’m playing with an increasingly miserable lvl 58 elf huntress. She wants to see all of Middle Earth, but she won’t. Because I am broke.I feel like writing this review in caps lock and yelling at the top of my lungs “pay to win pay to win pay to win”. Middle Earth is beautiful. Beginnings are sweet as you’re not engaged in battles straight away. You start in Eriador, and exact place depends on which race you chose to play with. Crafting is soothing, exploring is fun, everything looks amazing. When you get a horse, things get a lot easier and you find yourself immersed into the world and enjoying it so much. It leaves you curious for other parts of Middle Earth and you want to level up to enjoy them all. Music is great too and fits every scenery beautifully.But then, around levels 20-30 you realize you need to purchase a quest pack to play the next area on the map. That's fine, so you do that, still being into the game. Then you grind grind grind, until you face the same thing again. So you buy another area. And so on. Thing is, I didn’t even mind purchasing packs to see more. What I really did mind though, is how boring and repetitive quests became while levelling in parallel became increasingly harder and frustrating. I'm starting to think the best way to play this game is getting a horse and just riding like there's no tomorrow until you reach Mordor. Noro lim Asfaloth, noro lim!Unless on top of all those purchases you want to buy experience tomes. Thanks Turbine, but no thanks.Community used to be better too, but I’m guessing a lot of people left for which I can’t really blame them. Also in walks my biggest regret, and that’s starting my toon on a non RP server which is extremely boring and has very little activity. However, if you do the same mistake and want to try another server with the same toon, Turbine offers you to transfer it for 20 €. What a surprise, I think I'll get a heart attack.  Still, there were times when I was so desperate I was willing to put all that aside and give it another shot. Then server started crashing. Guess it’s not meant to be, Lotro.			"

												Good things:+ Absolutely oozing with LoTR vibe+ Beautiful landscape that vividly brings Middle-Earth to life+ Beautiful music+ Various small details that are so lore friendly(Prancing Pony Hobbit door, flies around lamps at night etc)+ Beautiful sense of exploration+ Crafting's traditional, but interesting. And actually useful unlike in many an MMONeutral things:0 Servers only in USA0 A lot of microtransactions(though you can help yourself if you know what to buy and when)0 Pretty old school gameplay0 Talent Trees(this one's completely in the eye of the beholder-imo they've done harm to the game with them, but then again they've potential and they do bring ""choices, choices"" to the forefront)Bad things:- Boring as hell(endless ""kill x of y"" with slow leveling and old school MMO combat-sorry LoTR IP can't save you from this one)- Developers lying to players all the time(it happened at the very least 3 times during the lifespan and all of those decisions ruined the game - latest: EU datacentre)- Easy difficulty + slow leveling = uh-oh.- Developers don't really care about players(back to point 1)I'll give it a thumbs up, but be VERY CAREFUL about those cons. It's basically a neutral score anyhow. Because the pros do outweigh the cons.Fair's fair and it ought to remain as such.			"

												Over my time of playing it, about 1,000 hours without steam I decided to play it on steam, which has no gameplay difference. But the game gives something I can't get enough of. If it's either defeating hundreds of different creatures, using tons of different moves to slay them, or maybe just explore the nice atmosphere. It's a great game, and I really enjoy playing it. It's full of action, adventure, and you can make a lot of new friends that can help you in hard parts of this game.I found you can also earn points to buy the worlds by playing the game, which makes it a fun challenge.It's also amazing that the creatures you fight, Goblins, Humans, Orcs, Trolls etc.Good game overall!

What more can you ask for? This game is dream come true for every Tolkien and video games fan. I played video games whole my life, and i have never met such a friendly community like in LOTRO. I used to play DOTA alot, and after that this is a deep relief for soul and body.It is actually free to play, but after time you will have feeling like developers deserved to award them with some money so this game can live long time more.

												     Traversing Middle-Earth slaying orcs and fighting alongside heroes like Legolas, Halbarad, and even Prince Theodred; what more could you ask for? Honestly, this game is not what it once was; that does not mean I don't recommend it. The Lord of the Rings Online is truly a masterpiece made a very passionate team. My first few years in this game were phenomenal - Don't let my Steam numbers fool you - if anything this game has given me a much deeper love for the lore. It's a game where the little things are the best things. The Yule (December) festival is by far the best festival I have participated in in any of the MMOs I have ever played. However instead of going on and on about this game, here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Middle-Earth is huge. Turbine has covered The Shire, to Bree, from Forochel to Mirkwood, Moria, Rohan, Ered Luin, Rivendell, and everywhere in between.- Very lore-friendly. Turbine has created an almost seamless integration of your character into the lore, the events that transpire through the main story (epics) fit together wonderfully with the lore.- Meet and fight alongside mighty heroes. You will get the chance to meet and fight alongside members of the fellowship. Not only that, but you will also meet people such as Halbarad, Elrond, Galadriel and Celeborn, King Theoden, Radagast and Bilbo Baggins; the list goes on.- Witness major events in the story. This includes the Breaking of the Fellowship, the fall of Boromir, - which is waaaay better than the movies -  The Battle for Helms Deep, the final stand of Prince Theodred, the forming of the Gray Company, and many more events, which Minas Tirith and the Battle for Pelennor Fields on the way later this year.- The crafting system. The crafting system is by far one of the best I have experienced in an MMO.- Legendary weapons. You will be able to obtain powerful legendary weapons that grow in power as they are used; you can even name them!- The outfit system. By far the best outfit system I have ever witnessed in an MMO. With the purchase of a wardrobe, you can cosmetically wear ANY piece of armor/clothing in the game regardless of class or race.- The deeding system. The deeds while 'grindy' award Turbine Points (TP) which can be used to purchase quest packs, cosmetics, and other things from the LOTRO store (See Below)There are no doubt a few I missed, but these are the highlights for me. Now onto the cons:- It is impossible to advance in the game without spending money (unless you grind a LOT). I was able to make it to level 52 without spending a dime, and having no quest packs for levels 30+ Levels 1-30 are free, however 30-100 (yes level 100) all require the purchase of quest packs and expansion packs either with real money or Turbine Points.- The game is not what it once was. While still enjoyable, the game has just started to really lose it's spark. I truly feel sorry for those who did not get to experience the game before 2012. It was amazing back then. But with all the gameplay/mechanic/etc. changes it has ruined the experience for me and many veteran players.- While nice for new players, the game is not very veteran friendly. I covered this more or less in the above statement. With all the changes going on many of the veteran players have left the game. I have seen lots of new players joining, and the game is definitely new player friendly, but at a terrible cost.- Lots of the servers are dead (or dying). Brandywine is the server to choose. It is one of the most populated servers and one of the few very populated ones still in game. That's not to say that LOTRO has a tiny playerbase; most people are just on a few servers like Brandywine.I hope I have been able to sum up this game in a positive way with the 5 years of experience I have with it. I truly recommend giving LOTRO a try. ESPECIALLY if you love the lore; that's one of the things that keeps me in the game. With this in mind, I will mention that Lord of the Rings is nearing it's end. I do not believe Turbine will renew their license past 2017. We will luckily get Mordor, and from the looks of it, the Grey Havens and the areas that are needed to ""Complete"" the game. If you're on the fence about this game, I suggest you get it while you can; it is free after all.			"

												awesome game. this is pretty much only mmo that i've ever played for a longer period of time. it is obviously very story driven game. you follow the lord of the rings story by completing epic quest line. and this epic quest/story line really is awesome, it takes you through whole middle earth, you meet tons of characters, you participate in a lot of instances and explore every region of middle earth. it really makes you feel like you're part of the story. besides this, there are loads of regular side quests, and if you take your time like me, and read text about each quest, game becomes much more immersive.the middle earth is huge and diverse. you have nice looking shire (green, flowers, friendly people), then you have arctic cold and frozen forochel; barren, dark and hostile angmar. 10/10 for world (middle earth) variety.you have 5 races and 10 classes to choose from. nothing too crazy, but definitely not bad. each race has it's own starter zone and unique quests, where you learn a bit about lore, and meet some characters important for that race.there's quite a bit of instances, raids and skirmishes to choose from, and most of them can scale to your level.game has couple of regions where you can purchase your own house and decorate it with trophies from battles.community is friendly and mature.f2p model: you can play whole game without spending a cent, and i know people that have done that, but it requires a lot of grind. personally, i bought eriador quest pack, and all expansions (you can get them for free if you grind enough).game is not perfect though. it has performance issues in newer areas where your fps is constantly low. i don't know if there is fix for this, but i haven't looked for it really. another downside for me is that all weapons within same class (axes, swords, spears etc...) look pretty similar. i'd like to see more variety there. mobs can get a bit boring, and basically after you've seen mobs on first 30-40 levels (maybe even before) you've seen them all. they definitely need more variety.there's quite a bit of things i didn't go through (crafting, exploring, hobbies, mounts...) but it would take forever to write this review...8.5/10			"

												Terrible, even infuriating, customer service. Despite this being a prime example of a good solid classic MMORPG.Had a bad experience with a GM a couple years ago, arbitrarily changed my name from ""Theodophilus"" to some randomly generated name. Claimed it broke the rules and was too religious, despite Theod- being a very common name prefix in the LOTR universe. I questioned him about it, he refused to change it back, and even banned my account for three days because I pressed the issue. There is no recourse at all as a customer, WB is just too big to care, and Turbine (or whoever) have no real means set up of dealing with these problems, they had a suggestion box and ticket system, true, but it's /dev/null, never got so much as a form letter response from those venues. Once a year I call up WB and asked if they've changed the name back for free, or taken any action to rectify or make amends for my terrible customer service experience. They sympathetically tell me nothing can be done on the phone, and I tell them that I enjoyed the game itself and would have possibly been spending money on it, and they have now lost $X amount more dollars in the past year I may have spent, because at the time of the occurrence I happily a subscriber--This was after the game went f2p, I figured I liked it, I spent time on it, I would support it.The GMs have no oversight, and can pretty much do whatever they want without repercussions. If you do gamble on this game, I would encourage you to spend no money on it, so the only thing you will lose if you encounter a rogue GM is your time. GM abuse shatters the illusion within an MMO that what you do within it has any meaning or permanency whatsoever, someone can just come along and spitefully fiddle with your entry in the database, what's the point? The suspension of disbelief was shattered, and this was reinforced by the abject lack of customer care or public relations. While the game is a fine example of a classic MMORPG, unfortunately so is the customer service, from a bygone era when gaming was a less competitive market, a higher ratio of gamers were children, and the novelty of being in an MMORPG at all may have been enough to get some kid to tolerate the unpoliced abuse by a GM. This isn't the past, I'm not a kid, and they have lost a lot of money from me. Always vote with your wallet, it's one of the few things that really matter in this world, unfortunately.Nothing preciousssSSssss here, just a database some guy can drunk dial on a whim.			"

												Just started playing, and it's already got me hooked. The visuals are really crisp, the storyline is engaging, and the mechanics are easy to get the hang of (I'm not new to MMORGs, but there are some differences to others I've played). My only real gripe thus far is that the map isn't as interactive as I'm used to. But overall, it's really great to see the lands of Middle Earth come to life in this kind of format, especially ones we haven't seen in other games or the films. I'm excited to continue my journey.

												  As a big fan of Lord of the Rings, i decided to play the MMO game version of it when I first came across with back in the summer of 2011.During my journeys throughout Middle-Earth I have met important personalities, visited many places and helped a lot of kind people. And I have enjoyed every minute of my adventure..  First of all, I have to congratulate the developers of Turbine for their effort in the creation of Middle-Earth. Following Tolkien's masterworks and using a little bit of their imagination, they created a world which is astonishing and different from any other game worlds. From the green plains of Shire to the icy peaks of Misty Mountains with the deep mines of Moria below them and even beyond, to the White City of Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, each region offers a unique experience for the player. However the graphics are indeed a bit outdated and it might frustrate some people but that doesn't stop you from enjoying the graphical scenery of the game.  Another good thing about this game is it's variety of quests and tasks. I remember when i was fighting a Barlog in Angmar and the next moment I was at Shire, fishing at Brandywine to collect some fishes for a hobbit. Because adventure in games is not always about fighting epic monsters and bosses...Needless to say that your own personal story is so well merged in the story of the Fellowship of the Ring both chronically and aesthetically. I have to say that is a smart move from the developers that you are not declared as the chosen one or the savior of Middle-Earth from the very beginning. You are just one of the many folks out there who is eager for some adventure and wants to pursue his/her destiny ...Gradually you gain fame from your deeds and more and more people are pinning their hopes on you to purge Middle-Earth from evil.  LOTRO'S music and soundtracks is a strong feature of this game. There's a wide variety of songs here which elevate your gaming experience. Each region has their respective soundtracks which make the game even more atmospheric. You have to test it for yourself to see what I am talking about.  The overall gameplay experience is good. Crafting is an essential and rewarding part of the game. The combat system is enjoyable. You have a large amount of abilities with a variety of combos. LOTRO is by 99% a PvE game because is focusing on its story rather than the fighting. We all know what happens in the end. Good guys win, bad guys lose. Although the PvMP system , where you are playing as an servant or Sauron, is rather fascinating. The community is friendly and there are lots of players willing to participate in numerous instances. Furthermore, the deed system ( =achievements) rewards you with Turbine Points and other stuff ( points for buying things in store) if you are exploring the regions or killing more enemies.  Well, Turbine may be a little expensive ( don't let it mislead you with the F2P label) but in my opinion the pay system is quite handy. Apart from the subscription system where you are forced to pay once a month to have all the areas for free ( like in WoW), you can buy each region of Middle Earth from the store for an amount of money and then you can have it forever with all the quests and deeds of this area.  Personally, I was addicted to this game since the beginning. It is a very good MMORPG for all the LOTR-fans out there who have watched the films or read the books. But if you are not one of them, why don’t give it a try and join in an adventure throughout Middle-Earth? "

												I rarely play MMOs anymore, so I will avoid talking about combat and such in this review. Instead, I will focus on other elements of the game.So, congrats: you've just found the portal to Middle-earth. LOTRO does a wonderful job recreating the world. Despite the graphics, I still had loads of fun exploring whenever I wasn't off killing orcs. Some places, like Lothlorien, are gorgeous and breathtaking. Others, like Angmar, manage to get under your skin and make you feel just a tiny bit repulsed. The atmospheres of each region are wonderfully conveyed.Tolkien gave us a fleshed-out world, and instead of drastically changing the lore, LOTRO adds onto it. Granted, the LOTRO-created lore is plausible within Middle-earth, so I'm usually content to let it slide. As an added plus, a lot of it is interesting!I haven't been able to get far into the main storyline (nearly through with Volume 2), but I can vouch that it's engaging. While the Fellowship is off doing their own thing, your character is tasked with helping the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Side quests are the usual fetch/kill quests, so nothing really notable there. You can choose to run around in groups of people (appropriately named ""fellowships"") or just go solo.And that leads to what I reckon is my only complaint. It's not really a free game. You have to buy quest packs for some regions, so it's a lot harder to level up quickly when you've run out of things to do solo and don't have money to spend. That's how I got bored.Servers are usually populated with a fair amount of people, with most hanging out on the roleplaying servers. Something that made LOTRO really stand out for me was the kind community. I've met a large variety of players ranging from high schoolers to parents. Many offered to help me out whenever I needed it. There will be the rare troll in the chat, but you can simply ignore them. Everyone's there to have fun and nerd out over Tolkien's works.If you're a major fan of Middle-earth and don't mind some tweaks here and there, I recommend this game. 7/10.			"

												Wow. It is really hard to review a game which became a part of your life and of your soul. I'll start with negative points then, hope it will be easier for us all this way.1. Move along if you're not familiar with Lord of the Rings. This game is made for fans of Middle-Earth by fans of Middle-Earth. It is story-driven game which rewards you for being into this world. It is not worth your time nor money if you are indifferent about LotR. Better go read some books. You might as well close this review, won't be anything more useful here for you.2. Teh graphics suxx. LotRO doesn't hold its line against any of nowadays-popular MMORPGs (except maybe WoW, which looks just as awful now). I'm not sure if I placed 2 first points in the right order, but anyway: if you're looking for impressive effects and fappable grills, move along. Go play TERA, it's just what you need (and quite good a MMORPG by the way).3. The combat system is decades since deprecated. Yes, it's THAT point-and-click we all were tired of for years. If you consider it disgusting and still reading it for some reason - move along. Go play TERA or anything else, there is a plenty of action MMORPGs nowadays.4. The game is not free. Period. If you don't spend a single penny on the game, you will have really hard time past level 25. However, don't leave yet. It's the first matter I'll deal with below.That's it for contras, I think. As promised, concerning money. You have two options: to buy a subscription or to purchase all items (mostly, quest packs) separately. Aside from that, you'll need two out of three DLCs (""Steely Dawn"" is auxiliary, nothing mandatory there). Taking all the discounts into concern (~20% off in-game items, 50-75% off DLCs at large Steam sales), the second option is much more convenient. Still, it will cost you dearly (around $30 for Russian players and probably twice that much for all the others: there's a solid reason for this difference, but I won't elaborate here).Still reading this? Kudos to you then. Now I'm going to persuade you to install LotRO.1. THE STORY. I cannot stress this enough. The game is highly story-driven. Every single quest is a brick in a huge building of the Middle-Earth story. The epic storyline follows the road of the Fellowship of the Ring. It reached Gondor as of when I'm writing this. And it's called epic for a good reason. Still, side quests play no lesser role. All of them contribute to the story and to the atmosphere.2.  The graphics. You've got it right, and f**k those who left in the progress. The effects might seem simple, the grills might seem not fappable enough, but it's LotR, not a manga. It feels natural, however natural it might be for a fantasy world. And you have my word that you will stop once in a while just to have a longer look at that landscape.3. The world. Do you remember? It's the good old Middle-Earth. You can venture into icy crevasses of Forochel (don't jump in the water!), walk among the golden mallorns of Lothlorien, explore the dangerous depths of Moria and ride with rohirrim against the tide of Uruk-hai. You can even find a hat Gandalf dropped at the very bottom of the Endless Stair.4. The atmosphere. You get used to it, to every good and bad thing about the game, and you really feel like you live in this world. The domestical system. The music. The language in quests is good and proper English (or Elven, mind you). The mobs are not concentrated at farming spots, but are mixed and scattered across vast logical regions. The crafting system (you can actually cook, Valar be damned!) HP is called Morale, so you don't actually die, but desperately flee when severely outmatched. The Dread system which turns your screen gray and replaces minimap with a flaming eye, when you encounter something truly fearsome. Like a Balrog corpse. It is, definitely, the best LotR-inspired game in terms of atmosphere that ever existed.I could go on. I could mention the community, the music playing (yep, you can play any music in the game at a MIDI quality), the PK absence, the epic battles and whatnot. But I will conclude.Come and feel it yourself. If you're still here - it is worth it. This is an experience you'll never regret. And LotRO will love you back.THIS GAME IS A F***ING BLAST AND I LOVE IT. DO IT. Join the Fellowship.Oh Eru, I wanted to say it from the very start.Sincerely Yours,Talcano Mithrenhen, Landroval (ex-Mirkwood).			"

												Love this game. Been playing it for many years. It's really remarkable. Definitely the best 'escape' game out there. Music is really chill, the world and art is beautiful and the gameplay is fairly easy going.My only complaint about it is that after so many years, it can get a little repetitive but that's mostly my fault for playing it so much. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, but it's mostly enjoyable and there's so much variety in the game that you can change gears all the time and keep yourself engaged in countless activities.

												My family and I have played this game for more than 5 years now. This game is for those who really cared about the story of middle earth, because that is one of the main things this game surpasses at. My current hours are actually no where near my actual as I played the game before steam had it for many years. This is not a fast game, and if you're careful with your deeds, you never have to pay money. For PVE, this is not pay to win. It is not fast paced or gloriously action filled, I like playing it on a lazy weekend morning.			"

												I played this game from open beta and loved it. After Mirkwood came out a few things in my life had me put LotRO on hold.  I came back about 2 months ago and it feels like a different game. That being said, it's not a bad thing, just different from what I remember. Not dramatically different but enough to make it interesting. It is still one of the best MMOs I've ever played (going all the way back to Ultima Online before EA or whoever got a hold of it and ♥♥♥♥ed it all up). The game follows the books pretty closely (and not the movies). So if you like Tolkien and are looking to get into a MMO, this is the right place for you. Even if you haven't read the books and just seen the Hobbit and Rings trilogies, there is enought in the game for you to say, ""Ah, I remember that!"" The game is a little old but that doesnt take away from its charm. It being older means the the graphics are not all HD/3D/VR-esque but are not too bad in hindsight. The story and quests drive you to want to go to the next part of the game and leveling is not that bad. The quests make it interesting to the point that it doesn't feel like a constant grind. Not to say that there isn't a grinding element to it.....it is a MMO after all.I'd give it a 9/10, just because I'm a fan of the books and they actually took the time to get it right.			"

												The game is great, if your style is grinding and free to play, then this game is for you, if your a huge fan of tolkien's work and his books, then this is for you for much of the  game's lore are very spot on. The community is very friendly, VERY VERY FRIENDLY,no exagerations. And if you want some Role Plays then this game has, much RPing are on Laurelin but some servers has it's rp.                         And a little tips for grinding Lotro Points (LP), use a minstrel dwarven so you will start at the very top of ered luin's map, why minstrel? It's because Minstrels are kinda OP (overpowered) at the starting levels (ered luin, the shire and bree-land), do all the slayer deeds and exploration deeds, if you do the quest then much better for it will complete a deed which will give you more than the slayer and exploration deeds, plus the reputation deeds you must do for it will give you 50 LP if you manage to complete all 4 of it, then after you've done all deeds at Ered Luin, do the same for The Shire ( I reccomend to do only the exploration and slayer deeds at the shire for the Quest deeds are kinda annoying :D, for reputation deeds,you need to be level 20 to use the Reputation Items, you can farm them at the old barrows or trade it in the skirmish camps) and Bree-land, eventually you can gather 800+ LP (Lotro Points) after you are done with the deeds.            It can be done for like 5-6 hours for all the starter region's deeds to be done, my record is kinda 4 and a half hours ( i use slayer deed acceleration and that thing that will give you boost on horse speed). This game has it's up's and downs like the dwindling numbers of players ( like the Dunedains XD, but there are players who came back after some months of not playing), much of the stuff in the game are fellowship (ex. Angmarm but you can solo almost everything that is important like Epic Quests).              My hours on record is 761.3 hrs but let me tell you that i have been playing it since 2012 and i have been using the stand alone client for almost 3 years, and the 2 years on steam. You are not alone in this game despite the few numbers of players, if you need help then you can ask for it in the WC (World Chat) and if you need for fellowship quest then look in the LFF chat box. God bless and Goodluck! "

												Free to play done right (and no it's not pay to win either :D ). Don't listen to folks who have one or two hours logged, you really can get a lot out of this game if you can put in some time and a little money. After all we all put time into games and some are bloody expensive!LoTRO is the least frustrating free to play experience I've had as Turbine gives you a taste of everything. They don't lock out 99% of the game. Completing 'deeds' (challenges like kill X amount of goblins) will earn you Turbine points for micro transactions in the LoTRO store. With enough time and patience its possible to buy several store items from in game rewards. If you spend even the minimum on Turbine points (£5) you get upgraded to premium account status. That gives you two more character slots per server and removes the gold cap.However if you're aiming not to spend anything at all you can't have a job or life and do that. That is some serious grinding. You'll also HAVE to spend time grinding the Turbine points if you don't even want to spend a fiver to remove the gold cap, as two gold is not nearly enough in game currency later on. Good thing is that before you remove the cap all money you earn gets saved in an overflow wallet ready for when you do gain access to it.WHAT FREE TO PLAYER'S GETThe epic quests that make up the main story line are mostly free (to continue it you need to buy the expansions).Player housing is free. Some items used to decorate can be bought in the store but most you get for free.Some trait slots are free. These are different to trait trees (the skill trees you spec into to get your abilities). You gain most of these by deeds and they can be slotted to give either passive buffs or more skills.Steeds. Getting your horse/pony/goat (can only ride goats in Moria) is a free option but the riding skill itself is not free. Don't throw your arms up in protest yet. With small effort you can get the 95 Turbine points you need to purchase this skill. Most deeds that award Turbine points (and most of them do) are worth between 5-10 points. Some deeds are worth more. It's easy to get (VIP's get a free quest that grants the skill). Some steeds are available in the store. With the Rohan expansion you can ride a war steed for mounted combat and customize it's appearance but that can get bloody expensive.The Shire, Bree, Ered Luin, Lone Lands and Celondim areas are free. Free, Premium and VIP players all have to buy the expansions, there are five in total. There are quest packs for other regions you can buy in game from about 595 Turbine points. You can travel to the areas you don't have the quest packs for, you just can't do quests there. It's important to note that free content (excluding skirmishes) drys up around level 35-38. Moria, the first expansion is best entered around level 50 so you'll be needing a quest pack to fill in the gap.Some skirmishes and repeatable instances are free.Joining a crafting guild is free but you need to pay for full access to it. You don't need be in a guild but it gives you access to far more recipes than you'd have otherwise. Having full access is a distinct advantage as there is far more choice.All but the Warden (one of the tanks) and Rune-Keeper (DPS and healing, not the only DPS or healing class in game) classes are free. The Rune-Keeper is well worth it, lots of ranged DPS magic fun. The Warden is more of a secondary tank with combos (called gambits) and other tricks thrown in.The fishing hobby (the only hobby) is free. You can catch fish to display in your home or to cook if you or any of your alts have the right crafting profession.The in game mailing system is free and is very useful to post items to your alts, not just other players.Creating a guild (known as a kinship here) is free (well it would be stupid otherwise lets face it).Free daily silver hobbit present.WHAT VIP's GETIf you go the subscription route you become a VIP. VIP's pay the following:$15 a month$29.97 for 3 months$59.94 for 6 months$99.99 for 12 monthsFor your chosen cost/sub length you get:Mailbox field access Access all character trait slots500 Turbine points per monthAccess all quest packs and skirmishes that are not a part of expansionsUnlimited chat20 Slots of shared wardrobe space (this enables you to cosmetically equip gear on any character)Additional inventory slotsCustom character portrait frameDaily +100% XP (for 30% of a level)Free weekly gold hobbit presentAccess all monster classes (Monster play is mostly PvP)Access all crafting guildsNo currency capMaximum auction house listingsThe most major benefits are the quest packs, skirmishes, 500 free Turbine points, crafting guilds and monster classes. That gives you a ton of extra content.PLAYING THE GAMEChoose race of men, hobbit, dwarf or elves, then pick your class. The usual DPS, tank and healer classes are present, along with the squishy pet class (Lore Master, that does more than just use pets). Next is the choice of where your character comes from. Choosing this region doesn't determine more than a preset skin tone and hair colour (which you can change). Choose your hair style, facial features etc, pick a suitable name and away you go. The level cap for characters is 100.The tutorial is easy and makes it clear how to use your abilities. A nice touch is the tutorial skip option available at character creation if you've already done it before.The usual MMO type features are here. Choose a crafting profession to make useful items along the way, level up and upgrade your weapons and armour, collect type quests, kill type quests, quests in instances as well as those in the open world. Most are set in the open world. There are also repeatable daily quests in certain areas. The interface makes it easy to see who is in your area if you want to start a fellowship (team). There are different instance quests called skirmishes. These can be repeated and are a bit more entertaining than the usual quests as they have a few different objectives and ambushes. You gain 'marks' for successful objectives as well as completing the skirmish itself. These can be completed solo or in a fellowship. Turn the marks in for rewards.When you start to level up you'll be getting trait points. Each class has three trait trees that will determine specifically how your chosen class plays and what skills you gain. Some skills however are not determined by which trees or how far into them you spec as they are standard skills. The Guardian (one of two tank classes) for example has a tanking, DPS and two handed tanking tree choices. You can choose to specialize in one tree or spread yourself a bit thinner into others as well.Being an MMO the graphics are not top notch but they are beautiful. Water effects are nice.USEFUL INFO ON CRASHESMany players have suffered from constant crashes. Check out post #11 in this thread;https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?521607-Lotro-keeps-crashingThat may solve your issues. Also if you have Pando Media Booster installed get rid of it! Not only is it pointless it can slow LoTRO to the point it crashes. Both these solutions worked for me and my wife.Yet again this is one of the vast amount of games these days that has annoying bugs. Hopefully you won't suffer them or at least be able to sort them with the above solutions. Also some of the store items are far too pricey (extra bags and anything steed related in particular).There's a lot of nice places to explore and plenty to do once you have a stable game. There are many more features I've not covered such as raids, PvP and monster play, not to mention the legendary weapon system and your free hobbit present you get each day. Have a bit of patience and you'll love Middle Earth. :)			"

They don't lock out 99% of the game. Completing 'deeds' (challenges like kill X amount of goblins) will earn you Turbine points for micro transactions in the LoTRO store. With enough time and patience its possible to buy several store items from in game rewards. If you spend even the minimum on Turbine points (£5) you get upgraded to premium account status. That gives you two more character slots per server and removes the gold cap.However if you're aiming not to spend anything at all you can't have a job or life and do that. That is some serious grinding. You'll also HAVE to spend time grinding the Turbine points if you don't even want to spend a fiver to remove the gold cap, as two gold is not nearly enough in game currency later on. Good thing is that before you remove the cap all money you earn gets saved in an overflow wallet ready for when you do gain access to it.WHAT FREE TO PLAYER'S GETThe epic quests that make up the main story line are mostly free (to continue it you need to buy the expansions).Player housing is free. Some items used to decorate can be bought in the store but most you get for free.Some trait slots are free. These are different to trait trees (the skill trees you spec into to get your abilities). You gain most of these by deeds and they can be slotted to give either passive buffs or more skills.Steeds. Getting your horse/pony/goat (can only ride goats in Moria) is a free option but the riding skill itself is not free. Don't throw your arms up in protest yet. With small effort you can get the 95 Turbine points you need to purchase this skill. Most deeds that award Turbine points (and most of them do) are worth between 5-10 points. Some deeds are worth more. It's easy to get (VIP's get a free quest that grants the skill). Some steeds are available in the store. With the Rohan expansion you can ride a war steed for mounted combat and customize it's appearance but that can get bloody expensive.The Shire, Bree, Ered Luin, Lone Lands and Celondim areas are free. Free, Premium and VIP players all have to buy the expansions, there are five in total. There are quest packs for other regions you can buy in game from about 595 Turbine points. You can travel to the areas you don't have the quest packs for, you just can't do quests there. It's important to note that free content (excluding skirmishes) drys up around level 35-38. Moria, the first expansion is best entered around level 50 so you'll be needing a quest pack to fill in the gap.Some skirmishes and repeatable instances are free.Joining a crafting guild is free but you need to pay for full access to it. You don't need be in a guild but it gives you access to far more recipes than you'd have otherwise. Having full access is a distinct advantage as there is far more choice.All but the Warden (one of the tanks) and Rune-Keeper (DPS and healing, not the only DPS or healing class in game) classes are free. The Rune-Keeper is well worth it, lots of ranged DPS magic fun. The Warden is more of a secondary tank with combos (called gambits) and other tricks thrown in.The fishing hobby (the only hobby) is free. You can catch fish to display in your home or to cook if you or any of your alts have the right crafting profession.The in game mailing system is free and is very useful to post items to your alts, not just other players.Creating a guild (known as a kinship here) is free (well it would be stupid otherwise lets face it).Free daily silver hobbit present.WHAT VIP's GETIf you go the subscription route you become a VIP. VIP's pay the following:$15 a month$29.97 for 3 months$59.94 for 6 months$99.99 for 12 monthsFor your chosen cost/sub length you get:Mailbox field access Access all character trait slots500 Turbine points per monthAccess all quest packs and skirmishes that are not a part of expansionsUnlimited chat20 Slots of shared wardrobe space (this enables you to cosmetically equip gear on any character)Additional inventory slotsCustom character portrait frameDaily +100% XP (for 30% of a level)Free weekly gold hobbit presentAccess all monster classes (Monster play is mostly PvP)Access all crafting guildsNo currency capMaximum auction house listingsThe most major benefits are the quest packs, skirmishes, 500 free Turbine points, crafting guilds and monster classes. That gives you a ton of extra content.PLAYING THE GAMEChoose race of men, hobbit, dwarf or elves, then pick your class. The usual DPS, tank and healer classes are present, along with the squishy pet class (Lore Master, that does more than just use pets). Next is the choice of where your character comes from. Choosing this region doesn't determine more than a preset skin tone and hair colour (which you can change). Choose your hair style, facial features etc, pick a suitable name and away you go. The level cap for characters is 100.The tutorial is easy and makes it clear how to use your abilities. A nice touch is the tutorial skip option available at character creation if you've already done it before.The usual MMO type features are here. Choose a crafting profession to make useful items along the way, level up and upgrade your weapons and armour, collect type quests, kill type quests, quests in instances as well as those in the open world. Most are set in the open world. There are also repeatable daily quests in certain areas. The interface makes it easy to see who is in your area if you want to start a fellowship (team). There are different instance quests called skirmishes. These can be repeated and are a bit more entertaining than the usual quests as they have a few different objectives and ambushes. You gain 'marks' for successful objectives as well as completing the skirmish itself. These can be completed solo or in a fellowship. Turn the marks in for rewards.When you start to level up you'll be getting trait points. Each class has three trait trees that will determine specifically how your chosen class plays and what skills you gain. Some skills however are not determined by which trees or how far into them you spec as they are standard skills. The Guardian (one of two tank classes) for example has a tanking, DPS and two handed tanking tree choices. You can choose to specialize in one tree or spread yourself a bit thinner into others as well.Being an MMO the graphics are not top notch but they are beautiful. Water effects are nice.USEFUL INFO ON CRASHESMany players have suffered from constant crashes. Check out post #11 in this thread;https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?521607-Lotro-keeps-crashingThat may solve your issues. Also if you have Pando Media Booster installed get rid of it! Not only is it pointless it can slow LoTRO to the point it crashes. Both these solutions worked for me and my wife.Yet again this is one of the vast amount of games these days that has annoying bugs. Hopefully you won't suffer them or at least be able to sort them with the above solutions. Also some of the store items are far too pricey (extra bags and anything steed related in particular).There's a lot of nice places to explore and plenty to do once you have a stable game. There are many more features I've not covered such as raids, PvP and monster play, not to mention the legendary weapon system and your free hobbit present you get each day. Have a bit of patience and you'll love Middle Earth. :)			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online is by far the Best MMORPG I've kind of played.  I was a late to the game, but I subbed for a few months with some friends (and even more since f2p).  The fellowship quests and group content is as solid as it gets for old school MMORPGs.  A time came when new and shiny things came and Lotro was left behind for me and my pals, But I still go back every now and then.  I love the rich lore/story, the fantastic graphics (even today they look good), and the truley epic settings.LOTRO at first glance when playing is odd.  I totally understand when someone says they just didn't like it.  Yet at it's core, this game is as good if not better than any MMORPG made during it's time.  It just does things a little differently.  For instance it tries really hard to stick to the books (the I.P it draws from-not the movies) so there are no mages or wizard classes bc the only Wizards are the famous ones - (Gandorf, Radhadgas, Sarapmon). There are however classes who play like mages using knowledge of powders (Lore Master), ancient runes (Rune Keeper), and...music (Minstrel).  There are no ""hit points"" or health.  The green bar is morale, and when it reaches zero you die..so yeah its health, but not really, and some abilities are just silly like the crowd control Burglar ability ""riddle"" (in the heat of combat you tell a riddle and the enemy thinks about it for like 20 secs).  Thats what Lotro does.  It holds true to the lore of the book and the world it created.  Each class is very fun and there are quite a few 'one of a kind' classes in Lotro. So often mmos copy paste classes.  At the start of the game, the music is not great, your gear looks like barf, and you're screaming at enemies to do damage. It's different and these can push ppl away, but the music is optional, lotro has an amazing (before it's time) outfit/wardrobe system that is fully customizable with dyes and overlays, and screaming at enemies lowers their morale so get over it. The main reason I don't play it very much is the lack of friends who will play it.  Like many MMORPGs back then, playing with friends is a tricky and often demanding experience.  Need to be on the same server, and need to be near the same levels. Servers have merged, players are a bit low, but It's still good and the Free to play model isn't horrible.  You can do anything by grinding Deeds.  The f2p model locks out questing zones and trait slots, and sometimes the paygates get annoying, but if you don't care to grind deeds it's really not that big of a deal.  Especially if you make alts bc their deeds count towards the in game currency too.  If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings in any form, nothing beats exploring and visiting all of the awesome iconic places you've only read about or seen in movies.  Give it a try! I know I will as long as it's still alive.			"

												I started playing this game when I was like 10 yrs old, when it just came out. I loved it then, and now that I'm 19 yrs old, I still love it. It has a certain draw to it that you just can't resist but to come back to. I have many more hours than listed by steam. Atleast somewhere inbetween 2000-4000 hours. I spent alot of my time playing this. It has is up and downs, but they're all worth it.The pros outway the cons.  The game is kinda dying it seems, cause there was a server merge recently, but I'll be happy to play this game till the very day it dies. The community is priceless in comparison to any other MMO I've played. Of course there are the trolls, and douches too, but overall they seem to be mostly kind. I spent 400$ on 2 accounts, and let me tell you that 400$ was well spent. This game is worth it.10/10 would be a hobbit without shoes again.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online is a must play for anyone that loves the world of Middle Earth, but the game itself is dated and suffers from a lack of cohesive game direction and meaningful new content. Character classes are interesting and engaging, and feel decently varied, but combat overall feels sluggish. The game used to have a great dungeon/raid system, but this has largely been replaced by the lackluster Big Battle system. Questing is largely comprised of standard kill and fetch quests, but the environments are varied and the storyline is a centerpoint. There isn't a meaningful catch up system though (unless you want to pay quite a bit of $$), so expect to spend quite a bit of time leveling if you're new to the game.The graphics are beautiful but dated. Character creation is a bit lackluster, but the world itself is where the game really shines.The music is excellent, and really captures the feeling of Middle Earth. At times it's a bit repetetive, but this is balanced by the ability to create your own music in game.			"

												I played LOTRO for about a year when it first came out and just returned to it 5 days ago. I was a bit concerned about it going F2P because most games that do that pretty much design it as Free to Win or design it in a manner that gives those that shell out the big bucks an unfair advantage. Fortunately LOTRO didn't go that route. You can play this game and never spend a penny because you earn points within the game to spend on unlocking material and servives. Sure it comes easier and quicker to those willing to pay for the points but if you don't mind grinding some then you can bypass spending real money. LOTRO to me also did a great job with the immersion factor. You feel like you are a part of Middle Earth. While the graphics don't hold up to the latest titles, LOTRO is still a great game and worth trying. I'm hooked.			"

												I am about 50/50 on this game. I like how it plays but if your going to do more than drop in ever-now and then ... dont expect anything unless you plan on paying for an account. it's an ok game to play when your bored and don't mind playing solo a lot.Getting in groups is pretty much useless unless your in a guild and they are usually paying members so.. if you want to be able to play it as intended then be ready to fork over the cash. Most players are lvl 105 now so don't ecpect to find many players at lower levels, even if you find them they are old timers and have alts that are armed to the♥♥♥♥♥♥and tweaked way past your little toon so its very uneven as a new player.As I said, if you want to just drop in every so oftena nd play a bit solo its not a bad game....Hope this helps.I will still give it thumbs up because it can be fun for a short time in small spurts.

												If you love the books or enjoyed the movies, this is a great game for you.  This game is P2W and there is lots of grinding.  Lag is also a big issue during mounted combat and higher level maps, such as Minas Tirith.  It is not known for PvP but does offer.  It IS for the hardcore Tolkein and LOTR fans with a fantastic community.  Some have said the MMO is dying and LOTRO does not have the players it once did.  Well, there are many folks who hop from game to game and do not tend to stay with a game for longer than a year or two.  If you are one of those folks, this game is not for you.  The game has really been enjoyable by myself and my family for the past 6 years.  We are in it for the long haul and have not yet found a MMO currently out there that offers as much as this one does.  Yes, it is a bit old school.  Yes, it is loads of fun and very addictive.			"

												In recent reviews, people have complaints about long installation times, trouble with registering, and not being able to play the game. For me, this was not the case. I don't have a powerful rig (and also not the best wifi), and I downloaded this game in under an hour. With quick account registration and patches installed, I was soon on my way to explore Middle Earth.As for the game itself, for being almost 10 years old, it's incredible. As a fan of Tolkien, it's astonishing to run into iconic landscapes and characters. The game is beautiful for being 10 years old, and you don't need a high performancing PC to run it. There's a main quest line that follows the books and plenty of interesting side quests. Combat is fun and engaging for a tab target MMORPG. The music, oh the music. If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings film scores, then you'll love the music in game. There's nothing more enjoyable than the ear-gasm of riding into Rohan and hearing the sweet sound of violins accompaning your journey.On the contrary, the game can become a bit grindy. Lower level quests can become quite repeditive with the feeling of ""kill 10 spiders and collect 5 bear hides.,"" can be a bit overwhelming. I know. I've almost stopped playing again because of it. But, if you pick an advanced and interesting class, it can be less mind numbing. At the time of writting this review, I have a level 20 Warden and quests are becoming more engaging. Skirmishes, epic battles, and instances are a great break from these grindy experiences, and epic battles are available at low levels.As for the F2P model, it's one of the best ones available. It's incredibly fair and there really isn't any P2W instances. Some higher level quests and expansions require LOTRO points, but these points can be acquired in game (if you're up for some serious grinding). Most of the equipment found in the LOTRO store are cosmetics, mounts, and chracter boosts. I started out as a F2P player, but fell in love with the game, and became a VIP member, spending some money on additional LOTRO Points.So download the game. If you don't like it, then all you have done is wasted a bit of your time. It's free to play people. With another expansion coming out this year and another playable race, download it now and enjoy an authentic Middle Earth experience.			"

												First of all - I've spent countless hours in this game before I finally downloaded it through steam when I had to re-install it due to hardware problems. The Lord of the Rings Online boasts a great open world based on J.R.R. Tolkien's famous works. Here you get to explore Middle-earth at your own pace, together with friends or all alone. Since LOTRO was first launched in 2007, it has grown from being a fairly small MMO to be among the biggest and broadest worlds out there. You can explore famous sites as seen in the movies and read about in the books, such as the Shire, Bree-town, Weathertop, Rivendell, Isengard, Helms Deep and as of one of the more recent updates, Minas Tirith! And not only do you get to see these landmarks, but you can also explore everything inbetween. Okay, you can't go everywhere straight off. In fact there is alot you'll have to go through to get to Gondor and Minas Tirith, but the story and places you visit on your way is just so masterfully created. You create your own character and you get to be the hero of Middle-earth in your own adventure paralell to the travels of Frodo and the fellowship. You'll see sides of Middle-earth that you never really noticed in either the books or films before. And the best thing about LOTRO is that it is completely free to play! Okay, you can buy Turbine Points and VIP membership to help you on your adventures. But it is also completely possible to farm Turbine Points in-game and get to the level cap, which is currently at level 105, without spending a single real-life dollar. I recommend this game to anyone who has a slight interest in Tolkien's work, be it the books or the movies based on them. I also recommend it to anyone who likes a good MMORPG and wants to try something a little different. Because LOTRO is different from other MMO's. Not only does it have by far the most established lore of any MMO, but it also has one of the very best player communities. Sure, there are a few jerks in Middle-earth too, just as there are in any other place, but overall the LOTRO community is among the friendliest and most helpful communities out there. The only con I can state about this game right now is that since it's come so far in development it is a little hard for new players and those of us, me included, who's taken a longer break from the game, to catch up with the newest content. But luckily, the friendly community has got you covered! If you ask for help, I bet you're gonna get it!			"

I haven't played too much so far, but i'm invested in the game and expect to be playing it for a very long time!

												I love to play this game just to unwind and take in the scenary of Middle-Earth. It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended.			"

												I've been playing for 3 years now, a little over 5000 hours.  The game is a beautiful interpretation of Tolkien's lore, and a fantastic rendition of Middle Earth.  If you enjoy the journey, rather than rushing to cap, it's perfect.  Many of the quests are interesting, some funny, some touching, a few a bit over the top with the running back and forth.  Exploring is always fun, you never know what's around the corner.  The devs have hidden little ""Easter Eggs"" throughout the landscape- a little cabin in the woods housing 3 bears, the occaisional bear-skin rug with a rabit sitting on it, and many others.  Hidden deeds suprise you with a new title when you accomplish an objective you didn't even know you were going for.  These are just the extras, as the whole point of your journey is to help in the background as the Fellowship persues thier goal.  I love it, and the community.  The vast majority of players are helpful and friendly, ready to advise, assist, and inform.  Try it, you have nothing to lose, and a whole world of enjoyment to gain.			"

 9/10  Is my personal rating for this game. The -1 is  only  for the slightly outdated graphics.   If you like MMO's, and know a little about the Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this game. Although, the more you know about the lore, the more you will love LotRO. There is enough content here that  you can easily make the 2 charicters without repeating the same quests. I have put in 2k hours and it is still fun for me.  Paid subscription  - This is  not necessary. In the beginning, this can help with level gain and will unlock a few perks. At level cap, a subscription only allows you into the player vs. monster player area, and  does not make players over-powered. Additional areas are seperate purchases ($7 - $50). Thanks for reading, and I hope this info helps!			"

												Unsurprisingly, given the number of hours played, I find this f2p MMO really enjoyable. The recent (2013) introduction of trait trees has somewhat dumbed down the gameplay and has particularly hurt support classes, making them less useful in raid situations. The Helms Deep battles however have added some level of strategic play which may compensate some players for the loss of complexity elsewhere. Of course new players will not experience the loss felt by long term players to the complexity of play and can just enjoy the excellent epic storyline and the great graphics (these improve as you level and reach regions that have been created more recently), but all the areas look pretty as long as you have a half way decent graphics card.Skirmish and instance (dungeon) play does not become available until you reach lvl 20. Thereafter as you level up more areas of play become available.  It is worth buying the packs as you get more areas to explore and some decent perks. Although you can earn these in game if you are willing to grind Turbine points. 92:100			"

												Let me start out by saying I actually love this game...The problem is, despite being ""F2P"" it really isn't...unless I suppose you have 3,000 hours to grind LOTRO points, but even then, there's no way you could afford to purchase everything you need to play the game unrestricted. I purchased this game almost 9 years ago, before it went ""F2P."" Despite owning the actual game, they still said I had to purchase the level 20+ zone, which I already bought when I purchased the game, or subscribe before I could play it. Like I said, I love this game, so I subbed. Once I got to level 65, I found out that just having a sub wasn't enough to access the later content. I then needed to spend roughly $20 or so to access content for the next 10 levels, then another $20 for the next 10 levels and yet another probably $40 in LOTRO points to afford the end game content. This, again, wouldn't be a huge deal except the game is pretty lifeless at the non-endgame levels, making it ridiculous to have to spend nearly $100 plus what I already subbed to get to the end game where the small playerbase ""hangs out."" Having a sub should be enough to at least get you to the content before the latest end-game stuff.			"

												If LOTRO had come out first, I likely never would have played WoW. (That is saying something, as I have played WoW since release and still have an active account) I've been a fan of Tolkien's world and writing since I was a little girl and have worn out multiple copies of The Hobbit.LOTRO can be complex to learn (I'm a minstrel and I play infrequently.) and the store can be daunting. However, I bought the game when it came out so I had a few nice little perks like extra slots and bags etc. If you ""rush to the endgame"" content you will be disappointed. I'm not particularly fond of instances etc, but I love wandering around on my Minstrel and seeing the world. I enjoyed meeting Tom Bombadil (and helping him with a few things) and participating in a few festivals with the Hobbits.If you are looking for an MMO where you get obscenely powerful and faceroll all the content hit up something different. LOTRO is a bit dated, but, I had great fun with all the quests (enough so that I will probably make another alt) and I come back to it every year for a month or so, get a few more levels on my Minstrel (I'll never get max level, of that I am sure!) and enjoy a change of pace from everything else I play.

												Played this game for a bit, I've got to say the graphics are amazing for the time it came out. A bit outdated now, while this game is seemily f2p in reality it's not really. F2P only takes you so far, until around 38-42. From then on you run out of quests and the grind is so tedious and boring makes you want to quit. But no fret! You can get quests, by buying all the expansions or VIP. Lets not forget you Turbine Points basically become essential mid game.To top it off, getting a 4 man dunegon let alone 6. Is a nightmare even on the most populated servers unless you are near max level. Because hardly anyone is leveling new characters. The solo grind is beyond lonesome.If you are genuinely interested in playing this game 1-40 then go ahead, it's a good testing margin to see if you like the game enough to invest in the expansions and VIP account. But as far as 'free' goes, that's where the game basically ends.			"

												So i have 9.4hrs on steam and i don't want to count how many hours i have on the standalone client. But i have to say lotro has the most compelling and mature community that iv encountered.  Only gripes i have with the game is that partial p2p system. What i mean by this is after the lonelands questing zone you have to purchase the quest zones or get vip. Though this is circumvented through deeds where you gain turbine points (Or what ever there called now). Im not sure how it is now since the new company has taken over but this is my over all experence iv had with lotro prior to the new company.Should you play Lotro? - Yes one thousand times yes  even though of the partial p2p the community and mechanics of the game is very compelling and engaging. I wouldn't think of any reason not to download this and play it.			"

												I used to play this game until they released a patch which which broke the musical instruments so I left the game with sadness in my heart.You may wonder why I would have instruments as a reason to leave the game, so allow me to ellaborate;Once long, long ago I began my journey in LotRO as soon as it was released on Steam. I had thoroughly enjoyed the books and loved the movies to an equal measure so I decided to see what kind of game the MMO would be like.The experience was honestly the best I had ever had out of an MMO up until that point and I loved it down to the core of my heart. I loved exploring around the vast maps on my mount, dismounting to farm and complete quests and then return to uncover more story and venture deeper into more and more locations.The I found instruments but didn't know about how to use them correctly so I left them to one side.Eventually during my adventures I caught up to a group of people in the same area who were courteous to me and even allowed me to join them in their party so that we could all complete the quests faster and adventure together.Not long later they invited me to their Skype group and we would talk and play LotRO for hours on end. Slaying everything from the lowly mobs to major bosses and we would do so joyously.Then one person in the group stated they had been looking online at guides and forums and had stumbled across ABC files. These were essentially MIDI files that were programmed to work with instruments in LotRO. We messed around with them initially until someone in the group had the brilliant idea of synchronising our music by counting down in Skype and beginning to play the same song simultanbeously.We did so and the result was fantastic; we were essentially a small orchestra of terribly mismatched instruments but the sound was fantastic to us nontheless. Not only this but when we began to do this in centers of population like towns and hubs other players began to gather around in small crowds and use dance emotes as we played the Star Wars theme tune, MJ's Smooth Criminal, the Pirates of the Carribean theme tune and so on.Even though this had nothing to do with the game itself it was as if we had created a tiny meta-game within LotRO which we as a group resided and we even stopped questing as a whole. We simply went from town to town as a traveling band and it was the best time I have probably ever had in an MMO. It was also an extremely unique experience. Never in my life had I ever played an online game in order to avoid playing the online game in favour of doing some stupid pointless thing and it was still so enjoyable.Then the updates happened. Not only did servers begin to die out and disappear but they eventually released a patch which broke the instruments. HOW they broke the instruments, items which have literally no impact on the rest of the game or needed modifying or changing in any way shape or form is still beyind me, but they did and this crushed my heart and the hearts of my fellow group. We had spent what mjust have been three or four moths running aroudn playing music and being generally stupid while occasionally helping lower level people who required assistance withing quests.We unanimously decided to all leave the game. The thing which had become the core gameplay to us long after the grindy and repetitive combat had become stale was lost.We waited for a few weeks. We posted many complaints. There were quite a lot of forum posts. But this was to no avail. After each passing week the desire to return to LotRO had subsided and I have never return since.This in it's entirety is the tale of my LotRO experience. Although it may not be the most useful or the most interesting this is how I viewed the game during my playtime and the reason why I abandoned it.P.S. If under any circumstance they have fixed the instruments please reply to this so that people will know if they have not played the game but my desire to play is no longer here so I will not be returning regardless, thank you.

												I have been playing Lords of the Rings Online (LOTRO) since it went to free to play in 2010.  I just loaded LOTRO from Steam recently.   LOTRO has been my favorite MMORPG, since City of Heroes was closed.  I have bought all the quest packs, expansions and many unlocks for my one account. I only play on the Gladden server.LOTRO is called a ""Free to Play"" MMORPG in the description, but if you want to reach level cap in LOTRO, you will have to pay some real money.  Free to Play accounts are limited on purpose, of course. Free to Play only have the landscape enemies, all the epic story quests, few instances, some instant action quests, 3 starter areas and 1 area lvl 20 to 30, and can make 2 characters which have to buy trait powers, bags, swift travel, gold cap unlock, etc. The Devs are quite generous with awarding store points for just playing LOTRO and the game is more Free To Play friendly than others.  You can grind for store points by completing deeds on each character on your account, but you would have to work very hard to earn enough just to buy 1 quest pack.  You can also Google for guides to show you how to earn enough store points to Play for Free, check the Steam guides also.I suggest you try it out from Steam as Free to Play only, up to level 32. Then if you really want to pay, go to the in-game store to set up credit card payments. The best way to play LOTRO, imho, is to pay for the all the Expansions and Quest packs, then take VIP for 1 month, then create all your characters, then play for free as Premium account.   Expansions have to be bought separately, even for VIP players, but can be bought with store points in-game.  Paying for VIP for 1 month will unlock all the stuff for each character you open that you would have to buy separately.  With store points, you are able to unlock alot of things that VIP players get for free, and are in premium and free accounts to annoy them. Get the account Wallet also. The LOTRO store has a lot of sales on points bundles and items in store.  Don't expect payments from the Steam wallet to work, but it has worked at one time.If you have problems running this game while loaded from Steam, then download it straight from the LOTRO dot com website.  If you are a Mac user, and have problems playing this game then switch to a Windows OS computer.There is no pvp servers, just special pvp maps for level 105 subscribers to fight player controlled monsters.  You get a Orc Warrior (Reaver) for free with any character on that server reaching level 10.  The rest of the Creep classes are buyable using store points.  You can pvp on the same side by sparring but there is no rewards for that.LOTRO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set in a fantasy universe based upon J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth novels. It takes place during the time period of The Lord of the Rings movies. The graphics and controls are good still.  The level cap currently is 105 and there is plans for more expansions. The game like all other MMORPGs that has it's faults but it is better than the other games out there currently still, imho.  There are still plenty of hardcore and new players on the remaining open servers, after there has been a server consolidation in 2016. Standing Stone games is the original development team and have shifted producer to Daybreak game in 2017.  Has a great Crafting system. There are plenty of raids, dungeons and instant action content. Try this game out if you like fantasy MMORPGs.for more info:

												Still, after 9 years since game has been lounched it's one of the best mmorpg's ever made. Only the fact, game is still active, with still added content make this game such as unique as every mmo player need. I have played since closed beta, now i have over 1600 hours spent in this game (counted ingame time), my guild is still active after that much years after. Yes, only with a few elder members, but still .. Graphics dont look like an high end title, but ye ... it still isn't trash.  Much of key features fot times when game was new, like hobbies, great farming, nice crafting, exping of weapons, raising your own horse, housing for everyone not only for high lvl players. A lot of games after has tried to use these philosophies from lotro with theyr own little inovations.  It's the only mmorpg what i have still instaled, all these 9 long years and i'm still loging back. Not for long gaming sessions, I'm now 32 years old grandpa :D But for strong bond with this game, great sceneries, lovely soundtrack and a cup of nostalgia for sunday afternoons. I know, for today's young players is a lot of new games for chose from, with high end graphics etc. But in this game, you've got 9 years of ading quest with no ""clicktobehighestlvl"" like in wow = months of questing, months of collecting, months of making deeds, months of making your unique named and stated weapon, etc. Try it with your friends for the best experience. I will put my arm into Saurons fire if it will not be fun for you.			"

												Just one word can describe this game: wonderful. Is not just f2p, you can get all content for free (thought you need lots of grind).The combat system feels a little outdated, but I really enjoyed the ambientation and lore withing the game.

												Ive only played after the move to F2P and all I can say is that some of these old players seem unusually bitter. The changes were made years ago and yet they are just now saying how bad supposedly is. Here is the truth of the game. You get to play any of the free races of middle earth with a good selection of classes each with interesting mechanics. The story litteraly fallows the books with the player being a step behind or a vanguard for Frodo and the felowship. Although many things are locked and require Cash to unlock you can get a ton of Tubine Points just by getting achevements that are as simple as expore X area or use X spell Y number of times. I was able to unlock runekeeper doing this while my minstril was under level 20. You get to see the world, meet the people, and even play full songs on the in game instraments. Heck, There is a real life band based in the game. Check out ""The lonly mountan band"" if you want to hear some cool Tolkin inspired (or in some cases writen) music.			"

												As most I started playing the game when it went free to play. I was very interested in playing an mmo in the universe created by Tolkien. At first the game may not seem attractive due to the outdated graphics, the clunky combat and the somewhat repetitive questing. However, if you invest a good amount of time to understand it the game starts showing its jewels. As you progress through the areas you will feel your character getting stronger, becoming a seasoned warrior whose path is tied with that of the Fellowship. The main story line not only lets you experience the Lord of the Rings trilogy to its depth but also gives you an insight on secondary plotlines that were in the background of both the books and the movies.A major advantage of the game is that it literally lets you get every part of the premium content by grinding. You can get every expansion, dungeon, skirmish e.t.c. by doing the abundant deeds spread out through all the areas. I have never seen something similar in other similar MMOs. Another great aspect of the game which adds to its immersion is the community. Everyone is very helpful to each other, bad game practices are non-existant making you feel like a member of a large fellowship.Overall, I believe people who like me are fans of the universe Tolkien created would adore this game as its huge content lets you experience the history of the books as if you were there.

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is huge! And by that I mean just the locations are huge. Weirdly the only thing I don't like is that every time you level up there is no way you can add skill points to your hero. It just auto scales. But barring that, the game itself is pretty absorbing. :)			"

												So after 500 hours I guess its time to write a review.No matter which game I play, I always seem to come back to Lotro. It has its flaws, but yet there is just something special about it. The community in general are always helpful and willing to help out new players, and after the server migrations the world feels much more populated. Even if you are not a fan of J.R.R Tolkien's work, I would still recommend you try this game for at least the first 30 levels, as you would not have to buy a single thing until then.Pros:- Great Community- The only game that allows you to explore most of Middle-Earth- Very active RP groups if you are interested in that- Hundreds of hours of content- Possible to play this game completely free (You can earn Turbine points by doing deeds in-game)- PvP is fun, as you can play either as the Free Peoples, or as Sauron's ArmyCons:- The game is old, so even though it still looks very good, the outdated graphics might put some people off- There is a lot that you would need to purchase or grind for, if you do not pay a monthly sub.- Server issues can cause lag quite a lot, especially in PvP, though in general it is fine- Balance issues with some classes, though the game is still being actively developed and balancedSo overall, I would score Lotro a 8/10, and would recommend anyone looking for a decent MMO or just a fun game to try it out.Edit: 1300 hours and review still stands, loving it so far!

												I played Lotro for 4-6 years....I tried returning a few weeks ago only to find literally the very game i had loved so much to be backtracked and burned to stupidity and dumbed down horribly...the classes are no longer classes v.v . It has become dead because of the stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥they keep doing honestly there used to be so much potential for the game and the developers and stuff always took it for granted and every expansion after Mines of Moria or Siege of Mirkwood or any content was disappointment after disappointment and they never cared to listen to any of the real voices of the game they basicly molded it now to be a stupid thing.... Lord of the rings doesn't deserve to be like this, I wish it could be redone back to how it was originally retouched graphics wise and have a crap ton of new features like boats/ships, swimming underwater. More including of PvP and playable ""Monsters"" cus kinda think it'd be cool to be a goblin >.> but meh...no instead they kept adding recolored and the same thing over and over :/, I would advise not to unless you just want to take in the views of each area considering most of it you have to unlock to quest in with grinded Turbine points or having purchased it all.I'll always remember Lotro, my favorite instance was Garth Agarwen back when it took a full group of 6 back when things were hard and you felt accomplished after succeeding the higher you leveled. If Possible I would love for this game to go back to how it was originally and then new features added and just a mass overhaul that J.R.R. Tolkiens world is worthy of, instead of the garbage money grab its become :(			"

												This game was my childhood. I remember waking up every weekend and and running into the living room to load it up and play along with my parents. The game is absolutley amazing, I spent countless hours playing Lotro and I still do today. Whenever I had spare change I would go and buy something from the turbine store. Even though I am older now and don't have a lot of time to play lotro I still come back to it whenever I can. Can't wait for Mordor to come out!!!			"

												As a 7 year veteran of this game that has purchased every expansion/class/zone I cannot in good faith recommend this game anymore, Turbine have no idea what they are doing at this point and are obviously suffering from lack of staff and have been since Riders of Rohan launched.Turbine apparently decided a game wide nerf was in order because content was too easy, huge sweeping changes like this couldn't possibly affect anything right? NPC's in escort missions were hit by this nerf and in turn had their HP lowered to an absolutely rediculous amount causing some key story missions to be almost impossible until completely outleveling them (96 to do a level 87 required mission) requiring you to completely bypass doing the games main story (the key reason I enjoy it and play it) and do sidequests until you are able to go back and play catch up. If you managed to complete this story before the game wide nerf you were fine. This is insanely unacceptable to require the player to be almost a full 10+ levels higher to complete in order to finish the quest.Also of note is the absolutely abysmal or almost complete lack of optimization in the recent expansions. To put this in perspective I have trouble maintaining 15 FPS on ultra in areas with a fairly decent rig (R9 390X, i7 4790k, 32g DDR3). This game was released in 2007. I have no trouble maintaining 100+ FPS in Final Fantasy XIV on max settings. The game functions atrociously on anything above a dual core cpu and it shows. Mounted combat has been laggy and suffers from rubber banding regardless of connection since it was implemented in 2012 with no improvements, something that was touted as a main mechanic and the entire expansion was centered around. The game also suffers from extreme hitching regardless of settings/zone in every expansion past Riders of Rohan due to the way the engine is structured and reads files from an HDD, this is not fixed using an SSD or flash drive as the devs suggest in the forums.This is completely depressing as this is easily in my top 3 MMO's I've played. I love the community and the setting for this game; I have genuinely never met nicer people in an MMO than I have in this. I enjoyed being able to create my own character and explore an absolutely gorgeous world and I really enjoyed seeing an expanded form of the LOTR universe and being a part of new stories told in it.Maybe by some amazing stroke of luck the game can magically obtain a development team that is substantial enough and experienced enough to fix the problems with the game and restore it to the game I once enjoyed spending my time in, but until then the game is on life support and future updates will likely not fix the issues the game currently has.

Enjoyed it immensely. It is the place for all the Middle Earth fans. Wonderfully created, with great music, ambient, sightseeing and just abundance of stuff to do and places to see.This game was the first to have great main story and memorable stuff to do.You can just log in and do basically nothing but walk around the Bree or Shire and enjoy it.

												Put it simple: the best MMORPG out there.It's big. What do you think is big? WoW? Check this. If you pay attention, you'll notice that any other MMORPG uses either corridor-like locations, with view always blocked by mountains, trees, buildings etc., or dramatically low draw distance, or both. Well, LotRO draws enormously vast locations with honest draw distance - not GTA V, but nothing like you've seen in MMORPG before. (The Crew was later). When you're in the fields of Rohan, you feel exactly why it is the land of horseriders.It's authentic. I play this game for 7 years and still I stop and gaze in awe at dwarf lords sculptures in Moria. Still I take screenshots of The Shire. Still I find dozens of new landscape details. This world is handcrafted by the indigenous inhabitants of Middle-Earth - piece by piece, tree by tree, bush by bush.It's homely. LotRO officially has the best or one of the best communities in online games.You know, I can go down to the basic mechanics, the classes (see in comments), the raids, the PvP, the unique mechanics like Legendary Weapons and Mounted Combat, but you know what? It's boring. Every game has mechanics, classes, balance and lots of people whine there's no balance. But this game is special. It has... it IS The Middle-Earth. If this means nothing to you, just pass by. You will like it, or dislike it, nothing I can change. But if you love Middle-Earth as I do, or if you are ready to fall in love with it, then whe shall meet at the White City. One day.Over 4000 hours /played on Russian servers before they were shut down.			"

The Graphics are amazing for an MMO and the storyline is unique to every character. Being given both the free roam option and the quest option, this fantastic MMO is a great choice for all types of gamers. 9/10			"

												I haven't played an mmorpg since i played runescape and adventure quest when i was a kid. Since then i've only played FPS games (halo, cod etc.) so this was really refreshing to me. Almost had 200 hours playtime now and I'm just approaching the point where you have to start buying expansions to carry on playing the game in the same way. The game is still playable without expansion though and there is still more things to do, but you will be unable to do all of the sidequests which make progression in the came natural and prevent you having to grind levels. This game is immersive, social, and very very fun. The map is pretty much a life-size recreation of the entirety of middle-earth from the lotr universe.			"

												I've tried out several MMOs (only a few work on my Mac to be fair) and I keep coming back to this one.It's a nicer community than WOW, the atmosphere is better than Guild Wars 2, the graphics are much better and run nicer compared to a lot of cheap browser games, and it's the only true opportunity to wander about Middle Earth in all its glory!The writing is perfect. People making this game cared about the legacy they represent and names, descriptions, even game mechanics are on point. You don't feel like you're playing reskinned WOW because this feels deeper, more like an adventure than a series of tasks I think. Music is great, there's just enough voice acting to make things feel alive. It's based on the books, not the films, so it's a much richer experience.It's got a pretty slow progression but for a guy like me I appreciate the opportunity to explore, talk to people, maybe take in a little fishing. You won't get ganked by a bored high level player and I've yet to see any unpleasentness in the world chat. It's a special game when the most heated argument is about the timeline of the game in comparison with the literature rather than player's griping about the game or other players.Also it's free. Pay a little for a mount is probably a must but it's still a good time!			"

												I've been playing LOTRO for 8 years and have a lifetime subscription (which is no longer available to purchase).If you love Tolkien's Middle-earth, you'll enjoy visiting Turbine's interpretation of it in LOTRO.If you enjoy theme park-style MMORPGs and don't mind playing an older title, you'll probably like LOTRO, too.If you're looking for PvP, you'll find it's limited in LOTRO, but still has a lot of passionate players.If you only enjoy competitive max-level raiding for ""world firsts,"" LOTRO probably isn't for you.If you like making music or role-playing, LOTRO will probably be like heaven. I really can't think of a reason for anyone not to give LOTRO a try. Even if it doesn't have all the features you're looking for, you might still fall in love with the setting, the story, or the community.			"

												Ever wondered to explore Middle-Earth and see the town of Bree, the greens of the Shire and the beauty of Rivendell through your very own eyes? Or perhaps you aspire to be a warrior of the Free Peoples by wielding a shield with as much expertise as shield-master Boromir or string an arrow to the bow as elegantly as the archer Legolas and leave a pile of Orcs in your wake?The Lord of the Rings Online offer all those opportunities and more. Excellent graphics means that you really feel the whole Middle Earth experience when you walk through the town of Bree and into the Prancing Pony for a glass beer or mug of ale. And yes, LOTRO will let you do that!Having spent the past few years of my life playing this game in my free time, I will admit that initially downloaded the game not knowing what to expect of LOTRO's idea of Middle Earth but now many years later, I am proud to say that I've got the chance to do deeds that would make Aragorn consider leaving Arwen for. Or make Boromir betray Gondor - if that makes more sense to you.From simple solo exploring of the fields of the Shire to raiding up with up to 23 other people (24 in total) to fight the likes of vile creatures such as Balrogs and Dragons, LOTRO has it. A good combat skill and trait system allows for dynamic fights and variety of gameplay amongst the various classes. Feel like wielding a shield and turning into a unstoppable version of a defensive god or grasping a greatblade and breaking the Middle-Earth record of ""number of Uruks killed""? Then make it happen by playing LOTRO.Taking all of the above into account and adding on things like a wide choice of mounts for players, a flexible and in-depth crafting system, unique legendary items, player housing filled with the Balrog's Sword (a loot dropped from killing him) makes The Lord of the Rings Online THE MMO to play.Take your first baby steps in Middle-Earth by giving this game a try - who knows, you might even get into the history books found in the Library of Rivendell.Forward onto victory! Forward...FOR GONDOR!			"

												Undying for its iconic interactive portrayal of Tolkien's world, LOTRO has had its fair share of problems lately, but it still remains a fun and memorable game.Pros:+it features a lot of the places and events from the book+contains a very vast world, whose variety truly makes you feel like you're on an adventure+the dialogues do manage to awake some of the nostalgia which made the book so powerful+class advancement, though not special from other MMOs, is still quite decent+the story part of the quests is more developed than in many other MMOsCons:-the graphics is pretty much outdated-overall, Turbine's marketing techniques tend to be a bit aggressive and dishonest. Besides, the F2P system is quite tricky. Don't go into the game imagining you can play it up until the final level without paying anything, because that's very nearly impossible. -shallow dialogues, inaccurate portrayals of iconic places, uninteresting new landscapes-repetitive quests and often grinding, though not more than in other MMOs-the last updates have been quite disappointing in terms of the originality of the contentNeutral:-the PvP system is promising and quite enjoyable already, but it is also poorly uninvested inDespite its many issues, I would still recommend LOTRO for its landscapes, story and lore, at least for a try. If you do not like it, you may give up before hitting the level where you actually need to start paying money to advance properly. But just don't go into it with the impression that you'll reach max level entirely for free (like in GW2), because, even though technically it's possible, it's extremely difficult and will ruin the fun of it even if attempted.

												The atmosphere is great, especially in Moria and some other areas. The community is good, and combat is enjoyable.That said, quests are awful in every way, there is no dialogue whatsoever, a lot of places are badly-designed, cosmetically and practically (Minas Tirith, I'm looking at you), and class balance is not great (poor hunters). Don't bother playing without a subscription or good hardware, either - most of the game requires cash to access (including class-critical abilities), and later areas are laggy.The character building/equipment system is a joke, especially since essences.- There's a whole bunch of base and derived stats (maybe 25-35, depending on how you count), but only a third is actually relevant. The remaining stats come free when gearing for the important third.- There are sixteen equipment slots (plus legendary items, which are class features, not items), but they all do exactly the same: they exist only to dump armour with lots of essence slots into. Yes, there are set bonuses, but you could easily reduce the whole equipment system to, say, six numbers (# of four kinds of essences, # of two kinds of equipment set).- Overall, there is a semblance of complexity, but successive updates only seem to replace the need to think about your equipment with more grind-based power creep.- To be clear, combat is fine. It's just that char-op is boring.I don't recommend it, because I don't like it (anymore). However, if you're not interested in deep character building systems, you like being monologued at by NPCs (in LoTR-style speech), and you don't mind a bit of grind, it's otherwise a good game.			"

												Horrible F2P Model, And An Incredibly Boring Solo ExperienceSo many pointless restrictions to F2P playersWhatever you wanna do, you are always reminded of the store, and there will be always something blocking you unless you get VIP (Premium) or buy Turbine Points (or endlessly grind for them)Your wallet is capped to 2 gold, which is no-where near enough for people who are level 20+Your ability to use the Auction feature (Global Trade/Multiplayer Market) and sell your items is locked, you need to buy ""slots"". Each ""slots"" purchase gives you 3 slots to sell your items. Pathetic and not nearly enoughYou need to buy a ""Mount Skill"" in order to use the mounts in-game, which are desperatly needed since your character in-game is stupidly super slowAny basic features you need to use that are provided for free and easy to use in any other F2P MMORPG, you need to grind and spend hours on end just to use in this gameThere is such a heavy focus on the LotRO Store and the game practically forces you to buy into their stupid VIP Premium crap, and punishes you if you don'tLoTRO is just a P2W exploited gameAll the pointless restrictions can be unlocked, via the LotRO Shop, by doing ""Deeds""But Deeds are just a boring, endless grind of killing the same monsters that take hours on end just to turn up with afew Turbine Points (LoTRO Shop Currency). You get 15 Turbine Points for about an hours worth of grinding the same, slowly respawning Monster, and some of the lower costing features is around 95 Turbine pointsThe game is incredibly boring, and just a long boring choreIt's just jam-packed with courier missions that make you back and foward from one town to another, to transport an item, give a letter to someone, or tell someone something. Things slowly pick up by level 20, but not nearly enough to make the game fun or intrestingTL;DR - The game is one long, boring, P2W choreI highly advice you to stay away from this game, it's really not worth your time unless you're willing to drop so much money into this game			"

												     Out of all the games I have played in my entire life, The Lord of the Rings Online (LotRO) has been the most detailed and beautiful game I have ever come across. The story emulates Tolkein's original work, and as a LotR fan, I appreciate that. The graphics of this game are not top-notch, but compared to other MMOs and MOBAs I have played (Archeage, DDO, Smite, Rift, etc.), the graphics are much better. The music in this game is nothing short of phenomenal, as Chance Thomas's compositions are eloquent, detailed, and blend in with the scenery of the game. The game itself is immersive in nature. I have played for up to twelve hours at a time without even noticing (recovering LotRO addict). LotRO offers VIP subscription, but it is not needed. Regions and the LotRO quad pack can be bought with LotRO Points (either buy them or acquire them by completing deeds). For those who want to have a VIP subscription, it only costs ~10 USD per month, but there are 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, and lifetime subscriptions avaliable. I give LotRO a 10/10.			"

												The steam review system is keeping me from posting my original, longer review, so here, in a nutshell:- Used to be such a great game, with an awesome community, much respect for the lore and the books etc. - Ever since the F2P conversion, there is more and more focus on the store.- Just came back after a long break (have played since launch, but took long breaks), and I can't try any of the new content as I have to unlock the zones and their quests. So either have to sub, buy TP or do insane grinds. - Even if I was remotely interested in either of that, the fact that there are still SO many bugs keeps me from doing so. Within 10 minutes, I saw such incredibly horrible rubberbanding on my warsteed (which was something people complained about when this system came OUT in 2012), that I don't wanna see more.- Game feels empty now, hardly saw any players, my formerly big and active guild is deserted now- Whatever you wanna do, you are always reminded of the store, and there will be always something blocking you unless you sub or buy TP (or grind)I am saddened by what the game has become. It was so immersive, had such a great community (especially on Laurelin-RP), but now feels empty and abandoned, and for a returning player, there is hardly any motivation to stick around and come back because everything is locked unless you pay. So this ""F2P"" feels more like an extended trial. I have no issues with F2P, many games do it so much better though.This is just a shadow of its former glory, and the few minutes I just spent after my last hiatus gave me no reason at all to ever come back.

												One of the oldest and best MMOs out there. If you love stories in games this is a good choice. It has 100s of hours of stuff to do. The recent server consolidation means the worlds feel much busier and server choice isn't as important as it used to be. The game also has one of the nicest communities I've seen in any game. The free to play model is a bit unusual, it's not exploitative in any way but I'd recommend VIP for at least a month.Now on the bad side: the graphics are a bit dated now but the landscapes can still be stunning. Combat animations are slow, which makes combat feel a bit sluggish. The game is also far too easy when levelling up, but this is fixed at higher levels.Overall I'd highly recommend it.			"

												Excellent graphics, scenery, cosmetics. Unbeatable storyline (LOTR). Endless content to keep you busy, from easy solo missions to big dragon raids, and Isengard dungeons. See places from the main story, or places you rarely ever hear of. Currently this game stretches from The Shire, thru Moria and the Misty Mountains, all the way to Isengard and beyond! Very polished and easy to play. Totally worth giving this one a try if your a LOTR fan. 9/10Review about starter packs:This game is truely amazing. I've played it for years. The only problem with this specific pack is that it doesn't even provide you with VIP status for 30 days. That is extra on top of this initial cost. I would only recommend this starter pack to people who really like to collect in their MMOs. Otherwise, just play for free until your ready for VIP.			"

												Considerations of this game from most important to least:-It's free to play (truly) -it remains about as faithful to true Lord of the Rings lore as any game has ever done so far-bonuses that are available to players who pay premium can be acquired by free-to-play players by doing a nominal amount of grinding (and if you want to get the expansions for free, you can grind a hell of a lot and still manage to get those as well) -game is entirely playable as a single player if you so desire (offering power ups at key story points if you don't have a group)-a very friendly community of players that is extremely helpfulHonestly, the only downside that I see to this game is that once you reach roughly level 30 (which does not take a ton of time - I reached level 20 after a few days of playing) things start to take a lot more time.  This is because a lot of the features in the game, such as fast-travel, mile-stone bindpoints (teleportation points), and upgraded mounts aren't available immediately to free-to-play players.  That is not to say that mounts are entirely unavailable to free-to-play players however, a mount is available to any character at roughly level 20.  Obviously it is necessary for the company to provide services that must be paid for in order to keep the game running, and considering the fact that an entirely new player could go into the game and immediately start playing what would be roughly 70% of the game content without spending a penny; that is a pretty good deal.  Not to mention that, as i said previously, if you grind 'turbine points' in game enough, you can collect enough to pay for all of the expansions - granted it would take a long time, but it is certainly possible.All in all, i would rate this game 9/10.  The point loss is purely because there are still a few extremely minor inaccuracies in the game that are noticeable to Lord of the Rings fans who are extremely knowledgeable to the lore.			"

												This is probably one of my favorite things to review...as you can tell by my hours..198.8 hours total, BUT I have 64.9 Hours just in two weeks, thats how addicting this game can be, that is with no sitting around, no afking or etc..it's a very fun game..But with the fanboying aside lets get to what you guys came for and give my Pros and ConsPros:Great Community (very helpful no matter what server your on)Beautiful AtmosphereNever breaks the tolkien universe feeling (which means always feels like your really in the Tolkien Universe) Great Variety in Weapons, skill sets, and armors, you will rarely find someone with the same kind of armor and or weapon as you or even close for that matterVery Unique in its own way, personally I love the cosmetic system, it adds this feeling to kind of drive you into the universe more so you can kinda be more in character, feel like your there (Cosmetic system, allows you to equip armor and weapons that you would personally think suits you, so for man it would be ranger armor and etc, dwarves heavy dwarven armor and etc...Personally it a great feature as it gives a better feeling to it) Teams still working on the game, making it much better with every update!Added a new race called Beorning with the class (their like druids, for WoW players you turn into a bear pretty much lol) But also hard to get on free to play..but possible!Has own servers for Roleplayers (so if your into kind of the Tolkien universe for LOTR that you know a lot about roleplaying and stuff give it a shot, people are very forgiving on Laurelin (the EU and US RP server) along with other servers as well.Has some wonderfu crafting mechanics that could very much benefit you if you are in a Kinship (kind of like a clan) you can help each other have the gear you need to FIGHT For middle earth!Cons:Sadly, helps the VIP a lot, with all expansions and etc unlockedF2P's have to ""farm"" all their points in order to levelF2P's have a huge grindSometimes you could be looked down upon from being a f2p by VIP's (more my personal experience but still, something to be careful about)Time Consuming farming (not too much of a complaint as that's how its suppose to be XD)Graphics for character are out of date (expected of course from 2009)Some areas can be depressing yes, but that DOESN'T mean its still not beautiful, you could be taken away by the beautiful areas around Angmar, or the huge mountains in Moria or just in the Misty Mountains great places to go (harder to get to if your F2P, trust me..I farmed the points, tough but worth it) These are of course my personal Pros and Cons, as you would expect, but most of them were based off of other people's reactions to the game and stuff like that, so it is not just me spewing a bunch of stuff out for someone to read :P I hoped you loved the review, and trust me I'd gladly give it a 10/10 course it has its flaws but it is still beautiful, fun, and interesting.And always remember....Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu! (which means...Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!) Sorry i'm a dwarf Junkie myself! :P I love dwarves and their history in the Tolkien universe.			"

												LOTRO is an excellent ""visualization"" of J. R. R. Tolkien's Trillogy - The Lord of the Rings. It is based solely on the books, and therefor differs from the Peter Jackson movie version -- which took significant liberties with the books. There is no ""Dwarf Tossing"" or ""Shield surfing"" in Helms Deep to just pick two glaring examples.The world of Middle Earth is huge, and contains many ""easter eggs"" from both the books and Tolkien's life. At present, November 2014, LOTRO has no ""end-game"" - it has only just begun the third book of the Trillogy, and will probably not reach the Black Gate until 2016. But while we hope Sam and Frodo reach Mount Doom on their own, there is much to do to clean-up Sauron's deviltry in the rest of the world.There is much to do in Middle Earth. 29 Servers provide a wealth of opportunity for players to create different characters for each of the four races - Dwarf, Elf, Man and Hobbit; and in each of the classes - Hunter, Champion, Guardian, Captain, Minstrel, Lore-master, and with the appropriate expansions, Rune-keeper, Warden and the just introduced Beorning. Players can create characters on each server!The Fan-run website: https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Main_Page provides a wealth of information about the game, from items and quests, to background lore.

												People complain a great deal about The Lord of the Rings Online in how it isn't immersive with its dialogue, or lack thereof, and other rather old MMO elements. So World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies were not great games either that followed this game doctrine?LOTRO is an exceptional example of an MMO for fans of the books, movies, and newcomers alike. The player-base is smaller than others, but this leads to a community that is more friendly, and charitable. That is one of the best parts about this game also: the community. In LOTRO, you won't find many toxic people (At least, on my server, Crickhollow). I bought this game the day it came out, and have had the luxury to see how it evolved since then, and the toxocity has not increased much (but, this game is free, so expect some bad apples).The MMO is also very relaxed, meaning that if you are used to super-competitive MMOs, and want to retreat from it all, LOTRO is a great game to relieve that built-up tension. The crafting system is also elaborate, and fun to do as well, with crafters even giving some of their finished work for free to players in need.The attention to detail involving the world of Middle-Earth is very accurate to how J.R.R. Tolkien wrote it (not how Peter Jackson tried to erase it in the movies), with famous characters, places, and events all happening that fans read about. I can compare this to Star Wars Galaxies (RIP), where you are sort of ""Along for the ride"" with the major plot.Overall, LOTRO is one of the best MMOs out there right now, if you don't want to remove your scarf and thick-framed glasses and play WoW (tried WoW, got bored of it the same way the people who gave this MMO negative reviews did). So many elements encompass the greatness of this rather obscure, and in some ways forgotten, MMO. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes MMOs, give it a shot, it is free after all!			"

												It's a game rich in story, the enivronment brings you in an total other era. It's high detailed. The things i like the most is the way of crafting, the homesteads (personal housing in an neighbourhood, where other players live in) and the way the shops are (you can shop like you do irl). Only con of this game is that to play it properly and have nice stuff, you will need to buy Turbine Points and those are quite expensive. Other than that its a nice MMO, with nice content :) If you need crafted stuff, feel free to ask me :D			"

												10 years and still fascinating millions of people world wide. Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today. Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined.			"

												If you like MMOs and you like LOTR then this is literally the best thing ever. (If you just like MMOs and don't really know much about LOTR then it still might be the best thing ever.) It isn't pay to win IF you are committed because by completing challenges (called deeds) you can earn points (Turbine Points) that you can then use to purchase the expansions or quest packs. However, if you are impatient like me then you might end up spending 50 bucks, which isn't really a bad idea if you like the game because it's supporting the devs!The scenery and places you can go are amazing. The game is practically a 1:1 scale of Middle Earth (don't quote me because I know this isn't true...). The gameplay doesn't really get monotonous like most MMOs, because the quests are very fun to do (especially in a group). JUST DON'T DO QUESTS IN THE SHIRE BECAUSE ALL THEY ARE IS GETTING SENT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN 2 HOBBITS THAT ARE LITERALLY 100 FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. The community is probably one of the friendliest I have ever had to pleasure to play with. Most of the players are a really good sport and are very helpful if you ask questions. If you are into RPing then this is one of the best places to go because the RP system is pretty kickass and the RPers know what they're doing.My review may not be the best, but hopefully with this one and some of the others, we get a new member to the LOTRO family!(and remember that it IS free to play so you can always try it! If you don't like it just delete it!)			"

												I've been playing this game since it became free to play, and I feel like every update since has been making the game better and better for me. I'm a big fan of Middle Earth and getting to see bits of lore that you don't experience in film (like Tom Bombadil for instance) really helps bring this world to life. I love the emphasis on kindness and friendship, and following the epic storyline makes you feel like you are a part of this world and that you all matter.As far as gameplay goes, I feel it is fairly standard in terms of controls - easy to get the hang of once you learn the differences from other games. Some people may not agree with the locking out of certain features in-game for free players, but these are easily unlockable with enough effort and determination without having to spend a penny. I personally did end up subscribing for a few months to unlock a lot of content. Since then, I am always considered a premium account and I keept a lot of the features that were unlocked with subscribing.This is my favorite free to play MMORPG out there at this time.			"

												Yes the game is old, but so are the books that the game's based on.The lore is there, and the areas are there, almost as good as the books. The main story (epic quests) has you following the fellowship (or running parallel), working in the background to fight the rising evil, aiding the good cause.You will quest around landmarks from the books like Weathertop, and you can find little touches like the petrified trolls in the Trollshaws.It may not have the best graphics (but certainly not the worst either). I grew up with a Commodore 64, so gameplay is more important than graphics for me, but things like the use of lighting to set the mood works really well for me, as does the weather.It is F2P, but that doesn't mean it doesn't cost a thing to have all content available.The good thing is that the store credits (Turbine Points) can be earned in-game, and that you can buy almost everything that is included in the VIP status with it. The only notable exception is 'fast travel' which you really will miss if you haven't got it, as the game is BIG.The bad thing is that earning TP quickly is a grind, although it can be sped up if you have some high level characters.Combat is old school skill clicking, which you either like or dislike.Crafting is extremely simple; you have the mats, you make the item. (with a % to critical success). I would have liked something more involving, like EverQuest II's crafting perhaps.Crafting does require interaction with other players, as you won't be able to get all materials you need yourself for the crafts you choose.If you are into PvP, then this game is not for you.There is some sort of PvP (PvMP), where some players have a character on the evil side, and some players play their regular 'good' side characters. There's one map for it, and the PvP crowd varies wildly per server.If you are into endgame raids, then this game is not for you. There is no (new) endgame content. There are scaling instances, which are essentially the same from L20 upwards, except with harder enemies.There is some new endgame content in the making though.Most of the population is helpful and mature, but, as this is an online game, there are some trolls and trouble makers on the chat channels. Although vocal, this is a very small group compared to the helpful people.Oh, one major bad thing: The download is HUGE, and the update process is extremely slow compared to other MMOs.Overall: If you like the Lord of the Rings lore (whether from the books or the movies) and like to explore Middle Earth yourself, then this is the only game to play.It's free up to around L30, after which you need to unlock quests for other areas.Whether you pay for it with money or with time is up to you, which is a fair deal IMO.And remember, the journey is more important than the goal.

												LOTRO is shaping up to be the best f2p MMO of 2017, with upcoming model/animation updates in the summer.The game is nearly 10 years old and far from dead, in fact it just found itself in the hands of a much better pubisher, Standing Stones. Community is slowly building and new content is still being released! The world is second to probably WoW in terms of exploration / lore, and gameplay is typical MMO/grindy. Think 2007. We all know the lore of Tolkien is amazing, and the game pays really good attention to the books, so I've heard.Basically, if you've tried more modern MMOs and they aren't your thing you might be looking for more immersion or depth, and LOTRO can give you that (for free)! You can purchase expansions for the game, which by the time you get to I'm assuming you'd be willing to pay for them. Get them on sale when you can.			"

												Pretty good overall and captures the atmosphere of JRR Tolkein's world nicely.Used to play a long time ago and have come back to it on steam now; a lot of things have changed but it's still fun. The skill system and crafting is complex and satisfyingly engaging.An annoyance factor about it is the ever-present Pay-to-play aspect, very soon into the game you will be chasing turbine points to buy basic things like extra inventory space and extra character slots, increasing your gold cap etc etc as what you are given just isn't enough to be able to play properly. The Community is very friendly (certainly on the server I am on) and there is always groups happening for both quests/instances and some lovely rp-events.By todays standards the game engine & graphics could be considered *outdated* but I think some areas are  beautiful if you max out the graphics options. Recommended, especially if you are a fan of the books+films :)			"

												It is a great game if your a fan of roleplaying. You don't have to be heavy into the whole mmorpg to get your enjoyment if your a fan of The LOTRs in the first place. Visit all the places from the movie's and books you always wanted to. See the world come to life with npcs filling the world and going about life. Great pick up considering its free. Mind you there are purchasable abilities and add ons but you can get most through playing the game and putting in time.			"

												First of all I want to point out that im a f2p user on this MMO, and I have by-passed many restrictions without a problem. It's an absoloutely amazing game, especially if you're a big fan of the LOTR triology, as you can easily relate to many parts in this game, story, characters etc etc...The game truly has great content, and a huge world to explore as you level up to capin at 105 :) ...Graphics are quite decent , especially on high specs, and runs quite well on alot of systems.. no matter if you have an average pc/laptop. Communities are great (from experience : primarily depending on the server activity) for the most part there is always someone there to give you a helping hand when you start off. Apart from the exciting and adventurous story and quests, LOTRO also brings PVP, which is quite competitive involving the Freeps( the good side/the classes of middle earth) vs Creeps( the monsters/evil side). Both are playable and both are great, its all up to a matter of preference which side you would like to PVP as. I wont review that in detail, but there's plenty of playthroughs and info on pvp online.Im currently a lvl 105 Beorning [ with a couple of alts of each class, all lowbies :)  ] ( totally F2p ) in the server of Evernight - Name : Hranvir, and have not spent a single cent getting her (bar VIP for 1 month, which I decided upon in the end), with expansions, and quest packs leading up as far as the end game Far Anórien quest pack (excluding the odd few quest packs/ and the helms deep expansion, which are not too necessary in reaching end game) , as well as gold cap, Auction house slots,beorning class w/ character slot , you name it. All unlocked by doing the deeds, quests etc to unlock ( LOTRO points/the in-game store currency - above the traditional gold/silver/bronze) All through arming and also using different alt characters to repeat... making hundreds each run (approximately around 400+) within 2-3 hours.It just shows that if you're a F2P even for the start, how far and how much you can achieve without paying anything, just with some time,patience and dedication, which will pay off in the end :) . Its up to you if you want to pay for the  game expansions/quest packs, especially if you feel you do not have the time at hand to farm them all out. (even going VIP for 1 month will unlock many permanent restrictions on your account (characters which you log on while VIP is up will gain benefits), aswell as giving you some TP & access to PVP as a freep, and access to all creep classes... only for the price of €13) I have done it for one month & its definitely worth it imho! Overall, if you loved the LOTR story/books/movies, and are a huge fan of MMO's ,you like open world action, the freedom to do/go as you wish, meet many new friends, and encounter some great adventures... this is the game for you! :) I personally love this game and once you get started, its quite tricky to let go :) I felt is was just really exciting, and is a great experience you might not want to miss out on :) I would certainly recommend this to anyone and you should download and give it a go right away! If you would like to have a deeper look into the game/gameplay/action and so forth, Youtube is simply the way, as it will show you through gameplay, the races/classes/mounts/ etc etc. so do check that out! LOTRO is definitely a great MMO, and one you will certainly get to grips with and enjoy! :)*This review is based from personal experiences, so to really see if it is applicable to your enjoyment, give it a go! :)  In my opinion, it is one of the best mmo games out there, and its free! *			"

												This game was my very first MMO, started playing in 2013 (I have way more time in the game, downloaded LOTRO via Steam recently) and its a really good game. Follows the actual LOTR fairly well. Players are usually fairly helpful, so it has a good atmosphere. A plus is being able to play for free if you wanted (VIP is worth it, but its possible to grind).EDIT: The last couple of updates has made it feel almost like a chore to get the really nice max level (Level 105) gear. T2 raids are the fasest way to get it done but Teir 2 requires a really big amount of morale to even survive the raid (not to mention groups usually require a certain amount). Essence armour was fun when it was first released with Gonder but in my opinion the morale levels and essence gears are getting way out of hand. I still enjoy and recommend this game, though. You wont have to worry about essence armour until you are a higher level anyways.10/10 A great MMO			"

												Wish I could say yes and no. It can be a fun game if you are into Tolkien lore. There is a TON of stuff to do in this game. But there is a lot of bugs and glitches even after this many years. It is SUPER confusing trying to figure out where to go versus which quest pack you need to buy and so forth. If you are a subscriber which makes everything available to you except expansions it is a little smoother. But as a f2p it can be very confusing. The graphics are getting dated but with everything on max setting I still found some areas to be quite beautiful. The prices on the expansions are quite expensive for such an old game. Its not a game where you can just hop into here and there. It is fun if you immerse yourself into the world though. I refused to pay another 40-60 bucks for an expansion that seems like the rest of Riders of Rohan so I cant comment on Helms Deep or any changes that came with it.			"

I haven't and wouldnt spend money on those. On top of that, the community is helpful and knowledgeable and willing to share tha knowledge.

												The game is B2P, and free to try.You can try f2p to 105, but you can not do majority of weekly dungeons, and locked trait make your character is so week, and almost solo endgame quests(in fact, need to buy too), and farm TP to open all contents will be a yearly work.The game is nicely balanced, to who pay, and let free players try. I suggest you give up your wish of free playing the game, just consider it as SWTOR, a B2P/FTT game. "

												Although this game seems outdated and there are a few problems with it, I love it.Some of the strong points of the game include:  Story and lore - there is a ton of story and lore packed into this game, which is awesome if you're a Tolkien fan  Music - the music is top-notch for the most part and really fits the world well  PvE content - there is always something to do, whether it's following a quest chain to level up you or your epic weapon, following the main storyline, fighting in a skirmish, decortaing your personal or kin house, or participating in one of the many festivals  Character housing - something WoW has yet to implement...Some of the weak points of the game are:  Rewards - Turbine has a problem with giving away proper rewards in their games. It happens in their D&D game as well. you can run through a long Instance for 20 minutes and get a bit of skirmish marks, or you can do a quick skirmish and get the same number of skirmish marks. And the daily gifts are usually something you don't need or want  PvP is lacking - I'm not very much into PvP, but if you are, this probably isn't the game for you. The PvP (in LoTRO, PvMP) system seems stale and boring. It is cool to be able to fight on the monster side, though  Graphics are outdated - models and animations need to be updated, though there are many times the graphics are quite beautiful. I appreciate that the graphics are less cartoony than other MMO's, but an update would help a lotMany people complain about it now being F2P, but it doesn't bother me, I just love the LoTR world and love being part of it. This game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I definitely recommend it for a shade of Earl Grey.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off since release, I still have the original physical copy even though that is now pretty useless. I've really struggled making headway. I play for a while, stop, comeback moths or even years later and start again. The one thing I have to say about this game is props to the devs. I know Turbine got a lot of criticism for going F2P and perhaps rightly so, but to still be releasing content after nearly 10 years is incredible in a time where if games aren't commercially successful instantly they are dead within a year. I really hope they continue until endgame in Mordor.			"

												This game is fun and addictive as well as free.The world is open and explorable from the moment that you finish the very helpful tutorial. The world is beautifully rendered and the art style is reminiscnt of the films. The story is also captivating as you help Gandalf and the felowship. The iconic landmarks such as Isengard, Minas Tirith and Gondor are fully Explorable and the game is completley free. No nescascary subscription, no mandatory payments only complete freedom of choice. The shop allows you to buy level boosts and other items (Weapons, Furniture, Steeds, Premium stuff, etc.) through their ingame currency, Turbine Points, and they can be earned by doing deeds. The completley free players can earn premium currency by farming and thus stay completley Free to play.8.5/10-Stefan			"

												I used to love this game. In fact, it was my favorite MMO. I loved the Legendary Items, loved the raids, loved the PVP, loved the crafting, and most importantly, loved the world and story. At some point along the way, Turbine suffered a few hits to their staff. Many developers were gone as a result. This was awful for the game. For some reason, they decided to take away group content and focus on ""Big Battles"" which some would argue that it is still group content, but it is extremely lacking. I have played this game since Shadows of Angmar beta and loved it, but without the group content and developers being let go, I have a feeling this game is dying. I hope that isn't the case. Do I recommend the game? Well, it depends. I loved what it was and hate what it's becoming. Hopefully it will get better as time goes on. Time will tell.			"

For a lot of things you can do there are achievements, which give you points for which you can unlock paid expansions.This means that with enough effort you can unlock most of the game's content free of charge!The game is nothing spectaluar to look at, but it can be very well designed in many places, and after all looks isn't a mmos saving grace.The major issue is that the game suffers from low population on many servers. So I STRONGLY suggest that you take the time to look though the date online and find a server which has HIGH population and the right TIME ZONE for you.I do hope this helps.			"

												Y'know, usually when I play an MMO it throws me into a world I have no clue about. The only reason I really even play this game is to see all the iconic sights that were in the books and the movies. Hot damn is it cool! What I think is really neat is that you can go to just about every location that Frodo and Sam went on their jouney to Mordor. The only real problem I have with this game is those damn turbine points for cool stuff and what not. So i give this game a solid 9/10. Trust me the turbine points really suck because you barely get any, I think the most I have is like 25. However if you love LOTR and if your a huge fan of the books and the movies, or you just like playing free MMOs then I would totally consider playing this game.			"

The best weapons in the game are crafted, not bought. It also has fantastic graphics for the low system requirments it has. The story is great. After the helms deep exansion it took away the traditional trait system of the game and made a few classes more powerful than they should. All in all this game is great and because it is free so there is no penalty for trying. The community is very open to newcommers even if most of the people have been playing for ever like me (Since 2007 open beta). I would ighly recomend this game to anyone who like traditional MMORPG games.			"

Recommended if you are willing to spend money after you have advanced a little in the game (you have seen nothing when you have reached level 20, so much left to do!)cons:Very demanding in terms of in-game avaiability, you have to purchase off restrictions, like gold cap.You can't proceed further than level 30 if you are not interested in grinding repeated in-game activites.Not much player activity in old game areas, whereas at the level cap there is tons of player activity(depending on which server)pros: Beautiful and large sceneries, you can travel from thorin's hall to east-Rohan!You have to dedicate your time if you want to reach the best of the best, making it kind of adictive.Many recreations from Tolkiens books!Possible to earn enough in-game currency to unlock anything you want which would cost money, if you have time.8/10			"

												This is a truly amazing game for Tolkien fans and RPG gamers alike. The game give you access to many starting areas including the beloved Shire and Bree-lands as seen in the movies and books. And give you the opportunity to play completely f2p by earning Turbine points in game to unlock other areas in Middle Earth. Additionally the Epic (main) questline is completely f2p and you can run through the entire game at no cost, completely worth it. If you want to see the beoved characters true to the books, experience some authentic tolkien lore, play classes with incredible skills and characteristics, become a member of the highest crafting guilds and test your skills in fellowships with people from all over the world I completely reccomend this game :D			"

												If you are going to play it, purely F2P, you can, by grinding TP ( Turbine Points ).You can basically get the whole game that way, at the cost of several months of straight-up farming/grinding.I highly recommend that you play with other people, whether you know them or not. Playing solo is boring, as it is slow. Some classes can actually make soloing easy. However, playing solo is entirely viable. At the moment, any class can mow down tons of enemies on their own. At levels 1-90, you will hardly find anyone to play with, there isn't enough people to do stuff with, or they don't have the content, as they have to buy it.There's also a bunch of classes with their own mechanics, the most basic of them being the Guardian.If you like LOTR lore, this is for you, however, don't expect amazing end-game stuff, and don't expect a top-of-the-line story.Some may enjoy the story of LOTRO, as it ties you with the main characters from LOTR, but some may also be bored with the main stuff, rather quickly.The PVP is...meh. There isn't any structured PVP so it's all in a region called the Ettenmoors. The balance is for PVP has always been bad/awful, as there is always something OP.The community is fairly helpful compared to many other games, but there is always an occasionally jerk/idiot/whatever.If you come expecting amazing, you'll kinda feel let down. But it's good enough to say the least.                                                                 Try the game, see if you like it. It's free.			"

People really like to help, if you get lost at questlines or need something etc... It really is the ultimate MMO. I've played it many years back, then tried some others games, but I keep coming back to play this, especially now when it's on Steam , I decided to start it again. The game just never gets boring. The classes, the content, the community.... It's just remarkable			"

												You can play your own instruments... Upload some fan made music creations and listen to Crazy Train on a lute!But on a serious note:Gameplay 7/10 - Combat is dull but overall not terribleGraphics 8/10 - Some areas are very beautiful, and some look quite poorCommunity 10/10 - The kindest bunch of players i've ever met on an MMO (On an RP realm)Is it Pay-To-Win? I wouldn't say so but you won't get very far without at least 1 purchase... It's 'Pay and you can speed everything up' (Levelling Boosts etc) however from what i can see there is NO way to purchase in game gold, which is good, and no way to purchase game changing gear.However i would recommend purchasing VIP at least once, or purchase anything. If you are planning on playing this game 100% free without buying anything ever, you are going to have a bad time. Gold cap is 2G and you remove it by making a purchase.Highly Recommended, but don't expect a free rideTime_For_Tea "

Since combining servers it's really busy online too and there are always people around town game with. Sure some of the expansions aren't amazing, but compared to some mmos I've played this tops them. The game really comes into its own from level 30 onwards imo but stick with it and you will enjoy the ride!			"

												Upon entering Rhovanion we were set upon by a new type of enemy. This enemy would forever change my perception of this game, as I stood there, awestruck by the brilliant mechanic before me I could not help but to contemplate the big questions. How was this not caught in testing? Worse yet, if it was caught in testing, who thought it was a good idea to let it through?  As my initial shock vanished, I came to the conclusion that something of unfathomable importance had just happened on this Tuesday morning in the Norcrofts. I must admit I had my doubts as to what was happening after having first acquired my Glider in the Wold, but this.. no this was something different entirely. In all of this I could not help but think to myself that ""This may have looked dumb, but in all honesty these graphics somehow still holds up fairly well."" This thought was destined to continue for some time but as I spotted some gathering nodes I swiftly went into a state of blinded greed where I threw all safety and precaution to the wind as I dashed over to mine it. Sadly, I was still in combat.At this moment I realised that the mighty fine enemy who previously had left me awestruck still remained in existance. Unfortunately it was nowhere to be seen. I decided to cut my losses and move forward with my quests. Close to ten minutes passed as I was flailing away at seemingly unendless quests including the slaughter of what I now presume to be a close to extinct race of Goblins (Seriously, if you don't like beating up Goblins, this game is not for you, theres millions of them and you WILL have to kill every. Single. One. Twice.), I was monitoring my minimap as usual. An old habbit from my days of playing Delta Force 2. Granted, there was no radar in Delta force 2, but still the point stands. I should say that there was a minimap in Delta Force 2, but this one only displayed the topography of the landscape and did  in no way alert you to the potential hazards of an enemy that had attacked you over ten minutes ago charging back at you from nowhere. This minimap however, does precisely that. I watched a red little marker on the minimap come charging at me at inhumane speed. Inhumane for two reasons. Primarily because it was not human. But the fact that this tiny goblin was also mounted seemed to also contribute to this partcular notion. The lil' guy attacked me. Once. Before charging off into the distance once more. At this point I could but embrace one simple fact: I will never get out of combat, that superbly speedy and obnoxiously sneaky Goblin will keep me in combat until one of us perish. Being stubborn, rather than lazy, I opted to simply track down the bugger. This, I might add, is where my true adventure began. For the next thirty minutes, I would walk back and forth in the middle of Norcroft (For those of you who have never seen Norcrofts, its just a huge plains.), Every once in a while my good friend the mounted Goblin, whom I after the third time attacking me had been baptized George, would attack me to keep me in combat. All while dashing off into a different direction than which I was traveling towards before in an feeble attempt to catch him. Fed up with this little concept of a mounted enemy who apparently does not know how to stop, I opted for running to the edge of the map and await Georges return next to one of the many mountains that encircle the plains. As George had a tendency of walking by roughly every ten minutes I decided to go grab myself a drink. Not that it is relevant for the review, but I should probably inform you that it was a cup of Tea, Lemon green tea. Highly recommended.Upon returning I was, to my dismay, at about 3% hp with a Norcroft Field-bear happily chipping away at my health. However this was not all! Looking at my minimap I fondly observed how George was, indeed, nearby. The poor little fellow had got himself lodged into the mountainrange on the side of the map and tried incredibly hard to get himself dislodged. This process, apparently, took around ten minutes, then he would charge off and slap someone, most recently: me, in the face before dashing off and getting himself stuck on the other side of the map. It was with resounding joy I found myself dying to that Field-bear and watching Dear old George finally reset and return to his appropriate location in the fields where he belongs and will graze away peacefully until he runs into another player who will undoubtedly rejoice in the idea of never having to leave combat ever again.Unfortunately however, the gliding characteristics of the mounts in Rhovannion prohibits me from ever moving past the area due to sheer amusement, but other than that..10/10!

												 Before the Rider's of Rohan expansion, especially around the time of Mines of Moria expansion, this was easily the best MMO on the market. This was a fantastic game with great visuals, story, and the best community in any online game I've ever associated myself with, but it has been turned awry, presumably by the heads at Warner Bro's Interactive. The levelling experience from 1-75 should be as fun as ever, but thanks to horribly uneccesary class changes, among other things, the experience is desecrated. Thankfully, newcomers should still be able to get some enjoyment out of this marred product, though returning veterans will undoubtedly be dissapointed. (seriously the Helm's Deep battles are awful, and the mounted combat is even worse) "

												I started playing LOTRO just a few weeks after it launched from Beta to full. I have to admit that I personally enjoyed the game a bit more before it switched over to Free to Play.  I didn't mind paying a subscription fee for all the hours I spent wandering through the lands I had read about for years before the game came out.  I read The Lord of the Rings many years before the movies came out and many times over at that.  I also grew up playing D&D with my friends. My friend Bill's mother was dating a guy named Dean who had played D&D since the late 70's and was an expert Dungeon Master. It was just so great to have an adult DM that put weeks and months into planning. When one of our characters died Dean actually collected the character sheet and refused to return it, their were real consequences to dying. The reason I mention all this is to point out that when I play LOTRO I'm commited to using my imagination and enjoying the game as if the books had come alive. I do not play LOTRO from the perspective of a gamer who is trying to succeed at winning a computer game. I play LOTRO as if my character is participating in Tolkiens world for real. For years I roamed around Middle Earth. I made it a habit of doing some of the things my character would do in the game. If I drank ale in the game I would drink one at home. If I grew and smoked pipeweed in the Shire I would pack a bowl and smoke weed at home. I spent years playing LOTRO extremely high. I've read that the pipeweed grown in the Shire is just tobacco, but the movie portrays it having a euphoric affect and that made more sense to me.LOTRO is really very good game. It's not perfect but it's very good.  There has been a good deal of care and detail put into this game. If you play it from a gaming perspective and just go for winning and leveling up this game's detail and Tolkien's signature depth are lost on you. When I play this game it's as if I can see where I am in my memory of Tolkiens work. People who will play this game primarily to level up and if they havent read the books or understand the locations.			"

												This game manages to hold up to the test of time, being a good game for less powerful machines--and any fans of Tolkien will enjoy the attention to detail and lore. It's a good alternative if you only occasionally play games like WoW that require subscriptions, as it manages to scratch that MMORPG grinding fix.			"

												Awesome game, although playable without buying TP's it is optional.Plenty of guides and advice on gameplay and character building and also great variety of helpful players.Ingenious use of elements within the game such as the crafting professions though I would like to have the option to select which 3 skills I would like to work on (3 crafting skills selected individually).So far I have only seen Fishing as a hobby, I would like to see more hobbies made available early in the game to keep people more interested if they are tired of hacking and slashing and burning their fingers on the forges.If this allows me to edit this post, I'll update it as I think of other things :)this game is getting a 4/5 due to the fact that there are still things that can be added to the game that could make it a heck of a lot better :)			"

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about Lord of the Rings Online. Released in 2007, this game has captured my attention since it was first launched with the title Shadows of Angmar. One of the last true RPGs found within the MMO genre, the game captivates with its art and design that still manages to impress nearly a decade later. Despite drawbacks in population, ownership change at Turbine (purchased by Warner Bros in 2010), and the launch of A Free-2-Play model shortly after, LOTRO still has a magical draw about it that compels players to take up arms against the Dark Lord and trek across Middle-Earth. The game is worth the subscription cost, especially if purchased for 3 or more months in advance. If unable to afford the fee, there is a Free option with limitations; just about all of which can be unlocked in-game through the use of Turbine Points gained from completing various Deeds, both kill, quest and reputation. In general, the community is helpful- much of the time willing to assist a newcomer with answers to their many questions. Give the game a try, it is perfect for the hardcore quester, casual gamer, role-player and explorer; something for just about everyone.			"

												This game is my favorite MMORPG, if not, my all time favorite game. If you are a fan of LOTR, you will love this game. I found it while I was reading the books and the experience I had between reading and playing, I have never had such an amazing encounter with a game in my life. I have tried other MMO's and RPG's but I could never stick to the plot and get easily lost or bored. The game is beautiful, immersive, and easy to play. The community is wonderful and helpful. I played solidly for a year and stopped for a couple because life got in the way, but picked it back up this year, even with updates it's easy to get back into, especially for a casual gamer like me. It may be an old game but it's still got lots of life, they constantly update and expand, I could spend hours just wandering around middle earth. It's the only game I've actually spent real money on in game. I hope the game keeps getting updates well into the future and that it will be around for a long time from now.			"

It did take a while to get into it and to understand how to play properly but as soon as you get the hang of it it is awesome. 1 thing i don't like about it is your abilities seem quite slow. I have tried playing the game on every different graphics option possible to make sure it wasn't my system,but its not. when you click on an ability it takes a few seconds before it starts performing the action. Maybe i'm just used to the ""smoothness"" of WoW.			"

												This is definitely my favourite MMO that I have played to date. I have played it before getting Steam, so I have way more game time than it actually shows.This game is basically WOW, except less limited in the free to play. You can unlock everything in the game just in F2P, and there is no difference, except for a few perks, between a player who is F2P or not. There is one location that requires you to be VIP : a location for Player vs Monster Player fighting, but there is another location for that.The graphics are not disappointing, considering this game was initially released in 2009, but could use an upgrade to bring them to modern level.Speaking of updates, these are happening constantly, with bug fixes, but also new areas and locations, quests, and other content. Now for the quests. Well, to be completely honest with you, while the main epic quest is loads of fun, and actually had me engrossed in the story for quite some time, (It's really good !), the intro quest for the Elf start is.... lacking. Sure the beginning of it is, kind of awesome, in the middle it is just pure boredom. I had to spend several different day doing it, simply because I was bored with the walking - talking - walking - fetch item - walking quests. That would literally be nearly half of the quests in the tutorial, which takes an HOUR to complete. That being said, the end of the Elf tutorial picks up the pace once again, but - not really that great.Combat is absolutely fine, no issues with the abilities of any kind, Hunters' focus system is to be enjoyed with the balance. Different combinations of the abilities can be used to fight different monsters and also people. There is a PvP system - you can spar outside of major cities.The map is just spectacular. You can explore the entirety of Middle-Earth, with different regions corresponding to different skill levels so you always have something to do in the game.Overall - 8/10, really fun game, but a few of the quests are boring and repetitive, with a few bugs.

												A long-enduring ever-expansive homage to the alternative history that is Middle-Earth, that will absolutely bury you in its many miniature gameplay mechanics steadily accumulated and tweaked over its now 8-year-long course.  And while it my look like an overwhelming ammount of content to go through to a new player, the fact that this game is most proud of is, be you a level 1, 30, 50 or 100, there always seems plenty to do to feel rewarding, and a time well spent. Mechanically, its a by-the-numbers MMORPG game, very much entrenched into evey known trope of an early 21st century online game. But its style and gameplay hasn't yet been hampered by it, rather built around it. There's the standard 50+ skillbar of each fairly ballanced class which compliment eachother in a D&D kind of way (the tanky one, the squishy dps one, the buffer, the healer, the run-around-do-whatever-you-like one), working together without ironic subtext, since Tolkien basically wrote the book on them  (ugh...) inadvertently defined the classical dungeon crawling class system anyway. You TAB around the monsters presented and diminish their red bars. Alternatively, you gather materials, craft, randomly explore, complete numerous deeds, roleplay (it is, obviously, an extremely RP frienldy game), buy junk, sell junk, play through story mode, pvmp, do instances (scalable) do quests, do quests, do quests........The strongest parts are indeed the stories of numerouns inhabitants of the world, gated behind and propelled by your typical fetch and kill x quests. You could do a lot worse then reading through abysmal ammount of text walls of these chatty NPC's, and, if you're a fan of the setting, it will be a treat throughout the game. It is skippable of course, but this is a text heavy game.The FTP model can safely get you through 1-50 without much hassle, and the remaining content is gated behind purchases, but, by then, you'll already decide if its worth your money and time. As stated above, there's plenty to do in Eriador anyway, before venturing forth through Moria into Rhovanion, Rohan and Gondor.Tip: Get a mount as soon as you can, it's a massive game. And don't venture into Prancing Pony drunk. Oh yeah, grinding is, for the most part, optional.Highly reccomended.			"

												The game first came out in 2007. That should be kept in mind when you are judging the graphics. That aside, the game as a whole had held up fantasticly, each class is enjoyable to play, and the options for player houseing and professions bring a wonderful feel of immersion. The game is easier to play then it once was. But still challanging in later levels. The only downside I have run in to is an occtional micro-payment for quests, but this can be worked around with grinding. Over all the game is wonderful and has held up great over time.			"

												This is the last good MMORPG still alive on it's retail servers. These new have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boring story, PvE is boring too, bosses are not challenging like before, now is all about PvP. You should try this game, it's good, but maybe you will not get hooked as game have that old concept and veryyy veryyy long journey to end-game point.			"

												All the reviews below pretty much sum up how I feel about Lord of the Rings Online. I just felt the need to mention one feature that no one else mentioned, and that I feel makes LOTRO unique like no other MMO- the player music system. You can equip a musical instrument in game and, either by hitting keys or launching an ABC music file, play a song in game that people in the area can hear. Players have formed bands that give concerts, and on Landroval server there is even a yearly event called Weatherstock that attracts musicians from many servers for a day of music on Weathertop. Even if you don't roleplay, the abilty to perform and listen to player music in game adds so much to the experience.			"

												I have good memories of this game, the environment is massive and detailed (although don't expect next gen graphics, it's a 8 year old game). The main questline is fun, and although the side quests can be a little grind-y, they are easily done without much effort as you complete the main storylines.But the main reason that I loved this game is just exploring the world of the Lord of the Rings. Whether you want to go to Hobbiton or Bree, or into Lothlorien, Moria, or now even Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep there's so much to see and do. You can join a kinship and make new friends there and just immerse yourself in the world.			"

												So, I've been playing this game off and on for the last four and a half years, so I would say I've seen enough of it to write an hoenst review. What I love most about the game are the story and the immersion you feel when you're playing. You really feel like you're a part of the Middle Earth World, which to me means a lot (I'm obssessed with Lord of the Rings). The regions are varied enough that you feel like every place is different. Also, each class has its own unique characteristics that set it apart from the other classes; most people have multiple characters on multiple servors because they want to capitalize on all the different class options and play styles.The main problems I have with LOTRO are that the combat is getting clunky, certain classes are way overpowered compared to others, and the questing in certain regions is getting a bit monotonous. The combat is generally the same the whole game, so it's important that you pick the class that goes with what you want in the game. It can just be very repetitive at times. Likewise, certain classes are way stronger than other classes. My hunter is so frail at level 89 compared to most other classes. So frail that it becomes difficult to get through basic solo quests. Finally, the quest are around the same thing over and over again. I know there can only be a finite number of quest ideas, but I would appreciate more diversity in questing. Overall, I find myself coming back to this game every couple of months, getting bored, and then coming back again in a cycle. I've done this for four years now, and I expect to d othe same for at least a couple more years. 8.5/10			"

												yeah i broke down after 70 hours of playing.. to finally buy the VIP Pass of the LOTRO.     - Cause there is only a certain point ya can efficiently level up .  But reallly there are 105 levels from what I am seeing..   Main suggestion to all new players who love the Epic Novels..     DO NOT RUSH the game by Powerleveling.. enjoy the ride.   Really you get alot more out of it if you just be a part of the story and  enjoy and absorb the LORE of the epic quests... take your time and enjoy this love of work.			"

												An excellent game, yes it may be 10 years old or so but it can still hold its head high amongst the newer MMO games out there. FTP with its ingame shop but points spent in the shop can be bought for cash or grinding ingame so cash will speed things up but is not the be all and end all PTW that some games are. As it is free to play you can not go wrong with giving it a try, you never know, you may just like it.			"

												If you're looking for a world where the soul is in the heartfelt community rather than flash-in-the-pan, technological gimmicks, look no further than this version of Middle Earth. Come, explore, make some friends, relax, and be fulfilled by the best kind of 'leveling' & 'progress', the kind that involves no stats nor scores. The kind that involves spending the whole day fishing and talking with friends, perhaps serenading a random audience in the town square with a song that you literally wrote, or having a snowball fight in Winter, or even racing through a corn maze in Fall. Sure you could get to max level if you want, but this is a world where the person with the best attitude wins, not the one with the highest level, thanks to the best MMORPG community I've ever seen.

												If you're a RolePlayer this is almost a must-try MMORPG. LotRo has one of the best RP communities on it's Landroval server that you will find pretty much anywhere. Fairly standard combat for an MMO, but the Rohan expansion adds quite a bit of flare to that. You won't find better in terms of lore, immersion, and a die hard tolkein fan base.The game's one downfall in my opinion is the free-to-play model that is currently in place. You will be spending a lot of time re-rolling characters and running the same zones over and over to earn enough points to unlock the next quest packs, expansions, bag upgrades etc.. etc.. My recommendation is to subscribe and get everything for a monthly fee, minus the expansions that will have to be purchased of course. "

												I love this game, why? You can play on your own tempo and there is alot to do in the world, even in the Free edition.The expansions are realy great but I should start with the free edition to see if you like the gameplay, ofcource like any other MMO RPG the higher your level the more features.  If you do like it, and I know you will, the LOTR or Hobit or J.R. Tolkiën fans will for sure just for the story line alone, although if you do not know anything about the story, you will learn it gamewise!Like it? Wanna play more and want full features of the game? Then start with buying the ""Steely Dawm Starter Pack"".And then it is up to you but I would go first fo the ""Triple Pack"" and after for the ""Helm's Deep"" Base or Premium edition. Both are identical except that tyhe premium edition offers better gear and more in-game Turbine points.I used to play WoW for a real long time, up to Catacalism, then I stopped for almost a year or so untill the latest expansion came out and I got 30 days free play. I played up to lev 85, which is the max cap, but what I dont like is that everything in WoW, or you must Raid alot and do alot of epic dungeons, cost to much and that raids or goups are not like they used o be.If you wanna Raid or run some Heroics then you should at least know what your role is and I hate people that think they know all and start bullying others and leave middle game.Find a Guild in LOTR and if you have a few friends that play, the fellowship playing style is just awsome!

												I tried this game years ago and only played the free areas. It was patronisingly easy and dull at the beginning but it got better as it went on. When I'd finished all the free areas and hit the currency cap, I moved on to a different game. I always remembered how much I enjoyed it though and recently I bought the expansion packs during a sale. It's much more enjoyable paying for access rather than grinding for Turbine Points. With the expansion areas unlocked, it's a lot easier to get TP too. After a couple of quest pack purchases, the whole game can be unlocked painlessly through regular play.			"

												Maybe im just getting too old and don't have the patience of old. Big fan of lotr, and mmos. Couldn't believe this game was free, i remember thinking ""wow how could i have missed this gem"" especially after reading the great reviews this game got. This game reminded me a bit of Warhammer Online which was an mmo i loved so much. The only reason this game has survived this long is because of lotr fans. There is a decent ""fanatic"" playerbase that won't let this game die and they need newbies to come along to feed and boost their ego. I dont mind that aspect, i was that player in Warhammer online. But what made me uninstall this game was the fact that you have to PAY to get ahead for everything... and i mean EVERYTHING. Every quest every notification you get is ""Go to the LOTRO store to unlock this"" or ""Go to the LOTRO store to make this faster"" its absurd how none of the reviews i read mentioned this. probably because i only focused on the good. I get how the devs need to make money but come on! at one point i thought ""well, im an adult with a job and its a free game... why not spend a little cash"" so i took a look at the lotro store and i was shocked! VIP for a year is like 200 dollars! if i want to buy a simple horse to get around 25 dollars! everything is so expensive and this game is sooooo old! i think the graphics on Zelda on the N64 looked 10x better! The quests consists of : talk to Sally Took, now talk to Barbara Took, now go back to Sally to tell her what Barbara said, now go back to Barbara to tell her of Sally's response.... And they're 10 minutes apart!!!  (without buying the 25 dollar horse) im sure this game will get better if i were to put more hours into it, but i can already tell i would have to spend a significant amount of money to compete, and to make it worthwhile. I like being rewarded for having no life and grind out levels/items... i don't like being rewarded for how much cash i have to spend.			"

												This game was decent from when it was released all the way into the Isengard expansion. Now the developers have left it and the game is mainly based on solo play. Along with that, it says Free to Play but unless you're willing to put about 100+$'s down on this game you won't see it to its end if that. There are many more Lotr games and MMO's that are better than this one so i wouldn't waste your time.			"

												To anyone looking for a new game to sap your life away, this is it!! It is by far the best hotkey mmo out there, and yes, i mean over WoW. Now before you get up in arms about it, listen to this. There is no fee at all to play. The entier game is F2P. There is  a catch though. the games irl for ingame currency is called turbine points (TP). In order to unlock quest packs to find leveled zones, as well as expantions, you need TP, lots. But what sets LOTRO appart, is that you can earn TP through everyday things! Ie kill 100 orcs in this area for 15TP, or find all the areas in this zone for 20TP and a cool mount, or eat 30 hotdogs at the anniversary celevration or many others. its F2P and pay for luxary, not pay to win. plus above all, you get to explore iconic locations of middle earth on your very own!! Rohan, Moria, Bree, The Shire, and even soon Gondor! Watch your fantasy come to life as you slowly create your own characer of the 4 races, and build your class to suit the way you fight! Join the Fellowship and aid them in various, lore correct inbetween movie/book tasks! interact with your favourite characters! Forge your own adventure throughout Middle Earth! Subscribe now!!!PS reaserch servers before choosing, some are super empty where some are teaming with players!			"

Turbine allows us to do deeds to get turbine points which is what you get to get quest packs, classes (Rune-Keeper, Warden, Weaver, Blackarrow, Warg, Defiler, and Warleader), some cool cosemetics, and much more! I highly recommend this game, it also has a great community and many servers to choose from.			"

												I like this franchise a lot, and I like this game too. It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe. Overall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!			"

												I've been too busy playing this game to take the time to recommend it! I'm not usually an MMO gamer, nor am I a fan of Tolkien, but Turbine did a fantastic job with this game -- I've been playing for a month and a half and I'm still enjoying it. Really looking forward to the Riders of Rohan expansion that will be released in September -- mounted combat, combat mounts you can advance, and lots of new turf to explore! If anyone wants to give it a go, let me know -- I'll help you level up and get started on the right foot.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online or (LORTO) is several years old at this point (2007) but it's probably still the best theme based MMO in the genre. The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game ""play speed"". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel3) The casual nature and pacing of this game. Everything about LOTRO is tailored toward a more mature type of MMO gamer, So much so before the last major exspansion Turbine just flatly said that there will not be creating any more raid or large group content since no one does it anyway.A lot of people may or may not agree with this review but I really tried to distill why the people who play this game play it. If you find yourself drifting in the see of MMOs out there and just want to log in and deliver some pies in the Shire or See the Long Dark of Moria this just may be the game for you.			"

												To properly appreciate this game, you need to invest a fair amount of time into. I would say the game itself is a fairly standard RPG, perhaps above average for a free to play and it doesn't bog you down in restricted VIP only areas. However, a big selling point for me was the fact it was LOTR and I got to explore all the places I wanted to visit from the films. This was FRIGGIN AWESOME. I admit, I spent the majority of this game playing with friends, so I cannot vouch for the solo experience but questing together was the most fun I had on an MMORPG.Throughout the game, you may be able to save up enough currency to never need to invest actual money into it, however I bought the mithril starter pack which gave me enough points to progress as far as I wanted. The first purchase you need to save for is buying a horse to actually be able to get around. This is relatively painless and involves completing a fair few early tasks to get the points. Apart from that advice, take your sword, your bow and your axe and go out and explore the world of MiddleEarth!			"

												I've been playing this game since the summer of 2012 (though only just recently through Steam), and it is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and most certainly one of my favorites. The world is so massive and fun to explore, all the quests are enjoyable and I actually want to do all the side quests, and the story quests are really engaging. At many points I find myself wanting to know what happens next. The lore of Middle-earth is very well represented, and the game feels very true to the source material, even though it does take liberties, as one would expect. The community is a good one, and you can almost always find somebody in-game to help you out. Even when you can't, for the fellowship quests you just have to gain a few more levels and it's definitely within reach. Of the nine classes I've played (all but the Lore-master) they're all unique and fun to play. The Hunter in particular is a good beginning class, since it has a wide range of ranged and melee skills, and the quick travel skills are lifesavers. I'm only at level 70 on my main character, and that's exactly the sort of pace this game requires: nice and easy. It's a game that really draws you in, and even when I'm not actually doing a quest or deed or other objective, I still love just going around and exploring the Middle-earth Turbine has created for their game. I cannot stress the beauty of the game enough. Each and every area is unique and beautiful. From the rural hills of The Shire, to the torch lit caverns of Moria, each new vista amazes. I can't wait to see where my adventures will take me next!Overall, not only is this a great MMO, it's just a great all-around game, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in the world of Middle-earth.

												A lovely MMORPG set in Tolkien LORE, which only sweetens the package. Better than most MMORPG in the market, shame that they couldn't put the voices and music from the movies (which resulted in painfully simillar music which annoys me because they might as well have written a proper original score). Other than that it's great, there's a lot to do from the usual MMO grinding to playing a lute.Honestly, I've had more fun in it than in Wow, probably because it's free and doesn't require the stupid subscriptions that freeze your account.

												I love this game, if it was not for this game, I would have never have been introduce to the world of MMORPG's. I guess it was also a bonus I was already a Lord of the Rings fan, and that added another platform to be able to enjoy the story even more. And hands up to Turbine they have done the story justice and that made me fall in love with it even more. If you are not sure you have the time or money for LOTRO, Free to play is amazing and their is plenty to do and keep you busy for many hours. One of the best free to plays out there right now I believe. I honestly believe you can not go wrong with this game, great community atmosphere, amazing story, lots of content and so much to do that you can lose your self whilst playing. Well hopefully see you in game, and happy hunting.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online or (LORTO) is several years old at this point (2007) but it's probably still the best theme based MMO in the genre. The character models are a bit date but the landscapes are gorgeous, the combat is at times slow and predictable, however, Turbine has made great strides in trying to improve the game ""play speed"". To really understand LOTRO you must understand the reason people play this MMO.1) The Story - Plain and simple people play this game for the lore surrounding it more than any other factor.2) The Community - The people who play this game are by far the most mature and helpful community of MMO players that I have ever seen. This has fallen away somewhat with the addition of a FTP model some years ago and the recent addition of a Global Chat Channel3) The casual nature and pacing of this game. Everything about LOTRO is tailored toward a more mature type of MMO gamer, So much so before the last major exspansion Turbine just flatly said that there will not be creating any more raid or large group content since no one does it anyway.A lot of people may or may not agree with this review but I really tried to distill why the people who play this game play it.

												This game is surprisingly good for a MMORPG, I was surprised. It is quite addicting and I can see why it did not become as big as WoW. At least new expansions are making this game better instead of worse.UPDATE: This game is one of the best F2P mmos of all time. It has stood the time and has been around as much as wow and still stand. Yes, it has a payshop which you need to go to get expansions and optional testing areas but it is definately worth it. Yes, there are paywalls. But it is sooo long and big of a game, its as big or not bigger than wow.Some might wonder why is it still going, well because the game hasnt been to Mordor yet, it is currently up to Gondor and the Halls of the Dead, you know... the trial of Aragon to get the undead on his side, yeah. That means the next xpac should be the Battle of Minas Tirth then maybe we could finally go to the gates of Mordor after and finally Mordor itself.It is amazing, i definately recommend it and I think you should play it. Been out longer and still way better than most F2P mmorpgs.			"

												Absolutely epic game! If you like The Lord of the Rings (and even if you don't), this game is just plainly amazing. It can seem a bit overwhelming at first and it takes a bit to get the hang of things, but once you get going, it's addictive to death. Something great about this game is that the free content is huge, unlike other free games that limit you to the point where it's no longer fun; and actualy, with a LOT of work, you can get enough in-game points to buy everything that is for sale. I haven't been so hooked up with a game in quite a while, definetely recommended!			"

So many things to do- up your reputation with this people, collect relics for that people... build a fellowship, buy a house, the Yule Festival... Fight with Aragorn, visit Legolas and Boromir in Rivendell... it's endless <3 I have a couple characters, but my lvl 29 guardian elf is my best so far... My only complaint is how many turbine points simple stuff costs... at least they're only extras. The best value would probs be to go premium and buy a couple currency packs but ain't nobody got time for that. xoxox Love you LOTRO <3			"

												Pros:-Fabulous people still do exist in this game. Sure, there's a rough people mixed in, but I've met a good many folks who are incredibly kind.-Lots of quests. Too many almost. Too much to do. Can't keep track of all of my quests. Help.-A fine F2P model. And being a VIP (a subscriber) is pretty great too. Either play style is great.-Great stories. You even get to assist the Fellowship at times.-As of this year, we'll be able to SIMPLY WALK INTO MORDOR.-If you love Tolkien's world of Middle Earth, then you'll never want to leave.Cons:-Optimization issues. Lag can be your biggest enemy in this game. Certain over-populated zones are sometimes horrible for certain players.Still a very good game, despite its age. Hop in, talk to some people, join a kin. Enjoy.			"

												I've been playing this game since the summer of 2012 (though only just recently through Steam), and it is easily one of the best games I've ever played, and most certainly one of my favorites. The world is so massive and fun to explore, all the quests are enjoyable and I actually want to do all the side quests, and the story quests are really engaging. At many points I find myself wanting to know what happens next. The lore of Middle-earth is very well represented, and the game feels very true to the source material, even though it does take liberties, as one would expect. The community is a good one, and you can almost always find somebody in-game to help you out. Even when you can't, for the fellowship quests you just have to gain a few more levels and it's definitely within reach. Of the nine classes I've played (all but the Lore-master) they're all unique and fun to play. The Hunter in particular is a good beginning class, since it has a wide range of ranged and melee skills, and the quick travel skills are lifesavers. I'm only at level 70 on my main character, and that's exactly the sort of pace this game requires: nice and easy. It's a game that really draws you in, and even when I'm not actually doing a quest or deed or other objective, I still love just going around and exploring the Middle-earth Turbine has created for their game. I cannot stress the beauty of the game enough. Each and every area is unique and beautiful. From the rural hills of The Shire, to the torch lit caverns of Moria, each new vista amazes. I can't wait to see where my adventures will take me next!Overall, not only is this a great MMO, it's just a great all-around game, and I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in the world of Middle-earth.

And hands up to Turbine they have done the story justice and that made me fall in love with it even more. If you are not sure you have the time or money for LOTRO, Free to play is amazing and their is plenty to do and keep you busy for many hours. One of the best free to plays out there right now I believe. I honestly believe you can not go wrong with this game, great community atmosphere, amazing story, lots of content and so much to do that you can lose your self whilst playing.

I'm not usually an MMO gamer, nor am I a fan of Tolkien, but Turbine did a fantastic job with this game -- I've been playing for a month and a half and I'm still enjoying it. Really looking forward to the Riders of Rohan expansion that will be released in September -- mounted combat, combat mounts you can advance, and lots of new turf to explore! If anyone wants to give it a go, let me know -- I'll help you level up and get started on the right foot.			"

												I like this franchise a lot, and I like this game too. It does open a lot if you pay to play mind you! I find that with this game once you get to Mines Of Moria thing's start to get a lot more interesting, for instance to enter the mines, they give you a Legendary weapon. Also, the areas in the expansion packs look very pretty, the Vanilla game does too, but the expansions even more so. I think the zones are very big as well, sometimes too big, but then again they are pretty acurate to the books. I think my favorate questing area has to be the Hobbit area as that place is the most cheerful and colourful too. For anyone thinking of playing this game, do yourself a favor and get a Subscription, even if it's only for one month, as it opens up four bags, and removes the gold cap, and gives you 500 Turbine Points to do as you please with, plus any character you make in that month will be able to learn to do their riding traits for free which will stay with that character even when you un-subscribe. Overall, if you read the books and liked them, you will propably love this game. If you only watched the movies, then this game may still appeal to you, but one thing to note this game is based on the books not the movies. A good effort by Turbine in my opinion and nice to see they didn't shut it down!			"

												Overall I love this game and would recommend it to anyone. What I like about this game is that there are a lot of things to do from customizing your character, weapons, clothing, housing all of it. There are lots of quest too some some of which are repeatable. You even get to pick a trade like woodworking or being a scholar just to name a few. You can join a kinship or start one of your own and help eachother out. You also get to interact with the original characters from Middle Earth like Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Frodo, and so many others. The one thing I think is a drawback is that you have to spend money to unlock most reigons in order to be able to do quest in them and there are some other items such as mounts and clothing that you need to buy with money as well. And there is a gold cap so you have to pay to expand that as well. So unless you have a job, or some deep pockets you can dig into and if you're not a giant passionionate fan for Lord of the Rings then this game is mostlikey not for you. But if the above is not an issue for you then I would totally say this is a great game for you. :)			"

												Note:I have played this game extensively on other clients, so I have a pretty good grasp of the game. LotRO is a fantastic game, but not always the best MMO. The game, while multiplayer and hosts a variety of features for guilds and group quests, is designed just as much for singleplayer. Many times it feels like you're all alone in this vast world. hunting monsters and finding resources. It's a fantastic game set in Middle Earth where you can enjoy yourself alone or with friends. I have many fond memories of fishing, questing, and exploring. The game is FTP, well, as much as any successful MMO can be. You can grind to get the in game currency you need to aquire DLC (all but the most expansive ones) and odds are you will be a bit willing to buy something if you enjoy it enough. You can even travel to many of these expansion areas just to see how they are, you just won't have access to the quests. I played for hundreds of hours without so much as spending a dime, it's fantastic. I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to live in Tolkien's epic fantasy, it doesn't get much better than this!

												One of the best games I've ever played.Graphics engine was made so long ago and yet still so smexy. The plot can be a bit dragging sometimes, but when you're with friends charging through dungeons, epic war, or just other stuff... yeah, it's like Borderlands on a Rampage or an actual fellowship bent on taking down all of Sauron's Army in a harder hack-and-slash madness combat style (note some of you may die given leveling is ridiculous)Not to mention, free in-game for killing hundreds of bad guys to unlock really cool stuff. What's not to love?The game's not ""pay-to-win"" and it has a very active community. PLUS!!!! Most of the lore and story are like shadow plots in the movies and don't ruin the Canon or Lore (unlike some other Disney-bought franchises I know....)Overall 8/10 now. 9//10 when made. 10/10 with friends.

												This game is interesting. One of the first MMOs I tried playing (I think Heroes of the Three Kingdoms predated my trying out LotRO), it was an... interesting experience at the time. The game has aged well enough. And the action is still there... in spurts. The biggest problem when I first started playing was that the lag would kill any movement around the time you arrived at Breeland. That seems to have been eased now (whether better computer, connection, or just more people farther on, I cannot say).Each of the classes are rich and detailed in their own right. And combat is fun.It also brings more lore to your attention, if your experience with the Lord of the Rings is more-or-less confined to the movies...			"

												Alright, alright... I guess it's time to make a review on this one. Before we begin, I have roughly another 4000 hours i've put into this game before it was released on steam. This is a tough one, when I was in the peak of my playing there wasn't a better MMO out there. Fun but challenging raids, lucrative fellowships, and unique 3-mans made end game play a world of fun. And the pvp? It was unbeliavable, both sides were always out and willing to trade some deaths for some kills. After RoI, however, things started to go down hill. Textures started being reused, quests turned mind-numbing, the landscapes weren't as pretty and the end game raiding wasn't as fun. The pvp started to decline, now if a side isn't getting kills most will just log off. After that, the next expansion came out and then another, each one succesfully killing off more and more of the loyal community that this game used to have. Is it worth getting end game now? I guess. Granted that you are ready for some grueling quests level 65-105, it's still not too awful to play. Although grindy, the community that still exists does make it worth it to continue playing at max level, if you can find them that is. But for the casual gamer that isnt looking to spend 50 hours just to reach max level, it is for you that I strongly suggest you try this out. Levels 1-65 are so much fun to do, especially if you have a friend or two! The quests for the most part are fun and inventive, and there is something almost transcendic about being a big LoTR fan and following the company along on their journey! Many of the expansions are reasonably priced; you can either buy these with real money, or deed in game to earn enough turbine points to unlock them! TL;DR Not as good as it used to be but early levels are still a ton of fun			"

												Of all the different MMORPG.s that are out there in the world, of which I've tried a few different ones, I have always come back to LOTRO as it holds a special place in my heart. It's easy to say that since you like Tolkien's books you'll like that game or that film, however I think that very few games actually manage to capture the magic and mystery that Tolkien's books give birth to.I have played LOTRO on and off since the time when you couldn't venture further than to Mirkwood, whilst now you're almost at the black gate and very close to finishing this epic journey. The reason I keep coming back to this game is simple, they keep adding more and more content and I want more and more lore and just the feeling of adventuring in Middle-Earth. It's just one of those feelings which is really hard to describe, but nothing will ever compare to exiting Moria after ~1weeks worth of time (IRL) questing in the depts and then being treated to the glorious Lothlorien and their beautiful forest.That said, the game is not without problems and is at this point really old, however, if you can look beyond the slightly blurry textures that show that the game is old, there is much to love in the game.The combat flows smoothly, sometimes there are a few problems with pathfinding for the enemies, but these are few and far between.The lore inside of the game is canon as far as possible, though the developers have taken some liberties in their designs, of course, though I would say that there's nothing that is terribly lore breaking and you can enjoy this game and get your geek on without risking the ""Peter Jackson syndrome..."", looking at you Hobbit...Is this a game for everyone? No certainly not, no one game is for everyone, but you don't need to be a Tolkien geek like me to enjoy this game. If you take some time to read the descriptions for quests etc. you'll find yourself learning loads about the world in no time. Basically, if you've ever had an interest in running around Middle-Earth and slay orcs, I'd say this is one of the better games to do that in. It may not be as big and fancy as WOW or other MMORPG:s but it makes up for it with stories and grandious environments for you to visit.Touching on the F2P models slightly aswell. I have ever only played the game while it's been F2P, this because I was too young to be able to uphold a subscription before then on my own. I find that the F2P model is quite fair and you're even allowed to gather Turbine Points, their currency for the in game store, though questing and doing deeds in the world.Although I would strongly recommend that whoever enjoys this game and would like to improve their life a little, should subscribe for just 1 month and then go back to playing, this will bring your account up to premium level, compared to the F2P version, giving you a lot of quality of life improvements to the game, such as more bags, higher cap on gold etc.You will be allowed to quest up to ~Level 20 in the game for free before being required to purchase more regions to unlock the quests that lay within. Giving you, in my oppinion, ample time to form an idea about the game and decide weather or not it's worth spending that ~5€ to unlock more stuff. I did and I've never looked back on it as ""wasted"".Is it perfect? No, but good enough to warrent countless of hours of playing, weather you're a Tolkien geek or no. Give it a shot without paying money and if you like it, there's a lot of content to be enjoyed here, for not too steep a price.			"

												Been playing this since launch. Glad to see it on steam! The F2P model is not the best, with a very pay as you go mindset, making you purchase quest packs as you level. This can be avoided by paying subscription.The MMO aspect is also a bit dated, but this means there are mountains of content to enjoy.This gets consistently updated with new, and free content, as well as expansions on a yearly basis. The story is well into Return of the King by now.If you are in any way a fan of Middle Earth, I recommend trying this one out purely to explore this interpretation of Middle Earth, as it is the most fully realised one to date.You can walk from the old fortress of Carn Dum in Angmar, all the way to Dol Amroth in Gondor.You could follow the path the fellowship took, or even that of Bilbo to some extent.This is a fantastic game for the role players and explorers among us.

The sheer amount of things to do is immense. So much to do, So much to learn and there isn't a diffinitive ending. The game is one of my favorites and is well worth the 20GB's of storage required to play it.

												I used to love this game.  Then, after they released the update for Helm's Deep, they abandoned the whole skill tree, and re-did everything.  I felt overwhelmed...I had carefully planned my character's development over LITERALLY THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay.  Yes, I know that there's something wrong with that.  In my defense, between bouts of grinding, there was something terribly soothing about standing above the valley of Rivendell.  But how could I start over?  Without the skills and perks configured, MOBs of my own level would likely waste me.  Yet if I mis-spent them, I'd be stuck with a fouled-up configuration, unless I paid to re-spec.  So it sits in the queue, unused.  I thought Minas Tirith was available now...I had so longed to make my way to the White City.  But even that appears to dangle out of reach.  (thanks Dr. Wumbo for correction)  Perhaps someday I shall yet return...some day...ah.If you enjoyed the books, and have a LOT of extra time on your hands, and sometimes find yourself wishing to spend some time in Tolkien's world, you could hardly do worse than to spend some time with this game.  I bought it long before it was free-to-play, and it was worth it.  (Shoot, I'd have bought the lifetime sub back when it was available if I had known how much I'd like it.)  And if you're starting now, you needn't face my conundrum...unless Turbine does it AGAIN, in which case it may be time to craft a new legendary weapon. "

												I've  been a fan of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit since I read the books way back when. The movies where amazing. So when my brother introduced me and got me into the game ( A change of pace from my usual Chaos Space Marines)  but the opportunity to play a fantasy realm in witch we both were avid fans about, I took the chance.  Both of us being our favorite hero as Gimli, son of Gloin, we took to the character creation with an idea of mind. ( I'm also a dwarf slayer fan from the Gotrek and Felix novels.) To be long bearded, axe toting dwarves. And as it was , we could! Other than dwarves you can play as other races of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth...men, hobbits and elfs. Also like other rpg's you can choose from various classes. Champion, Guardian, Hunter, Burgler and Loremaster. Each class and race brings to the game a specific play style along with culture and language and skills and story line. Dwarves for example, get and axe damage bonus and a stamina regenerative bonus for being a harty people.  So choosing and making you're character does change you're online game experience.The game itself is so fully in depth and full of fantasy lore that its hard not to be overwhelmed and lost in it. Even if your just a fan of the books, or just the movies or just like rpg's. You'll find yourself reading the quests and missions, enjoying the simple basic rpg mechanics( Legendary weapons is A LOT of fun) and instances its hard not to be captured by Tolkiens world. Its all there, down to the movies soundtrack to add to you actually want the music up and loud when you’re slaying goblins in the Misty Mountains. In game you play as a hero of the Free Peoples defeating every orc and goblins in league with evil, from Erin Luin to Moria (my favorite) to Gondor. Community wise it has to be the most friendly based I have ever played with. There is always a fellowship, kinship out there to help with a quest or instance or get items or even craft them for you free of charge. Honestly it has a great atmosphere with a '' Were in this together'' and ''All for one and one for all '' attitude. A great game if you like joining with others and having fun rpg dungeon crawl wise. As a free to play game technically, there is a pay to play feature. With real money you can buy traits, skills, steeds, quests and maps that can easily create a large hole in your pocket. But if you choose to pay you definitely wont be found wanting. Even as a free to play game there is plenty of content and game play that you won’t be crying exactly that you didn't get the full experience. but there is so much more, if  you are willing to pay for it. It doesn’t make your character so much better than others or game changing where you become a God amongst men, but it definitely can change your experience. To make your steed go 250% faster or to play that one instance where you defeat the orc armies of the Iron crown. It’s up to you. As a free to play player myself sometimes you do wish you could do a certain quest or skirmish and there is a way. In game, for completing quests and deeds you can earn Turbine points which can pay for real money perks! It's a nice way to get some of those pay to play perks for us that have empty wallets.			"

												I play LOTRO since about four years ago, so I kind of grew attached to it. I know the map and the controls really well and certain places even bring back memories. I guess that's why I really love this game, so I don't have a good opinion about it. I can tell you though that it's fun to recognize places and characters from the movie, but it's a shame you can't swim underwater. The artwork might not be great compared to others (it can be beautiful, but WOW is for example more magical), and quests can be annoying, but hey, every MMORPG has annoying quests right? You can't like everything in a game. So if you don't compare games too much, and you just want to try an MMORPG, I recommend this one.			"

												Ahhh,LOTRo where to begin.This game is honestly the best classic tab targeting MMO i have ever played.Before i tell why i think so i will first tell you the cons of this game as to get them out of the way.1.Its a bit old so the graphics are not as good as modern games,still pleasent graphics(its not virtua fighter)just not as nice as shiny new games2.Its new content is made under a differant company then old LOTRO so it feels a bit differant,not bad just differant.3.Long travel times between destinations.This is commonplace in MMOs but LOTRO is big and fast travel is limited so yeah,lots of running around.This is easily mitigated by LOTROs excellent vistas and the steam overview if you wanna browse the store or something while traveling,or just talk in chat.PROS!!!1.Firstly and most important is that LOTROs community is by far the best in any game.This fact is so true as to almost be undebatable.Every person i have ever met in this game was great.2.This is lord of the rings,so you instantly have the greatest fantasy world and lore ever created to explore and adventure in.3.Varied classes.You start with some good class staples like Guardian and Hunter,but some really special ones are included like warden(a combo based tank in a tab targeting game?Its crazy fun for more skill based play.Runekeeper(super adaptible healer/dps)and countless other cool stuff about the other classes.4.The world building is close to perfect for a classic (but fresh) take on the lord of the rings.In conclusion i love this this game and while you may not,you have to try it,at least two very differant classes to lvl 30,and make friends!these people are great they make f2ps and newbies right at home.GO PLAY IT!

Posted: January 30, 2016
												So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game? Then LotRO is definitely your bet.2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for). 7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game. You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)Total score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.

												This game has taken months off of my life and I still love it. IGN 10/10 for musical instruments. Plus you don't need to buy anything if ur a cheapo the horse riding trait is easily unlocked with deeds so don't give me that sh*t the only problem I have is the gold cap which I am working to take off.

												If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!			"

												This is the game that introduced me to the addicting world of MMORPGs.  The game has aged rather well when compared to its counterpart, Dungeons & Dragons Online.  If you want to do F2P go right ahead, the company who runs the game doesn't bog free players with pointless restrictions and mandatory purchases to move the game forward.  In my opinion, however, its worth becoming a VIP, as it only enhances your experience and you get your money's worth.  Anyone who has always wanted to try an MMORPG but is intimdated by bigger games like Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft should give this one a try!			"

												There isn't enough I can say about this game. Being a huge Tolkien fan, this game gives me the sense of Middle-earth in a proper form.

The community is really helpful and are always ready to help someone in need. Crafting is great as well. Decorating your house was a really nice feature, but Standing Stone Games recently upgraded it and I haven't seen any other housing decorator system like it.

												Of all the different MMORPG.s that are out there in the world, of which I've tried a few different ones, I have always come back to LOTRO as it holds a special place in my heart. It's easy to say that since you like Tolkien's books you'll like that game or that film, however I think that very few games actually manage to capture the magic and mystery that Tolkien's books give birth to.I have played LOTRO on and off since the time when you couldn't venture further than to Mirkwood, whilst now you're almost at the black gate and very close to finishing this epic journey. The reason I keep coming back to this game is simple, they keep adding more and more content and I want more and more lore and just the feeling of adventuring in Middle-Earth. It's just one of those feelings which is really hard to describe, but nothing will ever compare to exiting Moria after ~1weeks worth of time (IRL) questing in the depts and then being treated to the glorious Lothlorien and their beautiful forest.That said, the game is not without problems and is at this point really old, however, if you can look beyond the slightly blurry textures that show that the game is old, there is much to love in the game.The combat flows smoothly, sometimes there are a few problems with pathfinding for the enemies, but these are few and far between.The lore inside of the game is canon as far as possible, though the developers have taken some liberties in their designs, of course, though I would say that there's nothing that is terribly lore breaking and you can enjoy this game and get your geek on without risking the ""Peter Jackson syndrome..."", looking at you Hobbit...Is this a game for everyone? No certainly not, no one game is for everyone, but you don't need to be a Tolkien geek like me to enjoy this game. If you take some time to read the descriptions for quests etc. you'll find yourself learning loads about the world in no time. Basically, if you've ever had an interest in running around Middle-Earth and slay orcs, I'd say this is one of the better games to do that in. It may not be as big and fancy as WOW or other MMORPG:s but it makes up for it with stories and grandious environments for you to visit.Touching on the F2P models slightly aswell. I have ever only played the game while it's been F2P, this because I was too young to be able to uphold a subscription before then on my own. I find that the F2P model is quite fair and you're even allowed to gather Turbine Points, their currency for the in game store, though questing and doing deeds in the world.Although I would strongly recommend that whoever enjoys this game and would like to improve their life a little, should subscribe for just 1 month and then go back to playing, this will bring your account up to premium level, compared to the F2P version, giving you a lot of quality of life improvements to the game, such as more bags, higher cap on gold etc.You will be allowed to quest up to ~Level 20 in the game for free before being required to purchase more regions to unlock the quests that lay within. Giving you, in my oppinion, ample time to form an idea about the game and decide weather or not it's worth spending that ~5€ to unlock more stuff. I did and I've never looked back on it as ""wasted"".Is it perfect? No, but good enough to warrent countless of hours of playing, weather you're a Tolkien geek or no. Give it a shot without paying money and if you like it, there's a lot of content to be enjoyed here, for not too steep a price.			"

												Very fun game if you're e LOTR fan and always wanted to explore Middle Earth. Players are always friendly and willing to give a helping hand if you're stuck or need some help clearing a mission or skirmish.  Does require a bit of grinding though if you're itching to get to a particular location and explore, but there are ways to level up quicker if you look for them. All in all, a great way to pass the time and escape reality for awhile.			"

												Don't let my steam hours on this game mislead you, I have spent several thousands of hours on this game. It was the second MMO I ever played and haven't been able to quit playing it entirely. When I found out it was on steam, I downloaded it through here. It is the best MMO I have ever played.The achievement I am most proud of is grinding so much through the game that I was able to buy three expansions and get to the level cap without spending a single cent. Later, I did buy some things because I wanted to support Turbine, which is an amazing company.10/10 Would farm barrows for trinkets again.			"

												So, Lord of the Rings Online is fairly good MMORPG here with a couple of nuances:1. This is a game about the lore for the Tolkien's writing. Tolkiens fans can start with it all fine, all others would need some time to understand what is, actually, up in here. Let's say you didn't read the books, but you do want to start your sinking in it with a game? Then LotRO is definitely your bet.2. This isn't a game about PvP. While there are friendly duels and PMvP (Player-controlled Monsters versus Player) raids this isn't a focus for the project, neither it's really entertaining. Enjoyed being a ravaging orc for a change though.3. This game isn't about wiggling breasts, like, at all (notably other games on the market are, like TERA or Black Desert Online). Personally I like this aspect of the game second to lore, so if you're after storytelling and not the boobs you'll do fine.4. This game has a ton of cooperational group content to do from the very start of the game (lvls 20+), both very interesting and entertaining. Consider to make friends in kinship (local name for clans) or invite your own friends!5. This game requires some reading skills. I mean, quest texts are really good, and some of the side quest stories are awesome to the marvelous point.6. This game is great for exploring. The more areas you explore 'to the last tree out there', the more stories to hear/read you uncover, the more rewarding the deed system goes on you (deeds are in-game achievements you get tons of premium currency for). 7. Payment system isn't that unfriendly to free players if you ask me. Yes, grinding premium currency with deeds can be tiresome if you buy nothing, but hey!.. Get Steam packs available for the game and you'll do just fine. 15 USD (when on sale) and you won't need to buy anything else in months.These developers deserve support with our hard-earned cash.8. While some point out that the graphics of the game are outdated I can't call those 'ugly'. I'd say older locations look like the Gothic II ones (which isn't bad, you know) while new ones can be stunningly beatiful. Visit Evendim peaks and Forochel coasts to see what I mean.9. Music puts Peter Jackson to shame, really. Definitely a strong side for the game.10. And the last, but not the least thing about the game is the Community. People come and go, but old players always return to LotRO, so you can find all types of people in. Seasoned veterans, who played the game for 8 years, new lads and lasses, some experienced folk to group with... Roleplayers, that enjoy the very social aspects for the game. You'll certainly fit in our bunch :)Total score would be 9\10 points for the people that share the same things to love with me and 3/10 for the people that just want running around a half-naked curvy girl with a sword larger than the girl.

												Alright, alright... I guess it's time to make a review on this one. Before we begin, I have roughly another 4000 hours i've put into this game before it was released on steam. This is a tough one, when I was in the peak of my playing there wasn't a better MMO out there. Fun but challenging raids, lucrative fellowships, and unique 3-mans made end game play a world of fun. And the pvp? It was unbeliavable, both sides were always out and willing to trade some deaths for some kills. After RoI, however, things started to go down hill. Textures started being reused, quests turned mind-numbing, the landscapes weren't as pretty and the end game raiding wasn't as fun. The pvp started to decline, now if a side isn't getting kills most will just log off. After that, the next expansion came out and then another, each one succesfully killing off more and more of the loyal community that this game used to have. Is it worth getting end game now? I guess. Granted that you are ready for some grueling quests level 65-105, it's still not too awful to play. Although grindy, the community that still exists does make it worth it to continue playing at max level, if you can find them that is. But for the casual gamer that isnt looking to spend 50 hours just to reach max level, it is for you that I strongly suggest you try this out. Levels 1-65 are so much fun to do, especially if you have a friend or two! The quests for the most part are fun and inventive, and there is something almost transcendic about being a big LoTR fan and following the company along on their journey! Many of the expansions are reasonably priced; you can either buy these with real money, or deed in game to earn enough turbine points to unlock them! TL;DR Not as good as it used to be but early levels are still a ton of fun			"

												One of the few MMO titles I've played for more than six months. If you are a fan of Tolkien's universe, LotRO is a wonderful adaption of it. Rather than having you be a part of the fellowship, or actively assisting the ringbearer at all times, Turbine has devised a story that follows the events of the book by foiling the plans of Sauron, Sarumon and others who do not have the interest of the free peoples of Middle-earth in mind.Start in Ered Luin (home of the Elves and Dwarves), The Bree-lands (home of the race of Man) or The Shire (home of the Hobbits), and make your way through one of the largest game worlds created. Travel through Evendim (it's landmark being Annuminas and Lake Evendim itself), Forochel (home of the Lossoth, a tribe living on the frigid tundra), The North Downs (where the Rangers have made base to keep guard over The Shire), The Lone Lands (it's landmark being Weathertop), The Trollshaws (it's landmark being Imladris, the city of Elves), The Misty Mountains (it's landmark being Goblin-town), Eregion (which leads you to the black pool and gates of Moria), down into the Enedwaith and on into Dunland (it's landmark being the Tower of Orthanc).Should you journey east from Eregion, you then enter the vastness of Moria on into Lothlorien, where you can journey further east into Mirkwood or south down the Great River to the Wildermores and Eastern Rohan, a massive region comprised of four areas; The Wold, The Entwash Vale, The Norcrofts and The Sutcrofts. From there, you will travel into Western Rohan, on to Edoras and on to Helm's Deep.LotRO is also the epitome of Free To Play. While a player does not have immediate access to everything the game has to offer, one can purchase nearly everything with Turbine Points, a currency you can purchase with  real cash or earn by playing the game and completing deeds. If you're not willing to spend money, you can spend time to get the newest stuff, from cosmetics to mounts to expansion packs.Storywise, as of this writing, LotRO has just reached The Battle of Helm's Deep with it's new expansion (released Nov. 20, 2013), aptly titled ""Helm's Deep"".

												My gametime lies, I played this for over 2 years through HappyCloud before I started playing it through Steam instead ;)This game is highly underrated in my opinion, and although it's an older game it still has a lot going for it.  The pros:  - Tolkien lore, sooo much Tolkien lore.  - Ever wanted to get drunk in the Prancing Pony? Now you can.  - Great community for an MMO, trolls seem few, people are friendly, player-run events a-plenty.  - The in game music system.  You can use lore-friendly musical instruments in game to play ABC files of your favourite music, and even sync with other people in your party to form a band & play the same songs in time on different instruments.  - The free-to-play model allows for a pretty lengthy free trial period.  After that you'll want to become VIP (a subscriber) to enjoy the rest of the game, HOWEVER you only need to go VIP once to unlock everything, and it all stays unlocked if you cancel your subscription, so it's not necessary to keep paying.- Huge list of Instances, Skirmishes & Epic Battles to participate in.- Player owned houses, and Kinship (Guild) houses which are all customizeable.  - Wardrobe feature allows for lots of outfit customization.- Monster play feature allows for PvP battles while sticking to Tolkien lore.  - Extensive crafting system, & auctions of course.Cons: - Graphics are showing their age, certainly not an ugly game, but not the stunning graphics we're getting used to seeing either.- Standard MMORPG mechanics.  Nothing particularly new or exciting in terms of gameplay, basically just another WoW clone, but with Tolkien lore.- Free-to-play is limited, you will need to spend some money to enjoy the rest of the game.If you're a fan of Tolkien lore then definitely give it a try, if you're not, then there's propably much better MMO's out there for you to try instead.  This game does stock-standard MMORPG pretty well, but it's main draw point is definitely the setting & lore.			"

												Love this game! Its fun to play however I wish they would focus more on fixing the game up then making money all the different fees to play turn me off from playing. If they would just have one set fee for the month and thats it then I wouldn't mind it if they were upgrading as much as wow does.			"

												I LOVE the LOTR universe, read the books, (the hobbit like 4 times) seen all the films. When i first saw this game i got excited beyond belief, in this game you can go to all these locations, just from looking at the map i got excited, but what drove me away recently was the HUD, it's a bit messy, and the map with quest markes also is quite messy, in my opinion the HUD and quest markers need a redo, and some slightly better graphics wouldnt hurt. But i reccomend it to all other tolkien fans.			"

												This is my favourite MMO of all time. It follows the story of Tolkien's books from the Lord of the Rings. You can explore Middle Earth by your own, or you can follow the epic story line, which brings you to all the regions. The quests are good, there are a lot of different quest types, and when you're lucky, you can join a festival as well. The things I like about the game is the beautiful scenery, the storyline, cosmetics(!), and the player community is one of the best I know. There are 4 player races, all with their own backgroundstory. The classes are also fun to play (I tried them all). Another good thing is that it is normally F2P, so you can try it out as long as you like. You don't have to pay a monthly fee, unless you want some extras. The only downside is, that the expansions and the extras can be expensive. But when you play is often, it is totally worth the money.My rating for the game: 7,5/10			"

												If you're a Tolkien fan, you should love this. It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth. As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!			"

												As a returning character to LOTRO i have alot of things to say. Firstly i have much XP on this topic im am a lvl 75 Captain named Adantheir on the Gladden Server and i have played this game for 3 years stopped and re downloaded it to see how the new FTP model effects the game. I would recommend this game to new players/friends who love the franchise and lore. Your gonna have to spend money to unlock ""Quest Packs"" which allow you to do quests in a certain area. It can sap the fun right out of lvling a character but thats the price of FTP. Understandable this could turn off a few new comers but have no fear because imo it was worth every penny and i am glad i spent money on this game and i will surely be buying the Helms Deep expansion to continue my story :D			"

												I have just played this game for couple dozens of hours but I recommend it as one of top 3 LOTR games. Things I really liked about the game are. First of all the huge area that is so great and looks precisely as how I imagine Middle-earth. I really liked that the first missions of Mens and Hobbits started in Archet which is a big + for me as fan of LOTR. The combat system is bit hard-to-learn for me but even not very much experienced RPG-player would get into it in couple of days. I will play more hours in this game for sure. I recommend.			"

												This game is great, the quests keep you playing and all the people online are a blast to play with. I do have a major issue with the game as it is tries to make money everywhere, even in the most simplest of things. This pisses me off. A currency cap... It's one of the stupidest things I've seen also only on this game so far. The riding skill itself also requires you to ""pay"" or use the special points. Im sure that if the devs were a bit more lenient on the ""pay to win"" more people would get more out of the game. Simple things can make a big difference.			"

It has a story to every race as well as class, great cinimatics, one of the best being the opening, and like i said before, a very fun and helpful community. I was just working on leviling my character up and a great and funny discussion happened of why the eagles didnt just fly them all to Mordor.			"

												Great F2P MMO that keeps me coming back. If you choose to play the game for free without subscribing you will have to grind for points in order to unlock content and it will be very grindy vs. paying the subscription fee. It is possible, however, to play the game and even unlock content without paying via deed farming.If you're a LOTR fan this is a definitely worth a try. The graphics are dated but the music along with the friendly community (in general one of the best communities in a MMO I've ever experienced) make for a great experience. LOTRO has a social aspect to it that I haven't been able to find in other MMO games such as WoW, Lineage 2, and Aion. The community may not be as large as some of the previously mentioned MMOs but the community is very laidback and helpful.Quests follow the same standard set by the MMO-genre so expect there to be some redundancy, however, with the LOTR universe to play with there is a lot of lore and a lot of reason to explore the game world. There are a lot of titles you can earn for your character as well for just about anything in the game from, crafting, slaying monsters, questing, etc.Overall 8/10 if you're a LOTR fan you'll see it as a 10/10Tips for beginners: if you're going to be F2P look up a guide for deed farming/point farming and stick to it, find a good kinship as soon as you can it helps a lot, and clear an area completely. Even if you're overleveled clear the entire area (do every quest in that area), this allows you to stay and farm deeds, get mats for your vocation, and stay at a decent level when entering the next area so the mobs don't run you over. It will also help with making sure you unlock every instance going forward. For point unlocks after you purchase the rider skill (which is what you should be saving all your points for up until level 20), you'll want to get the wallet upgrade next. After the wallet upgrade it's up to what you think you need to save for.			"

												I bought this game when it first came out on DVD rom disk in the box which I still have and an expansion, wayyyyy back about 5 or 6 years ago. Bought one other expansion pack online , played for a couple years and stopped. Saw it on Steam for 'FREE' and figured , Hey cool, let's do it. So I downloaded it , still had all 9 characters , one a Warden over level 50 and one each of all the other classes. A hunter elf , a Dwarf guardian, an Elf Champion, a human Loremaster ( my second highest leveled character), a Hobbit Burglar , a human Captain.. and a Dwarf Runemaster...all of these characters are above level 30 or greater so it took me a while playing it to get there. I can say that the free to play model is bull crap because there are like 4 or 5 expansions you have to pay for to open up the rest of the map as you level, each expansion caters to a parameter of levels and that gets costly. To get full experience and other perks you have to subscribe but being an mmorpg that is par for the course. The game is old, but it's got a quirky kind of charm to it that's addictive and endearing to some , boring and tedious to others. I was enchanted by it for the longest time and I still look back on my time playing it fondly. Do I recommend it? Yeah , sure , why not, it's as good if not better than most of the newer mmo's out there today and if I had time to spend on it and money I'd go back and play it some more. Maybe during the winter if I get laid off from work? lol			"

I believe I first played this game when it went free to play, and I fell in love, even though the pay to play content was at times somewhat intrusive. I no longer have any particular desire to play, as I have grown out of any interest in MMOs, but if I were to play any of the games available in the style, LOTRO would absolutely be my first choice.

												I'll admit, I haven't played many MMOs, but LoTRO is one of the best that I've played. You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game. Another clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use ""Turbine Points"". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world. There is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.In short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.PRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.			"

												I had always loved the Lord of the Rings books as a child and this game is also a wonderful story telling experience that in my opinion rates highly right along with the books. I have already put in over 100 hours and I am not sure I have even scracted the surface of what this game has to offer. This is one of the far better options for anyone wanting to try and mmorpg. Its free to play so really why not give it a shot? You have nothing to loose.			"

												Great game all-round, the expasions are worth it if you feel the need for more gameplay. Nice game to play with your friends with great combat, beautiful graphics and a lengthy list of quests to complete. One problem I found is that if your game is a tad buggy for whatever reason. Do NOT verify the files with Steam, the client will redownload the game. If anything needs to be updated, Turbine will release it, not Steam. Steam is just the portal to LOTRO. Otherwise, it's a good game all round. Totally recommended, even if you haven't watched LOTR (I haven't). This game is still good (2016 update)			"

												 There is just something about this game that sparks my excitement like reading a great fantasy novel.  The graphics are superb and are always being improved upon.  This is one of the few MMORPG's out there that are always trying to reinvent themselves by adding new combat systems and revamping existing areas to bring in more players.   Turbine has a true gem here.			"

												I'll admit, I haven't played many MMOs, but LoTRO is one of the best that I've played. You'll enjoy this game somewhat if you're more of a fan of the Peter Jackson movies, but if you're a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic books, like me, you'll go crazy over this game. Another clever thing that Turbine has done is the in-game store. In order to buy things like quest packs, war-horses, and dyes, you use ""Turbine Points"". How do you get Turbine Points? You could buy them...or you could complete deeds like doing so many quests, killing so many orcs/giant fly things/wolves/brigands, or finding different locations in the game world. There is just one big problem this game has: The riding. Not the riding itself, but the riding skill. You need to buy it from the store. And it's not cheap. It's 95 Turbine Points. Considering the most Turbine Points you can get from a deed is 15, and that's for doing over 30 quests, that's quite a lot.In short, if you want a good open-world MMO with a great story, pick this up.PRO TIP: Find and buy a boxed copy of the Mines of Moria expansion pack. You get a extra character per server, VIP for a month, and of course, access to Moria.			"

												I started playing Lotro at launch and then stopped playing for many years. I have recently come back (after being inspired by the Hobbit movies!) and I'm really enjoying it.The free to play model is very generous here; there is an absolute ton of content to play for free including the entire epic quest which is really good. Plus just by playing normally you earn Turbine points which can be used to unlock niceties such as the ability to ride a horse and so on.It's a very content rich game, with great story amd there's also a lot of fun stuff to do with all the festival. The community is one of the nicest ones in the MMO space and if you are into RP then this is very well catered for on some of the RP servers.			"

												The lord of the Rings online is a pretty rock solid MMORPG.Players will find themselves dropped right into the action of middle earth regardless of what type of character they decide to play. The events of the Lord of The Rings Online (LOTRO) follow the events of the films as your character follows in the wake of the fellowship to aid the free peoples of middle earth against the forces of sauron.Players can choose a host of Classes Ranging from DPS to Tanks to Healers or support. The list of all classes is listed below.Guardian-----TankWarden------TankChampion----Melee DPSHunter-------Ranged DPSMinstrel------HealerRune Keeper-DPS/Healer HybridLore Master--Dps/Healer/CC support HybridCaptain-------DPS/Support BufferPlayers can choose the races listed below.MANDWARFELVESHOBBITSThe game features group play at all levels by means of ""Fellowships"" that can be made between 2-6 players. Larger fellowships can be converted to Raid groups for 6-24 players. There are tons of instances all over middle earth that will take you anywhere from bree town to Helms  deep at the moment where players get to live their own Middle earth expiriences fighting the evils from mordor and isengard.A very easy to use crafting system is also in place for players who prefer to craft to benefit themselves or other players. There are many different crafting skills availab;e to tailor to a player's  specific tastes. This is a great MMO for people  who are newer to MMORPG's, or for the MMORPG veterans who simply want a taste of flavor. Everything in the user interfacce is easy to find and clearly explained throough tooltips if the player so desires them to be in and can be toggled off in the setting menu. A very easy to pickup, addicting game that you can pick up for free. Whats not to like? "

I would recommend to anyone after Spending 6 years in the World of Warcraft (-05-11).Game is Free to Play, tho' as any game in that genre, has it's micro-payment-systems. On the good side in this payment systems is, that you can earn in-game currency straight by grinding and completing these ""deeds"" that game contains plenty. Only thing I've paid for this game, was Quad-pack, on sale, wich contains four first expansion packs in the game.Actual short-fall of this game is lack of players on lower levels.200+ hours spent in this game and many more are up ahead.If you're Tolkienist, it's pure gold. 9/10If you expect it to be like WoW, you'll give it maybe 7/10Ps. There's no actual PvP in the game. Monster play enables it, but havn't found any interest in it so far, since the focus of this game is on PvE and on the free peoples.			"

												***ILotRO...Lord of the Rings Online. I played this game for well over 200 hours prior to it's STEAM release and have 2 max level characters, and all of the optional classes***I'll keep this short and sweet...this game is absolutely wonderful! One of the best MMO's that I've ever played. Also, the roleplaying servers are very active, and this game offers the best roleplaying that I've ever experienced in any MMO, hands down.The only drawback is this games age, because of the age of this game, the community feels like it is slowly dissapating. While still a very friendly and helpful community, and honestly one of the most mature communitied I've ever seen in an MMO, the player base seems to be dwindling so much, that it may, at times, leave you feeling alone.If you haven't played this game, and are ok playing alone, give it a shot. If you have a group of friends to play with, give it a shot. If you're patient enough to have periods where it seems like no one is online, give it a shot. This game is great!			"

												Played this game for way too long and way too many hours.Great game, fab community, superb wiki resources and game mods. The game is largely free from bots, cheats, exploits and if a spammer rears its ugly head once a year (if even that...last I saw one was 2012), it's laughed out the door.It's the theme park of theme parks, Lord of the Rings. Up to a couple of years ago, very down-to-earth and toned down graphics. Then WB games went medieval on the rear end of the game. In particular the store end of the game. Now you get deco pets (how about a rat the size of a horse or a shining spectral bear with a little snowstorm above it), silly character costumes and store enchants to rival many Asian micropayment grinders. Happily you can opt out of seeing any deco pets and if you see a bare-chested dwarf in purple tights running around town with a chicken nest on his head...so be it.On the plus side, there is zero focus on lingerie. The female character game models are as sexless as plywood and the males look either goofy, mildly gay or just a little burly. It's toned down but rather outdated and promises of updates to the character game models have been made.Typically, a micropayment game is aimed at making you pay and keep paying.LOTRO is different. If you sub for just one month (that is USD 15), you gain permanent perks and upgrades to your account and your characters that will remain forever. This means that the paywall is nearly non-existant.Technically you can grind and grind and utilize 99.99% of the features in the game and never whip out your wallet or add your credit card to the store. You can grind out in-game cash and you can grind out store points (example: quest area covering a certain amount of levels would cost 500 store points and you would have to spend 1-2 days dsolely grinding out store points to attain that amount).Game cash can be used to buy certain store products from other gamers. This is the one recently added pay-to-win game store bias that rubs me the wrong way. The few and far-between botters could use botted game gold to shop regular lootable items before but the choice was limited. Now they can buy most of the useful store items.Beef:store stuff vs game gold as long as a gamer is willing to spendsomewhat dated character game models inside a rather lovely gameno apparent effort is made to delete botters or exploiters even if these are very fewnot a game in maintenance mode but manned by a dwindling number of staffyearly novelty features quickly abandonedbad fishing (hey, I like good fishing in a game!)rather boring pvpSuperb:no gold sellersno focus on lingerie or sexualized childrenthe lore is deep and to a large extent exactgreat atmosphere and in-game muzakmostly great communitysuperb external wiki resources for any little feature or thing in the gamegreat options and conveniences for everything...freely adjust game window, turn weapon glow on and off, show or hide pets, chat filter if wanted, creatable user defined chat channels and tabs, save UI settings for alts but can use entirely different ones, any keyboard command adjustable and little extras like searchable NPC stores, searchable options and so on...really well done90% well-defined character classes not overlapping too much but not strictly trinity heal-tank-dps			"

												Once a great MMORPG, now fading away slowly. Less players everyday, people asking worried on Reddit what is happening, and all I can say is that this game has came to an end.It is probably still going to be alive for a few years but what it was 5 years ago, it won't be anymore. I had too much fun on this game with my friend and I still believe that while this game is up, you still will be able to find some fun. It is not only for Lord of The Rings fans, it is also for MMORPG fans, Gamers, people. Everyone can play this game and have some fun. I still recommend this game, for the old times.			"

												Most of my time in-game is the non-Steam version, and I haven't reached cap yet, but there are many reasons why this is one of the BEST MMOs to play right now. So heres a review from someone whos a good chunk of the way in, and coming off 10+ years of WoW.If you are a LOTR fan AT ALL, this game follows the books decently closely, with the exception of the classes able to use magic, or turn into bears like Beorn, among other things. But going to Bag End and seeing the Sackville-Baggins' out front moving their stuff in was extremely satisfying. Its obviously not PERFECT for the sake of in-game story, but nothing is that bothersome (to me at least).The graphics hold up very well, I am not a ""AAA GFX ONLY"" gamer, but the scenery looks beautiful, its got a GREAT view distance, the map is MASSIVE and theres pretty much every single location you would ever want to visit in Middle Earth (aside from Erebor, Dale, Esgaroth and the northern Mirkwood). Since you start on the western side of the Misty Mountains in Eriador, it makes it GREAT fun to work your character up and experience getting to those famous locations like Moria or Minas Tirith or Edoras.The biggest thing I enjoy about the game is the F2P system. Honestly the best I have seen. Even subscribers have to unlock the expansions through the store. But fret not! You can earn a ton of the store currency just by playing and doing a special type of quests called Deeds. They range from slaying monsters to discovering locations to collecting. Not only does this encourage people to keep playing to unlock things, this allows you to REALLY explore the map (for instance going back to low level zones to finish your deeds), as opposed to other MMOs where you just feel like once youre too high for the zone, you never have to go back. Of course it can get a little grindy, but the system doesn't bother me as much as WoW these days, and how many good MMOs truly arent at all?Combat is as you would expect from an MMO, just not as flashy as say WoW or FF. Killing orcs is great fun though.I would recommend TRYING it if you are an MMO fan and LOTR fan. The community is very helpful as well. It's been a while since I've been really driven to do everything in a zone without being concerned about level, and this game nails that perfectly. It feels good having something to work towards in the expansion packs. As a gamer who has tried to get into almost every MMO available, this one is the only one that has kept me stuck.			"

												Edit 11/3/2016 - It truly pains me to edit my opinion of this game, but i will leave the orignal post due to the fact that it still rings true.  However, the GMs will ban for little to no reason if you use world chat and the replies you get when appealing to these bans basically state that ""you did something and that's the way it is, so you can deal with it and we're not talking to you anymore.""While that is paraphrased, it gets the point across.  I've been a faithful player since 2009 and I've sunk hundreds of dollars into this game on cosmetics, VIP, and quest packs, and they banned me two times in two weeks without allowing any kind of appeal.  They've also taken out the ability to contact customer service via phone and often times the GMs can take the better part of a day to reply to a ticket.  At the end of the day, I suppose if you stay out of world chat, the game is still very fun and very enjoyable, but the experience i had with Turbine recently may have destroyed the franchise I've loved for decades.This game is amazing.  Everything from the graphics to the F2P model. Let me start by saying that any F2P game is going to ask for money at some point, right?  Well, not LotRO.  Paying money is strictly a convenient option, Slayer deeds award 5-10 turbine points each deed, slayer deeds, when done right, can be done in 20-30 minutes, tops, awarding 15 TP (Turbine points, what you use to buy stuff in the cash shop).  After you leave the intro, you are immediately able to complete 3-4 of these deeds, resulting in a total of 45-60 TP, then you can move on to other regions slayer deeds if you haven't hit a high enough level to perform the next batch of deeds.  The other two starting areas have 3-4 slayer deeds as well, so that's another 90-120 TP.  These are just the slayer deeds that can be done before level 15, which you should hit withing 2 hours of gameplay.  LotRO's free to play model is the only free to play that actually makes it realistically possible to unlock every aspect of the game and essenstially EARN liftetime sub without spending a single penny.Other games have tradeable items that grant one month of VIP/sub status, which is fine, but often these are priced in such way through the in game economy that it's an unrealistic goal to play the game in a truly free to play manner, not to mention these items are completely dependent on the communities willingness to pay the publisher for those items.On top of those facts, if you DO choose to pay for a monthly subscription, you automaticaclly gain addition Turbine points in the game, permenantly lose the currency cap on all characters owned during the subscription period, unlock shared wardrobe (which allows you to cosmetically equip any item, even items that are grossly above your current level), unlock all quest packs, expansions, dungeons, skirmishes and instances for the duration of the subscription, and you gain bonus experience for being in a town.Even if you aren't a Lord of the Rings fan, this game is more than worth your time.  It has an AMAZING community, attentive Devs, a thriving roleplay community, in depth story with insane amounts of hidden lore, a fun crafting system, and so much more. Remember, all of this content is potentially FREE, 100%.  You find a f2p model like that elsewhere and get back to me.And as a final point, the game is not a casual-fest like so many other MMOs, you can't hit the level cap in a matter of hours regardless of subscription or not.  If you're looking for a WoW clone, I highly reccomend you play almost any other fantasy themed MMO out there, this isn't for for you.			"

												As a huge Lord of the Rings fan, this game instantly caught my eye. The installation took a little long, but it was definitely worth it. This game displays some of the best graphics that I've ever seen along with a unique gameplay. The ability to choose races and classes makes it a different experience each time. I really enjoy this and would recommend 10/10.			"

												What most people on the negative reviews forget is that this game was officially released on 24 April 2007 and then it was added on steam on 6 June 2012.This is a great MMORPG and it was one of the best at the time, right now it's still a great game. Most people think they will be playing the same story as the one that goes on the movies but that's completly incorrect and if you are thinking of playing this game with that mindset please look for another game.You get to explore Middle Earth with your own Character, class and Race. Yes, you do have to walk alot but that's the same in 99% MMORPG's', you have a Sh*t Load of quests, easy crafting method, season events all year long (Summer and Christmas Festivals are a few examples), alot of raids/instances to go through with your friends and/or party. A good Kinship(Guild) system that makes sure there are no empty guilds taking up names, simply said you need a total of 8 players if you want your kinship to stay ""alive"".In terms of gameplay it's very similar to World of Warcraft (remember SIMILAR NOT EQUAL), pvp included and focused on certain locations.This game used to be pay to play, now it's free to play but fortunatly not pay 2 win, the shop only gets you items that you can use while lvling(not the most powerfull just average), cosmetics but you can get your own while you play the game and participate in festivals. You need to buy the riding token from the shop but that's nothing to worry about because some of the quests you will be doing will give you premium money allowing you to not only get the Riding skill but also purchase every other item AND Expantion through the online LOTRO shop.Overall this is still a great game, just depends on how you look at it, so don't go comparing it with the story of the movies......

												Though it's old this is a very beautiful game. And it is very true to Tolkien's world of middle earth. So as a Tolkien fan I would recommend this game just for the world alone. I will never forget the first time I saw Weathertop or entered the mines of Moria.The quests have a feel of old MMOs. They can be rather grindy at times. But the main (epic) quest line is very well written and pulls you into the game. Makes the lesser and more grindy quests bearable. I would highly recommend reading the quest text of the main quest line as it really makes the game so much better and creates a lot of immersion. The community in the game is very nice and helpful. I don't know if it's because I play on a RP server, but I have never been trolled or anything for asking a question on world chat. People just seem very friendly and helpful. The auction house is pretty empty and often also overpriced. But asking in chat you never have to wait long to find someone willing to sell what you're looking for. "

												As a huge fan of LOTR and JRRT's world in general, I was looking forward to playing this game as soon as it was announced. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get it installed for a very, very long time until Steam came over to Russia. Now I had my chance to play and form my opinion. I really liked the graphics - much better than I expected. The mapping of the world is nicely done, lots of great and beautiful locations, and an interesting storyline too. At first, that is. Unfortunately, it all gets rather dull as you have to perform tons of similar quests to get that XP and get stuff without paying money for it. Because, truth be told, all this game does (like any ""free"" online game) is try and squeeze money out of you. You can play without it, but it's much more difficult and in the end it gets plain boring because you can't level up fast enough to keep up with the main quest, so you're stuck will all the small quests all over the place. It also takes you plenty of time to go places, from location to location, from quest to quest. There are lots of servers, and I played on Landroval which has plenty of players. However, it's still difficult to find people for team quests as they're so busy running around with their own quests. In the end it gets rather annoying when you just need to find one item and you're killed right in the tomb's hallway or something. The thing I loved were the holidays, all the challenges were fun and rewards worthy. And the good spirit of competition, too! All in all, I would recommend this game, though it's individual whether you keep playing or get bored at some point. I know I'm not the most patient person - with Lineage II I quit at lvl 69, and here the maximum is a 100... I surely do have better things to do with my life;)))			"

												Alright first I want to say I have 5000+ hours in this game but I played most of those before the integration with steam.This review is more for players looking to rejoin middle earth.With that being said I left this game when West Rohan was released after a few complicated changesto what I was used to and changes to PvMP that made the game unenjoyable.Some staff changes later and a few expansions I came back and so far I have been really enjoying myself!There is more attention in the quests as opposed to previous expansions and I am enjoying leveling and the end game content is fulfilling.Servers have been closed and condensed to preserve server population which is smart but sucks in a regard that the servers are a little laggy with more players returning every day but its a great thing as well as the game is still striving and is on a verge of a bounce back with Mordor coming next year. Definitely give the game another go if you're on the fence, I doubt you will regret it.			"

A lot of quests and fights waiting to be done. Make a fellowship with your friends. Defeat your foes. Don't let the darkness spread....but. The game forces you to buy new areas since lvl 25. There won't be alot of quests avaible. Also if you ever played this game, you could have noticed that the graphics are outdated and the game is downloading for a long time. The game is overall good and I highly reccomend it to any Lord of the Rings fan out there.			"

												I strongly recommend this game for any classic MMORPG & LOTR fan.LOTRO has an immense amount of side story & lore vs. the traditional movies.Although this game is quite old now, the graphics are still considerably good.  DX11, DX10, DX9 settings allow backwards compatibility with older machines & laptops.  Choose to download HD textures, or not.  Choose to play at 1080p, or not.  It's your world for the taking!For a free to play game, you start off with everything you need.  A decent amount of character creation selection, a decent amount of storage space, access to all beginning area quests, as well as access to two more area quest packs.  Once you're in your LvL 20's is when you will need to purchase quest packs.To purchase quest packs, you have four choices:1) Go VIP & get access to them as part of VIP.2) Purchase packs from the LOTRO store/Steam directly.2) Use real money to buy in-game premium currency to purchase them.3) Create a grind character to grind TP (Turbine Points) to purchase them.You will earn in-game premium currency (Turbine Points) just by playing the game.  Completion of certain quests, or deeds, will grant a set amount.  Deeds are ""passive"" quests.  Example, kill 100 wolves would be a deed.  Use a certain skill a certain number of times is a deed.  I was able to grind 150TP in just over 1 1/2hrs.  One hint, it involves creating a second character, Elvish, and doing certain quests & deeds.If you're a crafter, this game has a very in-depth crafting system.  It is also simple to wrap your head around.  An added bonus, certain crafted items allow you to name them.  Every item you craft, the characters name who crafted it will be in the item description.If you just like a quick jump into battle then log off, there is a feature called Skirmish.  This is a closed mission/dungeon where you can take other players with you, or go it solo.  Either way, you can just hack n slash.  Skirmishes are unlocked around lvl20.  Although you don't get drops off of the foes, you do earn Skirmish Marks.  These are spent in Skirmish Camps.  You can purchase armor, weapons, rare crafting materials, cosmetic attire, etc.Here is a video, from 4 months ago, that I recorded when doing a solo Skirmish:


YouTube™ Video: LOTRO - Assault on the Ringwraiths' Lair 

			Views: 36		



If you like to play in a group with other people, there are two types.1) A Fellowship.2) A KinshipA fellowship is your standard everyday party/group.  You're just out to do a quick quest.  A standard fellowship has a maximum of 6.  A raid fellowship has 12.Raids can be extremely difficult, or, extremely easy.  You will find, as usual, most PUGs (pick-up groups), will fail unless they have a much higher level player, or a very experienced veteran player, leading the way.  Raids are also only ever done at end-game.  Unless you're in a kinship.  Many hours can be wasted during a raid with nothing in return other than a very costly repair bill.A kinship is your standard everyday guild/clan.  These are the groups of people you prefer to do raids, quests, events, etc. with.  Kinships also gain levels based on time.  A kinship can reach a max level of 10, with a max number of members at 1,000.  Every character you create can be in a different kinship.  A kinship can also have a Kinship Home.  Similar to a guild hall.  This comes at a fairly steep cost at lower levels.  A kinship is only allowed 1 home.  The kinship leader decides on access rules, though all kinship members generally have full access.Every LOTRO account is allowed to have 1 home for their characters.  You can purchase, & find treasure, cosmetic gear to spruce up your place & make it look just how you want it.  You can also purchase additional storage chests to keep extra special items.All in all, this game is FREE!  Download it & try it!If you like casual, but still exciting, playing at your own pace, or even just only crafting and never doing anything else, this game is for you!P.S.Although it says I've played less than 100 hours, I never really had a need to use Steam.  I only ever played LOTRO & nothing else.  Played it straight for nearly 4 years & also Beta tested it.  I've seen this game change so many numerous times, but I still hear it's call in my dreams...trying to drag me back...back to a neverending world of lore.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online (or LOTRO) is not an MMORPG for hardcore raiders, or hardcore PvP fans. Despite its age (6 years and thriving), it still looks good and has been for a while. But the strength of LOTRO, and what has kept it attractive for so long, is that it's one of the rare remaining MMO that still has a soul.Largely oriented PvE, with more quest and story content that you can play through with one or even two characters, it is focused on story and characters, and dedicated to the fans of the Lord of the Rings universe, which it reproduces very well.Raids and PvP exist and are nice, but they're probably slightly sub-par comparing to more recent MMOs. We've already stated that the PvE and story content, as well as the way the universe is depicted, are probably at the top of the crop. The last thing I want to mention is the community: after playing the vast majority of MMOs that are out there, I can definitely say that the LOTRO players are the most friendly, helpful and welcoming community I've ever encountered in over 10 years of MMOs.I hope this review helps everyone picture the game well. I am very happy to see it thrive so much after 6 years of operation, growing in content and in quality with each expansion. If you like the Lord of the Rings universe and quest content in MMOs, surely give it a try !			"

												~This is going to be a rather long review, please take a couple minutes and read through it if you're considering playing Lord of the Rings Online. :3Many people have said that this game is 'dying' and that has either scared people away from even starting to play, or pushing away old players who wish to play again. ~I am here to say that this game is NOT dying, NOT on it's last leg, or anything of the sort! The only reason that people from Steam say that is because Steam only shows people who are playing Lotro through Steam, but this amazing game was available, still is available to download through their website. This game has a flourishing community, many helpful people that would happily start playing with you, but only if YOU give this game a chance.In this next section, I will review what I think are the Pro's and Con's of this game. Pro's:~Many friendly people who absolutely love to play together, just waiting for you.~Flourishing community to answer all your questions and comments.~Fun and engaging content to keep you hooked for hours.~Simple crafting to gear your leveling character.~Many different classes to choose from to fit your playstyle.~Dungeons just waiting for you and your friends to plunder them.~The best gear in the game is crafted by players, not bought from a cash shop.Con's:~Many servers have a decline in population. (To move to Brandywine.)~Over-Simplified crafting.~Lag spikes in highly populated area's (As expected.)~Longer-than-usual server downtimes for simple repairs and maintenence.~Many things are still bought from the cash shop. (Personal Con.)~No real end-game (Yet, but plenty of gearing and skill tweaking to do.)You may notice that I have crafting in both Pro's and Con's, mainly because in the last massive update they (Turbine) made crafting super easy, but still fun for the leveling character.If you have read the review and agree, or disagree with what I have said about this magnificent game, go ahead and send a friend request and we can talk it over. ~If you're a new player, or a returning player who found my review helpful, you can find me on the Brandywine server, or even better, just send a friend request here. :D Always happy to help and chat. :3 "

												I present you the video passage of the game Lord of the Rings Online, more precisely, its main storyline, which is here proudly called ""epic"". Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters. Passage does not carry the main purpose of suggesting something to the players (although not without this, of course). Here, rather nostalgia, combined with the analysis of the plot and its connection with the original, untouched universe.			"

												The world in LOTRO truly feel like a world. It has beautiful scenery and feels vast and coherent. It is tantalizing to explore areas, places, towns and villages you have read in the books, and seen in the films. Once in a while you encounter the famous characters from the stories of Lord of the Rings which is ongoing behind the scenes. For a lore player this is a dream since there is always so much to delve deeper into if you wish.The only downside to the feel of the game are the player characters. They have an outdated or even unnatural feel to them, which is contrary to the rest of the world (which has a fantastic natural feel).The epic quest line is a joy, and I recommend that you take your time and follow the actually story in those quests.

												Okay before I have anyone hating on this review, I know it's an big bloody pay to win but that doesn't really matter because it's more PvE then PvP.Like if u were dedicated and had the money to upgrade state points u would probably be able to beat an lv 100, which would be hilarious.Now let's get to the point, this game is anaddictive as f*** MMORPG and I'm right about that, iv been playing for 4 days and already hit 27 hours. This game hasn't aged at all it still looks pretty for those hard core graphic fans and is still being updated to this very day. It has an pretty basic combat system but very hard to master the skills and which skills to use first and etc, just because of the skills I dont even use my mouse, I have to put both of my hands on the keyboard.The game hasn't died yet and I think its not going too with people still starting this game, most servers are pretty active and most of the community is mature but the only stupid things I saw on world chat is dont say sh** or f*** ye my kids play this. Like I can barely understand how to play this game and how are kids going to play this, but there are kids who lose their child hood pretty quick. Don't worry about in game money which is turbine u earn most of it by just playing the game and skaying everything. Crafting is key in this game and you'll need a couple of friends to craft what u need or multiple toons because crafting is the only why u get good sh**. It's full of quest and so much dialogue but not much talking maybe some lines ,because if u thing about it it would cost a fortune to get so many voice actors. But don't worry the cut scenes for story have sexy voice acting;). Also trust me when it says massive u'll be running ur♥♥♥♥♥up and down but it is all worth it in the long run. This is my first MMORPG that had a very good first impression  so I'll give it an 9/10 because they didn't f*** it up yet.Why are u stilI reading its free go ahead and already get it.			"

												A friend of mine recently introduced me to Lord of the Rings (I had never seen it) which led to me getting this game. I have to say that I really enjoy it! I like the combat system because it's not overly complicated and many of the concepts within the game are easy to grasp, even to someone who is fairly new to the LOTR universe. I do sometimes struggle with things like the map, meaning I have a hard time going the right way. However, I believe that this is due to my being new at the game and I feel that I will get the hang of it as I continue to play this amazing game!			"

												So, this game, when I played it, had one of the greatest player communities I've ever seen. It was absolutely amazing how immersed you felt. Graphics don't matter when you have people who love a game that much.It has been a long time since I've come back to this game, I'm hoping not much has changed, I remember playing it before it was Free to Play, and I was beyond impressed, the more I see other people play other MMO games, or multiplayer games, the more I miss growing my pipe weed, sitting in a tavern, or listening to a player band play their hearts out. I miss exploring the beautiful world that is Middle Earth, and I miss my Dwarven Champion.Not just did this game have an amazing player base, but it also had THE BEST questing I've ever experienced in ANY other mmo game, and in some cases in many other RPG games. I would go so far as to say Lotro defeats The Witcher (Series) and Kotor (1-2), two series I love very much. I remember there was an amazing depth to the game, where, sure you were one player among many, but every adventure felt important, not just your journey to become the strongest, but more your perilous trek to explore this vast world. I am a returning player, and all I can say, is I hope not much has changed, this game was almost perfect, I hope it still is.			"

												A seriously good MMORPG, I suggest everyone should give it a try! And don't you even dare to quit before reaching level 25 and say ""It's sh*t!"", coz you can not say anything bad unless you have tried it first, applies to every game.			"

												First...What is a video game ?Why do I play a video game ?A Game is basically an entertaining activity, some are more stimulating than others, and some stimulate reactions over concentration. If you get this logic right; you can discover a whole world of possibilities through video games. Someone could just decide to create a ""goat Simulator"" for fun (and you would pretend to be a goat), or create a Massive Multiplayer Game where everybody interacts with each other to accomplish goals in the game.There is a myriad of games out there today and some will tickle you to play, based on your interests of course.About Lord of the Rings Online :1st. Interests:Yes I am interested in the Lord of the Rings lore. I like the Medieval style, the powerful evil, the hobbits, the elves, the faith, the glory, the flowers, name it. I read the complete story years ago, way before the movies. Am I a complete sold out and corrupt Lord of the rings fan ?  Nope, not at all. I just like the writing style and the human-side, possibly believable logic-reality-fantasy, story of it all.2nd. The Genre:MMO. I am not a MMO FAN, in fact, I hate MMO's. They are a repeatable-similar-cut-and-paste infinite same thing said differently, lather repeat. This type of game is kinda of free-roaming-reading do the same thing. The story is vaguely known, the sense of it is tasteless.  Just roam, talk to someone and pretend it is fun. Now that's my point. (Lord of the GATHErings I called it back in my debut)3rd. Entertainment: Is Lotro entertaining? Well... I must say that something was entertaining, and still is... after playing this type of game for so long now... and still playing it ! What happened to my anti-MMO player side ?  It got impressed !!The cutscenes were a nice feature that propels you directly into the current conflict (linked to the departure of the fellowship...and following right down in their footsteps is totally great. The feeling of being part of the LOTRO world was achieved greatly with all those characters and storyline. The sense of my character being known to this fake-world was cool.  There is also an outrageous number of QUESTS ! From main quests, side quests, skill quests, deeds quests, trait quests to crafting quests, I am probably forgeting some.. there is so much.Yes, the graphics are now outdated even with full DirectX11. But it doesn’t get you out of the story that much. If you like the Lore, you will probably find it cartoony acceptable.What was the most entertaining to me, was the fact that I can take out the time I want in the LOTRO world to do whatever I wish. Roleplay with some stangers, do quests, craft, manage my house and garden decorations, look up the price of some useless item that some people desire. (Of course, in other MMO's you can also lose your time the way you want) But the most appreciable assets in those moments; The sounds ! Everytime I hooked up my headphones.. I was submerged in the wild environment, the ambiance and the tension felt everywhere in the wilderness.LOTRO convinced me where no other MMO could. The sound ! Especially in Moria... this is where it all began down the hill for me... I became a LOTRO FAN :) in Moria.Before that, It was Lord of the Gatherings ! I hopped in from time to time with a friend or two... running beside them and trying to follow up their leveling. Which was a pain ! Since they were so much into it and were leveling Fast in VIP mode.OK Now we get to VIP and the Free to Play thing.YES, before... believe it or not. IT was not FREE. You had to pay the game, and subscribe for the experience. I was not playing at that time.It then became f2p. Which is a matter of attracting new players to try the game and hopefully, make them pay to achieve their pleasure.It is FREE totally up to lvl 20... then you get the point, that if you want to continue and level up... or have some fun in this world, you will have to grind a lot of time to achieve some goals and earn some turbine points (In game store currency) to buy some useful needed quests pack or stuff. Yup, it’s a business world, where programmers need to eat, and infrastructure guys needs funds to host the game on Technical Horsepower, If you want a free computer, free energy, free internet, free games... well... Then you better get out and change this world to accept FREE as a currency. In the meantime, you won’t have any time left to play your favorite game, you will probably be outside growing your food and waiting the harvest to exchange some for... lets say... a computer! :)Is this game entertaining? YES, to me it is! And it is well worth some money. I bought some Turbine points with real money when there was a double bonus points event... and then waited for the 30-50% rebate on quests pack that comes along once or twice a year... It was well worth the ride. (More than VIP)4th factor: Replayability:Yes you can replay over and over again. Let’s say with another character.  There is so much quests... that you can probably live a lot of adventures in a completely different manner.The rest will be similar, in traits, deeds, skills and all with a slight new flavor. It's the same Game.5th factor. Price over time spent:If you pay 60$ per year for the new call of duty and you only play the campaign like me... well it is a shame. The game is much more satisfying online versus people. You can frag for a full year ! 60$ for 300 hours of game play.But for me... Since 3d Shooters is not my Main Genre, I play the campaign for 15 hours, do some LAN party with friends... and then put it on the shelf. 60$ for 40 hours ! Not the most satisfying purchase.In LOTRO, I spent about 70$ and got... if one level is 3-4 hours roughly...  320 hours since 2010 and I am not done at all with my purchases !  (Played with independent Client)It is well worth the run.If you are a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, you will probably like it even more. Besides that, it is well balanced in simplicity and complexity and its pace follows comfortably your period of learning the game.It's a MMO, you may be charmed by the genre or you may hate it. But from an adventurous point of view, even with my hate of MMO, I still have fun in this game.Conclusion, LOTRO is good, and for myself, my adventures continue mainly because of the subject world; Lord of the Rings, and its outstanding engineering sounds that keeps me coming back into the woods.

												I played beta and launch of this game... there was a lot of potential and it was very pretty at the time of launch- especially considering it was competing with the very cartoony look of WoW. There were some really interesting, unique features to the game as well as beautiful environments that were neat to explore as part of LotR lore...I popped back into the game, just to check out the f2p spin and see how things have evolved. On the upside, the game doesn't suck and all of my characters were still there. The down-sides, however, unfortunately, make me not recommend it. From my perspecitve, the game hasn't evolved (possibly de-volved), is a bit dated, continues to be a bit clunky, and is still not quite intuitive (coming from a veteran MMO player: EQ, SWG, WoW, Vanguard, Eve, AoC, CoH/V, DC Universe, D&DO, ESO, Entropia, SWTOR, blah blah blah). Most importantly, it seems barren now... so, if I want a LotR fix I'll just play one of the quality single player titles to get the same jolt... or maybe Skyrim. If I want a solid MMO (with actual players to interact with) to swing a sword around in, I'd spend my time and money on ESO or WoW. But, for other people, I guess if you really hate on WoW or ESO for whatever reason and really need an MMO fix in a similar genre or are REALLY into LotR and are willing to pay to play, it might be worth it. All of that said, it really is free to play at the start- so trying it and not liking it will only cost you the time to download, the space on your hard drive (temporarily), and however much time you put in. If you have time to burn and enjoy spending it trying new things, it probably won't be a waste.			"

												I'm a huge Fan of The Lord of the Rings Books and The Movies,  so why not make it the First game I download and play on Steam, it completes the circle, no Pun intended. I'm new to the whole PC gaming style and keyboard gameplay, but what i've seen so far, this game is very Cool, graphics and Word play are very on point, i advise you to use a powerful computer and a good graphics card to fully experience the gameplay and to see the World on which you journey threw. The Story line is very much the same with the books and movies. with a few side missions that adds a little more spice to your gameplay. Would i recommend the this Game, Yes i would, i'm true game player, that spans from everygame console, and Pc games (which i used a remote control), so i fully appreciate the time and effort WB GAMING put into this game, the ADD-ONs are spot on, SO the game is free, but of course to get your hands on the Add-On's , you must shell out some cash, no Biggie!  So get your hands on this game, if you haven't already. That is all...			"

												Boot up the game after installing it, tells me to log in with a Turbine account.Okay, I have one of these from a long time ago, it should work.Enter details, no subscribtion to LOTRO.Okay, go to their website to see what's going on.No information given at all.Look it up, find a steam page. Find out that if your account is older than LOTRO being F2P, you can't access the game and don't get to play it without making a new account.Uninstalled.Who the hell looked at that, who the hell thought that making it so that people with an old turbine account have to BUY a game that is NO LONGER FOR SALE. Which IDIOT was in charge of quality control? Which IDIOT was in charge of making sure that things work? For a company to just have that big of a blindspot is completely absurd, game can't be that good if that's the kind of crap you have to put up with JUST TO PLAY THE GAME.			"

												Although often feeling like a micro-transaction dominated world, LOTR has done what it can to survive in the changing climate of MMOs. The game will eventually require money to be spent in order to progress meaningfully and also to reduce frustrations in basic gameplay aspects such as gold caps and inventory slots. Despite it's repetetive enemy models and requirement for endless travelling, LOTR really shines in bringing Tolkien's world to life. The game has very accurate depictions of characters and tales from the mythology, whilst providing an outstanding feeling of immersion through a beautiful soundtrack and carefully crafted environments. Some of its systems such as music composition and housing make it one of the best MMOs out there for atmospheric and paced gameplay.			"

												I ""HIGHLY"" recommend this game it has such a vas class option going anywhere from Tank to Heal to a little of both. i personally love the  Lore Master Class the Minstrel Class and the Rune Keeper Class, these 3 classes are epic as a LM you can be virtualy unstoppable because you have the ability to summon a pet to your side to help you with your quest thru the story where as the Minstrel not only has has the power to do Major Dps but can Also heal now the down side of the Minstrel is you can do wither or but not both at the same time, the RK on the other hand also can do Major Dps and heal but unlike the Minstrel the RK can do both at the same time. The down side of the RK is you have to use real money to purchase it from the lotro store. Now if you are a tank you coud go with the gaurdian this Class has the upmost amount of Hp i think the most ive seen in HP is 21k at max rank this class is ment for group stile playing made to take all the damage while dealing lots of Dps, nwo if you like to help the group out and do alot of DPS then i recoment the Champion this is almost like the gaurdian but doesnt have as much HP this class is set more towards high amount of DPS with little dameage taken good for group still playing, if you are mre of a ranged player and not for the up close and personal then i recmend the hunter class it your usaual bow and sword class good for ranged DPS but in this game it has a major ability that everbody needs this ability is swift travel witch basically mean that you dont have to use a stable you will have a skill that will let you go straight to the desired location the last class this game has is for more a quite sneak around play this calss is the burglar this class uses more of trickster skills to throw the enemy.  this game is a well worth it game i again recomend it and i hop ethis helps you guys/girls out and enpires you to play this game, if you do decide to play this game and start to have problems or need help add Themusicguy that is my toons name and i will be happy to help			"

												As MMOs go, The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar isn't half bad. Although it's gone through several permutations over the course of its lifespan, it is currently a free-to-play title with a very hefty amount of actually-free material. As a man, hobbit, elf, or dwarf, you must rise up and begin fighting back against the various forces of Sauron, indirectly aiding the Fellowship of the Ring as they make their march to Mount Doom. Fans of the LotR universe and devout Silmarillion enthusiasts will have a lot to enjoy here; the world is packed to the gills with obscure names and lore trivia, and seeing every square inch of Tolkien's world fleshed out is actually rather thrilling (according to the massive Tolkien nerd I live with anyway). As a moderate fan of the books, I personally found the world better designed and more atmospheric than most MMO worlds, but nothing to freak out about.As for the gameplay, it's solid and incorporates many of the best features of modern MMOs. Forming groups for skirmishes and dungeons is easy, quest tracking is convenient, and inventory management is a breeze... assuming you're willing to pay a couple bucks here and there for content. Playing the purely free version of the game is a little more aggravating, but still playable and enjoyable. You miss out on some inventory space, some class options, and eventually a lot of quest access, but by then you'll know if you like the game, and as game costs go everything is pretty reasonable.Along with the usual assortment of MMO quest grinding (so many boar heads and bear butts for strangely insistent random strangers...), there's also a surprisingly substantial Epic quest chain for each race, making up the actual storyline for the game as your character works with Strider, Gandalf, and many others to save the world from the generic eeeeeevil of Mordor. While I hesitate to call it ""gripping"", it's a hell of a lot better than it could have been. The only aspect of the game I found lacking was the near-absence of PvP. While players who pay the monthly fee for VIP status get access to a MONSTER PLAY mode, it seems a bit essential to include that in base play.I could go on, but there's not much to say here beyond it being a solid, high-budget, free-to-play MMO that provides decent returns for your investment in the expansion packs, and which fans of a particular legendary fantasy writer may go nuts over. I had a good two weeks tromping from Shire to Moria, and I'm throwing in the towel without a bad taste in my mouth. For an MMO, that's a hell of a lot better than average.			"

												I've been playing this game since 2008. (We're talking back when f2p wasn't even an option and Moria was the newest thing)Ever since the game went f2p I've seen so many butt hurt people complain about how it ""cost money"" to do anything...News flash, Bree, The Shire, Thorins hall, and... The Elf starter area (wow... did I really just draw a blank on that? 20 Elf characters and I can't remember it... FAIL RJ!) are all free to do every quest and deed for.Here's the trick, I once did the math and to get the amount of Terbine Points needed to get your presious upgrades wouldn't take that many run throughs.The issue? I seem to be the only one crazy enough to do this. (it also helps that due to how long I've played I know the fastest way to do this :P)[Elf/RK done. Tutorial will always take 30minutes to 1 hour no matter how you speed run it but after that if you do things fast enough, you can get the Elven Deeds done easy... of course my idea of easy and yours are likely different...Anyway, I'll just be enjoying my free upgrades while you cry babies can't figure out my ways of doing things.Play the game, if you like it enough spend the money needed for the level upgrades and such (else you'll be stuck at lv 50 as a max :P) or spend the time and rerolls it takes to get the terbine points to do so.Long story short, See you in the Moors.~ A Warg/Elven Hunter who will remain unamedP.S. First thing I'd buy with Terbine points would be character slots, you f2p players don't get as many as I did :)Yes I'm f2p but I got a few bonuses for having subscribed before I was f2p :)			"

												Lord of the Rings Online, or Lotro is one of the older Mmorpgs out there. Like the name of the title suggest, this game plays out in Middle Earth where you can play as a Hobbit, Human, Dwarf or Elf. Each race has its own background story but will eventually merged in to a in my opinion Rich storyline where you help the people of middle earth and the fellowship of frodo and his companions. If you are a fan of the movies like i am then it won't take long to fully emerge your self in to this game and even learn new things about Middle Earth it self.So...? What can you expect from this game then? As for Dungeons and Raids nothing to challenging, wich in my opinion isn't all that bad, i have seen other games where they make it so damn hard people just rage quit or can't be bothered to play it after a hard day of work or school. What is new (mostly for ppl that used to play this game back in the days) is that deeds (kill for instance 200 orcs or complete 30 quests) are much more important then before and for ppl that are looking for a quick breeze through the game for max level and then hope to enjoy the end gaming this is made possible (unless you invest alot of $ in the online shop)For player activity? I Am playing on the europe server Snowborn and there is lots of people online, never had a moment where i didn't meet someone while playing.Free To Play version of the game. You may or may not ask you self, Is it playable with out spending a Dollar. The answer is NO. Some of the expansions aren't free, and if you're not in the mood to grind deeds with multiple character you miss out on a lot of coin that is needed to unlock many things in the online shop. Ultimately whether or not you choose to play this game is up to you. Like i said above, It maybe free but you gone spend money in the end anyway, that is if you want to see and be able to do everything this game has to offer. Other then the financial aspect its still on of the better online games out there and i'm sure with the release on steam the game will get a boost in player numbers, so in the end i give it a YES on recommendations even with cash you most likely gonna have to spend.

Dont even need a top of the range laptop to play it but still enjoying its beauty.  Crafting system is clean and works well, Auction House is well presented and the game mechanics (such as emotes) really are immersive.  At least 9.5/10 and would recommend anyone to buy it... oh and get VIP!			"

Nearly every function in this game is locked to unsubbed (f2p members).-You can run out of quests a lot forcing you to do power levelling.-Alternatives to running out of quests is doing a different zone which can be unlocked only with using the real money currency.-Repeatable lags on servers.

												To start off, Im recommending people to LOOK at the game, and not as much as, this is a fantastic game!! Really, this game is huge, vast, and will let you have hundreds of hours of playing time....trying to figure it out. While it is a very good MMORPG, it has its ups and downs. Let me name the ups and downs of the game and then you'll see the issue's.Ups: Great graphics, nice world, lots of towns all different and unique in some way. Crafting, class's, Ive seen some players look like knights, on a horseback. really feels like a Medieval England world. Sadly no castle's round Bree. Chatting is nice. Filter blocks bad stuff while it lets good stuff through. The looting system is one-of-a-kind, PvP, PvE, and you can even try out the Monster Play for a change of pace. The PvP is nice, and the PvE is also gonna be a critical role as you progress.If your the type that enjoys getting online, making online friends, joining groups, battling monsters, players, exploring different landscapes, and socializing, your probably thinking, whats the issue's? This sounds FANTASTIC!! Well let me now show you the downs of the game.Downs: Too much lag. Especially going into the towns. And towns are where your gonna buy n sell, meet the characters to progress through the story, and mail letters to players. Ive uninstalled two games to see if it would help. It helped, but still a little laggy. Next, the class videos, where it shows what each class is like, is SOO laggy, and usually in some battle/land area where your not gonna be for a long time. Plus it dont show you what weapons you can and cant have. So, you choose a class that sounds good. You complete the tutorial, and are ready to equip that shield you got awhile back. Oh wait, you cant cause its not available for your class. Wouldv'e been nice to know that ahead of time. And weapons aint the only thing lacking instructions. You get some dye to change your armour's colors. You can spend real money for extra amounts. Oh wait, it never said how to use it exactly. But they'll gladly let you spend money on it. How bout a horse? It says visit some guy in Bree-land for a starter horse. But wait! Whats this? No instructions where to find this random guy in a 10+ mile land? And without a horse, it takes ALOT LONGER to get anywhere. Oh and real money is needed to buy a riding trait. Take a LONG time to earn the points to buy the trait. Oh and some lands cost money to unlock.Ive found an active server on my fourth try. Its called Gladden. An active server will be important. According to some players I met in a kinship, they say level 40-50 is where your gonna have to spend some money to progress. I cant say thats true for certain however. By now, I'd say its safe to say, ""free to play"" needs a fine print saying ""until a certain point"" though it still leaves alot to run around and see...until it gets boring. My final overall thought: look at game, find an active server(Gladden) and spend hundreds of hours trying to figure it out. If you figure it out, and got money, you have hundreds of hours to look forward to. If not, hundreds of hours trying to figure it out down the drain. Oh and dont get discouraged when the usual ""new player bug"" pops up 45 seconds into the game. Just relog. To me, feels like alot of potential going down the drain.REVIEW UPDATE: It seems LOTRO has a rather dedicated and very loyal following of players, judging by the other reviews. However, when they say it still has an ""active community"" they either mean seeing no new players, every once and awhile some chat through the world chat box, seeing 2 players on through the week, with one of the 2 being AFK(Away From Keyboard) and then seeing a ""crowd"" of 4-7 over the weekend, means ""active to them. It  dont sound exactly ""active"" to me. Though on Gladden I have seen lots of new players, and lots of chat through the world chat. Recently, however, even Gladden was rather player-less, but world chat filled. Some places even on Gladden are quiet as a grave. Unless of course they've all gone to another, far-off region where new players needing help wont get to. Or they are all sitting on the LOTRO official website on there forums/community or something like that. I cant say for sure. The game is ""ancient"" by MMO standards, and even the movies have been out awhile, with one last final movie to look forward to. Reason I even out the ""thumbs up"" sign was in the hope maybe it'd encourage new players to help clarify the confusion this game creates within itself.			"

												Despite my time in this, I really love it. I have gone through stages of playing getting stuck and quiting througout this games life. I've recently been picking it up again, though on Steam and would like for all of those RPGMMO lore loving fans out there to know, This Game Is F*&$ing Amazing, if you can get past the wierd controls and being underleveled, (becuase This game is more then a few years old.) Pay to play and pay to win? No such thing while it does help to get the bonuses of the in game devil deals known as micro transactions, you can just play level up get better gear do more quests, grind, etc. The story at the beginging for almost all races goes from 0 to 100 real fast. Great game for LoTR lovers though will♥♥♥♥♥♥on your knowledge of the world.			"

												Hmmm, where to start?  OK, if you're an old-school WoWer then you'll love this (after you get over the graphics).  If you like the current dumbed-down WoW then you'll struggle to pick up LOTRO.  There's simply not as much hand-holding as WoW, but in ways that's better as you have to really get into the game (not just endlessly run raids and dungeons as in WoW nowadays).  And you really can play to level cap for free (I've met people in game that have done so).PROS: Crafting system is good after you get the hang of it, and you really can make better items than the drops at the same level.  The auction house system is good too.  And having your own home can be fun.  People are as friendly as they used to be on WoW and I haven't seen a single farmer bit yet.CONS: It is free-to-play BUT it is very much structured to make playing without buying TPs (Turbine Points) as annoying as possible.  For a start, there is the 2 gold pieces money cap - you need TPs to remove that.  And you can hit 2GP in an hour's play.  Yes, you can eran TPs but it's sloooooow.  And fellowships (forming a party) is a pain and you really need to make sure your fellow fellows know what they are doing.  I got to level 23 without dying, joined a fellowship for a dungeon and died almost immediately.  The housing system can leave you miles from where the action is so you'll probably end up buying and selling several homes.Try it! "

												Lord of the Rings Online is definitely an MMO game where the journey is far more important than the end goal. If your focus is on levelling as quickly as possible, skipping the quest lore, you're missing out on a great deal in this game. Although you can take shortcuts with money, you can earn TP through time and effort in-game to buy things from the store, such as new areas. The game definitely rewards having multiple characters, and the variety of the playstyles of the different classes makes each interesting to play. The most important part for me, however, has to be the setting of the game. I was genuinely excited to explore this amazing world, and it really brought the world from Tolkein's books alive for me. There was a sense of wonder and awe as soon as I begun in Ered Luin, and it hasn't diminished for me, even after many hundreds of hours in Middle Earth.			"

												It has tab target hotkey combat which I have grown to hate, and I'm getting a bit sick of Fantasy games, but this game was made by people who love and respect the original books. The material the game is based on was written by a well-respected literature professor, and this shines through in the setting and different areas when compared to similar games; I think the Shire is probably the most relaxing place I've ever been to in an MMO. The story missions and dungeons were very immersive and were set cleverly alongside the storyline of the books. I had lots of fun and met some very cool people. It's had player housing for a long time, which most other games strangely didn't seem to pick up on until recently. Graphics are starting to look pretty dated by today's standards, and from what I've seen of the free model it probably makes more sense to just subscribe if you're going to put a lot of hours in (the bulk of the time I played was before f2p and being available on Steam). But still worth a look in my opinion.			"

												I cannot speak for the game as a truly Free To Play experience, having been a Lifetime subscriber since the beginning.  Nor can I give any inclination into the Raids or larger group play that comes at end level.What I can tell you, however, that this is a truly rich game world that can really suck you in.  The various ways to progress are immense.  Bar the Mines of Moria expansion, which I found a slog, this game has never been tedious.  The landscape is rich and varied.  I've lost count of the number of times I travelled into areas far over my level just to explore.Arguably the game has got easier over the years, with the map practically pointing you directly to the quest objective (rather than some vague area) but it does help speed your progression.  And, I guess, you can switch off the help.I do not think you could find this game as entertaining if you aimed to spend zero on it.  It would undoubtedly be more of a grind than I found Aion.  You need to purchase the quest packs.  The Epic Quest line is good, but some of the zone quest lines are equally fantastic.And, no matter how hard I try to utilise a different Starter area, I always come back to The Shire.  The tranquillity of the area is made even more beautiful when you go further and further afield.			"

												I've spent a lot of time on this game, but I prefer to run it directly than run through steam so it didn't show the correct playtime. The game is fun and rich in content. You can visit many places of interest of middle earth though the map have only reached Rohan. But it's updating pretty fast, maybe we'll get to Mordor 2 years later? The graphics are good, but it's still feeling outdated a little. Go play on some populated servers. It's free to play. When you reach some locked quests, you can just buy the expansion that contains the quests. And it's pretty balanced. Just try it out, and playing alone isn't fun for me, I don't know about others.If you're a LotR fan, and you haven't play this yet, then you're missing out a lot!Go try it with one or two of your friends. MMOs are always better when you play with others~			"

												when you entered you will find best community and ofcourse best epic quests with amazing maps full with beauty of middle earth and you will have many best friends i mean real friends and good mmorpg players they dont insult you or they dont trolling your questions on global or kinship chat , they are not leave raid or fellowship just for a few wipe opposite if somethings wrong they call extra help from their friends or they change the toon, your kinship mates dont take charge for crafts or items because you are friends! and when you ask help for craft on glff everybody try to help you and craft items for you without fee! this part of is kind of dreamy...but one day sauron type greedy warner bros involved this amazing story with full of hunger of money and the turbine with full of mistakes for example 10mn long raids and unlimited farming mode and bugs and expensive expension pack without no raids in it i cant describe their money hunger if i need to give a example they even sell lvl50 character -with full of item and virtue ready to enter the moria- on store to make money !!!!they dont care players p2p or f2p and f2p part is a lie if you dont buy maps your only choose is farming skirmishes or finding a friend for farming dungeons!they are broking game over and over again and they even didnt know what is the problem and how they can fixed so game closing like a few days and so many apology to earn more time to fix it and the last option giving you a turbine point as a gift for extra day to fixes... i still love lotro because of community and recomending just for those players! join lotro and see the best mmorpg players at any age from anywhere of world !!!!

												Absolutely a fantastic game after re-vamp of the classes and polishing the world. This game has unrivalled atmosfear!I am truly impressed by this game, and for the very first time since it's release I have high hopes of raching end level tus experiencing my favourite fantasy city when they release it in an expansion: Minas Tirith!I always met the wall around level 30 before revamp; levels got slow, and the ""induction"" time, which are much less noticeable now, became unbearing.This game is now a strong 8/10; would be a dead-sure 10/10 if there was so that we could create a character on the ""dark side"" and level it up in it's own zones; PVMP doe's not really stir my interest in the way game is, but as a PvE game it surely is a gem.

												LOTRO is a good solid game for LOTRO fans, for new players is might be alittle harder to come to but over all you'l get there ,the story is great and i havint even gotten that far yet but it does have outdated graphics. Graphics dosint mean the game isint good or anything, just that mabey afew rich textures here and afew rich textures there wouldint hurt. Over all i would recommend trying the game at least because you can really get hooked if your in the mood. In my honest opinion i think the team should step it up, get more updates!, not so much the lore but other things that you guys have been wanting to do for awhile!.			"

												I ""HIGHLY"" recommend this game it has such a vas class option going anywhere from Tank to Heal to a little of both. i personally love the  Lore Master Class the Minstrel Class and the Rune Keeper Class, these 3 classes are epic as a LM you can be virtualy unstoppable because you have the ability to summon a pet to your side to help you with your quest thru the story where as the Minstrel not only has has the power to do Major Dps but can Also heal now the down side of the Minstrel is you can do wither or but not both at the same time, the RK on the other hand also can do Major Dps and heal but unlike the Minstrel the RK can do both at the same time. The down side of the RK is you have to use real money to purchase it from the lotro store. Now if you are a tank you coud go with the gaurdian this Class has the upmost amount of Hp i think the most ive seen in HP is 21k at max rank this class is ment for group stile playing made to take all the damage while dealing lots of Dps, nwo if you like to help the group out and do alot of DPS then i recoment the Champion this is almost like the gaurdian but doesnt have as much HP this class is set more towards high amount of DPS with little dameage taken good for group still playing, if you are mre of a ranged player and not for the up close and personal then i recmend the hunter class it your usaual bow and sword class good for ranged DPS but in this game it has a major ability that everbody needs this ability is swift travel witch basically mean that you dont have to use a stable you will have a skill that will let you go straight to the desired location the last class this game has is for more a quite sneak around play this calss is the burglar this class uses more of trickster skills to throw the enemy.  this game is a well worth it game i again recomend it and i hop ethis helps you guys/girls out and enpires you to play this game, if you do decide to play this game and start to have problems or need help add Themusicguy that is my toons name and i will be happy to help			"

												I cannot speak for the game as a truly Free To Play experience, having been a Lifetime subscriber since the beginning.  Nor can I give any inclination into the Raids or larger group play that comes at end level.What I can tell you, however, that this is a truly rich game world that can really suck you in.  The various ways to progress are immense.  Bar the Mines of Moria expansion, which I found a slog, this game has never been tedious.  The landscape is rich and varied.  I've lost count of the number of times I travelled into areas far over my level just to explore.Arguably the game has got easier over the years, with the map practically pointing you directly to the quest objective (rather than some vague area) but it does help speed your progression.  And, I guess, you can switch off the help.I do not think you could find this game as entertaining if you aimed to spend zero on it.  It would undoubtedly be more of a grind than I found Aion.  You need to purchase the quest packs.  The Epic Quest line is good, but some of the zone quest lines are equally fantastic.And, no matter how hard I try to utilise a different Starter area, I always come back to The Shire.  The tranquillity of the area is made even more beautiful when you go further and further afield.			"

I can say it is PROBABLY fun to play with a load of your friends and go on quests but whenever i ask if anyone in my group if they want to do something they tell me to lvl up to 30... 30, come on why should i even try to go to 30 if its NO FUN GETTING THERE.......*sigh* but i cant beat the game up about thiese things too much the game i beautifully intertwined with the books and the design is very nice, theres a massive map and is very compelling to go there, but trying to jet there is full of waiting and long drawn out tasks, i mean i shouldnt be waiting to get somewhere in an ""open world game"". but to sum all this uo i think its good to play if you have a CRAP TONE of time on your hands and are good at lvl'in up it could be fun so im going to leave this up to you and keep my voting at yes.

												Firstly, I have been playing this game on and off for almost 5 years. I have spent more than 1000 hours on it and I have experienced every part of the content it has to offer. No other MMORPG had me coming back like this one did, but the fact is that the game is not so popular these days, yes, you can find lots of people to play it with, but compared to 3-4 years ago.. it is dead. I started playing again, two weeks ago, after a little break to see how the game evolved with the new content that is available right now. Endgame is really good with the new instances from Gondor, epic story is in North Ithilien, getting ready to go into Mordor which is exciting, but sadly, the game got really grindy and by grindy I do not mean grinding instances and raids which is fun, it is about gathering hundreds of flowers to exchange for armour and doing Featured Instances once per day to get recipes for essences you need to put on the slots in the armour. Daily quests exist too and they get boring after 2 weeks of doing them on a daily basis. Also, take into account that if you want to play this game to its fullest you will need to subscribe for 1 month to remove gold cap and unlock traits and bags. PVP is boring, coming from a player who is mostly looking to PVP rather than PVE. Creeps are in a good position right now and freeps just wont come to the Ettenmoors to fight, now that it is challenging. Also, everyone plays the FOTM classes which leads to the Moors being stacked with 30 creeps while the freeps are on the stairs of GV afking. As someone who plays this game, I surely recommend it to you because it has one of the best communities in the gaming world, everyone is nice and will help you. I will end this by saying that this game has the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen and it is truly a superb experience to see every location in the book and movie, to fight Mordirith, Saruman, the Nazgul, Mumaks and so on. I will forever play this, even though I cannot play it for more than two months  without a break anymore.			"

												Great MMO consisting of a generic combat system with great story telling elements and questing. There is a ton of content includng expansions, raids, and even a unique PvP (PvMP). It is technically free to play but you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. It is outdated compared to newer MMOs but it is still being updated and expanded. My personal favorite MMO to date.			"

												Playerbase is great, very friendly and willing to help in any situation. Crafting system balanced, makes every craft appealing with ups and downs. Moderate battle system, nice animations but pretty basic battles. Nice dungeon system though. Would recommend for newbies to MMORPGs, LotR fans, and experienced players willing to work with people of different ages and skills.EDIT 9/24/14: Extremely P2W when over level 50. However, Turbine Points (real money) can be earned in game, even though it is very slow. I wouldn't recommend investing too much time in the game, but it's worth a try, I guess. Somewhat. Ish.			"

In LOTRO this couldn't happen. I am constantly joining instance fellowships and raids if I am 2-3 lvl behind or not with optimal gear. And nobody will say anything against that. The entire community is totally helpful and understanding. I hope that the game will be there at least for 2-3 more years. It deserve it!			"

												It's a pretty conventional MMORPG, but the Middle Earth theme makes it especially enjoyable.  Free-to-play model is a bit restricting but you can work around that by earning Turbine Points in game (partly by natural progression in the game, but you can grind for more) without spending money. All the character classes do feel like LotR and not some generic fantasy MMO, and the instances are a lot of fun as long as you are on a well-populated server. I think they did a great job with the various game environments, from the peaceful Shire to the dreaded wastes of Angmar.			"

												First off, i don't play this game through Steam. So my hours are not correct. I play this game since the launch in 2012, loved it and hated it at times. Many changes have been made to this game throughout the years, which is fine, but Turbine makes this game easier and easier with every update. In it's current state it's designed for the casual solo player who likes to spend 30 minutes a day questing, exploring or chatting with other people. There is almost no group play at all anymore. If you are looking for a MMO where you can raid and do instances with others, this is not the MMORPG for you anymore.If you like LOTR, and you just like to follow the story, this might be a good MMORPG for you.If you like roleplaying, this might be the MMORPG for you as there is 1 RP server and they sometimes do RP events.Also, note it's 'free'. But if you want to get to the level cap you will have to buy a whole lot of expansions and quest packs to get there, unless you want to kill millions of mobs to reach your goal.Oh, and the 'PvP' in this game is a joke. Very unbalanced and it's been like that since day 1. With every update the overpowered side changes, but never a way between overpowered and useless.			"

												There are some great MMOs out there.....this is not one of them. This game initally is very good but rapidly it becomes quite annoying because you need to buy the DLC to continue the story line, any ""Help"" the game offers is piece meal and there little if any voice acting and its not so much as a Lord of the Rings MMORPG as a Lord of the Rings take on World of Warcraft.I love Lord of the Rings I really do. This I hate. And it gets better, now they add little helpful hints that (if you read between the lines) say ""HAHA Screw you, you wont be able to advance the story cause....PAYWALL!!!"" And they are not very subtle in the fact that they screw you over. They are in essence operating on the basis that there game is SO GOOD that every one would want to pay for the DLC. HAHA...no.

												I, unfortunately, can not recommend LOTRO.  I really want to, but can't.  It's lots of fun, don't get me wrong, especially when played with a few friends.  But the hamhanded attempts to wring money out of the game by Turbine will be kicking the back of your seat the whole way.Look, I understand that a Free to Play game still has to make some money for upkeep costs and whatnot, but NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THE ORIGINAL LEVEL CAP FROM 7 YEARS AGO IS A SLAP IN THE FACE.If you end up playing you will find out you can reach level 35-40, depending on how much grind you do.  The original level cap was 50.Again, I'm not saying that they should give away the expansions, thats what makes all the long term money, but not letting players reach the original base level cap, and without telling them in advance, is honestly a terrible thing to do.It has has left a bad taste in my mouth that will likely be my last inpression of this once fun game.I guess if I had to sum this up it would be...Fun, but don't let the ""Free to Play"" tagline fool you.  In order to play more than 1/3rd of the game you have to sink close to 70 bucks into it for expansion and quest packs.			"

In LOTRO this couldn't happen. I am constantly joining instance fellowships and raids if I am 2-3 lvl behind or not with optimal gear. And nobody will say anything against that. The entire community is totally helpful and understanding. I hope that the game will be there at least for 2-3 more years. It deserve it!			"

												This game is a shell of it's former self. It was once great, even better before free to play, or so I've heard. The quest packs and expansions were completely understandable, as they have to make money somehow. They screwed it all over though. They want you to pay for everything.I started hating it when it recently tried to copy everything WoW did. They completely rebuilt the game. I loved it, absolutely loved it. Why did they ruin it, you ask? They wanted more money. MORE money. They figured if they changed everything and made it like WoW that people would come over and play it. Who thinks that? People like new things, not old, recycled gameplay and mechanics. Worst of all, you can just buy your way through the game. Why must companies insist on doing this crap?Just like WoW, this game is going to kill itself. Don't play it. It was much better before they screwed all the people who played it before.

												Should be called Nickle and Dime of the rings Online, IMO. They aren't content with you subscribing to their game, you have to unlock additional features by spending real money, even after purchasing all of the expansions. Get 50 gold in the mail from your friend? Not so fast, we're going to hold 45 of that gold hostage until you unlock the currency cap. The questing system is essentially 300 variations of ""kill 8 orcs(or goblins, or collect 8 things from dead orcs)"" mixed with other useless sidequests that add no value to the story. Whoever did the quests in this game was tragically lazy. None of the quests are bundled, you can do several quests in an area, turn them all in, and the quest giver or the next quest giver will just give you quests in the same area that you could have gotten while you were in the area the first time. The world is great, it's very large and detailed. There are hundreds of towns and cities everywhere. This game could have been a AAA mmorpg if it wasn't for the nickle and dime cash shop and whoever designed the quests.			"

Check out the full review here[uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]In this game you can play as a dwarven minstrel. If you don't understand the appeal of this right away and start gushing everywhere, I recommend turning back immediately because you are not going to like this game.The Lord of the Rings lore is translated fairly well from the movies to the game. It's the standard MMO fair of hacky, slashy, grindy, and skip all the dialogue quest completion but with a little twist. You can also grow crops, harvest furs, tan hides, make armor, prepare arrows, and a whole host of other things. It's still grindy but it attempts to own the grind in a match I haven't seen since Runescape. But eventually you'll get bored of your profession and want to do something else, and that's when Lord of the Rings Online starts grinding down my patience.Most of the interesting quests are locked behind paywalls. I don't mind developers locking additional content and adventures behind a pay barrier, but at least don't lock all quests within a certain level range behind a pay wall. If you want to be a subscription based game, just be a subscription based game. If you want to be freemium with a subscription model after a certain level, do that. This is just poor business practices.Finally I guess I have to talk about the PvP. It's a neat little idea where you have playable monsters and heroes fighting one another, but it turns into a mess when you realize that most of the monster races are locked behind further paywalls and the heroes are all more qualified to kick your♥♥♥♥♥than you are to do anything against them. Then you'll run into the other problem where there aren't any heroes online to fight because to access the hero side of Lord of the Rings Online you have to reach 95 and pay a fee.The funny part of all of this is that they introduced a balance patch in the game in Update 13 and it took just a couple new patches to break it into pieces.If you're a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan who doesn't mind the grind, go right ahead. Otherwise I wouldn't waste your time.			"

Posted: December 13, 2016
												First off, this game is great, for both Tolkien fans and people who haven't even seen the movies. This game has everything it needs to be a great MMO. Here are some more details with pros and cons:So the best part of this game is easily the story, I play for the stories. The Epic Quests are generally the best, but there are some really cool side quest lines too which are fun to play along. It's also cool to have Monster Play, to be able to conquer outposts and hunt down Free Players is quite satisfying. The classes, at least from what I've seen, are all unique and fun to play, each in their own way, which is cool too. Here's some stuff to keep in mind though.THIS GAME ISN'T TOTALLY FREE. Or at least, if you want to play totally free, it's going to take a TON of effort and a lot of hunting random creatures to fulfill deeds to get LOTRO Points. But there comes a point, after you've finished playing through the Lone Lands and you've played along the Epic Quest series in the North Downs, that you have to buy Evendim to continue the epic story line, which is usually something like 700 LOTRO points, and by that time I had raked up about 600, and there was, luckily a sale going on. But, I'm trying to make the point that in order to continue playing the game you are going to need a lot of LOTRO Points. Aside from that, other cons include the fact that Middle-Earth is too stinking massive and unless you use LOTRO Points to buy yourself a horse, you have to run everywhere, at least until you've discovered all the stablemasters. So that can be pretty boring.But in the end, I still find this game enormously entertaining, You can make it all the way to Level 40 without even needing to worry about buying another region if you follow all the side quests. The story is cool, engaging and original, staying true to Lord of the Rings Canon, while building off of ALL the loose ends that Tolkien left out there to create really cool stories. So yes, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I am a returning player who played LoTRO at time of launch and had many fun times playing with family and friends.  I decided to start fresh with a new account and started leveling a couple toons.  The game and lore are awesome, it has gone casual but for the amount of time I have to throw at a game like this being not so Mt. Dew extreme allow a more relaxing entertainment experience.  If you just want a fun game to go PvP in or surf new content only then I would not recommend this game.  However if you want a hint of old school MMO with a good community and not really interested in level hurdling to new content then this game is worth a play to at least level 30.  I've seen a number of gripes about the cash shop, however you do not need to spend a ton of cash to have an entertaining experience with this game.  It seems that way if you want totally free but I am not naive to think game developers live off good comments and troll hugs.  I threw a few bucks at the steam DLC, picked up the 3 month sub for 30 bucks and having fun!			"

												Should be called Nickle and Dime of the rings Online, IMO. They aren't content with you subscribing to their game, you have to unlock additional features by spending real money, even after purchasing all of the expansions. Get 50 gold in the mail from your friend? Not so fast, we're going to hold 45 of that gold hostage until you unlock the currency cap. The questing system is essentially 300 variations of ""kill 8 orcs(or goblins, or collect 8 things from dead orcs)"" mixed with other useless sidequests that add no value to the story. Whoever did the quests in this game was tragically lazy. None of the quests are bundled, you can do several quests in an area, turn them all in, and the quest giver or the next quest giver will just give you quests in the same area that you could have gotten while you were in the area the first time. The world is great, it's very large and detailed. There are hundreds of towns and cities everywhere. This game could have been a AAA mmorpg if it wasn't for the nickle and dime cash shop and whoever designed the quests.			"

												Nice game, potraying LOTR lore, however the leveling is often boring, and as F2P the game becomes unplayable around level 30.Having said that, I know several friends who have subscribed to the game, and really enjoy it - my advice is, go for it if you don't mind the fees, if you are looking for a F2P, dont touch it.P.S. Yes, I am aware of the deeds and that they were recently made ""easier"" to achieve and thus purchase more content, but its still an icerdible boring grind and is unsustainable, especially as players need to buy a LOT of content in addition to quests, such as mount and increased wealth cap - which makes it better than swtor somewhat, but it will still give you only about 5-6 zones with minimal changes should you play different race/character later on.

												I used to play this game A LOT (back in Shadow of Angmar days) and I witnessed the switch to F2P, which slowly started killing the game. Recently I installed it again just to check up on it and some friends I used to play with. The experience was rather traumatic. My kin (in the past one of the bigger kins on Eldar: Lorebreakers) merely a shadow of its former glory. People say it's difficult to get a party of 6 to do an instance (let alone the buggy raids). Turbine Points required wherever you go and click. Turbine and WB finally succeeded in butchering a great game it used to be. Such a shame.			"

												While the game is wonderful there is a bit to be said about game play lag and rubberbanding.  The lag is so very bad that you can't tell if you are coming, going, or standing still.  My son plays Battlefield on Ultra High with 200 fps but I still can't play in the Ettenmoors and many places in Minas Tirth without rubberbanding or standing while things go by..  I have a year subscription to the game hoping they would finally fix the problems with the collasped servers and installed new equipment.  That didn't seem to work.Bottomline...the game is awesome....if you could actually play without the frustration.  I can't find a similar game, any ideas?			"

This is the game you'd want to have played 8 years ago, but now, there are much better options in mmorpgs. I am playing this game because I am one of the original players from 2007. Until I find a new mmorpg, I'll stay here, but I do not recommend people buying this game at this point in time. I already bought it, so I might as well play it.			"

												My first MMORPG. I started playing a year ago and am still as in love with it now as I was when I first started playing. Great community and always something fun to do. The epic story line is great and pretty true to Tolkien's vision. As a huge fan of Tolkien, the story line is the most important factor to me in any game/movie/etc. that is Lord of the Rings, and LOTRO does a beautiful job of telling the story and bringing Tolkien's legendarium to life. Great game for those who love LOTR or just having fun.			"

												For lovers of the Lord of the Rings (books moreso than the movies), this game demonstrates its lore and story to the absolute fullest, with certain creative liberties to make it feel more like an MMO too.As a LOTR fanatic myself, I find myself in the beginning areas wanting to scour them completely before moving on to the next one.The graphics are visually pleasing as well, which is really good for a game made in 2007 and how it holds up to today's standards. But there are options to lower it, so users with lower end PCs can enjoy it just as much.Overall, I think it's a very well-made game, my only gripes is that combat does become repetitive, and if you're not a fan of the setting, I think that could get boring for you. For me: 8/10.			"

												Personally, I am a big Lord of the Rings fan. This game is outstanding. If you love the story and love mmo's then you will be able to look past it several flaws. One flaw is that this game is free to play. As a free to play user, you are force to spend a massive amount of money to acquire Turbine Points. Eventhough the game allows you to earn them, it takes a substantial amount of time to progress through the game. VIP is definitely the way to go if you can afford the $15/month subscription fee. The many festivals, events, and just the people you meet is enough to make you suspend reality if only for a moment. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is definitely, in my opinion an 8.5!			"

												There are a lot of great MMO's out there. Maybe this has the core concept of being one of them, however it is extremely outdated. The UI, the combat, the graphics, the gameplay. This is an old MMo that feels old. Graphics are one thing, but when I'm playing a MMO and it feels as old as it is (signifying no attempt to modernize) that's when It gets the thumbs down.			"

												This game is great game. Sure there are bugs in the game still but the gameplay itself is great. There is a lot of content to do. And if you wanna do deeding, well it will take awhile of course. But it's a fair trade atleast. sub this game is very good idea if you are up for it. Or you just buy the expensions which would be quad pack and the helms deep one. Don't buy the triple pack here in the store.There is of course pvp, but it's not main of the game excatly. Since the biggest part is pve or raiding and such. But there will be more new content in the future.The things you can do as free to play player. you can go to cap level which lvl 95.

												This game is great game. Sure there are bugs in the game still but the gameplay itself is great. There is a lot of content to do. And if you wanna do deeding, well it will take awhile of course. But it's a fair trade atleast. sub this game is very good idea if you are up for it. Or you just buy the expensions which would be quad pack and the helms deep one. Don't buy the triple pack here in the store.There is of course pvp, but it's not main of the game excatly. Since the biggest part is pve or raiding and such. But there will be more new content in the future.The things you can do as free to play player. you can go to cap level which lvl 95. Get your epic gear. and many other things.even use the mounted combat. Lots of features.Just give it a try i am pretty sure you going like it.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online is a great game, if you are a fan of the franchise. the game follows an epic story line which is based on the books. in a decent DLC, all the classes have been revamped which unfortunately made the game too easy. for example, in the game i have a lvl 95 guardian which is a tank class. i have 28k morale and i soloed a Warband which is a type of mob that roams around the plains of rohan. this warband called ""bethan"" have just under 1m morale and i soloed her when before the undate i wouldnt of dreamed of doing it. this is not a reason why you shouldnt play the game though. the crafting on the game is actually very fun but can be a grind. also if you are looking for a PvP game then this one has PvMP where one side play as the free people and the others as wither Orcs, Uruks, Wargs, Spiders and Trolls. give it a try and as its free and if you like it then i seriously suggest you play for VIP as the bonuses you get from it are very good.

												I never fell for the World of Warcraft hype when it first launched. I've tried several times to jump into it with both feet but failed each time. The game just doesn't have any pull for me. Lord of the Rings Online however is a different story. It's a much more casual MMORPG that doesn't eat up all your time, but still manages to be immersive and works very well with the lore of Tolkiens works. This has been the only MMORPG I ever got hooked on. I first played it at launch and still return to it from time to time. LOVE this game			"

And they housing are very limited in customisation.Well and loads of spawning enemys, not my style, you can se the pattern they are splashed out over the map. Its sad that all this beuty is destryed with to many monsters on every corner of the map.Not really tolkien way of travel.			"

A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. Truly a masterpiece.			"

												Very fun game with a devotion to the LOTR lore. It can be a bit tedious at times, but such is the reality of MMORPG's.A lot of people complain about the community nowadays. But as long as you find the right Kinship, you will find people are extremely helpful.I will admit I am now bored if not done with the game. But that wasn't before I got over 200 hours out of it. It's not perfect, but if you like Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings, and you also like MMORPG's, I'm surprised if this game isn't already in your library. If it isn't, click the ""Play Game"" button.			"

												I love it.The in-game store is a little bit iffy. Pricing is done in a way so you'll need / want to spend more.I can't comment on the free-to-play side of it in terms of classes, I dove straight into a Beorning which costs 900(not exact) TB to unlock one slot or 975 TB something to unlock the class for as many slots as you please.RP servers seem really dead recently, but from those I've seen they're probably with their kinships and guilds, etc. Otherwise it really does feel dead, any player who does show themselves is usually either not talkative, or wants to spar, all. the. time.Features Housing too, which (lowest for me was 950 Silver coins.) does feel a little grindy in terms of getting one. most quests give 1 silver and 90 copper.100 copper - 1 silver.1,000 silver - 1 gold.I'm level 16, played for 15 hours - gold is almost a myth, although I imagine when I reach near the cap it'll seem like it's flowing.Try it.

												7/10 - LOTRO is by far the best free MMO RPG I've played. The community is alive and kicking and the game mechanics are enough to keep you wanting to play for a little while longer than with most MMO RPGs.The quests are well structured. There's an achievement system so you don't feel like you're grinding on the bulk kills. The lore fits somewhere in between the movies and the books. There are alternative gameplay mechanics that fit into the role-play elements, like crafting and farming (literally planting stuff not kills). And it looks pretty good too.It's definitely worth trying out; at least; once. :3			"

												If you're a fan of Middle Earth, and theme park MMOs from the WoW Clone era this is for  you. It distinguishes itself by adding a ton more immersion than most of the genre through things like player written music, naming conventions that match the Lore (""kinship"" instead of ""guild"", ""Fellowship"" instead of ""Party"") and more. Its classes are unique, and do an ""ok"" job of pushing the envelope on the Tank, DPS, Healer trifecta. Pros include one of the only F2P programs that doesn't penalize you for being a F2P player, but instead only rewards you for paying in a fair and balanced way. It also is one of the few MMOs from the era whos community isn't largely toxic. Graphically it is a bit dated, but not nearly as bad as games such as Everquest 2 (there are 3 years between the 2 so not a 100% fair comparison). It is strictly GCD style combat, and the questing while taking you though places and meeting NPCs you'll know from the lore is still of the  ""Gathering Bear Asses"" variety.			"

												Well made game based on Tolkien world. While ist not perfect game, I think that all Tolkien lovers will like it. It has beautifull scenery and even great storyline, different for each playable race. Ypu can play solo, in fellowship (group), it has decent PVP (different from many MMO's), there are dungeons, skirmishes, epic battles you can farm and you can even roleplay on special server if you like. You can even buy house in game and decorate it.However, game is more pay to win, and has some big restricions if you cannot or do not want to pay. I would recommend to subscribe as VIP, so you can enjoy game to the fullest (or at least once spend money in game to became premium member, which has some restrictions lesser). If you want to play for free, Turbine gave us possibility to obtain Turbine Points (in game real money) in game by completing deeds and questing, so it is possible to just farm TP if you have time and will to do so. However, you cannot pay VIP with grinded TP or even became premium. These must be bought with real money.I love this game and don't even mind to pay VIP for it, so I would always recommend LOTRO for all lovers of Tolkien.			"

The servers go offline and online a lot due to the datacenter moves, you would think 10 years in that most of the bugs would be worked out, but, not.  That and players using bots all the time and whatnot, I fear this game is dying. The forums are full of negativity toward Turbine.  It isnt cheap to subscribe, and you get little or no support.There are a huge amount of players that adore this game, but Turbine are killing it.			"

												Completely F2P and definitely worth a shot. Played it for a while, it's a lovely game but I'm not too sure if it's actually worth a monthly subscription. If I remember it right you can become a VIP for like 8 bucks a month, which is cheaper than WoW. The game also has an in-game store in which you can buy all sorts of lovely stuff with Turbine points. You can either earn Turbine points by doing tasks in-game, or if you're lazy you can buy them with money. Anyway, this is an awesome game.			"

												I played this game while reading Lord of the Rings for the first time, and the first 100+ pages match up right with this game. I loved it. Roleplaying was fantastic too. I played as a hobbit and had other taller players laugh and poke fun of me as a hobbit. I'm not short in real life, but it gave me a little bit of little man syndrome for a while. XD			"

												Don't install from Steam.  Go to Standing Stone Games and download from their site.  the game store in the Steam version DOES NOT WORK.You cannot buy anything in game, and you can't activate your pay to play account from the in game store on the Steam version.All in all, just down load it from the developers site.With that said:The game is fantastic, great story and the quests are well done.  Micro-transactions suck and are a bit expencive, but you can earn LOTRO points while playing so you can up-grade your account simply by playing the game.VIP is worth the money (pay-to-play) more so then almost anyother MMO out there.This is the game that made me quit WoW, because it's just better.

But still I keep returning to this game, even though some options cost real money, I dont find that a problem because all the main features are free, if you dont pay real money you wont have a less fun experience. For instance they made the Lore-master class free, which is my favorite class so I was excited to see this happen.Also the movie references are lovely, If you are a fan of the LotR you love the characters you gonna find in this game.

Exploring a world we know so wellIf you're into the whole Middle-Earh genre, then this game is a must-play! Despite simplistic toon-like graphics, and give quest/complete quest/receive reward gameplay the ability to roam throughout Middle-Earth and interact with charaqcters we all know and love is captivating. I think I have an 'Alt' (alternate chartacter) in each of the character classes now and am enjoying levelling them all at the same time. I'm loving the ability to take my time and not rush towards end-game!			"

												Have played it since it's release in 2007 and the Devs are still releasing new content. The community is still thriving if you join the right server (Arkenstone represent). It's also a very welcoming environment for new players, any question you have will be answered. Kins are recruting everyday. There is well over 3000 hours worth of content and quests. Yes, although it is F2P, you still have to buy expansions and quest packs, but they are not expensive and can be bought with points that you earn in the game by doing deeds. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game and will continue to play it for many years to come.			"

												I love it.The in-game store is a little bit iffy. Pricing is done in a way so you'll need / want to spend more.I can't comment on the free-to-play side of it in terms of classes, I dove straight into a Beorning which costs 900(not exact) TB to unlock one slot or 975 TB something to unlock the class for as many slots as you please.RP servers seem really dead recently, but from those I've seen they're probably with their kinships and guilds, etc. Otherwise it really does feel dead, any player who does show themselves is usually either not talkative, or wants to spar, all. the. time.Features Housing too, which (lowest for me was 950 Silver coins.) does feel a little grindy in terms of getting one. most quests give 1 silver and 90 copper.100 copper - 1 silver.1,000 silver - 1 gold.I'm level 16, played for 15 hours - gold is almost a myth, although I imagine when I reach near the cap it'll seem like it's flowing.Try it.

												7/10 - LOTRO is by far the best free MMO RPG I've played. The community is alive and kicking and the game mechanics are enough to keep you wanting to play for a little while longer than with most MMO RPGs.The quests are well structured. There's an achievement system so you don't feel like you're grinding on the bulk kills. The lore fits somewhere in between the movies and the books. There are alternative gameplay mechanics that fit into the role-play elements, like crafting and farming (literally planting stuff not kills). And it looks pretty good too.It's definitely worth trying out; at least; once. :3			"

												If you're a fan of Middle Earth, and theme park MMOs from the WoW Clone era this is for  you. It distinguishes itself by adding a ton more immersion than most of the genre through things like player written music, naming conventions that match the Lore (""kinship"" instead of ""guild"", ""Fellowship"" instead of ""Party"") and more. Its classes are unique, and do an ""ok"" job of pushing the envelope on the Tank, DPS, Healer trifecta. Pros include one of the only F2P programs that doesn't penalize you for being a F2P player, but instead only rewards you for paying in a fair and balanced way. It also is one of the few MMOs from the era whos community isn't largely toxic. Graphically it is a bit dated, but not nearly as bad as games such as Everquest 2 (there are 3 years between the 2 so not a 100% fair comparison). It is strictly GCD style combat, and the questing while taking you though places and meeting NPCs you'll know from the lore is still of the  ""Gathering Bear Asses"" variety.			"

												Well made game based on Tolkien world. While ist not perfect game, I think that all Tolkien lovers will like it. It has beautifull scenery and even great storyline, different for each playable race. Ypu can play solo, in fellowship (group), it has decent PVP (different from many MMO's), there are dungeons, skirmishes, epic battles you can farm and you can even roleplay on special server if you like. You can even buy house in game and decorate it.However, game is more pay to win, and has some big restricions if you cannot or do not want to pay. I would recommend to subscribe as VIP, so you can enjoy game to the fullest (or at least once spend money in game to became premium member, which has some restrictions lesser). If you want to play for free, Turbine gave us possibility to obtain Turbine Points (in game real money) in game by completing deeds and questing, so it is possible to just farm TP if you have time and will to do so. However, you cannot pay VIP with grinded TP or even became premium. These must be bought with real money.I love this game and don't even mind to pay VIP for it, so I would always recommend LOTRO for all lovers of Tolkien.			"

												THis is a great game, with major problems.  It is nearly 10 years old and the expansions are fantastic, however, the bugs are almost intolerable. The servers go offline and online a lot due to the datacenter moves, you would think 10 years in that most of the bugs would be worked out, but, not.  That and players using bots all the time and whatnot, I fear this game is dying. The forums are full of negativity toward Turbine.  It isnt cheap to subscribe, and you get little or no support.There are a huge amount of players that adore this game, but Turbine are killing it.			"

												A perfect game for people who enjoy Tolkien's fantasy world and are willing to engage themselves to an unique adventure through the Middle-Earth. Can be played alone or with friends depenging your own preferences - there aren't too many players on most servers but always enough to find someone to co-op with. I've spent already over 400 hours with this game and I'll probably find myself riding with my war-steed around the newly-updated regions for hundreds, if not thousands of hours.			"

												This is an excellent game, I've put countless hours into it before it was availiable on steam, and I'll put a countless number of more hours into it now that it is on steam.First impressions are not something to look at to appreciate this game, once your done with the rediculous opening quests and reach level 20, that where the real fun begins.

												For fans of the LOTR saga, (and now also the Hobbit saga) this game is right up your street.It captures ALL the moments from the film, be it items, to characters/npcs, or simply landscape/areas.Problem is, thats just about where the fun of the game, ends.It's pretty much the same things that you have to kill, in different zones.Lots of re-skinned and tougher stats for monstes across the world, and it's really sad to see this, but then of course... LOTRO based their game of the old style WoW... You can see it with so many things which are alike with both gamesit's uncanny.From the combat, right down to the crafting system, and everything inbetween.Honestly, getting into a Guild, is normally the way to go with MMO games, as it tends to draw you into the game more, as you form bonds with your guild-mates.However, for me... This is a game that I would actually like to enjoy Solo, and really experience the world and all it has to offer, for myself.Sadly, even doing this though, the fact that there are so many re-skins and multiples of monsters which are boring and dull. (Generic types are Goblins, Orcs, Spiders, Wolves... etc)... That was enough for me to finally, after 60+ hours of game time, to put the game down for good.I can only recommend this game to the hardest of LOTR die-hard fans, who want to immerse themselves inside Middle-Earth.They can look past the boredom of the combat system, amongst many other simplistic functions of the game.For everyone else, nope... You will likely hit the wall I have... and look for a more modern day game, which has more variety in it, excluding different skins for monsters.			"

												Really fun to explore the world that resembles the most popular books ever. Crashes unexpectedly once in a while, but really its not that much of an inconvenience for me. Must mention that I am on a Mac, and that crashing does seem to be a lot less since the update. A lot more fun when playing with other people obviously, and it seems that Free to Play is only great up to about level 40ish. Going beyond that requires a subscription in order to have fun and avoid 'grinding.'			"

Me and my cousin definitely enjoyed this game, especially because you can play instruments in it. Not that we know how to compose songs but the fact that you can play songs as a band is fun.

												I recommend this mmorpg to all who like classic role playing environment and a mature, serious style. I play lotro slow and not hard core at all so for me the environment and the storyline is important. Technically the graphics is not the latest but the environment is somehow cosy and neat. That said the design of the races are totally dead and stiff. Since I have not reached end game yet I can not tell how good it scales. So for me lotro works well as a relaxing mmorpg.			"

												I find this game to be endlessly entertaining. There is something to do for everyone, be it story line questing, buying and furnishing a house, crafting items, exploring beautifully creative lands or farming experience form countless hordes of monsters. The free to play feature creates an opprotunity for you to dive in without worrying about if you will be able to pay the bills for the next month. With the ability to work on deeds and quests for turbine points for free this game creates a world in which you can live the life of a lord of the rings. I highly reccomend this game for people with time to set aside and friends who enjoy quresting and adventure.			"

												Well i should say something about this game but i have no reasonable words for it, its deffinitely great game with very detailed graphics but i always miss there something, one of main cons is need of paying for many things which are normally unseparable part of game, now i mean paying for quests after level 30, if it would be for some special quests i dont mind, something is just special but after 30? Yeah, its not so expensive but still only advertisments and in-game errors like unfunctional in-game store, its something unpleasant....Other thing is that f2p players have only 2 character slots, but its hard to put to pros or cons, lets leave it between, its good that f2p has a chance to play for more than 1 toon, but from other side its only 2, some people love crafting and in this game is great system of it, everyone can make very good armor or weapons but still needs more than 2 toons to be not addicted to auctions or other sources of equipment and other items....To say something as pros, there are really great places for just enjoying of that beautiful scenery of Middle-earth, large amount of weapons and enemies, also hobbies and other things like smoking weed (which made me laughing, its very good idea from author and same from creators of the game: )) or musical instruments....And one really large pros: outfits, its great because it makes player happy to see his toon, without this system there would be so many ugly toons because of bad looking armor, with this there disapear problems with chosing between usable and good looking, great work if i can say it: )And about paying again, i understand that everyone needs money especially when team of people wants to make something enjoyable for other people like this amazing game which leads players through Middle-earth, i admire it also because iam a great fan of Lotr books and movies. So i dont pressure to anyone, i only said what i like and dislike: )Yeah and something from in-game expirience, i played as Lore-Master (LM), Hunter, Champion and Guardian, if i can say, the best (in case of fun) are Hunter and then Lore-Master, Champion is perfect in PvE but in duels with other players i have the best expirience with LM, Hunter is great in case of fast killing, teleports and has lots of hp, but he loses his powers quickly so i can recommend to fellowship Hunter with Lore-Master as his powersource when fights are long and other help is not avaliable at the moment, then for tanking Guardian is great, he does low amount of damage but his power is hidden in high amount of hp, he stands many attacks and when there is also Champion or Captain, damage is large and Captain can heal well.... Then i like deeds, sometimes hard to do but great way to earn points for in-game store.So its something from me about this game, as you can see, i can totally recommend it but like always, nothing is perfect:) "

												I am a fan of this game but that won't stop me from saying the truth. This is an mmo set in Middle Earth, and that's where this game differentiates from World of Warcraft. It has the same combat and quest types and similiar graphic styles. I'm not saying it's bad, hell it's the best mmo I have ever played, but that doesn't change the fact that if you have played WOW then you have played this game. However, this game is set in the Lord of the Rings world with the armours and lore that makes the world so original. If you are done with the current MMO hotkey style gameplay and are looking for a new type of game than go ahead and skip this one, but if you are thirsting for a new mmo, havent played WOW, or if you are just generally interested in the LOTR world then go ahead and download this game and get immersed in one of the best stories created.

Posted: December 7, 2016
												The 160 hours on record here are a joke, since I mostly played through the actual client way before Steam was even a thing.This is an amazing game for many reasons, and one of my all-time favourites. This is interesting since I have never actually completed the final content of any tier, I just have too much fun playing older content and exploring the areas to really powerlevel anything. NOTE: I bought the ""lifetime subscription"" which was available at launch. This option has since been discontinued, so I am unable to comment on the free version of the game.So, here are the pros and cons from a ""hard-core casual MMO gamer"":+Area designFrom the lush hills of the shire, through the lightless reaches of Khazad Dum, to the windswept steppes of Gondor, this game features as many nooks and crannies as the developers could think of. Each area has something that makes it unique, and I had a ton of fun exploring each of them. For instance, my first character spent 5 more levels than he needed to in Moria, yet I still feel that I could go back and explore it more.+Music ScoreVery few games are able to conveigh emotions through music well, but this game takes it to a whole new level. Haunting frost wastes, creepy forests, homely taverns or busy towns, the music and background sounds are still impressive even after I listened to them so many hours spent in these places. I cannot speak for all areas of course, but the sound team certainly knows what they are doing.+ReputationMiddle Earth isn't heavily populated, so the few settlements outside of places like Bree or The Shire can really use a helping hand. And unlike in many games I have played, you really feel that the people are grateful for your heroic service. Every faction has crafting recipes, weapon designs and vanity items to earn. You even get discounts on travelling within their realms. They also tend to change their dialogue when they see you. Aside from the direct reputation, your character also earns ""virtues"", which are equippable buffs you earn by being helpful to people you encounter in your travels or exploring the lands of Middle Earth.+CraftingThis is always a big selling point for the in any MMO, and LOTRO does it amazingly well. Every profession is useful to every character (although some are more useful to a particular class than others), but you don't feel you NEED to take up a certain vocation in order to play your class properly. I especially like the Farmer. They can not only grow produce needed by cooks, but also pipe weed which has no purpose other than role-playing and cosmetics.+Role-PlayingWhile obviously not able to rival ""true"" role-playing games, this game comes as close as I think you can be without sacrificing essential game-play elements. There are a myriad of emotes, many of the cool ones are earnable. You have the ability to set cosmetic outfits, and you can share cool item designs between all your characters even if the stats of that item are lousy. Dyes can be crafted by a profession and applied to almost everything except your weapons. The bard class goes one step further in combining the well-known ""supporter with song"" archetype with a fully integrated music playing minigame to entertain your fellows, and can teach other classes how to play the many instruments that are found in-game.Going beyond pure in-game mechanics, there are even role-play dedicated groups you can join in many different languages online.-Free to play ... not reallyThe store page sais free-to-play, but it is really free to download. What you get for free is basically a demo. Keep in mind that this used to be a pure subscription based game, just like World of Warcraft. While I myself never actually had to play through the game without a VIP account (what the subscription is now), I know a few things from conversations on forums and in-game. The demo includes the starting zone of your race as well as Bree-lands, the main levelling area for characters around 20. EVERYTHING beyond this point must be purchased. Aside from content, you can also purchase almost everything that your character can unlock, but most of it can be done through normal gameplay, mostly by completing achievements. My recommendation would be to play the game for a bit until you are around level 20, and then, if you still like it, become a VIP. The devs REALLY want you to become a VIP, and from what I am able to tell this is a good bargain. But, if you are low on money, maybe browse the website and see if the various deals, packages or whatever are worth it to you. I wish they would just release a demo and make the rest pay-to-play, the current forest of pay-for-it or play-to-unlock-it descisions is really not fun.-Very grindyThis is a selling point for me, but it has become less popular in gaming. While you CAN unlock everything with real money, you really aren't going to be able to unlock your characters' true potential with money unless you have literally nothing better to do. Most of your character progression will be a hard-fought battle with millions of dead orcs, Uruks, spiders, wargs, and whatever else the game decides to throw at you. And if you just powerlevel past all the areas, your character will come out significantly weaker than someone who spent the time to get there slowly.Do you hate grinding with a passion? Hands off this game!-GraphicsThe graphics engine is as old as the game. There were a few updates, but the look is still the same. That maintains the old-school feeling of the game which is a good thing, but this may turn many people off when you compare it to clearly superior graphics engines used in games like Archage or Elder Scrolls Online. What this old-but-gold engine does well is artistic drawings on paintings and wall-hangings (some of the actual art in this game is truly amazing) and vast, sweeping landscapes. Since it is rather old, the areas tend to look very good even on low-end machines. What the engine does not do well at all is small details, which tend to be edgy and don't fit well. It also fails majorly with the hit boxes of terrain. The characters in-game often float above the scenery, you run into invisible walls or get stuck in midair (this doesn't happen often, but it is really annoying when mounted.) I love this rough-around-the-edges look the game has, but it isn't really a selling point in the days of Unity.So, finally, I would recommend this game if you: Love Lord of the Rings Love exploring many different lovingly crafted zones Enjoy actually playing a character instead of a spreadsheet Don't mind dated but still impressive graphicsI wouldn't get this game if you: Want to have balanced and well-tuned PVP Think the main point of MMOs is raiding and everything else takes a back seat Always need to have the most cutting edge graphics in your games hate slow progress through many different grindy areas "

												I promised that after 300 hours played, I would write a review. So almost 400 hours in, here we go:First of all, I started playing LotRO, when it was still pay by month, so the hours do not refelct my actual game time :)I do not agree with the haters hitting on the pay per use aspect of the game. Players can still get a decent experience without dropping a dime. Of course the experience gets better with money invested, but compared to spending 15 or 20 bucks a month, it is a steal.The game experience itself is great, as the epic story drops you right in the middle of the actual story. You get a feeling of actually helping the fellowship move forward. The narrative is very deep and many of the extra characters are just as likeable as Tolkien's cast. Some of the quests can be a bit boring (go to guy a, then go to guy b, then go to guy c etc), but it is a MMORPG after all. Time flies when you are playing, and that is the most important part.Visuals and sounds are maybe a bit dated (it is from 2006, you know), but I still often just wander around Rivendell, Bree or the Shire enjoying the scenery. So I guess it is good,So would I recommend the game? Heck yes!			"

												Downloaded it, looked promising at first, but as soon as I started playing I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, so I kept playing, but then the combat came along. This combat system is SO broken and boring that it would almost be one of the only reasons not to get this. But assuming you get over that, the camera controls are another huge bother, as they are way too complicated than they should be. They should have just copied camera controls like Skyrim, because that would have been easier! The last thing is; You'll probably only ever be able to play this game ONCE, this is because logging on to servers is TERRIBLE! It will have 20 attempts to login, and it ALWAYS uses every single one very fast. When it uses all of them, you don't even get a chance to try again, it just says ""client timed out of servers"" and all you can do is close out of the whole game. So for those LOTR fans like me that are looking for a good LOTR game, don't get this one, get something like Lord of the Rings: Conquest or the recent Shadow of Mordor.			"

												Pro:In Depth Story telling, not so color and magic overloaded because of it's IP. The world of LotR with little Magic and the ultimate struggle between dark and light, with a lot of grey in between is captured very diligently with graphics and atmosphere. You can spend hours and hours playing away only to find more beautiful written quests that always stay true to the books and ideology behind it.Con:However Some years ago some changes were made that will doom this game before Barad Gularan is shattered to dust:After Turbine locked out Codemasters, all servers were converged to the US. Eversince, the quality for EU players is diminished. This goes especially for riding War Mounts, which is required to be responsive but a sad joke in reality. Despite several updates, rubberbanding and 5ish second delays are still common.Along with this change, they seem to have let go all engine related workforce. After quickly introducing a DX11 render path at the time, they simply stop to develop graphics any further. The game looks and feels more and more ancient; textures, animations and immersion feel exactly as old as the game is.The only people that seem to still work for Turbine are creative artists. The Battle for Helms Deep also introduced instances to play the Siege of Helms Deep which corresponding to their technical possibilities (see above) was realised okay. However 12 months later bugs and inconsistencies in these instances are still unfixed.All in all:If someone would invest into Lotro to update its ancient engine and do something else than publish new outfits and mount textures, it could provide a great experience and it would be a blast to see Sauron take his final glimpse, but in today's state, I feel the lidless eye will still shine at the time they have to pull the plugs. I would love to recommed this game with all my heart, but I cannot suggest to get into this game that presents crippled graphics, is PayToWin and charges you generously for features that should be free.

												I am a fan of this game but that won't stop me from saying the truth. This is an mmo set in Middle Earth, and that's where this game differentiates from World of Warcraft. It has the same combat and quest types and similiar graphic styles. I'm not saying it's bad, hell it's the best mmo I have ever played, but that doesn't change the fact that if you have played WOW then you have played this game. However, this game is set in the Lord of the Rings world with the armours and lore that makes the world so original. If you are done with the current MMO hotkey style gameplay and are looking for a new type of game than go ahead and skip this one, but if you are thirsting for a new mmo, havent played WOW, or if you are just generally interested in the LOTR world then go ahead and download this game and get immersed in one of the best stories created.

												I don't know if I can recommend Lord of the Rings Online. It's a very boilerplate MMORPG experience with boring combat. I can't find myself actually enjoying the combat even though the story aspect of the game was pretty good. Alas, as great as story is I can't find myself liking an MMO that isn't very...multiplayer. I always felt like I was playing alone and while that can be great in a single-player game, it feels lonely in an online gameIt's World of Warcraft in the Tolkein universe and with better questing but...the low player population and basically the same themepark gameplay means that ultimately I left Middle-Earth.

												I promised that after 300 hours played, I would write a review. So almost 400 hours in, here we go:First of all, I started playing LotRO, when it was still pay by month, so the hours do not refelct my actual game time :)I do not agree with the haters hitting on the pay per use aspect of the game. Players can still get a decent experience without dropping a dime. Of course the experience gets better with money invested, but compared to spending 15 or 20 bucks a month, it is a steal.The game experience itself is great, as the epic story drops you right in the middle of the actual story. You get a feeling of actually helping the fellowship move forward. The narrative is very deep and many of the extra characters are just as likeable as Tolkien's cast. Some of the quests can be a bit boring (go to guy a, then go to guy b, then go to guy c etc), but it is a MMORPG after all. Time flies when you are playing, and that is the most important part.Visuals and sounds are maybe a bit dated (it is from 2006, you know), but I still often just wander around Rivendell, Bree or the Shire enjoying the scenery. So I guess it is good,So would I recommend the game? Heck yes!			"

												This game is awsome, id recommend it entirely.Well let me start wirh this,  They are expansions and eventually youll have to pay for expansions to continue. Dont let this throw you off though youll have about 50 levels to decide if you want to buy or not. :)The Lore is amazing. If you are a lord of rings fan, then trust me the story is good, i dont know how to explain it....  it angles with the story and you meet important characters, yet... it has its own story.Next, there is pvp. Im not sure if its pay to win. But you do have to pay money for the expansions to become level 100. (which is top level), BUT there is a monster mode, where you play orcs in the pvp.( you start with one damage dealer class, to get more you have to pay for more),    You have to take forts for your side (bad guys and good guys) I think it is realy fun, but it requires teamwork  in the you literally cant solo it without dying. Now i played one server and its not the most active pvp ever, its a freeroam pvp, so sometimes there is alot, other times there isnt.Next is quests, Some are intersting and some are boring. Not much to say that hasnt been said :)Deeds, deeds are achivements, they can give you special boosts, currency, or turbine points (more on that later) they are a little tedious and it takes patience and some grinding skills to complete.turbine points, they are the premium currency and they can be bought. Or you can earn them in small amounts from deeds and a few quests. They are used for account upgrades and  many other useful stuff, now they can be used to buy almost everything, including expansions. So it is possible to play the whole game withought paying a cent, BUT it requires alot of grinding, to the point where you may as well buy them.Mounts, you gotta love them, but you gotta grind for them, this part sucks, but you have to grind for turbine points to get a riding permit to buy a mount. I did it though without paying nothing. Heres a tip, do abunch of deeds while you are in a area, or at least do part of it, so you can save a lot of backtracking. I love my mount and i got a sense of achievment when i bought mine. :)   Also you need to be level 20 to buy one :) :) :) :)This game is awsome, LOADS of content to explore. I suggest downloading it right away and seeing for yourself how awsome it is. I mean come on its free ;).By the way im level 20. :)Edit:I have paied money for turbine points to buy some stuff. I think it was worth it, i bought a character slot and money bag upgrade. (see below)Also forgot to mention you have limited in game currency space ( not turbine points) but this can also be avoided by spending turbine points. I hope to see in the game. Happy Hunting! :)			"

												I started playing this game when I was a lot younger with my best friend at the time. He was lvl 13 when I started. He took me into his Kinship house and made me drink the beer. Suddenly when I awoke , I was in the deep mines of moria having only just of completed the tutorial. There was lvl 50 enemies running after me when suddenly some random Hunter guy came and saved me. He then escorted me for 4 hours all the way back to Archet as I didnt have a horse. That is how nice the community is on this game. 10/10 would fill up my HD again.			"

TL;DROverall score of 6/10. Read below to find out why.F2P ModelI've never really been a fan of F2P games. Most F2P MMOs tend to overdo or implement micro-transactions counter-intuitively or completely wrong (Rift being one of those exceptions). So I figured I'd give LOTRO a try and see how they did. They failed. They are one of those examples of OVERDOING it. I realize companies' need to make money.. especially on a F2P model. But Turbine REALLY nickel and dimes EVERYTHING. The base game includes 4 zones (3 of which are primarily starting zones with 1 real adventure zone). You can travel to areas you haven't unlocked through the store but don't expect to do much. So many things you take for granted in other games (space, skills, etc.) beyond a bare minimum have to be unlocked. And they REALLY like pushing some of the boosts. Comes with the territory, I know. If you are incredibly patient, you don't have to worry about those things, but expect ALOT of grinding and expect to be incredibly sub-par others that are your same level.And P2W (Pay to Win)? If you pay for the boosts and unlocks, you are way ahead of the power curve. Pretty much anything can be had if you drop down some money.Thankfully, sales happen now and again where you can get deals on TP or, during weekly sales, can get things like quest packs or unlocks for half off. Coupled with the lotro store giving away a couple free boosts per week, there's hope if you willing to drop some cash on the game and wait around for a good sale.The ONLY saving grace is the ability to obtain TP (turbine points) on multiple toons that you can use towards unlocking the MANY features/content available. It's still alot of grinding. But I've managed to setup farming alts and a setup where I can earn about 200TP in about 90 mins. 3 runs and you can buy a quest pack for a zone.Score: 5/10 (Middle ground score only because you can grind out the TP's if you really want something and don't want to spend real money, otherwise, the score would be 1/10 because of how overdone and nickel/dimey Turbine is about things)StorylineThe storyline is an epic one in the true tradition of Tolkien (NOT the movies). Which means it's dry, long and kinda boring (to me, anyways). The epicness of Tolkien's writing is not in the writing style but it's broad and intricate vision and LOTRO captures that well, at least. There's a big world to explore. And LOTS of things in it.However, alot of that beauty is mired in meaningless quests for characters you care little about mingled with very boring writing. I'm a BIG fan of storylines, quests/missions, etc. and love to find out what's going on with everyone. But, for some reason, LOTRO quests are written so Tolkien'ish that the character dialogues seem overdone and I find myself not really interested and just skip reading it (for the most part). Additionally, there is no real feeling of storyline progressions (aside from the big main epic one). All the sub-storylines go all over the place and don't have real conclusive endings to them. Just an ""I thank you for helping me, kind sir. Goodbye"" with NPC audio chatter of ""Oh won't you listen to my woes?"" Score: 6/10 (Just for the fact there's ALOT of quests, at least.. not for the writing at all)GraphicsGraphics-wise, LOTRO is partially old school. Harsh, blocky edges (especially in notably older zones) and weird or cheaply done world animations (can you say Shire waterfalls?) and blurry textures/skyboxes plague the game. Characters, are overly, bland looking, lifeless and blocky. BUT, despite all that, the world is really beautiful. Maybe it's because I come from the old school world of Meridian 59, UO, and EQ1. It may be outdated.. but there's still beauty in it. The way the grass shifts when you run through it or the gentle babbling of a nearby brook while you walk through a meadow neighbouring a dense forest. Newer zones and areas get an updated treatment with cleaner textures and more polys per object/models. So at least the graphics gets progressively better. But you can tell some TLC went into some of the earlier zones albeit old-school looking. Score: 7/10SoundNothing remarkable about the sound. The background music is appropriately themed, albeit very looped and repetitive. There's some voiceovers (mainly for cutscene introductions) and NPC chatter. The NPC chatter voiceovers are.. annoying, in some cases. ""Excuse me! How rude!"" from a Hobbit lady I JUST helped. ""Oh! Won't you listen to my miseries and woes?"" from a human I just helped by saving his wife from being eaten by orcs. Maybe he DIDN'T want her returned? the voiceovers give a little bit of life to NPC's but they are rather short, repetitive and inappropriate.. hence..overall annoying. I'm spoiled by games like TSW that did voiceovers incredibly well. Score: 6/10 (what can I say? there's sound/bgm/voiceovers, at least)GameplayQuest mechanics are your typical MMO fare. Fetch this, kill that, escort that. There's just ALOT of them. All over the place. And there's nothing more infuriating than a SLOW npc that you need to escort. It's an MMO staple. It works. But I haven't come across anything that stands out like a TSW puzzle or WoW NPC event. No world bosses for the community to band together and defeat (RIFT). No random events that pop up and surprise you (ESO). There' lots of quests, occasional instances (with the ability to vary the party requirements or the level of the mobs), skirmishes (repetitive scenario training grounds), epic battles (if you unlocked rohan for post 50), 100 levels worth of adventuring, the ability to play ""bad guy monsters"" called Creeps in PvP level 100 combat against regular players, etc. Lots of different features, not all incredibly exciting.. but there's something to do, at least.Score: 6/10 (for LOTS to do, but not alot of enthusiasm to do it)CommunityEach server is going to be different. I chose Landroval (US-RE.. roleplay encouraged) and the world chat community is.. talkative. Helpful at times and immature/mature some times depending on the time of day or weekday/weekend. Community-run roleplay events tend to go on frequently with spatterings of actual roleplay going on in various populated areas. It's not bad. Most F2P games are packed with immature freeloaders. I can only suspect that the old style nature of the game and the nickel/dimey nature drove some of them away. That's ok. go play Archeage, CS:GO or Dota2, kids.Score: 7/10TechConnectivity-wise, I don't get much in the way of lag. Ping times are ok, even during holiday events. Though, I do get some odd lag bursts that I can't pinpoint as network-related. One of my friends have severe issues with LOTRO's port switching tech which leaves her able to chat, but unable to move until she gets kicked. At which point she has to go through the hassle of editing the conf files to manual change the ports because the auto-port switching doesn't work quite well (we suspect her ISP is throttling/blocking some ports). Graphics-wise, I don't run into much lag except in heavily forested areas or scripted scenes with raging fires, overall, I'm running around with 40-60fps easy. I personally run into a SERIOUS issue with the LOTRO store. It's laggy, slow-loading, doesn't reflect your current TP's properly and sporadically I get an access denied and nothing loads in it. Ok.. if you don't want me to spending money, Turbine, you could just tell me.Score: 6/10 (for numerous technical issues)OVERALL SCORELOTRO gets an overall score of 6/10. It's not spectacular, but it's not god-awful either. Although it has some saving graces, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. Too many little things make this game not as enjoyable as it could be. Sorry.			"

												First of all I would like to point that I have around 4000 hours of time spend on this game and it was really hard for me to give thumbs down. Lord of the Rings Online is the game made me a game addict. I was playing the game day and night, ditching school to talk to few friends in game. Yes it was that enjoyable game.I would like to take you to time of Lotro' s golden years, Mines of Moria and Seige of Mirkwood. When you had amazing group content from dungeons to raids, each were original, challenging and fun. Classes in raids had diffrent jobs compared to others. You had to use more than 5 buttons to finish the boss session.Now, I was not a hardcore PvE player, the reason I played Lotro so much is that, its PvP gameplay. Not going to lie there were some balance issues, like any other mmo. But the feeling was so unique. Tactics were essential. Having fortresses were almost as important as fighting enemies themselves. Again classes had diversty.  You had to use more than 5 buttons.Those were the times as I was waiting for next expansion, Rise of the Isengard. Aka Fall of Lotro. At first it looked really fun, nice leveling. Great dungeons and challanging and original raids. All good. When I got geared, I stepped to PvP zone, since you had no PvP specific armours, you had to grind some PvE to be a decent player. Anyway when I stepped in, I saw a warg 2 wargs running at me. I was like '' Oh Isair now you are dead''. But what?! I practically 3 shot them. They couldn' even hit me properly. And it was when I realised what was going on, ever since Lotro went f2p, Turbine wanted players to pay for them. And you had to pay in order to enter pvp zone with your Free People character. So Turbine made Free Peoples (Freeps) lot stronger compared to Servants of mordor (creeps) And that was when balance in PvP simply dissapeared.Now if you were a PvE player, you might have enjoyed RoI. I do not know becouse I stopped playing on mid RoI due to unbalanced PvP.Then Turbine went full greedy, giving new expansions once in a year with no new decent group content or a decent look on PvP. Riders of rohan was lotro's last times with decent population. They somehow managed to bring slight tbalance to PvP. Freeps were still stronger but it was bareble. But even though I was not a main PvE guy, I compleatedevery single PvE content on RoR, why becouse all of them were easy as hell. So soem say (including me) that RoI was end of PvP and RoR was end of PvE.Aaaand we have Helm's Deep, highly hyped expansion. A hope for Lotro's epic comeback. But NOOOOPEEE. HD was the expansion that made Lotro fall to a position where it is now. A dying game where developers try to grab your money before it dies compleatly. Terrible PvP and even more terrible PvE where all you had to do was use you 3 slots of quickslot bard to compleate a PvE session.Rest of the expansions are fallowups of HD, really bad PvE and PvP. Although they brough some new PvE content (after 3 years) they are boring, simple and not worth it.Now I still play the game, like an hour a week. Why? Becouse of community. Community was what made Lotro great and still lets Lotro to live these hard times. Since you do not have any cross server stuff going on and low population, people know each other. Not by name maybe but by heart. You can start a random conversation in world chat and watch people you may know or not join it and have fun other than playing the game itself. Community of lotro is the best one you can find in any game. Friendship, love and trust just like in original Lotr. Final conclusion should you play this game? That really depends, if you play a game for PvE content, no. Go play WoW, rift or newerwinter.If you play a game for PvP, play swtor, gw2 etc.But if you want to play the game solely for relaxing chatting with other people and doing some events. Give lotro a try, you do not need to spend a lot of money since paying for either PvE or PvP just does not worth it atm.			"

												Played as each of the classes for years, and mixed my skills until I found the best combinations. I've worked for weeks/months to get some of them. Now they made it so that you have 3 ""skill-tree"" based things, and only get a access to a third of your skills, based on skill type (DPS/Defence/etc). This means I only get a third of the legendary skills I worked for.In addition: I've worked for ages to level up and get what I have. New players can do it almost instantly now. This game has been dumbed down and made far more linear than it used to be in gameplay. I used to love it. I used to be excited to play it every day. Now launching it feels like a chore. The game was great - all they had to do was add more quests/maps. But instead, they changed the game, really badly messing it up. Would definitely not recommend it anymore.			"

												This is just like every other MMO, If you like lord of the rings it can be intreging for a while. The only thing that kept me going was the hope i would get to see some cool lord of the rings stuff. But it never happens. they just tease you with it through out the entire game. trying to get you to pay. This is a cheap gimic to milk the mmo croud and people who like tolkens work.  Unless your a Billionare, and you can buy everything outright, then dont bother with this pay to win mess.This will always have a special place in my heart for being the first mmo I played. And it will be the last too. I got this back when it was new. Then i quit and played other games and some other mmo for a while.. I came back to this to see if i could finish it, the answer is no.

												Lotro ooooooh lawd. This game. Ignore my 180 hours, as this is just on steam since its been here, and i havent played that much since.I started playing late 2011, stopped mid 2013, in that time accumulating about 5 and a half months of play time across all characters, so 4000 or so hours.As a pvmp (basically the games form of PvP) player, it was bad. laggy moors, bad balance that was pve centred so left 1 side of the player field at a huge disadvantage etc. But it worked, because people played it; the population was enough for fun healthy PvMP. This was the best mmo ive ever played due to that.Then everyone (pvmpers) started leaving, as PvMP was getting 0 attention and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. The server merges came in, but they worked weird as they just deleted servers and told you to transfer off of them. Mine was one of these that was deleted, and all my enemies and people i used to see in the Moors were all gone. Rivalries died and♥♥♥♥♥♥went down rqIn conclusion, idk if the PvE is good, never played it, but i can tell that the PvMP is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that the people that made the game fun for me, my enemies that i knew for years as well as friends, are all just memories that i can only look back at.So dont download this game. Its dying, and youll just regret it when the friends you make here will be gone.			"

												DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!If you have a DDO or any Turbine account already, you will not be able to log in. And then when you submit a ticket you get an automated response telling you to search the forums. Wait, there's more. When you do search the forums you find out that you gotta submit a ticket. And then, since there are no people apparently working for customer support, you won't get a response. You will be greeted with an error message everytime saying ""No subscription to LOTRO found."" So my advice is don't waste your time with a company that cares this little about potential customers. Its shows they are only concerned about sucking money from your pockets and not your gaming pleasure at all.			"

												lord of the rings online can be a good mmorpg if it didint heavliy rely on paying for stuff that you should get already.like paying money just to have more bag space or hold more coins and trading just to name a few.the game is about spending alot of money just to get simple stuff you should get anyway.if you like free to play games and dont care about the ads to buy stuff go for it if so stay away.

												To simply put it.. I  just...  did not enjoy this game.  Maybe someone who is more into the LOTR lore will like it more, but to me it's dated and MMOs have come far from this.  The map is clunky, it's hard to see where anything is, the menus are terribly designed.6GB for a high resolution texture pack?  When was this ""high"" resolution?  It looks like an N64 game on ultra.Edit:  To the people who don't like my review, just move on to one you like that helped you.  There is no need for you to come in here telling me how to write a review.What are reviews?  Essentially, if they are on the internet, they've turned into the opinions of people.  That's what this is, my opinion on how I didn't like this game.Also notice where I said, ""People who are more into the lore of LOTR will probably like this a lot more.""I'm not that into the lore of LOTR.  I'm not that into LOTR.  I am, however, into video games.  Like 100+ hours a week into video games.  So in other words, if you don't like my review, ♥♥♥♥ off and comment on one you do like.			"

												As someone who has logged over 1800 hours in LotRO, this game was far better in years past, before the last expansion, and back when the dev team cared about the game.The game client is an unoptimized mess, hasn't been significantly updated in years, and gets shown up by other MMOs, like FFXIV, and basically every other F2P MMO out there because all Turbine cares about is milking you for the next cosmetic thing you will buy from the store.The game client is such a mess that Gondor was unplayable for me because I kept crashing on a gaming machine that runs FFXIV flawlessly, as well as every other game in my library.Those telling you this is a good game remember it as it was years ago. This game is a trainwreck now, and best avoided.			"

												I use to play this game back when the cap lvl was 50 and then 65-85.I'm honestly dissapointed in the expanisons after Rise of isengard. Some of the new areas will bring you dow to like 5 fps.Mounted combat is dreadful.""Epic"" battles are not epic.PVMP is so broken. Wardens, Weavers, most classes can solo a keep. Population is dying which is why servers were shut down.Honestly, it's sad to see it crumble.   As soon as it was bought out by WB. It was gonna go down. And alot of people at Turbine lost their jobs because of that deal.I still will play it with the  nostalgia tho, and all the fun times I had with my friends. Who now have departed for  Valinor. Leaving me in Middle-Earth to continue the struggle against the forces of darkness!			"

Game is still poorly balanced, streamlined to hell, pvp ruined by balancing issues and will never be fixed, free peoples players will whine like a bunch of baby ♥♥♥♥tard♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with the threat of cancling subs if any balance is presented by the company, of which never happens. so dont expect balanced pvp in this game in the far future, or never.

If you can invent a time-machine and go back 4 years, it's a fantastic game once you buy stuff.			"

DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON IT!  Unless you LIKE spending money that you dont get anything back for...  then be my guest.  My job here is done... Ive warned everyone here about their deception tactics on making money!    And here's alittle message to the Devs...  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T you lazy ♥♥♥♥ers couldnt get his account back!  YOUR DEVS!  You have everything at your finger tips to give even HALF his♥♥♥♥♥♥back to him.  BUT NO... you had to TAKE HIS MONEY, then LOOSE his account, and tell him ""Sorry, nothing we can do!""

												At one time LOTRO would have been my favorite MMO, and as my previous review was something near 12,000 words, one on which there was a lot to say.  Now - I can just say - avoid at all cost.For the past 6 months our gaming group (the 12 of us who play LOTRO) have had a problem, and that is most of us cannot log in.  PC, MAC, Dorm, home, office, WiFi, hardwire, it does not matter.  ""Getting into line to connect"" 0x80004005 is our lot.  Endless hours talking to CSR - our engineer techy finally discovered it is a non-standard networking protocol used for player verification  that is causing it - something the Turbine techs never figured out.  So he can get one or two of us online at a time, usually taking a couple of hours of playing with ports and settings.Is it worth it?  I would love to visit the world again, but Turbine has figured out a business model that does not need customers.  So be it.			"

												this game was so bad i went back to watch the movies to make sure they weren't as S*** but i found it was fine the movies were good now here is what i have to say, this game was so bad compared to the likes of SWTOR or GUILD WARS 2 now here is why in SWTOR u fell like a jedi/sith or etc and all classes feel differnet same as GUILD WARS 2 but in LOTRO u feel the f***ing same all the time and don't get me started on the MINSTREL u can't bloody bring somebody back form the dead with a DAMN BANJO like sure in video games they arn't based on logic but even in the LORD OF THE RINGS saga there is no SCARED BANJO OF LIFE or BUY A PONY FOR REAL MONEY logic in games like SWTOR u can play a free mode in where the w**kers get good gear but u still stand a chance and there is two factions fighting, but in this you only run around middle earth with a sh***y story and NO TALKING sure there is the odd MORINIG or HELLO and THIS GAME IS BAD STOP PLAYING but no enough and last but not least IT WAS SO F***ING BORING I WANT 34.4 HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK NOW			"

												    Its a very Old game having played for 8 years its progression for Pvmp is excellent and I have enjoyed it for countless hours on end and yet in the end, I grievously must not give it a good rating. It  lacks elements, where many other games have completely outgrown it, for 8 years they have a pvp system that has changed ever so minutely and not for the better as they have it restricted to a single region but have managed to continue to expand on pvmp content continuously with money coming in. Granted its great to play for free but for long term playablity its continuously remains to be seen weather or not it may wane or wax on the horizon as a successful competitor to many other MMO's. Lotro Really has needed an expansion on more than pvmp aspects, Its very disappointing, because the war of the ring was a war, not a continual processes where the free peoples of middle earth wandered their way in pursuit of the fellowship of the ring, that never happened it covered areas across middle earth and the violence spread to many corners of it. Lotro did at one point expand in that direction with the expansion of Frochel and Evendim, but ever since the Moria expansion it has sailed south for the oncoming winter, unfortunately winter is coming, my dear old friend and the continued content for the Osgiliath Expansion has been fun, but the Element of Questing and raids has left little wanting in regards to a competitive atmosphere.

												I used to play this back at launch when it was subscription based. It's since been ruined by the worst ""free to play"" business model i've ever seen in any game. You have to purchase zones to be able to quest and progress through the game, which is probably the worst part, and theres a LOT of other stuff, but that one takes the cake. The community has also been ruined, used to be mostly a mature adult crowd, but now has little♥♥♥♥♥holes that can't afford WoW running around acting like general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Would have givin this game a 10/10 in 2009, would rate 3/10 now.

												While potentially fun, LOTRO is not a free to play game. It's very misleading. Quite similar to World of Warcraft, you can only play for 'free' until roundabouts level 20, and while an interesting timesink for fans of the lore, it's frankly not worth investing money into this sub-par, ultimately pretty boring MMO.

												Absolutely Terrible Game!Firstly, the controls are completely horrbile to work with, which makes the game worse.Secondly, I would say that you can't turn Middle Earth into a MMO because it will become a disaster (like the game I'm currently reviewing). And finally, the maps and upgrades are ridculous. Also, I cannot comprehend how stupid some of the quests are within  the game!. In conclusion, I would say that the game is a terrible disaster and has completely shamed the other Lord of the Rings games, books and movies.1/10Definately wouldn't play again, even if the fate of Middle Earth depended on it!

												About the game:This game is a slow-paced game, as reflected by the slow story expansions released since 2007 (7 yrs is long time in the gaming world).  It took 7 years to reach Two Towers storyline and it doesn't really have much emphasis on PVP action. It's your traditional quest/crafting MMORPG.My experience:I played LOTRO for a fair bit of time. I started off to be F2P but soon realized I just cannot make any reasonable progress after reaching Moria. The most important issue was travelling. It just took too damn long given it's such a big virtual world and especially in Moria area where you can easily drop off cliffs if you're not paying attention. You need premium accounts to unlock many travel points. Without fast travel, you can easily expect watching yourself traveling for 10+mins. It just doesn't make sense for this day and age. Pros:- It's Middle-Earth!!- HUGE world, lots to do and explore- Friendly community, it's one of the best online gaming community I've met for all the games I've played- Classes are well balanced- Crafting system is cool, class system restricts what type of raw materials you can harvest/refine so you're going to have multiple characters for sure in this gameCons:- Horrible, sometimes buggy in-game purchase interface. Too slow and often resets.- Progress is too slow, both in leveling and providing storyline- Really difficult to complete some quests without a good party- Traveling is a pain- Because of travelling cost, quest planning also is a pain because you want to clear all the quests in the same small area- Mapping system needs to be improved, I like the maps following the literature artwork. But practically speaking, I need to be able to zoom in/out to really see where I need to go!- Quest grinding, too many of the quests are collect-style quests.- This game takes TIMEConclusion:I only really enjoyed the game when I had the premium subscription. In the long run it's just too much $$ (expect to invest $100+ in the long run). It just isn't a good investment to me, especially recent explosion in F2P games. On the other hand, I can pay Dragon Age $50 upfront knowing I won't need to keep paying to unlock slightly more gameplay.Therefore, sadly at this current date, I cannot recommend this game unless they overhaul the game mechanics/graphics to provide more action/$ and quality/$. It is getting outdated compared to other MMORPG. One or two yrs ago, I'd recommend this game. If you're rich, then go for it, full premium players enjoys this game a lot more.			"

												This game used to be an amazing game. But then the fire nation attacked. But nah, after each expansion it got progressively worse. Only the first two were good. Overall though I had fun. The mechanics are great, the questing is fun (Even though all you do is run around the entire land). Unfortunately the PvP is not free... It's a big downside for those looking forward to it. It's also extremely easy to be spoiled by being able to use resources to easily complete quests when they should be challenging and require group effort. In addition, servers are not that populated, so becareful when choosing one. It is possible to get to level 95 in less than a month of hard questing and with the help of another person. The environment is fantastic and incorporates a lot of Tolkien's work with accuracy.Over all I give this game a B- (or a 8.1 out of 10)			"

												This game is great to try up until level 20. Once at level 20 however, you have the option of becoming a premium or a VIP. Although the game is set up as free to play, it's quite difficult to do much if you aren't at least a premium up to level 20. Your currency is limited, a lot of your inventory is limited, the vault is limited, and you don't feel quite free.What I find troubling about this game is that there is a strong suggestion to pay money to advance. Not even to beat others, but to just advance further into the game and level up. They highly recommend you to use real life money to exchange for their currency (turbine points) or to subscribe monthly for VIP status.That being said, the monthly payments aren't too bad, roughly $10-$15, which is about normal. The quality of the game itself is quite fun. There is quite a lot to do, and each character feels really diversified. It does feel cluttered at times though, due to the high number of repeatable quests and lack of structure for quest taking (grab whatever quest you see, run to it). The main quest doesn't feel too prioritized, but it is a decent story line. At times, it feels like you are just being led around by your quests, rather than pursuing them. They feel really one dimensional, but necessary.The largest appeal of this game is the characters themselves, and the level of customization for your abilities, play style, looks, and classes. I really enjoyed this bit. There are specific skill trees you can specialize in, and they're diverse enough that they don't feel like the same class with different specs. Another thing about skills and abilities is that there is the Deed Log, which keeps track of achievements. This is a great concept of the game that rewards you well for doing specific achievements, which feels very rewarding. This adds to the customization appeal, where you can pursue an achievement to get a skill and be satisfied.In short, I would suggest playing this game at least up until level 20, and to really investigate the skill trees, the deed logs, and traits. Also, experiment with different classes, each class feels very unique, and within each class, is a sub-class that is also unique in a sense.			"

												Well, this is a rather nice game, within the first 30 mins of playtime i met some nice chap which was very helpful in getting me along in the game. I have not played for all the long, but from the time that i have played the game i was very pleased with it, although there are some things like controls i would like changed, its overall a good game. If you are into MMORPG's you should most definitly check out this game for yourself. It does have a item mall in it which allows you to buy items from IRL money, im not 100% sure if they are game changing items, but they are items non the less and surely are overpriced. The community on the game seem rather nice, unlike some other games in which i played where its filled with 13 year boys going through hormonal changes and trying to rip each others eyes out. This is just my inital review, and once i play some more i will most likely add to it. Check the game out.. its free.. if you dont like it.. uninstall it and move on.			"

The original Guild Wars (now long since shut down) predates it by 2 years, and surpasses it in every single aspect. Not even worth free.			"

												Hell's teeth! In have spend most of a full day reading up on the basics of LOTRO, and I can say that, whilst the game looks amazing from the outside, I found the time I spent just reading the basic gameplay, the commands, keyboard shortcuts, actions etc. etc took up so much of my time that I only spent around forty minutes playing the actual game.I also found myself having difficuty actually getting the game to start and once it did, there was no sound on the intro but it looked good all the same.Maybe I'm just an old fart but, as an avid gamer, I want to spend more time actually playing a game rather than trying to learn all the rules and do's/don'ts of a game.I'm afraid this game was not for me but in saying that, the game itself looks great (If you're into that kinda thing)!  More of an RTS fan myself.			"

												This is a cheap copy of World of Warcraft, and if you're looking for a good MMO, then get ESOTU already. Unless, that is, you want to spend a few hundred dollars on DLC's and in-game money.'Nough said.The only reason I play this for free is it's setting: without friends, and money to waste, it's kinda meh. But it has one thing previosly stated going for it: IT'S IN THE LOTR UNIVERSE, SO JUST PLAY IT! PLAY IT! NOW!On a serious note, you won't have much fun if you don't have money. But it's LOTR, so... I don't care.- Courtesy of YOLO Swaggins			"

												I’ve only played a couple of hours at this stage, up to level 10.The storyline and lore was fairly immersive apart from the occasional out of place line of dialogue, the graphics are definitely low budget so don’t expect too much out of it.As for the gameplay itself, the character that I played had standard WoW style combat with channelled spells, instant casts and a ‘white damage’ melee attack.Movement and camera control was almost identical to WoW too down to the num lock for auto walk.I guess that you could say that the learned biases they utilised allowed me to jump right in without much learning, but it also made the experience feel like a cheap independent version of WoW.In a good free to play model the ‘free’ players are used as tools to drive the in-game economy or gameplay, add value for paying player. For example Valve uses free players in TF2 and Dota2 to drive demand -through trading- for paying players to open chests (See Steam Dev Days for more info). In this respect free players are valuable in both a commercial and community sense.But as a new player only a few hours in, it feels like free players are not valued at all. From what I've seen, in-game purchases are in your face within the first 10 minutes of play and it just gets worse from there.In conclusion The Lord of the Rings Online feels like a $5 independent title trying to bleed you dry, with its only redeeming features being the large amount of content. It is also incorrectly labelled free to play, it’s more like a demo for a subscription game with mandatory DLC expansions and pay to win mechanics.			"

												This game used to be an amazing game. But then the fire nation attacked. But nah, after each expansion it got progressively worse. Only the first two were good. Overall though I had fun. The mechanics are great, the questing is fun (Even though all you do is run around the entire land). Unfortunately the PvP is not free... It's a big downside for those looking forward to it. It's also extremely easy to be spoiled by being able to use resources to easily complete quests when they should be challenging and require group effort. In addition, servers are not that populated, so becareful when choosing one. It is possible to get to level 95 in less than a month of hard questing and with the help of another person. The environment is fantastic and incorporates a lot of Tolkien's work with accuracy.Over all I give this game a B- (or a 8.1 out of 10)			"

From what I've seen, in-game purchases are in your face within the first 10 minutes of play and it just gets worse from there.In conclusion The Lord of the Rings Online feels like a $5 independent title trying to bleed you dry, with its only redeeming features being the large amount of content. It is also incorrectly labelled free to play, it’s more like a demo for a subscription game with mandatory DLC expansions and pay to win mechanics.			"

												The F2P model in this game is completely broken and geared towards making you pay a monthly subscription. You will not enjoy this game unless you sub.If you want a good F2P model (not necesarily a good game, that is subjective), take a look at SWTOR. You can choose not to subscribe, make some one-time purchases, and play 90% of the game subscribers play. Total cost: less than 100 US dollars.What does $100 get you in LOTRO? Some zones. Which should have been unlocked in the base F2P game, for starters.Yeah, no.			"

												I will complain about one thing and it is Quest system. Travel&Speak quest system will be exhaust you few moments later. You're taking lots of quests from a region. You're doing quest on an area and when done you have to back your quest region to bring 'em to NPCs. But problem is starting here. They are giving to you Quests which would be done in same place, last time you did. So back to same area. Turn back to quests and again!! There is no logical thing about this. Piece of piece you must do same nonsense. If you played in Evendim (as a sample! most area is same) you should know ""High King's Crossing"" and ""Barad Tharsir"" Travels like that. Quest receive location is ""HKC""Quest bring location is ""BT""And start: HKC>BT>HKC>BT>HKC>BT>HKC ... around 3 hours and done all quest in that area.. Another quest like speak quest. Talk to Aragorn>Talk to Elrond>Aragorn>blabla name>Aragorn>Elrond>Aragorn -_-' So that problem is taking long way travel progress is boring! Maps allready huge (If you played wow you should know wow maps are simple and easily can do) This game past many years and there is nothing improved for lotro. Same graphics, same boring stuff like quests, walks. I personally bought Evendim pack with Quad pack. However I cannot use those region ""swift travelling"" That is another stupid things. I hope I could be explained what's I mentioned about. Only stupid quest system is making this game so worse.If you have patient and jobless person (so I'm) l I can recommend this game. But there is always better a MMO aka WoW. It's up to you.			"

Yes people will help you, but it's not nearly as helpful as was or nice. >_> As an example someone bashes me on an alt, I alt over too my main, and I get apologized too. It's all about status and how long you've been there. >_> IF you're looking for fun pvp don't bother. (Yah sure the PvP can be fun but there are other games that are better), if you're looking for rp? 90% of the rp is Private yes there is Random Rp not as much unless you're in the pony, if you're looking for pve content? Meh? They're adding stuff, but honestly it's best just too find a new game you're not going to find the buss you're looking for I spent much of my life into this game. Not because I wanted too? Because I felt I had too, and too talk with friends. Realize I play this game for Social-Reasons not for actual content.			"

												Hell's teeth! In have spend most of a full day reading up on the basics of LOTRO, and I can say that, whilst the game looks amazing from the outside, I found the time I spent just reading the basic gameplay, the commands, keyboard shortcuts, actions etc. etc took up so much of my time that I only spent around forty minutes playing the actual game.I also found myself having difficuty actually getting the game to start and once it did, there was no sound on the intro but it looked good all the same.Maybe I'm just an old fart but, as an avid gamer, I want to spend more time actually playing a game rather than trying to learn all the rules and do's/don'ts of a game.I'm afraid this game was not for me but in saying that, the game itself looks great (If you're into that kinda thing)!

												Despite my bias of being a big LOTR fan, and having loved the movie adaptations (not so much the Hobbit, but even those movies were handled well), I find that this game tries too much to pander to my nerdy side rather than the part of me that wants to play a game.My expectation was that I'd make a character and be able to play an adventure where'd I'd be behind the back of my player and control how they fight. I did not get everything on this list.The point and click aspect of this game is the source of why I don't like it. If this game allowed full immersion into fighting by pressing different buttons, then it would be much more fun. What it does instead is say 'Hey, you wanna kill that wolf. You gotta click it and watch your guy attack it'. Really?If I wanted to click and watch the game do the work, I'd be playing Clash of Clans right now.Final Verdict, this game is a disappointment. To me, it doesn't deserve all of the praise it gets, because it's just plain boring. It's lore and story are spot-on to Tolkien's story, but I play a game more for fun than for the story it tells. Normally a story is a big slice of the rating pie for me, but gameplay is always the part I judge the most, and that slice of the pie was bitter for this game.Final Mark: 1/5			"

												Downloaded this game to try it and after a few hours I can say it's not my cup of tea.From the moment you enter the game it is trying to sell you things that, in my honest opinion, should be free.Riding skill should be free and class choices should never be locked behind paywalls.Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay for cosmetics and xp boosts, etc, I do it all the time in other games, but as soon as I am prevented from accessing what I consider core game mechanics I immediately hate the game.Yes, the game is free to play but honestly there are far superior games like Tera, Archage, and swtor that wipe the floor with lotro in both gameplay and graphics, and while this game would have looked fantastic back when it was first launched, in 2016 I expect much more, even from free games.For these reasons I have uninstalled this game and cannot recommend it to any serious MMO players looking to invest their precious life hours.

												While I am not a huge expert in Middle Earth, I do fancy it enough to play this game. Unfortunately After some time I felt the game drag and seem like any other fantasy MMORPG. While that is good for others, that was not good for me. Even with the gimmick of playing characters that are similar in style with the likes of Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas, I simply cannot recommend this game unless you are a truly hardcore fan of the universe or to people still into games like World of Warcraft. If you are looking for something different, you will not find it here, in my opinion. Hardcore Tolkien fantasy fans only.			"

												I have a realy long history with this game.Like I played it from the very beginning and the first 2 years after it's went F2P.Recently I poped in again and I could barely hold my breakfest.The devs completly ruined the game with changing the bare essence what made it great.Instead of the the specific Skill mechanics that allowed you to optimice your character in different ways, trough experiementing and putting in the right klass abilitys, put they in skill trees, to make the game easier.This had as an result, that they removed a buttload of skill and made the fights an incredible bland 4 skill game.Raids and Dungeons have been simplified, to make sure everything is a DPS race with AoE's everywhere.Tactics are broken down to a bare minimum.If I see the differnces between the last Raids I played and Dunhoth T2, i would say the difficulty,tactic and skill level have droped at around 3000%Honestly, there're better MMO's out there, this might actualy be at the bottom of the barrel.What a fall from one of the best to one of the worst.

												LOTR Online takes your favorite fantasy franchise and shoves all the good bits of the adventure behind a paywall of non-lore-explained Turbine Points(tm). You can grind these points by rerolling characters constantly but this game would be better off if you just paid a subscription fee instead of putting down money for quests, areas, classes, dungeons, Gold Cap increase, and EXP bonus increases.  Absolutely soul-sucking and not exactly true to the lore of Middle Earth anyway. Would reccommend to play once while fairly drunk and then never again.			"

The next day I tried to play the game and it didn't work, I suspect it was that my computer must've been a bit slow at the time or to actually play the game requires a good computer that isn't as old as mine.  I'm going to try downloading this again on a newer computer that I have and see if it works.

												I didn't give this game much of a chance to be honest. I can enjoy 8 bit games and have a blast, but when games try to look good and make a mess out of it by cutting corners I just can't stand to look at the screen. With DX11 and all turned on this game just falls short visually. It's the textures on the toons that just feel, well... cheap, like they cut corners to just push out anything. The micro transactions are out of control. Seems like anything I clicked on wanted me to go to a website and buy coins to spend in game to get items.Hardly no voice overs, in modern MMO's voice overs are a huge part of the games. This might as well be a old final fantasy game with all the text and lack of voice. The in game movies were also very low budget, and this is coming from a guy who mixes his own stuff for youtube. I'm no animater but I can comment as a player and they were terible. Many older games have done far better.Because of these I honestly didn't give the game much of a chance to impress me further. After all, I'm not paid to review games so if it's not something that's fun and catches my interest then no need to continue.			"

												The download and instillation process took a very long time, perhaps because I installed the optional texture packs. However, once in game, the graphics looked extremely dated, and were hard to look at. That's fine, I've played uglier MMOs. Yet, the combat felt wonky, as every mob ran through me, and the game won't let you attack from behind, so for every single mob I had to walk backwards, then attack. Camera movement was also really bad. The whole time I felt like I had tunnel vision, since I'm use to MMOs that are more friendly with both movement and visibility.Also, every minute or so there is a reminder of what you need to buy in the store. If you're training skills, you should buy this item. If you're collecting valor, you should buy this item. If your character looks ugly, you should buy this item (though there's no item to buy to make the game look good in general). If you want to play with others, you should buy this expansion. It just goes on and on.This is also one of the most dated looking games, both graphically, and in gameplay mechanics. There are just a lot of things that the MMO developer community has stopped doing, and for good reason that make this game seem more dated than it actually is. For instance, you need to level a character that you care nothing about to level 10 before you can make an evil faction character. This sort of nonsensical restriction I've seen in other games, and it's always a bad idea, costing them players in the process.Basically, I stopped playing because of a lot of annoyances heaped on top of each other. The game isn't worth the long download and patching process.			"

												Its just boring to be honest. A bunch of either fetch quests or kill this guy and return here. Along with a lack of atmosphere makes it kinda dull. Also in terms of free to play there is a giant paywall you can't get around at level 10 or so. Combats dull animation based mmo type. No challenge. Its also very very brown and grey, maybe some dull green here and there, nothing colorfull once you get past the tutorial.			"

												I didn't play much, much at all. It was quite the turn off. It was like a hot date with bad breath. Mmo fans love it I think. Which makes sense, as they love all mmo's (which is strange and scary). But, if you play normal games you might not be so down. I'd take a pass.			"

												Having played so little this may be worthless but still. I wasn't able to push through the awefull graphics, awefull charecter design and awefull menus that this game presents. It is simply a travesty. I played more than my share of both p2p and ftp and this game is worss than ftp's from 10 years ago.Story wise cant say, same goes for end game. Couldn't bear to reach max lev and look back to how many hours i might have wasted on this.If you want ftp quality games go for SWTOR, Runes of Magic, RIFT, Allods and so on...			"

												Install has been a long, long wait: the first download turns out to be a very old version of the game. It will take a total of 3 or 4 hours on a 100/100MBit connection to get the game up. There is a Happy Hour bit of the software that you simply are not able to direct to another location than default and it seems to interfere with my control of my PC (see later)Graphics were very disappointing. Seems like what was used by other games 5 years ago (at least for the characters). I uninstalled after two hours of ""play time"". I play quite a lot of MMO's and all work reasonably to very well. This game has hung me up 12 times in those two hours and in such a way that the machine will not allow me to kill the process or start any other programs. The only way forward after that is a hard reboot. Sorry, nice idea, I am totally into the fantasy world, but this game is unplayable in the state that I found it.			"

												Do not recommend for standard MMO. This game bored me to death from the bad opening tutorial to the random plopping of the main UI. The fighting and game mechanics feel a bit clunky. The camera controls glitched out on me too. I'd recommend other MMOs like Rift. However, if you're looking for an MMO where Lord of the Rings fans can gather and play in, then this is the only MMO you can get. So it does offer something for the LotR fans, but for someone like me who has experienced many MMO's... not a lot. Everything is rehashed and worse in some cases.I wanted to like this game, it was a huge disappointment even with the starter pack.			"

												This game could be good but Turbine have ruined it and made it awful. The big negative about it is that Turbine are very greedy. They have designed this game not for typical gaming fun but to make huge, massive amounts of cash. A few years ago you would pay once for a game and have access to all levels. Expansion packs would come along at a reasonable price.Turbine have decided to charge huge amounts of cash to progress from level to level. The truth is that they want you to pay 8 times more than what you would normally pay for a similar game. So if you have a very rich daddy go for it. For the rest of us, stay away and hopefully it will backfire on the greedy Turbine people.			"

												The only tab to target MMO that I'd be willing to play at any time, and yet it is totally inhibited by its f2p model.Things that should be available in every other f2p mmo are a luxery here. You will be hit in the face with the need for turbine points.From what I hear, you can grind these turbine points in game through what looks like an intended exploit. But it's literally a case of grinding so you can be able to grind. Not worth it.I mean if you want to dump cash into this to enjoy the real game, go right ahead. It's a good game then. But if I want to spend dosh on a sub game, there are much better games.			"

The combat felt sloppy and was just button mashing, the graphics were pretty nice but were dated (I'll give it slack, though) and it wasn't full screen!

												3/10This game embodies the logic of grabbing money in almost any way possible, while still waving the banner of F2P, more than any other game that I have seen. Everything seems fine for the first 10-12 levels. But during these leves you are still in the starting region and you already realise what is going wrong: you have to pay in order to purchase ""Turbine Points"" in order to be able to play this game in a semi-decent manner. You can't even have more that 2 gold pieces in your wallet without requiring an ""Unlimited Wallet Upgrade"" which costs 395 Turbine Points alone! You also need those points to unlock other regions and content, the auction house, extra slots for traits (rpg elements giving you character bonuses), to purchase more character slots, to unlock new classes. 90% of the content is available for Turbine points, making this one of the most obvious ""pay to win"" games I have ever seen.I only rate this game 3/10 because it has some really good mechanics (as for example unlocking traits with achievements),is based on my favorite fantasy setting and if it changes it's money-acquiring mechanisms (in other words if you don't need Turbine Points for everything) it could be one of the best MMORPG games available on the market.

And when I do, it needs to update.Look, download the starter areas, let me play, download the rest in the backround or later,don't make me update all the content every time, especially since it's all stuff I'll never see.Also, I forgot my username and password.

												As a fan of the series, I was really eager to give this game a try, as it looked really interesting. Unfortunately, I have not actually been able to play it. I had issues when I initially went to try and create my account, and then, when I recently attempted to again, the sign-up page was a wall of repeated text (clearly a coding issue on the site). At present time, due to these two issues, I wouldn't recommend the game. However, I certainly will not give up on the game entirely, and will continue to see if I can successfully register and get playing. If I'm ever successful, I'll (hopefully) be able to write a more positive review. Until then, from what I've seen in the above trailer and screenshots, the game looks like it could be great, with the above noted issues aside.			"

Otherwise you should try and find a better adventure game. Terraria is a good one.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online hasn't captivated players as World of Warcraft has, and there are reasons for that. After playing the game again after the remake of the classes, there some personal reasons I have as to why LOTRO isn't so great.1.  Early Levels - This is a big problem for Lord of the Rings in my opinion, because the early stages of the game are incredibly boring. When you play as a Human, you are hunting down spiders and bandits from level 1-20-ish. Afterwards, the game picks up slightly by introducing the Barrow-Wights but the bandits will still appear from time to time. The Elf and Dwarf starting areas are a little interesting because it involves goblin invasions and shaky alliances between the two races, though it also involves killing wolves and birds from time to time. The Hobbit starting zone is by far the most utterly dull place in the game. I spend most of my times carrying pies from town to town, delivering mail and helping people with their chores. 2. Enemy Design - This might not turn people off as much as it did to me, but the enemy designs are recycled. If they aren't, then someone put a lot of work in for nothing. The fact that the only difference between a bandit in the tutorial and a demon bandit overlord in the shadowy pits of Mordor is only their number, gives the impressions that no-one seemed to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥in the design of the game. 3. F2P is a Lie - Okay, this might be an exaggeration since developers need money and they can't just make the game completely free. Turbine doesn't seem particular successful with their MMOs. I believe their sister MMO, Dungeons and Dragons Online at launch was about to fail miserably (don't quote me on this. They decided to convert LOTRO and DDO into a F2P model worked, at least for a short while. The game promises that you can unlock game content by grinding for Turbine Points but the rate in which you gain Points is painfully slow. The F2P model added some juice to LOTRO but you basically have to grind the early levels over and over to play the next area in each play through. Referring to the first point, the early levels are boring as hell, so your patience will get tested.If you have never touched an MMO before and/or also a fan of Tolkien's work, go ahead and try the early levels. If you want to access the higher-level content, I hope you are willing to pay because grinding and grinding will take away any interest you have for this game.			"

												has a very ""too good to be true"" vibe at first.I played it, it looked like wow, played like wow, felt like everquest 2.I looked at the limitations and thats when I saw why it was too good to be true.it is branded as a free to play game, and by all intents and purposes, it is except it isnt! you will find that you can earn anything you want in the game except you have to keep making characters, and at the end of it all, you are still haunted by the fact that money is hard to make without the ability to trade it. I dont know if this is purchaseable with tp but I diddnt come back.all in all, gw2 does what this does and better the framerate is even the same on a weaker pc (choppy but smoothe) plus, you can play instruments on gw2 like lotro so save for gw2 and just get it cause you will end up buying content for this ""f2p"" title anyway.

												Garbage MMO was on my hard drive for a record low 20 minutes.  I played before a while ago and it worked decent IIRC.  This time, intro movie was laggy beyond watching.  When that painful crapfest was over, I got to the character creation screen... where I was unable to click on ANY of the buttons.  There were a few forum threads suggesting this and that... mostly tweaking with settings in various files... and the LEAST helpful of all: Click the options button and set graphix to DX9.  Well, there is NO options button on the character select screen and even IF there was one, I would not be able to click on it.  After combing the forums and knowledge bases for ""fixes"" and ""workarounds"", uninstall it went.  Which is too bad because 1) I am a big LOTR fan and 2) I had some money I was willing to spend on the game.  Thank god I decided to try the free version and didnt just buy one of the starter packs like I initially thought about doing.  Absolute crap.  Developers clearly can not keep up with evolving PC technology on this dated client.  Move on to something else.			"

												It's a decent enough MMORPG when you start out. The problem arises when you start to want things like auction house slots and the removal of the extremely hindering gold cap. Almost all of the things you would expect from a game like this have been locked behind a pay wall or restricted to paying subscribers. Turbine Points are the in-game store's currency and are almost essential when playing this game, and they can either be collected by completing ""deeds"" (tasks which require hours upon hours of grinding) or bought with real money. This is the largest flaw the game has, because after a certain point everything becomes blocked off except for a few main storyline quests.I'm sure this game was great when it was first released, but now that it has gone ""F2P"" (which is almost a lie) everything revolves around getting Turbine Points to progress. By the time you've collected enough for one small thing, the enjoyment has been ruined.My advice: Play for a bit if you must, but don't spend too much time farming TP, you'll just regret it. Also, If you're considering spending ANY money on this game, please don't. Look at the bigger picture, and go buy a complete experience elsewhere.			"

												WHEN the game works, it is a run of the mill, standard MMOG.  In fact, its nearly as old as WoW, and its age is starting to show.The best thing it has going for it is the story/setting.  The Free-to-play part is also very good, since you can earn points/currency to unlock everything in the game... It would take you a year or 2 playing nearly non-stop, but the option is there.  Unlike many other F2P MMOGs that you can ""play"" but some content will always be locked away until you pay.As far gameplay, game mechanics and interface, this game is ""Ok"" to ""Good""However, this is all overshadowed by the terrible software and support.  A lot of the programs that are running in the backgroud have issues with Windows 7 and 8, Anti-virus software also takes issues with the installer/update program.  Add to all this that TURBINE ( the guys who run the game ) use a lot of lesser-known suport software to do all these functions/update.... the problems never gets fixed.  I had currently been playing for about 2-3 years, but the installer/updates often gave me issues, sending me hunting all over the forums for the ""fix""... Typically the solutions was to disable firewals, Anti-virus, Windows protector, Nortin or whatever I was using at the time.  Even still, sometimes that wouldn't work.  Aslo, a fresh install was needed nearly every 3 months, meaning a 5-10GB download.I had hoped that a fresh install using Steam would solve the problems, but after a week of trying, I have not yet been able to get it to work.  So why should I spend hours trying to get this to run, when so many other games are just as good or better, free and are work the first time?			"

The map is really good, and the story is quite good in places: they succesfully combine your character's story to the actual story that we all know and love. The gameplay is just normal MMO gameplay, and the classes are just normal MMO classes. However, the PVP is not very well developed, the mobs are average most of the time, but the worst part is the trait tree update. It means that each character is limited to one tree of skills, and so the skills that all the characters would have had before have been split up in an attempt to encourage group play. However, all it does is make it frustrating that you can't have all the skills, and make the game about leveling up rather than enjoying it. However, the map is the best I have seen in an MMO, they have got all the place names with huge amounts of accuracy, and the map is close to the right size (despite the horses needing to be sped up to cross it without boredom.) Finally, the group quests and instances are fun (if you can assemble a group), and the items are relatively varied. Also, if you want to get above level 34, then you need to enjoy grinding or have quite a bit of cash, because you have to unlock the other areas. That is the worst part of the game, if you ask me.Overall however, I think it's a fun game, but can recognise the large amounts of missing features and the huge room for improvement.			"

												has a very ""too good to be true"" vibe at first.I played it, it looked like wow, played like wow, felt like everquest 2.I looked at the limitations and thats when I saw why it was too good to be true.it is branded as a free to play game, and by all intents and purposes, it is except it isnt! you will find that you can earn anything you want in the game except you have to keep making characters, and at the end of it all, you are still haunted by the fact that money is hard to make without the ability to trade it. I dont know if this is purchaseable with tp but I diddnt come back.all in all, gw2 does what this does and better the framerate is even the same on a weaker pc (choppy but smoothe) plus, you can play instruments on gw2 like lotro so save for gw2 and just get it cause you will end up buying content for this ""f2p"" title anyway.

												Okay this game has been out for a while. Still it has good content and alot to do in game. But in the 4 years I took for a break they still haven't fixed issues with some of there quests on how they adjust for your level. I am tipicaly a solo player and this game allows you to do alot of that. But some quest just are not soloable unless you pay out for gear and items, or you get so high in levels the quest isn't worth doing. There are other issues with the game but what game has any of us played we didn't have some issue with at least a part of it. Even as old as the game is it still has some fun to it. If you like to craft there are tons of things to craft but like most games the crafting is broken in my book. If one toon can't craft everything and forage for everything I think it is broke. But that is my thought on it.			"

												I started to play this game back in 2007 when it came out (i wanted to try something different from WOW and GW so i started to play this with thoes 2). I remember then having problems with game (hard to start, game crash but when it worked it was OK).  So i managed to make som 1.5 k hours in it.  I got back to it when it came to steam - but only for 48h and that was too much.  After a long time i wanted to get back to this rubbish just to se whats happening now in it and i cant log in - - yes the old error 201. Something that bothers this game from its start. Now good sides of the game:Good graphicLots of questNice in game musicF2P & VIP  (deppends on player wishes)Bad sides:Bugs Gets boring after some timesAnd F2P screwd everything. "

												The highest attribute of this game is hunting for little bits of lore along the quest lines. The quests are not post except for the first sentence of each encounter. No matter how many friends you play with you will feel like you're playing alone. The $0.25 novel bargain Bin at a local library will give you a better value and quality for story. Some of the quests give you part 1 for free and then ask you to pay for part 2. A book would be better. The combat is standard tab targeting with stationary mobs.			"

												While not a BAD MMORPG, I have to say as a Tolkien fan I was a little saddened by how linear the gameplay felt. ""Go here to start the quest, talk to this person to complete the quest, kill exactly this many creatures to complete the quest""...It just doesn't feel as if anything you do has any real impact on the world. If they had given it more of a sandbox feel while still being story driven (think Skyrim or Oblivion), I think I might have enjoyed it more, and yes I understand that a lot of MMOs are limited in this way. I suppose I was just expecting a little more from an established series; I get more enjoyment and feel more freedom in Star Trek Online. Visually and thematically it was appealing and I did love seeing the various locations, but it wasn't for me--especially after taking nearly 48 hours to complete the initial install as well as patch it. LotR fans might enjoy it if they are looking for something that's just LotR themed to play with friends, but if you're looking for something that feels like a Middle Earth experience you probably won't find it here.

												At this point in time it seems a bit outdated.  I played it with a Steely Dawn Bundle.  The game at this point in time feels outdated, and gives no direction in the game.  I feel that with a LOTR Online game there would be a much larger story line involved in the game and I felt like there was no story, and no challenge.  I quit very shortly after and found little enjoyment out of the game.  It's a pretty decent F2P game on it's own but I found it outdated and boring.			"

												It WAS a really good game that eventually lost touch with most of the older playerbase... not to mention p2w features, which, according to devs were just there for covenience since you could get them grinding for a couple of years as well. And then there were the... well... people who took advantage of a lack of banning. What about getting a fully buffed PvP monster character in one week (something that playing by the rules usually takes a year or more, five years in the old system).Played it for a good four years before I quit. Yes it is Tolkien, Yes it is LotR... but it became tedious with no real challenge (soloing raids anyone), borked updates, broken characters getting fixed then broken again the next day. As in all MMOs there are fixes and changes made all the time... yet time after time Turbine managed to brake things, or fixed things that weren't broken. Or introduced an extremely silly grind to reduce the grind needed to get maxed out buff. And lets not even talk about the lack of raids... If you look for a serious MMO you should look elsewhere, not even the fact that this is ME will save it			"

												The game itself is good, but it's a big pay2win... It offers a free solution to the storepoints if you grind like 150 of every mob to get like 10 points each. 10 points  = € 0.014 which is kinda sad cuz it takes you like an hour to get it. Also the game looks kinda dead, only an average of 10ppl appear to be online in the world chat. Rarely you see someone passing by when you're questing.			"

												Veredict: Not worth the time and effort.Sorry Tolkien fans, but sadly this is a big No-No.This game is basically World of Warcraft reskinned to look like Lord of the Rings. With some ""cameos"" from classical characters from the saga.I was a fan of Tolkien's work when I was a kid, read pretty much everything there is to read, and watched the movies when I was almost outgrowing Middle Earth. And to a lesser degree, I was a fan of pretty much everything Blizzard did up until recently. This is to clarify that I am more than aware of the ""lore"" differences.The problem is with the ""feel"" of the game. The gameplay feels clunky, the LotR lore feels heavyhanded, and the graphics barely offer anything remarkable (but they get the job done). And eventually, if you really want to experiencie everything there is to experiencie, you will have to pay... so it's not really ""free"" free. Now, I'm not saying that you cannot play without paying, or that this is a pay-to-win game. The system is fair and honest about what it offers.It's not a ""bad game"". It simply fails to hold any charm or provide a different experience than any other game of the same genre.The final veredict is: Not worth the time and effort....Unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise, or you had some very bad experiences with WOW, I doubt that you'll find anything in this game that is worth your time and money.

												Some of my friends love this game, how ever I do not. I am not a fan of the Lord of the Rings lore, and it feels far too much like a WoW wannabe for me to enjoy. It is also not really f2p, it's more like free to try, and the you either need to sub, or buy quest packs. People comlain about SWTOR f2p being a cash grab, but at least the only quests you have to buy there is the Expac.			"

												So we all know the Lord Of The Rings books and a few movies and the still being created The Hobbit.Personally I love all of books and stuff done from Tolkiens story but I really, really dislike games that are WOW like because I dont like HUGE EMPTY OPEN AREAS where from point A to point B is something about two kilometers but if by any chance you are into this kind of games like WOW then LOTRO is like a COPY of WOW.Have a nice play... I could not write a longer review for this product because the first minutes was really boring for me.			"

												buggy, boring and repetitive quests. When you play the Lord of the Rings Online you will be presented with ALOT of fetch quest (fetch 5 flowers, slay this overpowered boss to collect his ring, travel to the opposite side of middle earth to talk to something and then return to collect a item you can't equip as you are not the right class, pick up some turtles, fetch more flowers, slay another overpowered boss) And the fact that it says ""Free-to-Play"" is a joke as once you hit level 30 (a total of 95 levels currently)there is nothing to do unless you purchase a region to have something to do, I understand that the game is ""free"" and the developers who worked hard on this need some income, but i feel that the term free-to-play meanings that players can slowly reach max level without having to open a wallet and should only purchase items to advance much quicker or unlock things that are rare and powerful not to continue the game that last only 10 levels. and that without other people to play with, some quest feel as they are impossible.If you are looking for a new game to play without feeling the need to open up your wallet to continue playing, avoid this as it is very boring, repetitive and not satisfing to play.But however i know some people who love this game and wouldn't like what i wrote so if you really want to play this, download it, my review is only a warning.

												This game used to be fantastic. That is, when people actually played it. Somewhere down the road this title decided it would be a fun idea to convert to a free-to-play game. ""That's awesome!"", however, wasn't the reply the producers got from their players who mostly just quit the game to go buy another franchise. The reason for this is that the devs took ideas from asian-grinders and everybody knows that doesn't work in the western world: players suddenly found themselves spending money for ingame items and somewhere between buying costumes and purchasing quest-packs forcefully to continue with progression they thought ""this is simply wrong"". Nobody wants to pay a dime for a dying old game.			"

												Yikes.  Perhaps I was too late to the party here, but this game looks and plays very poorly.  Again, perhaps this game was reviewed more favorably due to its relative quality at the time of release, but it's still almost impossible to recommend this with a straight face. This is kind of hard to say as a die-hard LotR fan, but take a pass on this clunker and save up your greenbacks for Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor.			"

												Who doesnt like Lord of the Rings ? But to lie to the public. Let's define Free to Play shall we.You're allowed to log in and kill wolves. Leveling up takes ages.You can earn a couple of turbine points, but you can't really buy anything with them.If you're not VIP well why even bother.Instead of going into the lore more, you spend your time browsing the shop for stuff you wish you had. I dont mind paying sometimes but bloody hell... TOO EXPENSIVE.The combat interface is dull after couple of hours playing. All in all if you're a LOTR fanatic, you are better off watching the movies again and dreaming your part of it in your sleep rather than playing this game now.FYI: I had an non-steam account for it before and i just went back into it. And I want OUT. And good lord going from one quest to another takes like freakin forever.In short, F2P till level 30 then well got a million dollars ? Booooring. Too limited. Cheers.			"

												This game used to be fantastic. That is, when people actually played it. Somewhere down the road this title decided it would be a fun idea to convert to a free-to-play game. ""That's awesome!"", however, wasn't the reply the producers got from their players who mostly just quit the game to go buy another franchise. The reason for this is that the devs took ideas from asian-grinders and everybody knows that doesn't work in the western world: players suddenly found themselves spending money for ingame items and somewhere between buying costumes and purchasing quest-packs forcefully to continue with progression they thought ""this is simply wrong"".

												Lord of the Rings Online is one of those F2P MMORPG's that seemed like a good idea at first. You get some sense of nostalgia when looking through all the different races and some of the classes. Because the classes have cameo's to the popular characters in the books/movies, but when in actual gameplay, they don't seem to do much at all.During my time playing, I was able to use the champion class, the ranger class, and the thief class. I apologise for getting most of those names wrong, it's been a while.The champion class screams at people, very entertaining, the ranger class can't kite well, and the thief class can't steal things.In short, the game is fun enough to try, and to those who have played any other type of MMO, especially the F2P MMO's they all fall into the same kind of gameplay.I won't tell you to stay away from this game, but I also don't recommend it.

												My main focus of play is their unique PvP system.  Based on my observation of the game I have found that game can be fun, but it is currently in bad shape when it comes to game balance in PvP.  Many features which were upgraded when level cap was increased were not fixed or upgraded on the Monster side of game (ex. health regneration, passive crit bonues, damage).  This means that currently there is a heavy imbalance in favor of the Free people characters.  The primary reason is that while release was properly implemented for teh Free people side, the monster part (which is important for PvP side) was mostly ignored during expansions releases.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online, a wonderful open-world game. Freedom and quests are great but when you first start you can't just roam free... Well, you have to do the 'Prologue/Intro' where you do many quests for either the hobbits, dwarfs, elfs, men or beorning but once you have done that, you are free to roam. I found the 'Prologue/Quests' not too irritating but it does take longer to level up the higher your level gets. The races you can chose from are:~Human~Dwarf~Hobbit~Elf~BeorningSome classes include:~Champion~Hunter~Captain~Guardian~Minstrel~Warden~Lore-Master~eceteraGreat game! 11/10 "

												So I hit level 12 and I decided I just dont like fetch/kill quests being the entire prologue of the game.I would play this more if I had 50 dollars to throw at it so I didnt have to walk everywhere.I did like finishing the first part of the game looking like a musketeer though.Killing a specific monster to get a title was nice which led me sitting down and grinding wolves and then goblins when I came upon them.I could not coax the quest tracker to switch the active quest which led me to running a large distance to finish one quest to return and finish everything else at the place where I had left.A definite sticking point is the download time which came out to about 45 minutes from Steam and then around 68 minutes for the game launcher itself to downlink more♥♥♥♥♥♥Just feels a bit dull.

												This is a mmo that was made before the steam release date.You can pick between 10 classes and 5 races if you payed, or ells you can pick between 7 classes and 4 races.Dwarfs, Elfs, Hobbits and Humans. Some of the classes are race spesific, meaning that one race can not pick between all the classes.The graphics, grind and fighting system aren't good. Some of the lines are voice acted.So if you like grinding with mediocer battles, a ton of quests, known locations like The Shire, known movie characters like the fellowship and more then this might be a game for you.Have fun, enjoy and all hail the Hobbit master race :)			"

It just doesnt quite deliver in any scenario. Unfortunately it is just very dated. There are better graphics and gameplay in other free games; Neverwinter, Tera. If you want story, play SWTOR or if you want Lord of the Rings, get the new single player. I was sadly, dissappointed with this game.Note: I did not play the game for a very long time, so can not comment on later gameplay, however, in all honesty I could not ""play"" to later content and I think that speaks volumes.

												THESE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE GAME CAUSE I WANT SOMETHING TO BEAT KIDDY WOW!played this game for a while and disappoints me everytime. Cant use original soundtrack because lawsuit i guess? idk evertime i play i feel simple, like a child. (maybe because im accustom to more hardcore games like everquest?) idk i cant actually recommend this game although i have played this game longer than 20 hours, if you want that Lord of the rings feel, you wont find it in this game. My biggest gripe is the way it looks, it didnt need to look like wow, in fact i guarantee this game wouldve surpassed wow at every turn if they made it look more real than♥♥♥♥♥♥cartoon. also instead of the monster character where its♥♥♥♥♥♥ let me create that race and play a dark campaign and actually have factions because pvp is dead. To which why didnt you take that from wow you♥♥♥♥♥devs. in reality i give it a 4/10 because it doesnt feel look or sound like lotr but its own game with the name bought and slapped on. maybe if they make a lotrO2? maybe it would be better more realistic? a little more complicated where i and others dont feel like a child? And the OST so it sounds and feels like lotr? also add the side of mordor so i can choose those races of Goblin, Urk, Orc, Spider, Wolf, and maybe Troll? thats just me though,			"

												Lets see, The download wasn't that bad... but there was a second download within the game that doubled the original download time in total. The gameplay is more dull than World of Wacraft. The story is meh, if you're not a huge fanboy of Lord of the Rings. Art and detail is REALLY bad. There are two classes you have to pay for. If this game didn't take an hour and a half to download i would have thought this was a really well made browser game made by indie developers, but no this was made by a real company and published by Warner Bros. MEtacritic gave this game 86.... Planet side 2 (another free MMO) got 84, no, no... Bad call to action at the start. And last the layout for everything is just disgusting.The game was FREE TO PLAY. There is background to the Lord of the Rings but you wouldn't care at all if you didn't read every book and played every game. It tried to be like World of Warcraft or Guild Wars 2... but fell short.If you have a few hours try downloading the game and watch the numbers slowly rise from 0 to 10,000. This is just for the fan boy die hards. Anyone else stay clear.			"

												Let's see here....1st of all made a character; an elven mage. Tried to customise him, but they all look the same.2nd thing I did, played the combat tutorial; classic MMO throw numbers at baddie and he throws them back; smaller numbers mean dead.Next I dragged myself through some gray corridors until some horribly voiced acted guy was all like; ""oh no's! We're under attack :O""GUST OF WIND!!!! Most OP spell in the game!!! Just kidding it does nothing, you litterally throw glitter & it does nothing; the best spell I had was summon Dovahbear to fight for me. There's no penalty like mana to summon and he never died once. Hits waaaay harder than I ever could. Nice to know a wild animal can fill my place here.Met up with my buddy Noble. We ♥♥♥♥ed around with the relative system whilst the NPC's were yelling exposition at us. Nice to know he can be my mother, daughter and cousin all at the same time. Thanks game!Shopping happened.Me and Noble tried to go do a dungeon. A dwarven cemetary to be exact. It would be nice if we could go inside though. It's not too important to your dungeon ya know. Being able to use it.... oh well! Dovahbear's swimming animation is waaay more entertaining than the gameplay ever will be.I decided to follow Dovahbear off of a bridge. I got stuck in a watery hole. Still; seeing a bear doing doggy paddle is all the entertaining I need.Eventually I died. Probably starved to death. Maybe I killed myself. We will never know.I respawned in ring surrounded by wolves. Casted some gust of wind here and let my bear companion deal with the rest.My poor elven mage got so bored he hung himself. At least I hope he did. His fabulous ability to throw glitter at people with gust of wind didn't really help open that door the dungeon.Then everything went white. Then black. Then blue. That's either what happens when you die or when the game crashes. I'll never know because McAffee had the biggest temper tantrum with this game ever and purged my entire steam library.In conclusion; get this lose every other game. You can only play this game...Forever!!!!!!			"

												As someone who frequents the f2p section of Steam I can say I was fairly dissapointed with this game. I confess right off the bat that I have been spoiled by other f2p mmo's particularly regarding voice acting (there is none in this game). I also need to make clear that while I enjoy the franchise I'm not the most well versed in the lore of the Lord of the Rings universe, and perhaps that's why I couldn't get inot the game. I found the game to feel similar to the later Elder Scrolls Online, the game feels like a generic fantasy mmorpg with a coat of lotr paint on it. Combat is your typical hotkey button mashing you've seen plenty of times before. The graphics are marginal, although the game isn't too recent so I'd say take it with a grain of salt. I didn't play for long before this game bored me to the point of asking the dreaded ""why should I care?"" Another point to give to the game is that I didn't find any pay to win (though once again I didn't play for too long). You might enjoy this game if you're really into the LotR world and lore, or if you have a group to role through the game with. If you're not very familiar with the universe and don't have anyone to play with I'd reccomend giving it a try as it is free, but I'm not sure you'll find too much enjoyment as there are much better mmorpg's that are also free.

Posted: January 31, 2015
												I don't know what to say.It is strange.I played more than 1000 hours on LOTRO (!) and I wouldn't recomand this game in any situation.I can see two situations right now : 1 :  you are a fan of Tolkien's world or of the films. This game is not for you. If you are a fan of Tolkien's world, the team tried to speak to you by adding names and histories that are from the background of Tolkien's work. Some homages, some references. That's kind of them. But it doesn't repair the damages that can be done by the simplist gameplay and the money motivations. If some (not even all, just one of two) of Peter Jackson's choices just bothered you, then forget this game : it is full of it. And the whole game encourage gamers to disrespect the canon. Lot of ignorants in there, in this domain anyhow. You'll find that this is lords of the rings for dummies, that people in there prefer Dungeons and Dragons than The Silmarillion. That's fine, but you must understand that. If you search for a strong passionate community, you'll be disapointed. You'll find some like yourselves, but you'll be all drowned in all the casual gaming and mainstream ideology.If you loved the films, you'll find that all what is in those films is not respected also. The adventure feeling isn't there, the characters are used as pretext, the missions have no depth. The action is inexistant. It is more like a World of Warcraft feeling. And This leads me to my second situation : 2 : you don't care about Tolkien's work. That's fine, I don't care about a lot of things too. But if this is the case, why LOTRO ? The same team developped a more suitable game : Neverwinter. Works well, same features, same feeling, not Tolkien's world and I am forced to say : it is better. Because when the team tries sometimes to stick to an adventure (The lord of the Rings) without achieving it, they force themselves to limit their imagination and the result is mediocre. When in Neverwinter, the have a clean slate and full of ideas.So here is my conclusion. I understand that it will not be loved by the LOTRO community but honestly, I don't care. I have felt what it is to be drawn in a game like this : you feel that you have to do all the daily missions, the events, the things, the stufs... and you forget why you do it. Then, one day, you wake up and you just ask yourself : wait... That's not what I was looking for"". Sometimes, this wake up call is later for others, and when you are still in the process, you just don't want to hear anything like what I said, but the thing is : it is true.One big positive point though : the game has good graphics. Well, they are archaics, but the managed to do great things with it. The Shire is beautiful and peaceful, Imladris is has magic in the air, and good atmosphere. I just took more screenshots in this game than in all other games I have. The only thing is : while you are wandering on those great scenary, you bump into ugly things and it breaks the moment. But for contemplation moments, it is ok. It is great, even.I (or the road) could go on and on, I could speak about the whole gameplay driven by microtransactions and the fact that they gave a lot of things to the gamers sinces they pay for it, the fact that everything has no more coherence because of that, the fact that when they can choose to tweak a gameplay feature, they never choose logic and coherence, but always what could leat to more player buying, but that's propper to a lot of MMO and if you like MMO, you'll find those stuffs normal.So I will stop this long review here, that I tried honest and usefull.

The price of the items and services such as banking are so over priced it must be designed by some Prince of Dubia.  The killer for me was when you gat to level 10 you can join instances however to go to the 1st instance you have to buy it for approx £30 well guess what for £30 you can buy a half dozen better games then this.

												This game took forever to download and after having several difficulties and multiple hours wasted even trying to get it onto my computer, I was dismayed to find that the skin tones for player characters was very, very limited. As a black person and lover of high fantasy it is noteably very hard to find representation within shows, movies, etc that show such time periods, but often I have found that in MMO's or games that have at least some degree of character customization that allow darker skintones. Literally, the lightest I was able to go was a slightly darker tan. This turned me off from the game enough to delete it off of my computer completely, damn the hours I had wasted trying to play it in the first place. This kind of disappointment is unfortunately very common, but other games have included darker skintones and been able to hold much more vast audiences. LOTRO, please take notes from other games - Neverwinter, STO, Dragon Age, pratically anything else where you can customize yourself.			"

												My first impression is it looks old - the graphics don't look nice and I had my settings all on high. It feels a bit chunky when the character is walking/running around.Started doing a couple of quest and suddenly i could not move and had to restart the game.Back in continued the quest. The quest are as usual, bring this and that and kill this and that. The cut scene are nice but what I noticed is that you hear someone and suddenly you have to read the rest.. shame. character stuck again, restart game againIt has many options in game. What I did not like it th epurchase of a new role (Rune-keeper and the other). You can even purchase quest from the store !... again character stuck - restart game again.For a game that has been active a while I'm getting lots of these issues. It is not a game that wants you to play more and with teh crashed...All in all, try it and decide for yourself.			"

												If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												I really want to like this game. In fact, there is a lot to like. The graphics are nice for something as old as this. The storytelling is great. The combat feels smooth. The soundtrack is good. Unfortunately, there is A LOT of bad too. The game has a focus on group content and yet doesn't really offer many ways to get a group together other than spamming global chat hoping to find people. The group finder tool simple doesn't work. And even when it does it's only for dungeons, not open-world non-soloable quest and definately not for story quests.  And that's the real kicker for me. The game's story has quests that you HAVE to group in order to compete.  There just isn't enough hand-holding, help getting there, direction, or other players to help a new player move along.			"

												Let me detail to you my first hour or so of LOTRO gameplay.Created a Character. That was pretty cool acctually, Nice details, good naming system... nice.Spawned. It all goes to hell. Hobbit tells me to rescue some chums. I promptly rescue them. Suddenly, an enemy appears! A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Black Rider Animation! End cutscene. Another enemy. I click on said enemy. I wait. My character uses his baseball bat, sorry, sword, to hack the man to the ground. I squint: seeing a bar at the bottom of my screen, I realize I can change HOW my character whacks at enemies by clicking on one of the tiny options presented there. I try one on the next enemy, who looks exactly the same as the first. Now, my character, a human ranger guy, swings at the Bad'un from the LEFT. I cackle with excitement. I never knew one could make a videogame character swing from the LEFT before! I'm in the world. I think for a moment: I need an eyetest. But of course, I forgot, this IS a fantasy world, everything is SUPPOSED to be horribly distorted! I walk towards this giant arrow thing on my screen. Sorry, I click on the ground and my character walks there. I stop for a second... Why is my character twitching? Why does it take so long for my character to respond to my commands? Oh, wait, despite my posession of High Speed Internet and a computer that would eat this game for lunch, LOTRO is laggy as hell. I forgot. Not that I play large Planetside 2 battles with no lag or anything. I click on this wierd trashbag-clothed guy and he tells me that, for a reward (that I could also buy in the LOTRO player store for real money) I should go out and kill things. I go out and, at about 5-10 fps, click on various bunny-sized creatures and watch my character hack them to death. Strangely enough, they don't move when my Char hits them, or react at all for that matter, but, for some reason, numbers keep flying out of their heads. I'll have to ask about that on the forums. Repeat. Reward.Repeat. (x999999999)Eventually, I am told to run off to some templ-y thing to kill more bunny-wolves. I promptly do so, and slay my way to the top of the temple, leaving a mound of wolves behind me, to get to a platform. Suddenly, there is a burst of flame, and an evil-looking man appears, holding a staff! He cackles widly, and, in a strangely American-sounding accent, tells me I am doomed. I grin with anticipation. Finnally! A fight worth my hard-won ability to swing from the left! I walk across the room and click on him, heart humming with the rythms of battle...I swing....He dies. A message pops up: ""return to Quest Giver for reward."" I stare at my screen, schocked. Still dazed, I exit the game and power down my computer. Eyes wide, I stumble to an adjacent room, where I collapse on the couch, twitching. After nearly an hour I awaken from what could only have been some sort of mental shut down. My first words are : ""Someone should be executed for selling this trash."" Do NOT get hyped because it's got a supposedly HUGE world. There's loading screens between every miniscule area. Play at your own risk.			"

												Okay, I want to preface my review by saying that I love The Lord of the Rings and just about everything involving Middle-Earth.But, that said, I find myself questioning why I downloaded this game.I can hear it now, the people clamoring to tell me that I just need to give it chance.  However, that won't be happening, and for one good reason: the game does not work on my computer.A bit of information about my computer, since I know it is highly important to the working of the game:-Windows 8.1-AMD A8 2Ghz Processor-4 GB RAMThis would seem to be enough to play the game.  This is certainly enough to play a game that is arguably more taxing, namely Star Trek Online, which runs smoothly with only a few hiccoughs when my Internet connection slows.Now, for my review of the game.*Gameplay: 0/10*The Lord of the Rings Online, unlike Star Trek Online, does not run smoothly.  In fact, it barely runs at all.  After nearly three hours of downloading the game, I open it to discover another five hours of updates before I can play the game.  Once I open the game, I stare at a black screen for five minutes, waiting for something to happen.  Then, I am introduced to a cinematic cutscene with audio that is jerky and lags.  The video runs slowly, and I sit through another ten minutes of this.  I reach the character creation screen, and I finally have the game run smoothly.  There are no problems here.My character created, I enter Middle-Earth, and then I walk away from my computer to take care of some pressing issues.  I come back just as the the load screen disappears and my character shows up in a small room with only one other person present, Elrond.  Just an FYI, I created an Elf Hunter.  It is a level 1, since this was about as far as I got in the game.  I try to approach the wise Elder, only to learn that my actions have a serious lag time of five seconds.  Anyone who plays a MMORPG can tell you that even one second can be the difference between surviving a battle and dying horribly at the end of a goblin spear.  But I persevere.For another ten minutes, which is how long it takes me to reach the first door portal in the game.  I step through, and the game crashes.  Hard.  As in, I barely managed to get the Task Manager to open in order to End the game.*Graphics: 6.5/10*The graphics are not amazing, but they aren't terrible.  I really didn't get enough play time to determine much, but from what I did see, they earned an average score.*Story: N/A*I only played for a short time before I was done, so I can't even begin to guess what the story is about.  I caught something about a Dwarf and some artifact that belonged to some wraith or something... yeah, I've got no clue.*Player Interactions: N/A*With this being an MMORPG, or so I've heard, there should be player interaction at some point.  I never saw it, for the sole reason that I never got out of the tutorial.*Final Verdict: 0.5/10*tl;dr - I honestly want to play this game, but as it currently stands, I never will unless I find someone in the real world who has it and will deign to let me play for a couple of hours.

												So basically I've downloaded this game in hopes that It will be good.. I was kinda dissapointed. I knew the graphics weren't that good, but that was not my main point of downloading this game. My main point was to be impressed by the good storyline, amazing gameplay and the colourful character design as everyone has been saying in the comments below. I was not impressed. If you compare this to Neverwinter or Tera or even Aion (jk) this is not the best MMORPG out there. It's good for those who don't have a beast computer or for the people that have a Mac. I just hope this game gets better overtime and one day It will be as good as all the other MMORPG's out there (except AION).			"

												The gameplay for Lord of the Rings Online is slow, but not necessarily bad, though it seems to not compare to other Free to Play MMO games on steam.The main factor invoking my wrath is that the DLC for Lord of the Rings Online is very high in price, and then I had an experience unlike any other Free to Play MMO I've played. You are expected to pay $25 for a premium horse mount. You cannot use your horse in combat. If you plan on spending money in a game and get rewarded for it. Go play some Star Trek Online; I'm fairly certain you've considered playing that one too.			"

After installing and then patching 16GB I do NOT want to hassle with ""cannot locate game exectuable"" + ""Nope it does not work!""C: FIX THE DAMNED INSTALLER! PERIOD!SERIOUSLY : If you cannot fix this installer thing then you are just a bunch of incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no business in the computer games industry! I as the user should NOT have to do magic tricks and woodoo to get your game running.If you by chance have the option of getting _into_ the game, it's higly repetetive and grindy... Still the nice vistas and the LotR feeling is there, and it is a fun pastime. To bad it's made by bumbling incompetents instead of the people who tried and almost succeeded to make a great game. They should name the company ""Sharky & Sandyman mills & mmo"" Because this is really Pimpleface-poor quality!			"

												It's really boring. I've played about an hour now and decided to give up. You can't even play a real spellcaster without paying money. Right there that's a major difference from Neverwinter, a game that for some reason has a lower review level on here. Yes, Neverwinter is very repetitive but at least the graphics are better and the combat is challenging even for spellcasters. I'm not an expert on MMORPG's but I know what's fun to play and what isn't, and this isn't. Some of the positive reviews say stuff like ""It's fun if you like exploring"", ""It's fun if you play with friends"". It does have a huge map. But if the combat system is simply right-click and sit back, that's really outdated; I'd rather play Summoner I and II than this. And the spells for a class like loremaster are pretty lame. I don't understand the point of the game's development. Is it simply to build a huge world and then have crappy combat? I mean, what is the goal of the game for fun? Isn't an RPG supposed to be about specifically chosen character progression (by you, not the computer) in skills and levels, and then good melee and spell choices? Without those fundamental RPG attributes in a game, an RPG like this one just plain sucks, there is no getting around it.			"

												This has to be one of the worst MMOS I've ever played. The controls are clunky, the world is dead and doesn't encourage exploration (map areas are locked for too long and fast travelling doesn't work) the storyline is boring, cliched and vague, the leveling is broken, and the menus are confusing in this poor rendition of Middle Earth.I don't have high expectations for MMOS, but this one is painful to play and I'm sure has Tolkien rolling around in his grave.It may have been fun to play back when it was first released, but it is dry and uninspiring now.That being said, it is fun to play if you feel like playing a terrible MMO with your friends for the kicks.

												I tried to give this game a fair chance, but there are a couple of problems with it that make it impossible for me to recommend it.1 - It claims to be Free To Play, but in the end it boils down to Pay To Win (aka Feemium). Anything worth having is on the LOTRO store for prices that make it impossible to get without paying real-world cash for the coins.2 - This game is not for us who live in places where you still have to pay per megabyte of data, there are large ""updates"" every time the launcher starts. Looking at what is updating, I have to ask myself if I really need to be paying for different language loading screens.3 - Now it's broken. The latest update seems to have broken my copy (at least), which probably means I'd have to delete the game files and re-download it if I wanted to play further (see point 2).4 - I haven't really been paying much attention to world chat, but once or twice I noticed comments like ""if you don't want to be in a fellowship go find a single player game"" and ""if you want to quest alone go find a single player game"". A community that tells players to go away because they want to play a game in their own way is in trouble and heading toward becoming toxic.			"

												The beginning of the game is ok due to the cinematic gameplay you are involved in but as you level up it takes on the form of any other MMO. If you like questing in MMOs in general then you have the normal grindy leveling situation. I am not sure about endgame stuff  because I never have the time nor attitude to do that so I have no opinion. Plus, most endgamers won't even give me the time of day since I have bad gear and not very good on the keypad in Raids. Kind of stinks since at one time I loved MMOs and wanted to do end game stuff when it is hard not when they dumb stuff down for pug groups. The graphics are dated now although the game still looks ""good"" but definately looks older than it is. The game is worth trying to see if it is your cup of tea. I won't rate it since most people who like MMOs will try them out to see if they like them. It is F2P now anyhow and I think you have to buy level packs to move past a certain point but that make be changed now. I have played the game more than 8 hours before I installed it on Steam. I made it to the 30s before I stopped playing on another account. If you like LOTR lore you will like playing the game other than that try it out past level 20s.			"

I've never been a fan of The Lord of the Rings franchise so this review may be biased, but facts are facts. The combat is WoW. That's it. The community is not bad but not good either, nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ for new players anymore. Plus it's free to play, so expect some premium cash. It is by no means a bad game, at least it didn't appear to be in the 0.6h I've played it but it's not a masterpiece and there are better MMOs to play.			"

I mean really old. And I've seen better ones 10 years ago.-the tutorial is not too bad and has all the basics-the auto-target mission objective kinda worries me, since it always messes up the camera-controls are kinda un-intuitive, maybe I'm just used to something else (more modern)-compared to some newer MMORPG games, it's all clumsy, slow, chunky-uninstalled itCan't recommend this game.

												I couldn't wait to play this game, but I only got as far as the end of the tutorial before I felt compelled to uninstall because the graphics are incredibly poor (even at maximum), the controls awkward, the combat dreadful, and the writing awful (even for a tutorial). Even the voice acting is phoned in. From the first screen the game looks awful, and plays worse. It seems like the worst kind of hammered together movie tie-in game consisting of a poor engine with a licensed skin that doesn't remotely do justice to the source material. Absolutely not recommended.			"

												Initial impressions:Ok, so far, severely disappointing. I see a lot of good reception for this game but have absolutely no clue where it comes from. The graphics look more like they are from 2006 rather than 2012 and still the game manages to lag every time a new thing appears on the horizon. The writing has been fairly simple so far and the quests have been about collecting or killing an x number of something. The controls are actually inferior to standard MMO controls. Whatever happened to clicking on the enemy and your character running up and attacking automatically? Was that too advanced so that we had to go back to manually running to targets and getting smacked in the back because we ran a bit too far and clipped through the enemy, as your character won't attack unless he is facing the enemy? It's not like the old control system is being traded for advanced fighting techniques (like in Elder Scrolls) since the rest of the cotnrols is still just about clicking on enemies and pushing hotkeys. The game isn't terrible. I did notice that the world seems to be gigantic, which is nice, and everything seems to be functional, but so far LOTRO it's just a standard barebones MMO. If that is what I'm in for then I might as well go back to playing Lineage II from 2003. I keep pushing through to see if it gets more interesting or special later, but so far...no.CORRECTION: sorry, indeed the game turned out be from much earlier, so I take that part back, but as for the other stuff, I realised that I just don't have the time to wait a while and see if things get better. Who does? Besides the job and studies, there are so many other games, many co-op or mmo. Maybe that was not as applicable 10 years ago, but now...man.			"

												A 'could have been great' game, The Lord of the Rings Online™ is what I would call a Mega-MMORPG, consisting of a HUGE world for players to delve into and explore. The graphics don't disappoint either-Some of the best graphics in any MMORPG can be seen in The Lord of the Rings Online™. In addition to this, there is plenty of customization and stuff to do for new and veteran players alike for each of their characters. Unfortunately, this is where the high-points of this once-proud game taper off. Even completely new players will soon realize this game will most likely be a life-long effort if reaching Max Level is their primary goal. In addition to this, the pay-to-win factor is high here, with plenty of 'services' tailored for players who have real money to spend...Like the Riding Skill. And it only gets worse from there...Once a player achieves Level 20-25-ish, the monsters become tougher and more aggressive, and the quests only become harder. Of special note here are the prerequisites for completing certain quests. You may have to carry a certain item (Such as a bucket of water) from one location to another, which becomes a tedious task as you are unable to battle monster mobs and you are likely to encounter at least one mob! In addition to this, there are at least a few instances of repetitive monsters-I.E. Boars!! The grinding quickly becomes more apparent and certain sounds or noises in the game could be a bother to players with auditory sensitivity. Yes, they give out free presents every day a player logs in, but usually, they end up tossed away as useless junk items. The one and only time I played, I also noticed a lack of any sort of active community. And seeing as how this was WAY back in 2013-2014, I wouldn't wanna return to this game to see how much it has decayed since then.Pros...Ability to select a classNice customization options for your characterFairly easy tutorialAwesome graphicsGood selection of items/weapons/armor/spellsAbility to purchase and ride a horse (And later a War Steed)Ability to purchase and live in a fairly small houseMany quests are fairly easy to doYou can create more than one character per accountWell-Done story-line and voice actingCons...The main way of gaining XP is through completion of questsThere are several quests requiring a party or 'fellowship'The riding skill must be purchased with real money to be able to ride a horseAcquiring a War Steed requires the player to be Level 75The game could potentially download and run slower on PC's with lesser graphics drivers and RAMMuch of your efforts will consist of long-distance traveling...Even while riding on horseback!Some items/weapons/armor/spells can only be used by certain classesSpeaking of classes, you have to pay to play as one of themIt's rather easy to get killed in this game if you're not careful...Music doesn't appeal to me/Doesn't sound very goodCertain sound effects are capable of making my ears bleed!...Figuratively of courseGaining levels beyond Levels 20 to 25 requires MUCH more time and effort!Final Score-3 Stars-Bad!

After an hour of trying to reach what I thought was an objective waypoint, I went back to the person who gave me the quest and found the objective was three feet away.  After doing a few more tutorial quests I got one where I had to find and talk to someone else... it was then I realized I'd spent too long on this PoS already.			"

												well to be honest i have only played this game for 10 minutes. before i continue, this is my OPINION. if you disagree because you played it more than 10 minutes than don't take what i am going to say personally and don't make a discussion out of it. i have better things to do ;)people may find it unappropiate because i just played it for such a short time, but i just wanna share my thougts about those 10 minutes. first i wanna talk about the mood/atmosphere of the game (sorry if i said it wrong). i am talking about the feeling of the game. when i saw the intro, i found it a bit cheesy. wich is fine for the genre. but when the intro ended and i came to the menu, the whole lotr fibe was gone for me. too much happiness, too much (sorry to say this) WOW rip off and too less lotr. wich brings me to the graphics: the game looks too simple. the models, the detaills on models, etc. for a game that is still played today, dissapoints me. especially when i had to download 18 gigs and i get something that looks like 400 mb. its 2017, at least scale the models of the 5 classes, so that the body doesn't look like someone who has been on stretched on a rack or who has been put in a small cage for months. the game looks like the concept is more important than actually make it perfect. people want lotr, they get an everyday mmorpg that rips off mechanics from different mmos and put in hobbits and dwarfs to make it lotr. this brings me to details. oh god the details.... like: almost no detaills what so ever. too less blood if you compare it to any other lotr movie, game or even the book. no lotr details in buildings, characters or gameplay. maybe further in game in some quests maybe, but i don't wanna find out anymore. now the gameplay. the gameplay is so much ripped off i could play any other game. why play lotr online, while you can play any other mmorpg wich is exactly the same but better? just because it is lotr? give me a break.looking around, walking and engaging fights is really really sloppy. fighting goes auto, wich looks very glitchy and unsynchronized. i chose the hunter, and he kept changing from daggers to bow like he was some kind of magician. it looked REALLY bad. i could complain more, but ive already complaint more about the game then the time i spent playing it. I just want to say it is the worst game i have tried out in years. Conclusion: don't play this game. this is not what you want in a lord of the rings game. go play any lotr game that is not this one to actually feel you are busy with lotr instead of playing a game that is like any other game, but worse and just names its game, characters and items after the legendary stories of JRR Tolkien just to gain players.it is NOT worth ANYTHING, even the time to download.again: MY OPINION.

												The Lord of the Rings Online Pros:+ has a big map + nice quests Cons: -in your account you can have only a couple of characters from the ""Good"" side and one from the Monster side while all the rest monster races are unlockable through Turbine Points (meaning purchasing) -the game on the go comes with only 3 bags meaning 15 free slots each bag and these slots can be quite easily filled(if you want to get more bags certainly this not gonna happen through Auction House as it has no bags at all. Only through VIP and Turbine Points meaning purchasing it )-it has Currency Cap . Well you 've guested right! You can't have as any money you want to. Instead you gotta unlock this Crap and give some Turbine Points meaning purchasing.-this game is far from free to play.-This game shouldn't be called Lord of the Rings it's a disgrace to the title. Instead the right name should be like Cash Of The Rings-If Turbine doesn't cahnge the rules i am not gonna bother either with that piece of crap			"

												I come back to this game after not playing it for MONTHS and I have hours worth of updates to go through. 4827 files to download and it's taking so long. The worst part? I have to do these updates because for some reason, the launcher prompts me with: ""There are updates. Do you want to install them? You can't play the game without installing updates.""WHY IS THERE AN OPTION OF YES OR NO WHEN I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT INSTALLING THEM EITHER WAY?! It's an illusion of choice and it is terrible. Now I have to sit through these 4K files to download before I play again.			"

												This is surely the most beautiful and in every way perfect MMORPG. Playing this won't be boring even after thousands of hours played. Of course there are awesome quests, but also very nice crafting system, instances, housing and others. The most powerful attribute of this game is definitely world of beautiful environments, places you may know from movies and books, but also large amount of new places, places that will make♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself of their darkness. It's awesome game indeed, but still there is one bad thing - the higher your level is, the more awesome the game is, so there are some little boring parts in the introduction, especially if you play as a hobbit. Thankgod this part is short and it's followed by thrilling story and side quests, hobbies and stuff, like you've never seen. Maybe it can get boring again if you'll be low leveled and you'll need to level up with no quests left, but quest packs and expansions can fix it, and they are not expensive at all, you can even buy them for game cash, not real money. Well, this game is my first love, i recommend it to all of you!			"

												short version: the game is authentic to the middle earth mythos and has tremendous detail.it is easy to learn with good tutorials and the classes and races feel unique in how they play.a halfling burgler [bilbo baggens is a burgler class character] is different than a human burgler.rangers are quite different from lore masters.and i love it.longer version:i started playing the game long before it was on steam.i bought the game when it was REQUIRED to pay a monthly subscription fee for access to the game.i have seen the game expand and grow to what it is now.i approve.if you don't know the mythology that was built around middle earth, this is a great game and has many different ways to play.you can play casual or intense and you will find a community that is the most helpful and friendly of any multiplayer online game i have seen, and i have been playing online games since the mid '90's when they were all text games.the game is primarily ""co-operative"" player mode where you see and know and interact with many other players.there is PVP where you can take your characters from the co-operative world and have fun at PVP and return to the co-operative part of the game with the treasures and experience earned in the PVP area.you can be a burgler. a traveling mistral ,a warrior, or a maker of jewelry and pies.oh yes and a spell caster also.you can probably find some aspect of the game that appeals to your ""style"".if you know about middle earth you will be pleased to see that the team that developed, and is still developing this game are also familiar with the stories and have taken great care to be true to the original concept put forth in the books years ago.one example of this would be walking past a stone troll standing on a hill in the middle of a swamp in a certain area, and you knowing the story behind why it is there. no sign posted with the story, no explanation offered, but if you have read the story you know why it is there.and many other things like the last homely house and you get to meet tom bombadill at his house.when or if you meet bilbo baggins, elron, strider or gandalf it is done in a believable way that does not break or even stretch the known original story lines from the books.and being free to play with micro-transactions does not mean ""pay to win"" in this game.the ability to earn turbine points from actions in the game [turbine points are what you pay real world cash for]  makes this game different than other free to play games that i have seen, even among those other games with ways to earn points in the game.so you can learn skills and do deeds that are supporting of the ""middle earth mythos"" and be rewarded with points that can otherwise be bought.points in the game are earned mostly for working along lines that advance or support the ""feel"" of middle earth.

												First of all this is one of the better WoW copys... Not an exact copy, but hey it's one of those that is very similar is it not?.. But in a good way. What I like about Lotro is unlike WoW the soloing feels much more worthwhile,, example questing, deeds, proffs, etc. Not as many A hole players in the community (compared to WoW, but you're still bound to run into some somewhere) Also like that you can do some instances solo, and that there's a whole main story chain quest throughout the game comprised of instances at certain points. Great lore, well working game engine and mechanics imo, and decent graphics for what it is. Wouldn't regret giving it a shot, but I myself went ahead and bought the sub cause I hate being limited to 30 lvls, but you can still buy the game zone by zone.			"

												Surprisingly, really ♥♥♥♥ing good.  I was expecting another hack off MMORPG, but LOTRO has a huge number of features thta arguably make it the best F2P MMORPG on the market right now.First off, it's filed with pre-established lore.  An excellent job was done in making the player feel inside the LotR universe, and it shows that the develops didn't have to scrounge around for source materialAkin to early WoW, you're not a special snowflake.  You're just another player in this vast world; there are wars going on that you are only a soldier in, you can make small differences here and there but as a whole the world doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you.  And this is a WONDERFUL MMORPG CONCEPT.  It contributes heavily to the immersion, and makes the game as a whole more compelling to play.The unique skill and trait trees.  Every game ♥♥♥♥ing has these, but forcing the player to earn the right to use traits or improved skills, even if most of them are just kill 9000 boars and gather kobold candles, gives meaning to the word 'skills'.  Your character worked to improve themselves, and it is reflected in their abilities.  These aren't things that just come along easily while leveling: it takes a large amount of game time to master skills and traits, even with dedicated grinding.  Your character is reflecting the effort and time put into the game, and that in of itself is a fantastic concept.Lastly I just want to mention one feature that really put this game into the forefront of my mind.  Fall damage.  Most MMORPGs just adopt the WoW %health based fall damage, but this is one area where LOTRO exceeds everything else on the market.  Falling say a story or two doesn't damage your health.  Falling several stories or off a small cliff gives you an injury, which reduces movespeed immensely, removes any capabilities for dodging or negating damage, and lasts for 30 seconds.  Rather than punishing the player by forces them to do a spawn run or what have you when they attempt to speed up their travel by skipping flights of stairs, LOTRO realistically reduces the movespeed of the player by ""breaking their leg"", meaning that you can jump if you want to, but it is probably faster to walk down the stairs.  But keeping in tandem with the realism, if you jump off a mountain or fall off a building, you are going to die.  However it has to be an extreme height, so there is no fear of dying from simple stair skipping, and it actually causes fear if you come to close to a cliff's edge or accidentally slip off of a roof.All in all, a solid 9/10, easily the best Free-to-play MMORPG on the market.

												One of the most wonderful MMO experiences I've ever had. Solid story, great combat, incredible atmosphere for all the zones I've visited as a free player. Hours of play and replayability.I stopped playing this game three years ago mainly because the pre-30 content has dried up for me and I honestly cannot sustain a subscription and/or sink ~$40 for each expansion. If only it remained a buy-to-play game like GW2 with a minor microtransaction shop (nonessential/noncontent items), I would gladly have saved up, bought it, and never looked back.That said, if you can sustain a subscription or pay for the expansions, I have nothing but the highest recommendations for this game. 9/10.

												While certainly not as well designed and graphically on par compared to other MMOs, this is a great game for die hard fans of the Lord of the Rings series as well as people looking to get into massively multiplayer gaming. It's a generally faithful representation of Middle-Earth. The quests are also engaging and the epic story is actually quite intriguing. However, be prepared for 2007 graphics, even on high, semi-rare crashes, and long loading times even on a fast network. All in all though, the good outweighs the bad with this game, although if you're a hardcore MMOer, I wouldn't suggest getting this game.			"

												The hours that Steam has logged as me playing this game do not equal the amount of hours I have put into this game.  This is through no fault of Steam, I started playing LotRO around 3.5 years ago, and was not using Steam for part of that, and I can tell you that my hour count probably is closer to 1,000.  That should be a good indicator of what I think of this game.If that is not enough, then let me simply go off on a paragraph or two of love for this game.I have tried other F2P MMOs out there, jumping here and there, but none of them really did it for me.  They were all missing something, or some things, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Then, one winter break, my brother sent me an IM, telling me we should give it a go, it looked like fun.  Again, that was 3.5 years ago.  I haven't looked back, and I will be forever grateful to him for introducing me to this game.For starters, the game is fairly true to its word, it is Free to Play.  There are many players who have gone through the entire game content, buying quest packs, expansions, and fun little extras without paying a cent in real money.  The game allows players oppertunities to ""earn"" turbine points, the buyable currency, through the completion of ""deeds,"" little meta quests.  In order to look ""cool"" within the game, one only needs to complete a few skirmishes, or take a browse through the auction house to aquire neat looking gear.  Want a horse?  No problem.  The player initially uses turbine points to buy the riding trait from the store, but upon the creation of your first character (perhaps even on each server, not simply first account character), you are granted 100 tp to buy this skill.  Afterwards, one can purchase nearly ever horse availible within the game using the in game currency of gold, silver, and copper.  Long story short, the game does not bar players from looking great, getting around as fast as their companions, and joining their companions in their adventures, simply because they don't want to shell out some cash.Secondly, the content is really nice.  Everyone has their least favorite areas (ugh, Lone Lands...), but the way the story plays out and takes you through zones is really fun!  Within the game, you are not riding alongside the Fellowship, but working in other parts of the world, because there are more things happening than just the discover of the One Ring.  The main story line (or Epic Quest, Book Quests, ect) is interesting and enthralling, and you will find yourself getting caught up in certain places, feeling for the characters you meet (the end of the Shadows of Angmar books is a doozy, watch your step!).  Along side the epic quests are side quests, like most games, which are equally interesting and often provide a deeper look into the lore of Middle Earth, and a closer look at the story of Lord of the Rings.But I think the most...wonderful, really, part of LotRO is how it looks.  It is perfect.  Visually stunning even in the early zones, and outragiously beautiful as you get to the most recently released areas, it is easy to simply spend time roaming around the fields of Bree, bundling up and sliding down an icy hill in Forochel, or poking around dark corners in Moria.  There are tiny details everywhere, and it all seems to be carefully considered and designed, and is a vision of Middle Earth that I am more than happy to adopt as my default.  There are so many hidden nooks and crannies, little scenes, and secrets to find, and it's well worth it to just take a day to wander and forget about questing.I think, in the end, that's what really keeps me coming back to LotRO.  It's a game that has a solid amount of everything.  Exploration, crafting, roleplay, raiding.  The community is wonderful, I've made so many friends, and I cannot recommend this game highly enough.If you have any more questions, or want to see screenshots from the game, head over to http://elfwithacamera.tumblr.com.  I hope to see you in Middle Earth!			"

												Best MMO I have ever played. World is fantastic, even just the F2P. Story is interesting and well told and everything is very close to Tolkein's works. The game is never impossible but also has a good level of challenge and will keep you occupied for hours. However, the shining part of this game is the business model. Downloading it gets you the whole world (until Western Rohan) to explore and the main quest (again until Western Rohan), though you are unable to access any misc quests after the first four areas (Ered Luin, The Shire, Bree-land and the Lone-Lands). Further questing requires quest packs, however these can be bought using money OR Turbine Points, which can be earned in game and, in fact, many quest packs have the potential to return the investment with just 2/3 characters going through it, which, with many, will be irresistable. Personally I loved Evendim, which is worth roughly £6, or 595 Turbine Points. It kept me hooked for many hours, was fantastic for levelling and returned about 100TP of my investment in just one day. I got it with the Eriador bundle which includes Evendim, North Downs, Forochel, Trollshaws, Angmar, Eregion, Enedwaith and Misty Mountains and costs 3995 TPs (about £30 worth) and gives a huge game world which feels to be at least three times bigger than Skyrim. The combat is standard MMO fare, quickslots and auto-attack, but is fairly well-balanced with improvements planned in the next couple of updates.I only have two major flaws with the game. Firstly, the download time the SECOND time you load it up is ridiculously long for some and only takes a couple of minutes for some. My other flaw is some store items (like the Riding Skill) will slow progress if you want all QPs and Expansion packs using earned in-game points. To get about some of the later, and larger, areas, you will NEED a mount. However, it costs 95TPs to get the riding skill for each character. There are also a few dubious paywalls, or at least they seem that at first, but these are minor. For example, the quild access packs take a while to show much benefit, though later on do give some very good bonuses: making and improving your own legendary item which allows you to not rely on randomised drops and relics. However, every MMO needs consistent income, especially when more expansions and QPs are set to come (Gondor and Mordor all planned for the coming couple of years). The community is also the most helpful I have ever encountered. Overall I would give this a 9/10, the game being a little out of date graphics wise, but in terms of story, gameplay and the world itself, this is perhaps the best MMO I've ever had the pleasure of stumbling across.

												YES ! YES ! YES ! The Lord of the Rings Online.This is my game.To start off,I have hundreds of hours in the game though i have very few on steam because i recently started playing it here.LotRO is a one-of-a-kind game.It's not your common Pay-to-win MMORPG.As a Free-to-play player I can confirm this.In my hundreds of hours in the game not once did i have to pay for something which i can buy with the points i've won by playing the game.The market is amazingly made.There are currently 9 classes (7 available for F2P players and 2 purchasable through the store).The quests vary so you can enjoy the game even if you are playing it solo.There are tons of instances,raids and skirmishes for you to do.The game offers an incredible Co-operative experience and the end-game content is still developing.Pros: - Good class variety        - Racial differences (that sounded racist)        - Always updated endgame content        - Great variety of quests        - Turbine points can be earned without paying        - True to LOTR loreCons: - Grinding turbine points can get boring          - Intros are boring          - Graphics are sub-par  Verdict: 9/10 Outstanding Game Recommendation: Strongly recommended for Role-playing minded players and LOTR fans.

												Been playing this game since the beginning. Over the years I have watched it grow and improve. For the age this game is, The graphics are beautifully put together. All the iconic landmarks are in game up to Helms Deep. Highly enjoyable and addictive as you always want to progress onto the next major landmark. Follows Tolkeins well known storyline but also has side stories that are not mentoned in the book to keep it interesting and less predictable. Can be played both Solo and in group (Fellowship). Plenty of different classes to choose from all with their own unique style of gameplay. Would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Lord Of The Rings.Main Character Name - SephariemRace - ElfClass - HunterLevel - 95Server - VilyaKinship - Shield Of EriadorRank - Leader			"

												Entertaining casual MMORPG. Key features are a very well thought-out F2P system (you can subscribe and get it all, or pay as you go for each bit of content, something possible without spending any money if you're really dedicated), giant world, interesting classes and impressive level of adherence to the LOTR lore. The downside is that, due to the aforementioned adherence to the LOTR lore, a handful of things that make other MMOs fun aren't to be found here as they interfere with the lore. For instance, a large chunk of the world is rather plain looking, easy on the eyes with very little variety (in contrast, to, say, WoW), there are no fancy flying mounts or even fancy regular mounts, just a large variety of horses and some goats, and you can forget about super-duper-kill-all moves with flashy eye candy, because you won't find them in this game. Whether that's good or bad is ultimately up to you, however.The Steam download file size for this is ridiculously big, so I recommend you download it from the official site instead.			"

												Absolutely fantastic considering this game is F2P and has no monthly or bi/tri-monthly subscription fee. This game has kept my amused for hours and has a huge map to explore and tons and tons of content to dive into. This is further enhanced by the links to J.R.R Tolkein's world, making the world feel more like home (Assuming you've read or watched the Lord of the Rings books or films) unlike other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft. The only areas in which this game is let-down is the early level co-op features. I never delved too far into these as I could never see where I could access them. I played with 3 or 4 other friends and we just ended going around and doing the same quests as each other as we never found a way to do raids with each other or do boss fights together etc. 8/10 - Overall, a great game and definitely worth downloading as it's free and offers at least 50 hours of quality gameplay, which can be doubled by purchasing new areas to delve into.

												Turbine have beautifully re-imagined Tolkien's classic.If you're a fan of Middle-Earth and want to immerse yourself in that world, this is the game for you.Despite being F2P it's certainly not P2W; it doesn't punish free players in the way other games do with many opportunities to gain premium currency for additional perks.If you like playing with a group, I would recommend playing with friends as starter areas of the game can feel and often are empty. The player base is  already well established and you won't see a huge deal of life until you progress further into the game. Despite this, there are always advanced players willing to assist new players and plenty of Kinships (guilds/clans) to join with friendly and helpful members.			"

Being able to explore some of the lore of middle earth while the fellowship is away is pretty cool. The Classes are diverse and can take on different roles other then tank, dps, healer. Its fairly easy to get into and the game does well on bringing new players into the game. Each race has there own back story and main story line throught the game making each race fun to learn about. All in all I would recommend this game to any old WOW players or anyone looking for a new online experience. Plus its Free so you cant go wrong.			"

												Better than you'd think.  The graphics are mostly lacking, although they do support DirectX11 features.  It used to work fantastically in Wine, but the new launcher's broken support.  I love playing music in the game; it has some great instruments and player-music support.  Sometimes I login just to entertain people with music.  You can also play .abc files (a midi-like format that you can edit by hand), and even syncronize yourself with several other musicians to get a band of people playing different parts of the same song.  Best music system I've seen in any game, ever (although the actual background music of the game isn't particularly noteworthy (and no, it doesn't have songs from the lotr films))It also has one of the absolute best cosmetic systems of any MMO I've played, although dying isn't quite as in-depth as Guild Wars 2.  Overall, it's not mind-blowing, but it's a fun game to play from time to time.NOTE: I have many more hours than Steam thinks I do; I usually play the game on Linux in Wine, outside of Steam.			"

												I don't know what it is about this game, but for some strange reason I can't stop coming back. The player base tends to be really friendly, and there is no shortage of content. The accuracy of the land to the books description is quite stunning, except for the occasional glossed detail here and there. Between the player housing, the hundreds, if not thousands of quests, and the constantly expanding map, I garuantee you won't get bored easily.			"

												What can I say? I love the Lotr series, and that was the main reason I decided to download this game.At first I was put off by the turbine point system, but when I realised that points could literally be earned, I decided to make it a personal 'goal' as such to complete as much as I could to expand my way through the game. It may feel daunting and like a grind fest but you get a feeling of accomplishment when you earn your way through a game. I've not come across a real issue with pay 2 win gear since there really isn't pay to win gear (especially since if there was you would simply need to earn the points to gain whatever is needed).More about the actual game:Imagine WoW. It plays very similar to that in terms of questing and PvE (Right click and hotkey). You have a few classes and 4 races to choose from, which is relatively extensive. Choose your hair, eyes, nose, lips etc, class and race, each race has certain limitations to classes (as expected) but not as limited as one might think. Once you've chosen those, you can choose where you're from, which each come with certain changes to hair colour (unless you want to change is again). Once you hit level 10 you can do monster play, which as you could imagine, lets you play as one of the monsters from the lotr series, initially you can only choose one to play as, but the turbine system allows you to play as more if you buy them.Work your way through the universe of lotr and see the world in your own perspective!Definitely reccomended to anyone who liked the lotr series. Gameplay: 10/10Character creation: 8/10 could be a little more in depth but a very sound system.Quest system: Pretty good, the usual really, talk to... or kill.... or gather...etc.Lore: Friggin' 11/10. Exceptional since it practically throws you into the mix of the lotr series, witness Gandalf stop Balrog in a dream, and be told that the fate of the free people will rest on your shoulders.Point system:5/10. Only ranked so low since it can feel like a drag, unless you're one of these grind fanatics that absolutely LOVE grinding in games. Completing deeds will reward you with turbine points, but not a vast amount, usually about 5-15 tp each time. An upside is that most deeds can be completed twice but with an added end value (example: slay 30 orcs > deed completed > 5 tp gained and title bestowed > slay 60 orcs > 10 tp added) and considering you get certain deeds each time you enter a new area, like Bree-land to the Shire, your deeds will change to the area specific deeds allowing you to gain more tp.I think I've covered everything, and gone on long enough.GET THIS GAME NOW![/b] "

												I will say there is nothing new or incredibly innovative about this game, but what it does it manages to do well and with a polish that is surprisingly addictive. I would recomend this to people who want to try a new MMO, especially since it is free. As far as the microtransactions go, it is really more of a problem for those who wish to try and max out their character. To the casual player, the annoyances are in having two locked classes and having difficulty with mounts, but both of these can be overcome by using the ingame achievement system to get enough points (for free) to purchase the relevant products. Quest packs (large scale ones that is) are generally too expensive to be worth the time it would take to earn the points to get them however.			"

												Dose the idea of aiding in an epic quest line from behind the scenes grab your interest? Have you wondered what story book hero's do between the there chapters of the tale? If you, like myself, find you are an Emerson Gamer then here is an opportunity get yourself lost in the chapters of a masterpiece. I was turned on to this M.M.O. by my brother as a way to stay connected while he was in the service. Soon after the prelude we found ourselves adventuring to Bree & the inn called ""The Prancing Pony"", Selecting quests from the many faces that populate the land, & Riding horseback through ""The Trollshaws"" toward ""The Mines of Moria"". I found I can even choose how close to the story my 'toon' can live. You will find the many of the more technical points approached in Ammolds von Lichenstein's review which outlines the game  very well, yet not much attention was paid to the aspect of player vs. player. If you feel the need to test your skills in combat against other players you can challenge them to Duel or try your luck in Monster Mode. (I really enjoy Monster Mode) This solves the problem of assassination (P.C. Campers), brutal fights (P.K.ers), or deadly robberies (Trolls). An ideal choice especially if your new to M.M.O.s.			"

												Not too terribly impressed... I'm really not one to talk because I played to level like... 7 I think... Its kinda slow in general, frequently there are not enough respawning quest mobs to go around, also the game tends to shove the idea of buying parts of the game down your throat with the promise of quests, dyes and other little things. It's free, give it a go, just don't have monsterously high expectations.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online is a fantastic game that has fallen into a rut. Two or three expacs ago, the game could count itself among some of the best MMO's for pvp and raiding content. Since the Riders of Rohan release in 2012 in particular however, the endgame content has felt flimsy and uninspired. With the recent release of Helms Deep, the endgame content is virtually nonexistent (""Big Battles"" which feel more like ""Big Cluster F***s""). The lore, however, is ever present and I will continue to play the game due to its fantastic story arcs and beautiful landscapes. For the Tolkien nut, I'd strongly recommend this game. If you're looking for hardcore MMO content, take yourself elsewhere.			"

												I have fond memories of this game from the old days.  It's an MMO that lets you wander about Eriador in Tolkien's Middle-Earth.  You can by a house in The Shire, ride a horse to Rivendell and hang out with Elrond, talk with Goldberry at the Withywindle, put up with Lobelia Sackville-Baggins...and that's what I love about it.  Levelling up, finding and crafting loot, trading and auctioning, grinding, all that's there, and pretty well done.  But the charm of this game is the attention to detail to Tolkien's world without relying on the movies for inspiration.  Unfortunately, since the game went free-to-play, a lot of the cool stuff now has to be purchased separately, even for people like me who already bought the game.			"

The story more or less follows the movies/books and is easy to follow, the community is great and the small details are well thought out. Combat is solid and you can pretty much collect horses. At least that's what I did. The only problem is as you get higher in level the need for expansion packs becomes apparent. Now that I think about it LOTRO is almost like The Elder Scrolls Online. Over all I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG/MMOs and who need a new game addiction.			"

And this is coming from someone who cut her teeth on Ultima Online, and was a founding member of WoW. It's one of the only MMORPGs that really plays up the RP. No one doesn't like RPing a Hobbit Farmer from the Shire that has a lucrative pipeweed crop to sell. And the whole single player aspect of the game holds up so well that you can RP a solo rogue and never talk to another person.Just try it out. It's free and the ftp is actually worth it.			"

													It's a ton of fun, and since it's not tied to the Peter Jackson LOTR, you get to see a different style of Middle Earth. The fact that you get to be any race in Middle Earth, and that they all have unique backstories for your character is pretty cool. The music and atmosphere is great, and the combat mechanic, while fairly unimaginative, works very well. THe community is big and most people are nice, helpful, and have an appreciation for the source material.	That being said, the fact that you have to pay to play for pretty much anything not related to the main story line past level 20 means that you will either have to fork over tons of cash, or just grind for hours and hours.	Overall, I have and will again recommend this game, but with a few warnings.			"

												This game has gone a long way. It might be a bit challenging to properly rate or recommend this game from the many expansions that have come out. This is definitely a game that you have to make the time and enjoy the journey. There isn't really any endgame or benefit in making it all the way to the end. If anything, playing a hobbit through The Shire would be the best experience for any fan of the Tolkien books. Much of the classes and beginning areas won't cost you anything. If you wish to venture a little further, maybe into Moria, you will have to put forth some dollar amount. As enjoyable as the landscape is to look at, the game runs into problems as you progress in the later levels. The system buildup in your character, the area you explore, and how smoothly the combat runs is a detriment. Optimization is lacking and you will run into long load times and sluggish behavior on even the lowest of settings. Some people may feel like the game isn't true to its source. I like to think that I have never felt more immersed.			"

												I love this game, i just love it, i'm not the biggest fan of LOTR around, but this game made me like the series even more, the story and world design is brilliant, but there are a few flaws, yet they don't break the game. The one thing i dislike is the time you have to spend to travel if you don't have a stead... BUT that is acceptable. I did not experience PvP yet, but the PvE is a bit too easy for me. The crafting system is awesome, plus the game does not try to get your money at every occasion, the game can be totally F2P if you want it, but still, you can get a VIP if you like your games less rough. The quests vary from boring ""bring this, kill that"" to epic multi-threaded adventures.This game is not a waste of time, and i rarely got upset by something.I recommend it dearly!			"

												It's pretty good, and technically you CAN play the ENTIRE game + all expansions/quest packs for free - but it requires massive grind. Would recommend if you're willing to drop 20-60 dollars in order to eliminate a majority of the grind.			"

												The Gameplay is good and the graphics have an authentic feel that makes you feel at home after playing for a while, Good class system and battle controls, only problems are weapons, While I feel that buying the usage of weapons with in game money is annoying and slow, it adds a sense of accomplishment when you raise yourself up to a level by beating enemies higher then you, for me it made me feel a deep sense of comaraderie when I played with my small group of friends, each on of this in the same room, shouting at each other for not healing them or not supporting eachother, then when we won we would head to the bannered mare and play some music for other players before logging off.

												The game looks a little dated now but a few tweaks can improve the visuals considerably and make the rather odd default camera work as it should. The game seems partiuclarly easy at the outset but I expect this will improve once I have left the starting areas and entered Middle Earth proper. Although there frequent gentle prods to spend real money on the game no overt paywalls or pay-to-win situations have emerged so far. The game is well produced and interesting enough that it will likely gain some of my cash once I have completed the introductory levels.			"

												Now that City of Heroes is gone, this really is one of the standards for how to handle a free-to-play game. There's a lot of access to be had without spending any money whatsoever and the primary storyline quest is available to you regardless of whethere you spend money or not. There are a few shortfalls. I wish the points were a little less expensive and that some things, like the additional inventory slots weren't quite as expensive as they are, but over all I'd easily recommend this game to anyone looking for a free-to-play fantasy fix.

												If you like LotR and MMOs  you can't go wrong with LotRO.It has a huge world to explore, several different classes, lots and lots of lore and quests, interessting crafting, scaled Dungeon Content, a nice community and what not.Don't expect a fast paced MMO though and don't try to rush the content. It plays pretty slow and it can take a while to level up to level 100+So if you like LotR and MMOs, give it a try, its free.

If I start a new games and I am disappointed, I always patch LotRO and play it again for a few months.  The game is a little dated, compared to the new generation of graphics, but the world is still beautiful.  The storyline is closer to the books than the movies, which I really appreciate.  The player community is awesome.  There is very little trolling, gold-selling, etc.  The player base is extremely helpful.  As long as the servers stay up, I will be playing LotRO.			"

												It feels fantastic to walk in the world of Middle Earth. It's been my dream to fight alongside Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and with Lord of the Rings Online, that dream can come true. With some brilliant graphics, a wide range of characters, and a seemingly endless supply of quests, there's no doubt in LotRO being one of the best MMORPGs out there. It has a fantastic and friendly community, which you can interact with in Kinships, and team up with other players to battle enemies in fellowships.One of the things that I don't really approve of is the fact that you have to buy access to some region quests, which, for someone like me who doesn't really have money to spare, will frankly slow down your levelling to a complete stop, forcing you to end participation in the Epic Quest route. Maybe it could come to that some of the regions become free to play around in, because I'm kinda sick of being stuck at level 44.Overall 8.5/10, some areas need to be improved, but I'm frankly glad this game exists.

													It's a ton of fun, and since it's not tied to the Peter Jackson LOTR, you get to see a different style of Middle Earth. The fact that you get to be any race in Middle Earth, and that they all have unique backstories for your character is pretty cool. The music and atmosphere is great, and the combat mechanic, while fairly unimaginative, works very well. THe community is big and most people are nice, helpful, and have an appreciation for the source material.	That being said, the fact that you have to pay to play for pretty much anything not related to the main story line past level 20 means that you will either have to fork over tons of cash, or just grind for hours and hours.	Overall, I have and will again recommend this game, but with a few warnings.			"

												This game has gone a long way. It might be a bit challenging to properly rate or recommend this game from the many expansions that have come out. This is definitely a game that you have to make the time and enjoy the journey. There isn't really any endgame or benefit in making it all the way to the end. If anything, playing a hobbit through The Shire would be the best experience for any fan of the Tolkien books. Much of the classes and beginning areas won't cost you anything. If you wish to venture a little further, maybe into Moria, you will have to put forth some dollar amount. As enjoyable as the landscape is to look at, the game runs into problems as you progress in the later levels. The system buildup in your character, the area you explore, and how smoothly the combat runs is a detriment. Optimization is lacking and you will run into long load times and sluggish behavior on even the lowest of settings. Some people may feel like the game isn't true to its source. I like to think that I have never felt more immersed.			"

												I speak for those who can't or don't have time to pay for VIP (monthly-sub) and for you frugal troglodytes out there including myself. LOL.So far so good. Two potential concerns.. even VIPs don't get expansions as part of the deal. Buying all the expansions costs around $150. You start off with 45 bag slots which fills up really soon. Maxing out on your bags will cost about $64. You can purchase up to 12 additional +5 bag slots for a total of 60 more slots. 12 x 325 TP each = 3,900 or 4k. If 500 points is $8 then 4k will cost $64.Conclusion? So far, the expansions and bags will cost more than $200. This isn't arguable. I'm just stating facts.Yes, there are ways around piece-meal unlocks.. I heard a lot of people recommend buying a one-month sub. You can do that then buy the expansions on a piece-meal basis. The MMO's really polished. Classes are different but odd different if that makes sense.I wish the ""one-time"" Silver purchase would actually mean something compared to all of the above. So much for a F2P title, eh?			"

												For anyone who likes a good free-to-play game, and Lord of the Rings, will probably like it. Those who love LOTR and have read more than that: don't worry. The game is full of little details hinting towards the backstories, and are usually quite spot on. (Annatar's name is not exactly Annatar due to rights, but hey -better than nothing!) Also, though there is some content you have to buy, you can get ""turbine points"" by doing deeds (use a skill x amount of times), and so buy those contents without actually spending money. (Though some amounts are just huge and will take loads of grinding.)You can play as an Elf, a Hobbit, a Dwarf or as a Man, and they all have different starting points. Community is nice and friendly...most of the time. Yeah. Beautiful sceneries. Many events. Such fun.			"

												I played this game for a while and while i like the story i think the combat could be improved on a little. The third person combat feels like it is copied from KOTOR. I would prefer it if it took the combat from laura croft and put it into this game. Because the combat is the worst part of this game. The combat makes up a large portion of the game but in the end it just feels like wizard101 and KOTOR had a baby. Seriously there needs to be a way better combat system for a game that dares bares the title Lord of the rings. I think that this game is good and I would recommend it but it really needs to have a more improved combat system. So if I were you I would buy it unless you obsess over one detail like I do.			"

												Very immersive game world that is filled with many points of interest for fans of Tolkien's lore, with the best community in any MMO i've played. Very fair F2P model with the riding skill being the only really necessary thing to unlock, plus there are several easy ways to earn Turbine Points (the game's store currency), through questing and deeds (acheivements). Graphics are slightly above the level of WoW and some older MMO's with some good water effects, and nice area design. But not at the level of most modern games like Tera, Rift or SW:The Old Republic. Best played with friends like most multiplayer focused games, however there are many friendly Kin groups (guilds) to join if you are looking for others to game with.Very Highly Recommended.			"

												Der Herr der Ringe Online ist ein sehr episches Abenteuer RPG welches die komplette Geschichte zum Geschehen des Ringes erzählt streng nach Buchvorlage und aber auch viele Zusätze bietet.Das komplette Spiel ist Free to Play bietet zwar die möglichkeit mit einem ingame shop viel freizuschalten was jeder mit ein wenig fleiss  aber durch das sogenannte BdT - Buch der Taten nach und nach freischalten kann. Es lohnt sich aber trotzdem wenigstens einmal ca 10 euro zu investieren um VIP zu aktivieren einmal aktiviert behälst du sämtliche freischaltungen für immer und all deine Charaktere . Kenne Spieler die das  gesamte spiel kostenlos freigeschalten haben nur mit der Bewätigung vom BdT , dadurch bekommst du shoppunkte ...z.b. erkundung oder das besiegen einer gewissen anzahl von einer bestimmten art  Gegner. Dies ist ein sehr erwachsenes MMO was stetig gewartet und erweitert wird . Spielspass garantiert!! Gerne würde ich noch ellen lange Texte schreiben die mein Spielerlebniss und das Spiel selbst noch besser darstellen aber spielt selbst !!! Epische Schlachtzüge mit 12 -  24 spielern !! Auch kleine Instanzen mit 6 oder 3 Gefährten sind sehr fordend!Gerne hefe ich auch Neukömmlingen!! Also wer Interresse hat ^^    Ich selbst habe schon über 3000 Spielstunden LotRO !! P.S.LotRO bietet auch PvM player vs Monster bedeutet entweder du spielst mit deinem selbst erstellten Helden oder du erstellst dir dein Monster (ork , Warg , Spinne etc ) und stellst dich auf die seite Sarumans!

												I played this game for a while and while i like the story i think the combat could be improved on a little. The third person combat feels like it is copied from KOTOR. I would prefer it if it took the combat from laura croft and put it into this game. Because the combat is the worst part of this game. The combat makes up a large portion of the game but in the end it just feels like wizard101 and KOTOR had a baby. Seriously there needs to be a way better combat system for a game that dares bares the title Lord of the rings. I think that this game is good and I would recommend it but it really needs to have a more improved combat system. So if I were you I would buy it unless you obsess over one detail like I do.			"

												One of the few MMOs I fell in love with and played for an extended period of time.  The story of this game is really great and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Running around a Middle Earth is something I have always wanted to do in a game and this is one of the first games that let you do that extensively.As far as game mechanics go, it is pretty standard in terms of combat and in general MMO functionality, but that did not matter because it just seemed to work.One of my favorite features was the ability to play instruments and convert midi files to have concerts in Bree.  Man, I kind of miss those days!			"

												It's a standard MMORPG, made better if you're a fan of the lore however don't expect to be able to play totally free, for free players you can reach level 50, but questing areas stop being free at level 30, you have to pay to unlock those areas. There is even a cap on your gold that you need to pay to take off, getting a mount is achievable in-game but you must first pay to unlock the riding skill. I recommend this game for a ""trial"", and if you like it, sub to it, staying free will actually cost you more in the long run.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online is actually a fairly good MMO. It offers a beautiful world set in Tolkien's fantastic Middle Earth. Though not always correct in terms of lore, LOTRO still offers a great, basic MMO. The design and gameplay are good, music is nice too, but unfortunately it quickly becomes a little boring, and though the game is set to be Free-to-Play, it is much more like Pay-to-Win once you reach a certain level. Still though - if you enjoy ME, you can have a great weekend stroling through the Shire, the Blue Mountains or Bree, but do not expect to be able to past Rivendell. That is basically endgame without paying anything in-game. I would have loved to visit Moria!			"

												Entirely fun though with an outdated mmo style reminiscant of early WoW, the game works as a decent retelling of Tolkien's Universe without too much of jackson's influence, a lot of fun to play with a group but longevity wise you may get sick of fetch quests and slaying the same enemies over and over. A solid 7/10 MMO, which is quite immersive (though the severe lack of anybody really trying to rp servers is a little disheartening) pick it up if you love Tolkien's books and for extra enjoyment if you know the lore quite well.

There have been a couple of people i noticed that didnt like the HD update (Helms Deep) becouse it basically makes your choose if you want to do DPS AOE or Heals...well this is a good thing in a way becouse once you decide what you want to do (DPS AOE or Heals) then your can focus on ramping that skill up a lot...some people prob dont think the same but i just want to say that the update made it easier (especialy for new peeps)			"

												This game is pretty much the best mmorpg out there so far its hard to do the negative stuff but here I go:the game wont alow u to change gender for the dwarfs,in monster play you cant switch weapons or change what you are wearing,and in monsterplay id like more customization,plus the abbility to play as a nazgul would be nice since apparently there are more than nine of them, and finaly there are more free peoples that you should be able to play than what there is.Now the pros:lots of customization in free peoples,endless fun and quests,lots of adventures,and plenty of people play this game to where youll never be alone,you cant have nothing on you even if u take off what you have on so this game is very modest,leveling up is really fun,and lastly theres all of middle earth to explore for the first time(not counting the lego lord of the rings video game).If running around fighting and killing is your favorite,or seteling down and having a nice home sounds more like your cup of tea then give this game a try.All in all this game has become very important to me and I recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to try out.What I like about it is the fact that you can team up to do things.have fun exploring middle earth (5,000 stars)!By the way im pipon the leader of a kinship named the finders.

												I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys mmorpg's, I'm not a big fan of many of them myself, I did enjoy lotro for its unique perspective on the tolkien universe however, it has an art style that in my opinion makes up for the sometimes dull graphics. It also has one of the largest, if not the largest open world map that keeps expanding as new updates come out. Now, I only got up to level 20 in this game, because its at that point that grinding becomes more and more necessary to get to a high enough level to clear dungeons, unless you have a party, which I did not. I look fondly on the days that I played this game, adventuring all over the bree lands, going on a stroll through the shire, wandering the woods and mountainous terrain of ered luin, if nothing else its at least worth a try.

												Fairly standard F2P MMO game, there's nothing special here and also nothing really wrong with it.Played it for a few weeks with my partner and we had some fun with it.If you want to progress it can sometimes be worth purchasing with real money but in general you can get fairly far without putting in any cash.We never made it to the end-game content before we got bored though, So I can't speak for that.Overall, decent MMO and gives you a few weeks -- a month of enjoyment for little cash.

												Taking place during the events of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you take the role as a <Man/Dwarf/Hobbit/Elf/(Beorning, though that ain't for F2Ps)> <Insert Class Here>  who isn't nearly as heroic as Frodo or Aragorn, despite the fact that you kill more bad dudes than either put together. Then again, I suppose ""Dankbooms Fartwillow"" isn't exactly the name bards will write too many ballads after.Lord of the Rings Online is a MMORPG made by Turbine, developers of Dungeons and Dragons Online and... well, actually, that's it. While you may have some sort of stigma against companies that only work off of liscensed material, know that Turbine really did a damn good job at creating a lore-friendly Middle Earth. Sure, some aspects are a little skewed, but what kind of RPG would you have without some sort of mages? C'mon, let's be honest.Jump in as one of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth... or join the war as an Orc in Monster Play! Finally, you can kill all the hobbitses you want! Interestingly, LOTRO's ""health"" system is rather unique in theme (not exactly mechanically, though) as your ""health points"" are called ""Morale"". As such, healing abilities are less like ""Cure Light Wounds"" and more along the line of ""Bolster Courage"". So, yeah, Minstrels are the go-to healing class. And being in scenarios where you feel ""Dread"" end up lowering your max health and stats, while areas of ""Hope"" (usually when you're nearby hallmark characters like Gandalf or Elrond) will give you increased health and damage capabilities.Overall, not a bad online game. The playerbase is also slightly more mature than most other online games, as you'll find more diehard LOTR fans than ""gamers"" playing the game.			"

One can hardly fault these good people for needing to make microtransactionas and pay-to-play content in the mid->high ranges of the game. After all, we get to feast on their beautifully wrought landscapes and intricate quests, they should be able to eat too! Of particular good quality is the Shire. If nothing else, it's worth a download and free play just to experience the love that went into making their version of the Shire. Truly enchanting. 9/10.			"

												well this is an amazing game everything i want in an MMORPG people say since its f2p its become a p2w but thats very wrong if you pay money for things the game is way easier but other than that the game is playable and i dont ever find it too difficult its not a game where to get past certain quests you must buy extra things just about every quest is beatable if you are a close enough level. The skirmishes and instances are amazing and i would also reccomend joining a kinship to make great friends. join fellowships if needed to complete difficult tasks and just for a bit of added fun. so yeah very good game i enjoy playing it but i love lord of the rings thats mainly the reason, you cant get better than this, its truly an amazing game, very beautiful graphics everything looks good from characters to landscapes. The community is very nice and helpful to anyone from new to experienced players so if you every have any questions dont be afraid to ask. This is like every other fantasy mmorpg but at the same time its very unique in its own way			"

												A decent MMO for wasting time, classes are built more towards small party and soloing and the quests are pretty faithful to 'at least you tried' tiers to keeping with the books.  No clue about the expansions as a few of them look like they just put fan favorite characters where they wanted them.  However the worst part of this game is the same problem that Dungeons and Dragons Online has where many esential dungeons or grind spots are locked right from the start which is terrible and forces loads more grinding than someone witha  money pass.  And yet these areas are few and far between making only a few areas into massive grind fests.  The absolute worst thing however is the Hobbit's starting area, the music hills and enemies get old quick.  Other than that have fun playing one of the best WoW clones out there.			"

												This is surely the most beautiful and in every way perfect MMORPG. Playing this won't be boring even after thousands of hours played. Of course there are awesome quests, but also very nice crafting system, instances, housing and others. The most powerful attribute of this game is definitely world of beautiful environments, places you may know from movies and books, but also large amount of new places, places that will make♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself of their darkness. It's awesome game indeed, but still there is one bad thing - the higher your level is, the more awesome the game is, so there are some little boring parts in the introduction, especially if you play as a hobbit. Thankgod this part is short and it's followed by thrilling story and side quests, hobbies and stuff, like you've never seen. Maybe it can get boring again if you'll be low leveled and you'll need to level up with no quests left, but quest packs and expansions can fix it, and they are not expensive at all, you can even buy them for game cash, not real money. Well, this game is my first love, i recommend it to all of you!			"

												Been playing this game since the beginning. Over the years I have watched it grow and improve. For the age this game is, The graphics are beautifully put together. All the iconic landmarks are in game up to Helms Deep. Highly enjoyable and addictive as you always want to progress onto the next major landmark. Follows Tolkeins well known storyline but also has side stories that are not mentoned in the book to keep it interesting and less predictable. Can be played both Solo and in group (Fellowship). Plenty of different classes to choose from all with their own unique style of gameplay. Would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Lord Of The Rings.Main Character Name - SephariemRace - ElfClass - HunterLevel - 95Server - VilyaKinship - Shield Of EriadorRank - Leader			"

												I will say there is nothing new or incredibly innovative about this game, but what it does it manages to do well and with a polish that is surprisingly addictive. I would recomend this to people who want to try a new MMO, especially since it is free. As far as the microtransactions go, it is really more of a problem for those who wish to try and max out their character. To the casual player, the annoyances are in having two locked classes and having difficulty with mounts, but both of these can be overcome by using the ingame achievement system to get enough points (for free) to purchase the relevant products. Quest packs (large scale ones that is) are generally too expensive to be worth the time it would take to earn the points to get them however.			"

												non è un vero free to play. specifichiamo. è un bel gioco, per carità, ma purtroppo le QUEST sono bloccate. attenzione, qui non si parla di cose bonus (oggetti, borse, ecc) ma delle quest vere e proprie. le uniche sbloccate sono quelle legate alla storia, di conseguenza se si vuole avanzare senza pagare bisognerà passare tutto il tempo a farmare come dei matti, perdendo anche gli oggetti ottenibili unicamente con determinate missioni. a me piace, a voi la scelta.

												Lord of the Rings Online has a lot of potential, the only issue is It's community. I played for a while and seeing one other player excited me and made me start a conversation with them. The map is a huge disappointment, so expect to get lost a lot. Overall I can't say anymore about the game besides it's very well polished and has a lot of skills and attributes to obtain. It's a fun game, just wouldn't recommend it If you're going to play by yourself.			"

												The Lord of the Rings Online is actually a fairly good MMO. It offers a beautiful world set in Tolkien's fantastic Middle Earth. Though not always correct in terms of lore, LOTRO still offers a great, basic MMO. The design and gameplay are good, music is nice too, but unfortunately it quickly becomes a little boring, and though the game is set to be Free-to-Play, it is much more like Pay-to-Win once you reach a certain level. Still though - if you enjoy ME, you can have a great weekend stroling through the Shire, the Blue Mountains or Bree, but do not expect to be able to past Rivendell. That is basically endgame without paying anything in-game. I would have loved to visit Moria!			"

There is a membership you can pay for, but it's completly optinal. You can get to the Level limit without paying a thing!			"

												Played this for 2 years, the in game store will burn your wallet to bits if you let it, but most stuff in this game can be unlocked with hard work and good fun. I would recommend this game to anyone any age, though i think its 13+. Don't remember the exact COC lol. There are bugs as is with any free to play, i have screenshots in many areas that you ""aren't supposed to be in"". So full exploration, 1000's of quests. Lots of story that you don't get if you are a movie lover and haven't read the book series. Either way, it's fun. My time on Withywindle has been amazing, I lead the Stoned Trolls kin and know alot of people on that server, it is recommended as well. If you ask me overall, i give it a 9/10 if you can stand the grind and don't mind it like i do, 10/10. :) Good luck, and may you quest valiantly.			"

												I've played this game since it's release in 2007 and it's easily the most fun I've ever had in any video game, mmo or not. The community is overwhelmingly kind and helpful. Although it doesn't have as many players as say Wow, the quality of the players easily makes up for it. The game itself is beautiful, and the if you're a tolkien fan then you'll love the lore within it as well. From questing, to raiding, to the yule festival this game is never boring. Maybe you want to go fishing or just talk in kin chat, that's fine too. It is a very fun, and wonderful game. I'll recommend this game until the day it shuts down (which is hopefully not any time soon)			"

												This was the game that got me into the RPG genre. As a player from 2012, I am just begining to like this game a lot more now that I have a character over level 20. Lots of building, equipment, and questing, LotRO offers a unique MMORPG experience. Even at low levels, you can participate in team or solo missions called Skirmishes. These offer even more gameplay aspects. Money is optional for boosts and cosmetics, and I have only spent $14 to get the Beorning class. Get this game now!			"

												I find this to be one of the best MMORPGs I've ever played. The game is based off the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and takes place in Middle-Earth, making it one of the largest MMOs made. The game's pretty generous when it comes to free-to-play content, I've been playing it for free for two years now until I spent some of my extra Steam funds on this game. The game has a lot of free content for players leveled 1-30, and quest packs (which are purchased through in-game funds that can be bought with real money or earned through in-game ""achievements"") can help you progress even further. Unlike most MMOs, I feel fully immersed when I play this game, the artwork is very beautiful, it's better to take your time playing this game instead of rushing through the game to get to the level cap (100). I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who's a fan of LOTRO, MMOs, or both.EDIT: Changed the level cap from ""95"" to ""100"" due to an update			"

												Well, after many hours played I think it was time to analyze so here we go.The good:Turbine Points and Deeds; few massively multiplayer games are as quick and easy to get virtual money system and this is one of them, has an achievement system in which various the reward but almost always has to 5,10,15 or 20 points you can use to improve your or your characters. (Update: they make a bit more harder to farm sadly TPs)PvMP; There are two ways to enter this mode and is paying the first or second play as an orc, the community there sometimes you get surprised of how close that is unlike PvE community.Crafting; the system is so good in this aspect that sometimes you forget to fight, you can choose different types of crafting ranging from lumberjack to cook.Festivals; nothing better than chasing chickens, go to a haunted house or to race.The bad:Small populations; many servers sometimes seem ghost towns so this is a big problem and the only thing left is to review the forums to see which is your best choice.Dungeons; has only few free and it becomes very... very boring them often and if you buy a map with more dungeons you may not find a lot to play with.Leveling; is one of the games in the one you it takes a LOT to level up that I played, it becomes tedious so if you are someone who is easily bored is not recommended.Conclusion:If you have spare time and have some friends to play this game is highly recommended, it has some problems like any massive multiplier but rewarded with unique gameplay.Highly recommended.

												Lord of The Rings Online is a fantastic MMO for world emersion and roleplaying opportunities for anyone who is well versed in Tolkien lore. However, if you are a casual fan of the Lord of The Rings series or perhaps enjoy playing games to make up your own world, then stay away. Let me be clear that the people who play this game are no worse than any other group online. They just have one, very hard to ignore, flaw.The thing is that there is a much larger push to understand and adhere to lore outside the game than I have seen anywhere else online. This means that if you're not already a master of Tolkien lore you can expect either: A: Hours of research or B: To be confused by the majority of roleplay interactions and treated as an inferior player. I know, as I fall into this category.This does not mean the community itself is flawed. On the contrary, they mostly ignore anyone who does not directly approach them. It's worth noting that I played on a roleplay server, so it's likely not as bad on other servers.Lord of The Rings may not be the right game for you, but if you have a moderate knowledge of the Tolkien universe then I suggest you download it and give it a try. The game itself isn't half bad. Even with all the community issues, I still plan to play. (It's worth noting that when I began playing this game, it was not through Steam, but rather from the game webpage, so I havent had much experiance with the Steam version)			"

												This is honestly the best game I've ever played and I never get tired of it. I've actually played thousands of hours not reflected in my Steam account, because I used to play LOTRO downloaded from Turbine's website until I switched to Steam (I started playing LOTRO around mid-2009 and switched to Steam last year at around level 60)I'll just do a quick pros and cons list before I go into detail:Pros: -Huge open world sandbox, literally endless things to do-Great epic storyline quests to follow-Quite literally thousands of side quests-Slayer and explorer deeds to complete on the side-Reputation factions give some decent rewards-The world itself is massive, great for people who love to wander around exploring-Even for non-LOTR nerds this is a fantastic and immersive MMO experience-Community is helpful and respectful for the most part-Great cosmetic and crafting system-Free to playCons:-Housing system is eeehh. You have to keep paying upkeep for a house that really isn't that impressive (I have a deluxe house and it's still not that great, regular houses are just...no), and your decorations are locked into ""hotspots"".-Character models look very sad. Way outdated graphics.-Some quests are great (mostly the epic ones) and have interesting things going on. Most are your classic ""Kill # of (monster) or gather # of (item) because I can't because (reason)"". Can get VERY grindy. -Other quests have very vague objectives and are hard to figure out. -This was in the pros, but the world is massive. It's also in the cons because if you don't have some porting skills, you can face some loooong long horse rides to places. Oh, and if you're not a subscriber you have to buy the riding skill.-Some solo quests that *say* they're for your level, have turned out to be impossible for that level. I've had to return to some quests 4 levels later to complete them. Speaking of that...-PvMP can be really tough and it's definitely not well-balanced.-The Free to Play truly only lasts until you hit about level 35 and need to move on from the Lone-Lands and into either the North Downs or Trollshaws (both buyable individually)My favorite part about this game? It's the freedom and amount of things you can do. I'm level 70 and I still return to very low-level areas just to do random side quests or even just explore.The world is so vast, dynamic, and various that I always find new places to enjoy the scenery or do some solo or group role-playing.The music is epic and beautiful, though the constant combat music starting and restarting every time you fight something can get annoying and I do wish there was a way to turn it off.This game is more of a sandbox than anything I've ever played, even Skyrim. The amount of things to do is just ENDLESS. You can do side quests, build your reputation with different factions, complete slaying and exploring deeds, do the epic storyline quests, work on your personal vocation skills, you can do all of that and more in each and every area of the game.  If you love the freedom of doing your own thing whenever you want with little restrictions, this is the perfect game for you. If you have a free spirit and a heart for adventure, this is the perfect game for you. You build your own story, character, and legacy in this game.As far as subscribing goes, I usually will individually buy each expansion pack and have seen no need to subscribe. By subscribing I would probably save myself more money in the end, however, by not subscribing I can wait as long as I want before buying a new quest pack or area. Pretty much everything the VIPs get is available for purchase, so that's awesome.One of my favorite aspects of the game, though, is the seasonal and community events. They have fall, winter, spring, and summer festivals each with their own unique themes, activities, and locations. There are other events like Hobnanigans and other socially-organized events like Weatherstock (player music concert atop Weathertop). It's not without its flaws, though. The graphics, especially for characters, are very outdated looking and sometimes they take away from my immersive experience. And for the hardcore Tolkien followers, though it does follow the book, obviously a lot of side characters and other things are completely made up for the sake of the game.TL;DR Classic MMO with endless things to do, perfect for the LOTR nerd.

												Very fun and addictive, I love how they have a system where you can pay to enhance your account with real money, or earn points through playing the game and enhance it that way. The community is also very nice. Most people are willing to help you out and enhance your experience, though there are still a few bad apples. Kinda wish the game would explain some of its mechanics better, though. Some people get to really high levels without learning they have a secondary subclass and useable race traits.			"

												I've started lotro several years ago and still pop in every now and then.If You expect some HD graphics as in Battlefield, You'll be disappointed - Same goes for amazing animations and effects.But If You love middle earth and mmorpgs - this one's for You!As lotro is merging worlds right now and simultaniously updating their hardware, it is to expect that the game will run with less performance hits and less laggy than before.There are many things YOu might complain about if You're picky enough, but what I think makes up for a lot is this:lotro is definitely not f2p-p2w!All f2p players can achive turbine points (the ""premium-currency"") ingame via various achievements. So basically You don't have to spend a single penny to get 100% of the content - even though it IS a lot of work.			"

												I actually have a rough 800 hours in this game, It's very free to play up to level 20 I believe, after that it is wise to buy quest packs and or expansions to further increase a better experience within the game, or you may grind your levels tediously. This game wether people like or dislike it in my opinion is fun, And it's more fun with friends. It'll get boring by yourself and that's the truth. On a scale from one to ten I give this game a solid 7/10 -Fell 2015 "

												I've actually been playing this game since the game came out.  I got bored and removed the game then re-installed via Steam and thus the short hours played.It's a fun game really, but it gets really dull after a while.  The game and I didn't click.When I started playing the game I could do anyting like Monster play etc.  Now I am locked out of those characters.  The game just isn't as fun as it was, but that could just be me so I still recommend it.			"

												Fairly standard F2P MMO game, there's nothing special here and also nothing really wrong with it.Played it for a few weeks with my partner and we had some fun with it.If you want to progress it can sometimes be worth purchasing with real money but in general you can get fairly far without putting in any cash.We never made it to the end-game content before we got bored though, So I can't speak for that.Overall, decent MMO and gives you a few weeks -- a month of enjoyment for little cash.

												Well, after many hours played I think it was time to analyze so here we go.The good:Turbine Points and Deeds; few massively multiplayer games are as quick and easy to get virtual money system and this is one of them, has an achievement system in which various the reward but almost always has to 5,10,15 or 20 points you can use to improve your or your characters. (Update: they make a bit more harder to farm sadly TPs)PvMP; There are two ways to enter this mode and is paying the first or second play as an orc, the community there sometimes you get surprised of how close that is unlike PvE community.Crafting; the system is so good in this aspect that sometimes you forget to fight, you can choose different types of crafting ranging from lumberjack to cook.Festivals; nothing better than chasing chickens, go to a haunted house or to race.The bad:Small populations; many servers sometimes seem ghost towns so this is a big problem and the only thing left is to review the forums to see which is your best choice.Dungeons; has only few free and it becomes very... very boring them often and if you buy a map with more dungeons you may not find a lot to play with.Leveling; is one of the games in the one you it takes a LOT to level up that I played, it becomes tedious so if you are someone who is easily bored is not recommended.Conclusion:If you have spare time and have some friends to play this game is highly recommended, it has some problems like any massive multiplier but rewarded with unique gameplay.Highly recommended.

												An extremely long game. While you can still play in free to play mode it involves countless hours of grinding an area or doing quest where you might have outlevel the enemies. The grind gives you points that make quests, expansion and instances available. The true version of the game lies in the VIP mode where you pay a subscription it gives you access to all the quest while you still have to grind areas to get expansions the grind is significantly reduced. The story is engaging but more could have been done to diversify it and make it more engaging. You can forget doing low level instances if you are not part of a kin but even if you play alone and lvl up you will quickly find players in the same position as you trying instances. The weapons and crafting system lets you trade anything with players at any given time and is extermely helpful. You don't have to be a lotr fan to be able to enjoy the game.			"

												I'm not really a big fan of Lord of the Rings or MMO's but this game is proberly the best MMO I've ever played, just in front of Star Wars The Old Republic. There's just something about the game that is fun and interesting. And the world is big and you don't have to wait in loading screens to explore it (unless it is in a room or building). Because in DC Universe Online you have to load a lot of worlds. This is different. And easy to get lost so don't be to adventurous like me. :P			"

I only just recently added it to my steam though so don't let my hours fool you I have about 70 hours in game I think. Gorgeous rendition of Middle earth, engaging quest lines and awesome people.

												Got the game, loved it at first playing as an elf hunter kiling those cave crawlers and evil dwarfs. Stopped playing  shortly after since i was a massive noob at MMORPGS. Come back decide to become premium and purchase stuff, start actually getting into it, realise it was one of the best MMORPGS i've ever played. Shooting down goblins from afar and being able to down several foes in melee aswell while getting some sweet loot for your character. The leveling takes time compared to other games like WoW which is why i like this better. In-game deed log and turbine points awarded for completing them makes the game so much more worth playing. You want that riding at level 2 for 95 tp? Why not do some deeds and have it by level 10. What makes this game so good is that you can either play it normally and earn tp to buy stuff through the store or you can spend a little bit of money to enhance your character/characters while leveling or w/e you're doing. It's not really a pay to win game seeing as it's not like those other ones where you pay and  it's pretty much a pvp game. This is more questing, leveling and lore until max level. Once at max level you then can choose to go into the pvp zone or go into monster play. In the end it's totally worth getting if you're the kind of person who likes to spend time on a game hours on end grinding stuff and hacking n slashing those foes down until you can get into the next zone of leveling. De a 10/10 for me.			"

												I hate MMORPGs and I love LOTRO. Big reasons why:1. I care about the world. There's the Shire to explore, including Buckland and the Old Woods, there's Bree and its surroundings, and it all feels familiar and real. That's something you can't get with Everquest, because who cares about any of those cities or regions and whether they get destroyed by some lich king? LOTRO has a world I've wanted to explore for years, before there was such a thing as an MMORPG. No other online game can give me that.2. No pkilling. LOTRO seems to sense on some level that the people in their community aren't looking for the same experience as the Warcraft people. Interaction with other players is entirely cooperative and voluntary. For PVP competitions, there's a place called the Ettenmoors, but in actual practice, not many players use the Ettenmoors. If they want to kill other players and teabag the corpses, they'd be playing WOW. And even the social interaction is decent. At least it was for me. I was playing on Withywindle, which was a European server with a lot of UK users.3. Free to play was too good to resist. And once I'd immersed myself in the game, I had no trouble throwing some dollars at Turbine for some perks. They deserve a lot more than I've spent, really. A free user will be limited to the lower level lands, which include the Shire, Bree, Ered Luin (which I didn't know much about, but has lively dwarf and elf populations), and the Lone-Lands, where you can visit Weathertop. That's PLENTY for a free user to do. Especially the Shire, which is worth spending hours in just for the atmosphere.Anyway, even though the game interface is a little antiquated by 2015 standards, LOTRO is still amazing and it's the only MMORPG I will ever play. I'd recommend it to people who avoid MMORPGs but love Tolkien.			"

												I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys mmorpg's, I'm not a big fan of many of them myself, I did enjoy lotro for its unique perspective on the tolkien universe however, it has an art style that in my opinion makes up for the sometimes dull graphics. It also has one of the largest, if not the largest open world map that keeps expanding as new updates come out. Now, I only got up to level 20 in this game, because its at that point that grinding becomes more and more necessary to get to a high enough level to clear dungeons, unless you have a party, which I did not. I look fondly on the days that I played this game, adventuring all over the bree lands, going on a stroll through the shire, wandering the woods and mountainous terrain of ered luin, if nothing else its at least worth a try.

												I love this game! I always will love this game. Say what you will about the dated character models and missteps that Turbine has taken over the years (and they have made many).. yet good people keep trying and the community is great. The power of Modor will not stand against the free peoples of Middle Earth!!! (MOL sticks really close to the books so I'm pretty sure thats the way its going to end) "

												As a big fan of MMORPG games, I would say this is one of the best storrylines, since it ties with one of the world's most favored franchise, The Lord of The Rings. The developers really put much work and a big world for a free MMORPG. And the expansions are pretty interesting as well. I would reccomend this game to people who are familiar with the MMORPG Genre, or people who would like to go tie in to the Lord of the rings storyline.			"

												My 1st mmo and it started out fantastic. Good gameplay and a massive, really lore rich world with tons of things to do and explore. I am a lifetime membership owner and have played the game on and off for over 5 years. Once the servers went to the USA that was when the bad lag really started and through all the latest updates they have not really addressed the problem. There is hope though as they are creating new pvp maps and new servers in the EU (Amsterdam I think) So hopefully good things to look forward to			"

												I've played this game since it's release in 2007 and it's easily the most fun I've ever had in any video game, mmo or not. The community is overwhelmingly kind and helpful. Although it doesn't have as many players as say Wow, the quality of the players easily makes up for it. The game itself is beautiful, and the if you're a tolkien fan then you'll love the lore within it as well. From questing, to raiding, to the yule festival this game is never boring. Maybe you want to go fishing or just talk in kin chat, that's fine too. It is a very fun, and wonderful game. I'll recommend this game until the day it shuts down (which is hopefully not any time soon)			"

												I hate MMORPGs and I love LOTRO. Big reasons why:1. I care about the world. There's the Shire to explore, including Buckland and the Old Woods, there's Bree and its surroundings, and it all feels familiar and real. That's something you can't get with Everquest, because who cares about any of those cities or regions and whether they get destroyed by some lich king? LOTRO has a world I've wanted to explore for years, before there was such a thing as an MMORPG. No other online game can give me that.2. No pkilling. LOTRO seems to sense on some level that the people in their community aren't looking for the same experience as the Warcraft people. Interaction with other players is entirely cooperative and voluntary. For PVP competitions, there's a place called the Ettenmoors, but in actual practice, not many players use the Ettenmoors. If they want to kill other players and teabag the corpses, they'd be playing WOW. And even the social interaction is decent. At least it was for me. I was playing on Withywindle, which was a European server with a lot of UK users.3. Free to play was too good to resist. And once I'd immersed myself in the game, I had no trouble throwing some dollars at Turbine for some perks. They deserve a lot more than I've spent, really. A free user will be limited to the lower level lands, which include the Shire, Bree, Ered Luin (which I didn't know much about, but has lively dwarf and elf populations), and the Lone-Lands, where you can visit Weathertop. That's PLENTY for a free user to do. Especially the Shire, which is worth spending hours in just for the atmosphere.Anyway, even though the game interface is a little antiquated by 2015 standards, LOTRO is still amazing and it's the only MMORPG I will ever play. I'd recommend it to people who avoid MMORPGs but love Tolkien.			"

												An extremely long game. While you can still play in free to play mode it involves countless hours of grinding an area or doing quest where you might have outlevel the enemies. The grind gives you points that make quests, expansion and instances available. The true version of the game lies in the VIP mode where you pay a subscription it gives you access to all the quest while you still have to grind areas to get expansions the grind is significantly reduced. The story is engaging but more could have been done to diversify it and make it more engaging. You can forget doing low level instances if you are not part of a kin but even if you play alone and lvl up you will quickly find players in the same position as you trying instances. The weapons and crafting system lets you trade anything with players at any given time and is extermely helpful. You don't have to be a lotr fan to be able to enjoy the game.			"

												Now that City of Heroes is gone, this really is one of the standards for how to handle a free-to-play game. There's a lot of access to be had without spending any money whatsoever and the primary storyline quest is available to you regardless of whethere you spend money or not. There are a few shortfalls. I wish the points were a little less expensive and that some things, like the additional inventory slots weren't quite as expensive as they are, but over all I'd easily recommend this game to anyone looking for a free-to-play fantasy fix.

												Hey it's an MMO. I haven't really played much of it because it is very very dated. I'm not one to dismiss a game because of graphics, but this stuff looks wonky. In any case, if you like MMOs this is one of the best and longest running out there. The people who play this game are practically obsessed with it so there's obviously something good here.			"

												Best F2P MMORPG in the market right now if your love standard MMORPG style like WoW but with better graphic and tons of story and quest to read also it's free to play to the end game without spend any real money (Really you can do it in this game) just give it a try :D			"

												Lord of the Rings fan? Like to play MMO's? This game is the best to play with.  Sure it's not as vivid or lively as other well known titles but  depth wise it's very good.It's more associated to the novels than to the Peter Jackson films but either way it's a good game for any LOTR fan.Like I said it's not very lively you wont find hundreds or players swarming the cities but I have passed good time just going at my own pace and exploring middle earth.The crafting / vocations system is also very good.  Coming from WoW i got tired of the simple, easy to grind professions systems that I could max out in a couple hours to have no use at all in the end game.  The crafting system in Lotro offers multiple out put recipes and with its chance for pieces to crit and become improved to highest level quality makes you wants to craft your heart out.			"

												Some other reviews have blatant misinformation in regards to what is and isn't free, and what the model is. You play the game, you unlock achievements such as explore X zone, 10 turbine points(the cash shop currency) By the time I hit level 20 on one character I had enough to buy the next quest pack. The achievements to earn turbine points are many, finish all quests, kill x of each monster, it was fun, added extra goals and exploration to each zone and I thoroughly enjoyed it.If you like me, made a second character and leveled it 20(which requires no $$) you'd have a good chunk of turbine points to spend on the rest of the game. You do not have to pay to play, unless you are super lazy and do only the bare minimum quests to level. The game is dated, and looks dated, but I think it still has a charming feel to it, and I certainly did feel like I was a part of middle earth. I value quality of content over aesthetics, and this game delivers. Housing, quests, epic questlines, legendary items, mounts, tons of stuff involved. The only reason I am no longer playing is that I just do not have the time to devote to three different MMO's.			"

												Lord of the Rings Online is an outstanding alternative to World of Warcraft, RIFT etc. I have had a lot of fun playing this game and enjoyed the mass variation and friendly atmosphere that this game posesses both with the community, and the NPC interactions. I would recommend this game to any and all MMORPG players any day of the week. 8/10 for me.			"

												Well, Bout F**kin time; That being said, as a level 60 Elf Champion (those were jokes by time I left) This game is an Epic LOTR Fan's wet dream, that being said, I quit when the D&D Female F2P Producer took over LOTR and added D&D narrated Dungeons to this game, Im not sure how it plays now, But no offense to the women of my friends, I quit when ""she"" ruined dungeons of this game, It's still beautiful, and graphically one of the best mmo's I've ever played. So please check it out for it's F2P function, which last I played was 20 levels of free to play area (though you could grind to 30)With over 6 classes to choose from, There is an element of playstyle for everyone, you can't lose if you can develop friends in this community, and we're not all lore snobs :) you can join without knowing a lick of LOTR.... so please give this game a go...If anyone can get me to play this again my main is Maegen of Brandywine server.

												well, you know what? ive seen these hate reviews, and i dont agree with any of them. i love this game. sure, the graphics are outdated, but so what? why does that have to kill the playerbase? sure the turbine stores ""crap"", but so what? you can earn every penny you need via in game, people who think you have to buy turbine points, its not too hard to get them easily, you just farm them in skirmishes. done! :P other than that, i find the game quite fun at lvl 28 still. its not bad at all! i dont really want to do the quests. i just like to explore the areas and find bosses and secrets and build up my character! its actually really fun!]the playerbase is AWESOME too. sure there are trolls but the vast majority of them are really nice people. my review? 9.5/10 :P ill still put a few hundred more hours into this and probably a lot more before i get tired of it all!

												An MMORPG is only as good as the guild you're in to a large extent. Lord of the Rings Online is a good MMO with a good Freemium model, in fact it was the first hugely successful Freemium model and several other games have taken queues from it. I think of all Freemium models, LOTRO did it the best. The story is engaging and has you crisscrossing over the paths of the Fellowship across Middle Earth. The zones alone are well worth it for the big lore nerds out there. If you can find a good guild, this game has a lot to offer, but it also falls victim to the same shortcomings of all MMOs.Is it worth playing? If you're a Lord of the Rings fan looking for an MMORPG, absolutely. If you're looking for an MMORPG that does something hugely different, move along, this does nothing groundbreaking.			"

												I like this game quite a lot. It's great if you like the lore of LotR. Lots to do, plenty to explore, and many, many mobs to fight. It's by no means perfect, but it's still fun. AND! The free-to-play mechanics are not nearly as limiting as so many other games out there.			"

												This is the only MMO that has held my interested since EverQuest.  I love my Human Warden, I love the lore of the LoTR Universe, and the story that goes along with it.  Journing from Bree, to Rivendell, to Mordor and beyond is such a fun experience.  Get some friends, buy a horse, and pick up an instrument at the local Inn.  You're in for some good times.			"

												One of the few MMOs I fell in love with and played for an extended period of time.  The story of this game is really great and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Running around a Middle Earth is something I have always wanted to do in a game and this is one of the first games that let you do that extensively.As far as game mechanics go, it is pretty standard in terms of combat and in general MMO functionality, but that did not matter because it just seemed to work.One of my favorite features was the ability to play instruments and convert midi files to have concerts in Bree.  Man, I kind of miss those days!			"
