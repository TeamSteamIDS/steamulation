												Type of Game:2D Brawler/Beat-Em-Up with strong PDL elementsVersion Played:PC version through SteamSimilar Games:Risk of Rain, Guacamelee, Spelunky, and to a lesser degree Super Smash BrosThe Good:- An innovative genre combination of brawler and procedural death labyrinth that blends the two seamlessly- Gameplay is fast and frantic, which keeps each play-through exciting     - The procedurally generated “maps” also keep the game feeling fresh every time the player restarts, which will happen    many times - The difficulty level, as is expected of a PDL, is very high. The game gets progressively more challenging the further you progress and health power-ups are very limited.- Combat strategy is thankfully very complex and features parries, counters, and numerous different attack combinations     - This supports the notion that when the player perishes it is due to their poor play strategy and not the game’s design- Progression is similar in method to Risk of Rain, where different characters with different abilities are unlocked by performing certain feats in a play-through- I would be remiss not to mention the beautifully colorful artwork and animation that Ascendant contains. A cell-shaded “nature” themed design creates a vibrant and living game world- Treasure and loot are bountiful, if the player survives long enough, and contain weapons, currency, stat boosts, spells, and Blessings.     - The latter of which are really unique and can change how the player continues their play-through     - Each unlock or new item picked up is logged in a “journal” that describes each item in detail- Two-player local coop is a blast and can create some very fun “juggling” mechanics between the two players, plus exploring this beautiful game world with a friend (or child) is excitingThe Bad:- Lack of networked coop is an extreme bummer. This game is a fantastic experience when shared with another person and to limit it to local multiplayer only is a shame. I understand that the coding required would be difficult, but to be able to play Ascendant with a long-distance friend over Steam would keep it in my library permanently.- The User-Interface and presentation could be much more intuitive. A couple examples:     - The aforementioned unlock “journal” is difficult to navigate as it is tab-based with a full page for each item. This makes it difficult to quickly get to the player’s latest unlock to view it. While there is a copious amount of information for each item/blessing it would have been much cleaner to put them in an icon spreadsheet format which expanded when clicked on. Would potentially have been easier to identify the “new” unlocks too.     - I may be nit-picking, but transitioning around the game menu is clunky and could be streamlined. Any time the player is returned to the parent title menu the logo animation plays again, which is brief and pretty but can wear on the player the more they navigate the menu.Can you play it while the children are awake?:Yes. The local coop testing I mentioned earlier was based on my play sessions with my 8 year old son. Game violence is on-par with Super Smash Bros. and while the combat strategy is complex, it is also easy to pick up and button mash while still enjoying yourself. We had a blast!Did I make time to complete it?Not yet – as mentioned earlier this game is quite difficult and will take awhile for someone to complete all the seasons. I did, however, unlock a handful of characters and greatly enjoyed doing so in my many hours of gameplay.Recommended Purchase Price:Ascendant is a remarkable game that blends together the best parts of a brawler and a rogue-like. Fans of either genre would be doing themselves a disservice by not picking this up. The unique art style and complex mechanics create an unmatched robust gaming experience among a sea of “me too” rogue-likes and PDLs. It is a steal at its current price of $9.99.or100% of current retail value of $9.99A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Play:http://www.gamersglance.com "

												Ascendant is a 2D rogue-like brawler, and pretty dang good one at that. No run will ever be same, and there is quite a bit of variation in the layouts every time. This game offers consistent challenge, but with variation every run. And that is the mark of a good rogue-like.Here's a quick look video of the game if you want to see it in action and what it has to offer. Or if you'd rather read something more concise, just read the review below.


YouTube™ Video: Ascendant Quick Look 

			Views: 538		

			Noble of Lost Pause takes a Quick Look at Ascendant, a rogue-like 2D brawler. Watch as he stumbles into key after key. Never has there been so many keys.		

I'll first begin by explaining the basic mechanics of this game. You play as your selected magic swordsman that's able to slash down foes, launch them with a hard swing Guacamelee style, or fire magic at them. You continue doing this until you reach the boss of the randomly generated dungeon, who can also change every run. If you manage to beat them, then you progress to the next part of the season, or to the next season if you already did so. Each new progression brings a harder challenge than the last with enemies that behave differently and are generally tougher.But what makes that so good? It's the way each run feels like something new and the way the game still makes you feel like you're making progression. There's always some new weapon, spell, item, blessing or spirit that you'll come across and want to experiment with, the blessing being the most unique of the bunch. You'll only get them by defeating a boss, and where you equip them (body, sword, or magic) will offer you different boons that change the way way you play. And when you start progressing farther into the game, you'll probably be combining several together to make something that's really interesting and fun to do. I once found blessings that allowed me to slowly fall while casting and that enabled projectiles to bounce off walls. I then stumbled upon a spell that consistently fired off random projectiles every .1 seconds. Needless to say, the mayhem that ensued was a blast.But let's break down a few negatives this game comes with.*A lot of people may be turned off by the fact it looks like a flash game. A lot of games don't get the chance they deserve because of this.*While there is a decent number of enemies that fight differently, a lot of them are simple reskins of others. I would've liked to see different mobs. And it would've also made it less confusing how to handle something when I found melee mobs that that now shot projectiles.*Sometimes the random nature can be a bit too harsh. I once had a run where I found 3 keys to enter a shop, but I coudn't for the life of me find money to spend in them. Another time was when I consistently found hearts when I didn't need them, but when I actually did, I hovered on half of one for the longest time until I finally died. There should be some sort of mechanic that favors a certain outcome based on your current state.*There's no story at all. While I personally don't mind, some people like a reason behind what they're doing, even if it is something simple like saving the world or your girlfriend.Now if you can look past those negatives, you'll find a game that's challenging, fun, and even comes with local co-op if you want to bring a bud along. Even when you die, which will probably be often, you'll keep coming back for more and gradually get better. Why is that? Because the game feels fair for the most part. If you got hit, it's because you messed up and didn't dodge or parry in time. There's a high skill-ceiling in this game, and it's satisfying when you're beginning to breeze past the early levels that once gave you once heck of a challenge.So to sum up, I recommend this game to all who like challenge. You're going to get exactly that here, and it'll feel like a fresh experience every time.			"

												Ascendant will change your life. Before this game existed I was a clean-faced baby and now that I've beaten it I'm a bushy-bearded man earning upwards of 8 beard compliments a week. Think about what something like that could do for your life and then buy the game regardless of how that thought process went down. Also I helped make this game and my mom is pretty proud.			"

												I highly recommend this game if you enjoy challenging rogue-like side scrollers. The game is artistically beautifully, the characters are unique and offer variation to the gameplay, and the bosses are fun and rewarding. If you like risk of rain or rogue legacy, you will enjoy this game and if you arent a fan, you should become one because this game is great. The game also has an excellent coop (local only) mode and youll likely get more fun out of the two player experience. I've only played it briefly so far, but I think this game is a top contender in its genre. Thanks for reading.Edit: I've now beaten the game with every character and I can still say that the game is extremely enjoyable. Each run has been very unique and it feels great to stomp the last boss a couple of times. I highly recommend this game.Edit 2: Check out the wiki for help with bosses or anything else. I recently added a bnuch of stuff and looked at the rest to make sure they were correct or useful. http://ascendantgame.wikia.com/wiki/Ascendant_Wiki "

												There is a seed of a brilliant game here, but it's not as much fun as it should be.The good first, I guess: The stylization of the graphics is unique, and the visual design is terrific.  The BGM is gorgeous, no two ways about it.  Vibrant without being twee, atmospheric without devolving into sonic punctuation, Ascendant is an aboslute delight to listen to.It's a shame it's not such a delight to play.  The combat is well-executed, if with a somewhat steep learning curve.  In fact, in my first hour or two of play, I found myself wondering why there are so few action-platformers with such fun and engaging combat.  Then you start to notice that the power-ups you're unlocking don't really appear very much, that most of the pots you're smashing (yes, I know) are empty, and that using that cool combat engine in an engaging way is just going to end up with you doing sooner and having to start the whole process over again.  There is very little variety in enemy or level-chunk design on a level by level basis, and it all soon starts to feel less like a game and more like a chore.I feel like someone of my near-OCD-levels-of-completionism should absolutely love this, but I just don't.  Perhaps if there was more actual platforming (where, at the risk of sounding conceited, I do have the skills) I would find it more engaging, but the platforming is simply window dressing for the fighting, which is a shame, because the fighting is very, very good.  The platforming however, is not even at the level of Rogue Legacy, and certainly nowhere near Strider, Guacamelee or any of the 2D Castlevania games.  I'm not going to say I don't enjoy it at all, because I do, but only in short spurts.  It doesn't have the ability to keep me pinned to my chair for hours the way, to pick an example of a 2D action-platformer on Steam, Valdis Story: Abyssal City did.  I believe Hapa Games should be rewarded and encouraged for the stunning art, beautiful soundtrack and inspired fighting mechanics of this game, and reservedly recommend it on those grounds.  But caveat emptor; this game might not be for you.			"

#IntroI am not much of a rewiwer, more of an analyst. This review is based on experience both with the game and the genre, at the time of writing sunk 40-50 hours into this game. I will not play a bad game for 40 minutes let alone 40 hours. If you are a fan of the genre buy it, game is excellent. If you would like a more detailed reasoning behind why keep reading, there wil be very very minor gameplay/story spoilers as it is impossible to talk about certain mechanics of the game without referencing them.#PlotThe plot of the game is simple. You are a Demi-god, There is a God, Overthrow the God, Become the new god. Each Demi-god has its own story and reasons for wanting to be God. The level structure is similar to Binding of Issac, there are multiple floors in groups of two with semi randomly generated rooms between you and the boss of each floor. Every odd numbered floor has a random boss from a select pool of possible bosses for that floor, and every even numbered floor has that levels guardian which is the same every time but there are two possible variations of it. Each boss is a challenge in its own right and each has its own set of attacks, attack paterns, weaknesses to exploit and most have multiple phases. Some are more challenging than others and some can end up being trivial if RNGesus loves you but personally that is half the fun.#CombatBefore I begin I will say the game has an excellent Tutorial that covers pretty much everything I am about to cover. If you buy this game play the tutorial, it is not boring and gets straight to the point.Combat boiled down is - Attacks, launch attacks, Magic Attacks, Parry and evasion. You may also occassionally find a 1 use items called Breaths which offer numberous effects for the room you are in. Most are combat focused but for the most part you'll be depending on either your weapons or magic to clear the path between you and the next room. Attacking an enemy with either magic of spells will also do stagger damage. Stagger damage is a separate  health bar of sorts. Once an enemy has taken enough stagger damage they will glow yellow allowing you to use a launch attack to send them flying across the screen taking massive damage and doing massive damage to anything they collide with. Its a very simple mechanic and very satisfying. Feels very meaty especially if you are able to stagger and ping a larger foe across the room. For survival you can dash left or right through enemy attacks and flank them or parry the attack sending them flying (or in the case of projectiles reflects them). Timing is key, you'll have to be rather skilled at the game to successfully pull it off especially in the late game or against certain bosses but using the room to your advantage is also a viable tactic, You don't have to parry or dash through attacks, you can always jump over, run away, lure foes out of position among other things. It is very well done.As for what you'll encounter there is quite a bit of enemy variety but you will not notice it at first since each season is tiered. The first season will always have a mix of melee flies, Grunts, mage grunts, worm brawlers, worm hitters and suicide grunts, The next season will expand this roster adding elite versions ontop of new enemy types with their own elite versions. Many enimes especially later ones are a challenge in their own right and their mere presence can change the whole way you tackle the room. You may also encounter one of many many possible event rooms which range from being ambushed, blessing themed obstacle courses, mini games, gambling and straight up ""Here is a awersome free thing, have fun"". You won't know until you enter what it is and it took me around 20-25 hours of playing until I was finally able to experience all of them. Adds a lot of depth to each floor if you decide to explore them especially if they are locked costing you a valuable key.#ProgessionEvery playable Deity in this game (7 in total) has its own strengths/weaknesses which cater to certain playstyles which you'll disvoered as you unlock them. Every floor has at least 1 item room and a shop. Items rooms contain 1 gold chest either locked or unlocked which can provide you with high level stat boosts, breaths, weapons, a chunk of influence (the shop currency) or something else that I won't spoil. Shops on each floor are always locked and always have 4 items for sale and are one of the few ways to get a new spell. Each spell replaces your magic attack with a new one which can range from tripple shots to spread fire or mines.There are two levels of passives in this game. First are spirits which are straight up passives, you pick them up and you get a bonus. There are 57 to collect in all and most have a chance of appearing on weapons you'll find to. There is no limit to the amount of passives you can get and they pretty much all stack flawlessly naby offering very cool interactions with each other. Bklessings are the second teir of passive in the game and each Deity can only hold a limited number at a time but they are very powerful. Blessings are rewards for beating the levels boss and can be placed into 1 of 3 body slots augmenting your attacks, magic or passively. Each blessing has its own unique effect depending on where you socket and they all interact with each other. 21 blessings with 63 passives in total to discover and many many combinations and synergies to experiment with. Because of how potent blessings are they will shape your run meaning no two runs end up the same but that should go without saying, its the whole point of the genre.#ConclusionOverall the game is fantasic and a must have if you are a fan of the genre. There is a lot of depth to be had but it will require a little investment since you will have to learn encounters and most likely need to unlock new items before you are able to get a successful completion. It does have a few balance niggles mainly when you encounter a room with multiple shielded enemies which will be very intimidating at first but apart from that the game is paced very well and is very rewarding to play and much more than a simple 1 button combat system that is the fault of many other games in this genre.#Verdict= Highly RecommendedThanks to Totalbiscuit for his WTF is...? coverage of this game. If not for him this game would have completely flown under my radar as I am sure it flew under yours. If you need any more convincing check out his first impressions of the game.			"

												After about 12 hours in the game here are my thoughts.Initially I really liked the game.  However, as time past here are the things that have really bothered me and why I can't recommend it in its current state.There are boss fights that are near impossible to beat unless you are set up just right to beat them.  i.e. luck.  e.g.  Furthest I have gone after 12 hours of play time is late fall.  On the last run I met the son of something and he had an invulnerability shield.  That shield was up about 80% of the time.  No way I could beat him with all the spam he puts out.Very few people have beaten the game.  Simply put, if only 3% of players are beating your game on normal mode that is a design problem, NOT a player problem.  That 3% is probably attributed mostly to sheer luck, as I am sure it is well within the margin of error for luck in this game considering out random it is.  There are some, what I call, cheap mechanics, in the game, such as that invulnerability shield, or bouncing fire/acid in very tight spaces that can't be destroyed.  Things such as that, are why players die, and also why they give up on the game.  They feel cheated.  For the most part, I like how the levels themselves playout, but I find the boss fights tedious and quite boring, not to mention in some cases cheap.I would have loved to just see the game as one big tower perhaps, continous in nature, with no boss fights, or perhaps more well thought out bosses.  As it is now I am going to put this one down for a while, and put it under my in development category where it belongs.  I just find the first two parts, Spring early and late, too boring to trudge through over and over again after I die.  There are much better roguelikes out there, with much better balance (Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, FTL, Risk of Rain, SotS The Pit, etc....).  I really hope there are future updates to the game that address the issues I mention.  The game has great potential, but I just can't consider this game as finished as the balance is way off (reward/accomplishment system is also near nonexistant).Additional Later Review (20141129)Now 40 hours into this game, and I have beaten it on normal now with all but Midas and the last guy you unlock (forget his name).  I still stand by much of this review.  While I actually like the game a bit more now, having gotten really good at parrying many attacks and learned all the boss patterns, and with the additional unlocks making the game difficulty more acceptable, I still have to say that the game difficulty could use some refinement.I still find the invulnerability shields a horrible idea, and just a easy way to make boss fights harder instead of making the boss fights more interesting.  The boss fights imo are the weakest point of this game.  The last boss types (fighting another character, and that big guy after him), including the final boss are easier than some of the earlier bosses.  They need MAJOR refinement.  Open up the space, have a boss fight on a big area instead of an enclosed space, and use the environment more to make it interesting (spikes for example).There is still not much of a risk/reward system in the game, and you are still forced to clear every room you enter (which is against the idea of the roguelike where you DON'T have to fight everything, and probably should not).Some epic weapons are just too epic, like the twig.  I mean, infinite mana, basically?!  I could see half or a quarter, but zero mana use?!   If you have any decent, not OP, but decent spell combo with twig it is basically game over, you win, unless you get really careless.So yea, game still needs more refinement, and I do like the game, but I don't love it.  Sad part is that I want to love this game, but as pointed out above, some things about it just irritate the crap out of me.@Bluecard:  Perhaps you could come up with something more constructive, or maybe you are just a troll.@Karob:  I appreciate the comment, but well designed roguelikes, the ones that are succesful and actually have people who continue to play them because they are fun, have some level of structure within the game that tempers the randomness such that the extremes don't occur or occur very rarely.  I completely agree with the journey, not the destination statement.  Problem is I enjoy the journey of this game with moments of severe annoyance, not frustration or displeasure due to losing, but just being annoyed, mostly with the boss fights.  I win most all the boss fights, but I feel they take more away from the game then they give.  They feel forced, and feel like a very different play style from the rest of the game, the part that I actually enjoy.  I just want to enjoy the entire journey the game provides, not just some of it.  I think that can definitely be achieved with some rewrites of the boss fights as mentioned above.			"

												This is a fun little roguelike with both huge strengths and glaring flaws. This game sets itself apart from other games in the genre with action/beat-em-up combat, but the moveset is quite small. Almost all the customization comes from spells and passive abilities, so don't buy this game expecting tons of synergies like Isaac. The combat takes some time to master despite how simple it is, and clearing rooms usually doesn't feel like it all depends on luck. Be warned that this game is difficult; barely anyone who bought it has finished it, and that's not due to the usual Steam mentality of buying games and never playing them. Sadly, the boss battles are where most of the aforementioned things occur. Many of them are much too difficult to beat without a good build, and they are heavily scripted with frequent use of invincibility shields between phases. This essentially means that the player will be stuck dodging difficult attacks for several cycles if the game didn't give them a damaging build. They are frustrating to fight at best and annoying enough to make you not want to do repeated playthroughs at the worst. The recent addition of an easier mode makes things more tolerable, but the bosses will still grate on the player's nerves. The unlocking system is standard for the genre, but the way the game is structured means that they don't keep you motivated to keep playing. Most of the unlockable items are in shops, which is rough since the player is pitted against the RNG of both getting enough money to buy the item, and actually having it appear in the shop. Still, this is a decent game for people who want a cheap roguelike that's not afraid to step out of the genre limitations. The developers have hinted at the possibility of more combat, so perhaps these issues will be ironed out eventually. Just don't come into this game expecting to finish it regardless of your experience of the genre, and things should be okay.Overall, this is an ambitious game for this genre that suffers due to that. Still, it's fun enough to warrant a purchase.			"

												Not having a save function is a real deal-breaker for me. The developers said that they don’t think a save function is important, because everyone should be able to sit down and play for 1.5-2 straight hours to complete it in one sitting (and without dying). It’s a shame, because the game is actually quite good. Pity they had to ruin it for everyone who doesn’t have time (or doesn't want) to play it for hours on end.			"

												Ascendant is a decent cross between an action platformer and a roguelike, but it's far from perfect or even all that great. Think The Binding of Isaac meets Dust and you'll have a good idea of what you're in for. The game's amateurish art and uninspired sound hardly make for the most aesthetically pleasing package, and the steep learning curve will probably lead some to shelve this one prematurely. If you can stick with the game, however, you'll find that it really is a solid platformer with some relatively deep RPG mechanics and an intelligent procedure for generating levels. This game's biggest problem is that it falls into the same trap that a lot of indie games that attempt to implement roguelike elements fall into: Luck trumps skill in a big way. Ascendant is tough, and like The Binding of Isaac, your odds of success are determined almost entirely by how lucky you got with treasure chests early on in the game. There's a lot going against this one, but it still manages to be a pretty good game.			"

												Very interesting game, set in a strange world, with references from many cultures, like ancient Japanese, Sumerian and Hindu. The gameplay, although it does not feature anything new (you hack and slash your way, old school style, through various levels) is pretty solid and rewarding; there is a good variety of enemies that you'll find in your path and many interesting weapons and items to help you in your journey. When it comes to death, it is final, meaning you cannot continue from where you died, however your demise would be entirely your fault, not due to some random event or the game's imbalance in general. To sum up, Ascendant is a very good game that it shouldn't be missed and totally worth it's low price. Recommended!			"

												I generally love Roguelite/Roguelike games and especially this one because it does a major thing better than every other game in that genre that I ever played: It's the combat. It is fast, fair but challenging and it feels great and very fluid. There is nothing like dashing towards an opponent hitting him two times knocking him away dashing after him and continue hitting him. On top of that there is a huge amount of diffrent weapons, spells, spirits (passive effects) and blessings that you can put on your weapon armor or spells. These blessing also allow many diffrent character builds because depending where on your body you put them you get diffrent effects.It has a great soundtrack, a huge amount of replayabilty and very well executed game mechanics. I really recommend this game to everyone that likes roguelites because this one is the best there is. "

												Ascendant is a rogue-like dungeon crawler which is best played in short bursts rather than over an extended period time. It has fun gameplay mechanics, where you're able to blink to attack enemies from afar, parry attacks, dash, etc., and I've never felt that at any point in time the mechanics in the game weren't important, since certain enemies move faster than your character making the blink important, parrying projectiles one-shots most enemies, and you can avoid enemy fire to get behind them with your dash. The unique positive and negative attributes separate this game from others in the same category, with one positive being a character heals upon boss kills, and a negative attribute for a character is upon picking up health, it has a low chance to fizzle to dust and do nothing. While this game is fun, it's only playable in short bursts due to the soundtrack. Although it fits the theme of the game, the music can detract some from wanting to play it, and because to that I give a warning to those who are easily bothered by repetition to not purchase this game.I also give a warning to those who are bothered by difficulty, as I personally have only been able to reach the ending credits on baby mode with only a half heart remaining, out of my very extensive health pool of at least 10 heart containers. The game is not a breeze, and should not be taken lightly at first glance.For a quick list of all the pros and cons I can think of for people who enjoy those as well:Pros:~Quick, exciting gameplay which always keeps you on your toes~Fun mechanics which always feel important to the flow of the game~Chests spawn after literally every room clear~Challenge rooms are generally challenging, but extremely rewarding~Unique character attributes~Many opportunities for improved weaponry and spells~Blessings give game-changing passive benefits, and almost never feel useless~Enemy patterns are easy to learn~Enemies are NOT immune to spikesCons:-Repetitive sountrack-Shields can make certain enemies extremely difficult to attack-Bosses have very few attack patterns-Certain bosses are extremely easy to dodge, while others are nearly impossible to-Specific spells feel unimportant and don't feel as though they work as intended-That god damn zypherus challenge room...

												Ascendant is unforgiving and brutal and cannot be compared to Rogue Legacy where your heir will follow you up. It is a true rogue-like game where you can't just rush through maps while mowing down your enemies. You need to do so with careful planning, punch the right badasses and use them to your advantage to kick them towards any other enemies in your surroundings. The first few playthroughs will utterly destroy you and possibly your gamers ego but the more you play, the more you will learn from your previous mistakes. The combat system in Ascendant has a nice mixture of melee attacks, ranged spells and dodge and parry attacks than can backfire ranged spells amongst other things to your enemies. Several combo's are prominent in the game and will require some getting used to. Once you're more familiar with the combat and the enemies themselves, you will venture further and further in the rooms, finding various blessings, breaths and weapons that will help you become a fierce but not unbeatable warrior. Luckily there's a shop where you can buy upgrades which uses the influence gained by treasure chests and enemies as a currency to become even stronger. Each new item you will find along the way will be kept in a log split into various categories. This log can be accessed in the main menu but also in the game itself which comes in handy if you want to know more about what powers the blessing, breaths or weapons beholds. The replayability in Ascendant is absolutely brilliant as each playthrough will generate a complete new world, with new enemies in each room that are waiting for you. Other items such as the pots and chest will contain different bonuses and often the bosses you will need to face rotate. Each new adventure is a new challenge you have to face as death is final in this game. There are no checkpoints where you can restart from. That being said, the game is merciless and requires the player to have a serious amount of self-control while you study the enemies moves. Visually the game sets itself apart completely from various other titles in the same subgenre, a feature that will attract many players despite the steep learning curve of the game. It is said that the ancient power struggle between the demigods has begun once more and that is noticeable from the overall graphical features in the game. The characters you get to play share a resemblance to the ancient samurai's with various types of armor and colors. However, it may not be the characters themselves that stun you visually. The backgrounds that create the setting of each room will. The artistic landscapes are pleasing to your eyes and details are not left out. While Ascendant is a beat 'em up game, it is not filled with blood and gore. This makes it a perfect game to play local coop with your kids or your faint of heart friends.ConclusionAscendant is the most brutal beat 'em up game that combines features from the brawlers and rogue-like games with elements from platformers. Visually the game is outstanding and the ancient Asian touch can give you a clear sense of the demigod that you supposedly are, if it wasn't for you constantly dying. Thanks to the procedurally generated environments, each playthrough is a complete new challenge. The game is extremely difficult and has a very steep learning curve that may leave you bitter for a while but you will find yourself going back to it sooner or later. Ascendant is a title you should have in your collection, especially if you are addicted to the rogue-like genre.			"

												at first glance it looks like a nice easy 2d platformer with a combat system thrown in there for good measure but you would be oh so wrong this is a extremely unforgiving rouge like beatemup platformer it is very hard there is no save system and death is permanent  it is extremly fun but rage inducing i recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging rouge like platformer with a great combat and stat systemalso just to give you an idea as to how much rage this made me go through i start flailing my fists at my monitor			"

												Ascendent is an interesting game that has a lot going for it, and a lot going against it.Pros:-Interesting art style-Good soundtrack-Good amount of characters with unique attributes-Variety of weapons and upgrades for your character-Each run feels unique with different layouts, bosses, and itemsNeutral:-Combat is not the best but it works to an extent-Controls can be awkward at times but are generally not too badCons:-Obnoxious boss fights-Difficutly is overall too highSummary:Ascendent is a good game overall but it is flawed in many areas. For example the bosses are quite obnoxious as many of them have shields that make them invincible for a period of time while you get beaten senseless by them. Also some of them have attacks that are really hard to dodge. Another problem is that the game is just too difficult at times. There are a lot of enemeis and a lot of them have hard to dodge attacks. On their own its not too bad but when they are stacked up, you are bound to get hit. Add in the little amount of hearts the game gives you and the obnoxious bosses (where you generally get hurt the most) and you will find you die quite a lot. But while those points hold the game back, I still had a lot of fun. The game always had me coming back for more because each run felt different and had me going further along in the game. I like the way you power yourself up by gaining blessings from beating bosses or buying them at the shop. Each blessing had a unique power depending on how you used it. Also the weapons were cool and each had a unique effect. I have heard that other people didn't like the controls too much and felt the combat is awkward, and I can't say I disagree, but it didn't ruin the fun for me. While both could be better, they work well enough to enjoy the game. I was originally put off on buying the game due to some of the negative reviews, but I ended up getting this game from a Humble Bundle, and I really enjoyed it. Overall, its a fun game and I do recommend it. It has its problems but if you are not very critical of games or are not too picky, you can learn to overlook them and have fun with what the game does right.			"

Replay value???? Yes and tons of it, if you are a fan of the following: Binding of Issac, Risk of Rain, and Spelunky mixed with beat em up elements then this game is right up your alley with random power ups and a ""new world"" every time you play the game is pretty cool. The game is very hard but with a addicting flavor that keeps you going to try and get to the end. Lots of unlockables as well a solid game through and through.			"

												If you enjoyed Risk of Rain, Spelunky, or other similar games you should take a serious look at Ascendant. There's lots to unlock, tons of bosses, and a virtually infinite number of ways to combine powers and upgrades.  Maybe you want your spells to knock enemies backward, or maybe you'd like to leave a trail of fire when you dash. Mix and match these attributes to form your own strategies and playstyles. It's quite engrossing and pretty addicting.  This game is not for the faint of heart; if you do not enjoy a challenge, this game is not for you.			"

												""Roguelike"" 2d platformer with pseudo-random levels and a reflex based combat system.The story is nonexistent for the most part, the music is nothing but about 15 second loops. The artstyle is cool enough. Not a lot of enemy types. Or weapon types. Spells are mostly just projectiles.I spent a lot of hours in it and had fun with it at the time, but now that I've mellowed on the game a bit, I don't think I'd ever go back to it. Some of the bosses feel grossly unfair compared to others, and magic and a few specific uniques make the game a cakewalk.I wouldn't recommend it unless you can ge♥♥♥♥♥on the cheap and you're really hard up for 2d brawler action. It IS fun to run around and dash and fling enemies around into spikes and walls, but the rest of the game just feels a bit bare. The nods of various mythos and deities and mythologies form a cool framework for the game, and the combat is passably fun for what it tries to do and has a decent skill ceiling, but... I don't know. It's just not ""all there"". The music being the same loops over and over forever is rough. RNG determines a lot of your run, like any roguelike.			"

												First impressions of the game when trying it out was really good. It reminded me of ""Binding of Isaac"" in some areas and the customization possibilities you got when choosing where to place boss rewards on your character sheet made for interesting choices based on what kind of playstyle you wanted to try.Decent flow of combat, nice graphics and all in all it was a decent experience. All of this comes to naught because of one feature in the game, though.Event rooms.There are some rooms that are ""event rooms"" where you get the chance for a reward if you do something. This could be a simple as jumping unto a pillar that stood in the middle of the room, to beat a swarm of enemies, to feed a hungry shark or to... get killed by spikes.Actually, the last one is the effect and not the actual event. It sums up to the same thing, though. With one roll of the die, when you enter the room everything you did up till that point is nullified (""the room strips you from your powers""), so your customization and choices doesn't matter. Furthermore, it's not a matter of 'beat this challenge', but 'how long time do you want to spend in this room before suffering the inescapable death'. These 'event spike rooms' stand for the 'instant death' mechanics we should have left in the dark ages, even though the game tries to shine them up as 'hard challlenges'. The end result is the same. your choices and good gameplay before you entered the room doesn't matter and you won't get past the room.This was especially annoying when a game session is not a ""quick thing"" but something that can take hours. Hours of playing well and customization thrown away at the roll of a die. That's not good gameplay.My suggestion: Find another roguelike that actually feels rewarding without these 'instant death' rooms.			"

												This game reminds me in a lot of ways of The Binding of Issac... which is my all time favourite rouge-like game, and Ascendant is VERY simillar in many ways, but one of the biggest (and obvious) differences is the art style, i absolutely LOVE the gorgeous colour pallet in this game, really simple but oh so pretty! as well as the soundtrack...Just like Issac, its laid out as rooms connected together... up, down, left, right... which is perfect for the format, with some chest rooms that may sometimes need keys to unlock, and shops as well (influence being the currancy)... all these basic mechanics from Issac are here, and for a good reason... THEY WORK! As for the gameplay itself, its very simple combat, nothing too complicated, the only thing ive had a slight struggle with is being precise in smacking enemies into other enemies that arnt right next to you... and timing the block/parry attack (which is VERY freakin usefull if you can perfect it). On my first run, id honestly felt a bit dissapointed because all the enemies were very easy to kill.... that is untill i got up to the first boss.... DAMN YOU THE MAW!!!!........... freakin jerk.... but like alot of games once u figure out the pattern its not THAT hard... which is probably the only thing im not 100% on with Ascendant, its not quite as brutally sack crushing like The Binding of Issac, but that being said it doesnt make it any less enjoyable, just a bit more relaxed.All in all, i really like this game... most definitely recommended for anyone who like the genre, and actually worth the price.9/10.... only thing stopping me from giving a full score is the difficulty... but seeing as ive not played a HUGE amount yet... i could very well change my mind later......... EDIT........Having now played over 20 hours i do indeed change my mind... 10/10... hands down one of my favourite rouge-likes... the more you play the more you unlock to be able to pick up in runs, which just makes it so much more fun... and it does indeed get considerably harder the further you go. love it... just freakin love it!

												A fun little rogue-like in a similar vain to Binding of Isaac. It isn't a twin-stick shooter like Isaac and the combat does have a slight learning curve to it. It's a fun permadeath game at a decent price. There are a few negatives including a seemingly limited variety of enemy encounters in the early stages and a limited variety of boss fights. Navigation also isn't as straight-forward as one would like, but the maps make finding your way a lot easier.There appears to be a wide variety of powerups and abilities that will make the replayability high. For $10, I would recommend the game for fans of the genre.			"

												Well... This game is pretty bad♥♥♥♥♥ With a huge variety of weapons, spells, upgrades, and passives, replay ability is massive. Learning just unlocking everything in the game at least once will take 20+ hours to complete (depending on skill level). The combat in this game is simplistic but feels nice; being able to dodge attacks, parry, use spells, and with the added ability to send weak enemies flying as projectiles for massive damage, pulling off massive battles become very challenging but never unbeatable. Bosses in the game are fun to fight and require many different ways of killing them, With the launching mechanic being a mainstay in many fights.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a challenge, Rogue-lite, or Beat-em-ups. Well worth the asking price!			"

												This game is awesome.Ascendant is a roguelike with brawler execution. For me, is a mix between Binding of isaac and Dust: An Elysian Tail, two of my favourite indie games.I didn't have this feeling of descovering items, seeing cool combos and customizing randomly your character since the first time I played Isaac. Ascendant is a hard game and I really liked this. You can have an unbelievable start, go to the 3rd world with overpowered stats and powers and you will die if you don't play good. You can go to single stages called events with random stuff happening. For example, you will have to pass a test of skill, with particular skills like double dashing or double jump. Or you will have a free weapon to pick but when you do it, tough enemies will appear. So even if you are strong you can die if you do mistakes.Bosses are hard too. You will need to memorize their attacks and skills, and even if you are overpowered as hell, their shields,  environment or their particular mechanics will kill you. So this is a game in which you have to play perfectly and don't be over-confident because you got incredible stats.The items system is really fun too. It's random with some choices. When you kill a boss, or sometimes on events or randomly, you will get something called blessings. Blessings are like runes that you put on your armor, weapon or magic. Every character (there are 2 to start and you can unlock 5 more) has a different number of slots. For example 2 weapon slots, 2 armor slots and 1 magic slot. So a single blessing can be a burning effect if you put it on the weapon,  an explosion when hit on armor and spell explosion on magic. This way you can have totally different characters every time you start a new game depending on the blessings that you get on game and the choices you make. I only saw like 10 blessings and I could do really cool combos. So with all the blessings you can unlock, the 1-use items, magics, weapons with their own skills and stats, and the 57 spirits (passive skills like money = damage, low player gravity, low shop prices...) you will play a different game every time you start again. The possibilities are huge.Recommended 100%			"

I very much liked the art style and general look of the charecters was appeling to me. there is a large veriety power ups and upgrades to find and unlock  that alter your abilities and can finer tune your play style, though the random nature of what powers you get won`t always   help asmuch as you may need, but thats just the chips fall. Any way I highly recomend Ascendant  and don`t think it will disapoint.			"

												This is not a ""terrible"" game, it's just it's not engaging at all. I entered the game, confronted with a menu, went trough a tutorial, then the game started. What (or who) is the character?. The game feels hollow and empty, almost without a story. I found the graphics colorful, but dull. The scenarios are not attractive at all, a lot of colorful tree like structures with some lines, but they don't seem alive. Why in the world are you running in this forest killing grunts and those strange flying things?. The music kind of ""meh"", but repetitive. As someone reviewed, it's forgettable.After playing Guacamelee (in all this forms), I found this game be quite similar (beat em up, colorful, a lot of enemies), but lacks humour, variety and charm. Contrary to Guacamelee, the rooms are randomly generated, and harder, but it's not enough for wanting me to go back if there's no motivation behind.Yeah, I know, I played for less than an hour (probably half an hour). With a enormous backlog, I couldn't find any reason to play more time to see if the game get better. It's strange when you see all the praise (126 positive reviews), but well, maybe makes sense playing more time.TL; DRBoring, repetitive, hollow and the art forgettable.			"

												The combat mechanics are really amazing - if you don't hate beat'em up at least - but this doesn't make the game better, it just makes it feel like a waste of potential.There aren't enough type of different enemies, and the scenarios are annoyingly repetitive, even when it changes it's just graphics, and not of the stunning type. It's randomly generated, but that's a joke, because it's always some lines of terrain here and there, where you can jump here and there, fighting the same enemies here and there, doing the same exact thing... again and again... here and there! There's nothing that adds variety to the game, and this is something you can't accept in a roguelite where you are supposed to play multiple times through the same levels.I'm sad, because i really loved the gameplay, but this game is a constant deja-vù of itself.I bet that the majority of people who rated this game good, did it after playing for a hour or so. They enjoyed it and suggested it, thinking they would have found more content playing it. Well, no. There's no reason to play this more than a hour, so, i'm sorry:Conclusions: It made me sad. :(Thumb down. "

												I would love to recommend this game, I really would! The art style is gorgeous, the environments are amazing, the music is lovely, and the enemies are unique!But the difficulty is just too damn difficult to make it last more than two levels. I made it to Fall and died on the second Fall boss (The Hermit).To explain the difficulty best; think classic Castlevania on steroids.			"

												It reminded me a lot of the kinda-story-mode in Super Smash Bros Brawl except it was fun. You run around, beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta stuff, get upgrades and have a good time. Some of the controls and mechanics are REALLY awkward but it could just take some getting used to it. If you want to change any of the controls though, you better believe it's a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You have to set EVERY SINGLE BUTTON if you want to change one so that was pretty awful. But focusing on the game, the items are all really cool and fun to mess around with, there's a pretty good amount of customization (3 choices for every ""blessing""). If you like running around with no actual aim and beating stuff up just to get to the next level, you've found your game.			"

												Exceptional roguelike beat'em in a charming world!You will die. Again and again. But with each death, you learn and become stronger demigod, relentlessly pushing farther and farther... Although you do improve your demigod as you play, it is the improvement of your skills and knowledge that persists between runs.This game is brutal yet fair, rewarding and fun. If you like Rogue Legacy, grab this immediately.If you haven't played this kind of game before, give it a shot and feel the power of fair permadeath!			"

												My favourite game this year so far. It's like Rogue Legacy but without the stupid permanent progression system and much more random which makes it very very fun and replayable.It's challenging as balls too, it took me 34 hours to beat it for the first time and i've been still playing since then for about 30 more hours.An absolutely 'hidden' gem, buy it, play it and enjoy it!PS: Get ready to experience some bugs though.

TL;DRThere's other games in this genre of ""super hard 2D beat 'em up""s that come more highly recommended by me than this.Coulda Woulda ShouldaBland bacon. Though there's nothing inherently wrong with it, you can't help but feel like it might be better with some seasoning, or if it was smoked, or maybe just prepared in conjunction with a more flavorful dish. This game is essentially bland bacon, nothing terribly wrong with it, but there's so much more room for it to be better.BreakdownPros Definitely Difficult: if you're a fan of the super difficult beat 'em ups, then this game does fit into your niche. Interesting, enough: there's just enough content, with the new characters and what not, that warrants a couple extra play throughs if you've beaten the gameCons Fiddly Controls: for a 2D platformer, this game has some of the fiddliest controls I've ever seen. Don't even try playing this on a keyboard unless  you have the hand stability of a surgeon. Even on a controller, getting your character to go where you want is kind of difficult. Lots of Visual Issues: the art assets in the game aren't Triple-A quality, but that's fine and not a con. What is is Con however is the fact that many enemies and environmental dangers blend into the scenery. I can't count how many times I've died accidentally walking into easily avoidable spike traps simply because I couldn't see them. Too Much Luck: most games in the ""super-diffcult"" genre are usually very consistent in their delivery so that a skilled player is discernably ""better"". However, there's too much luck involved in the item drops, room locations, and shop prices to make each play through consistent. A newbie can get great shop and item luck and blow through seasons while a seasoned (ba dum tshh) player with bad item luck can die over and over again on the first couple.Score: 3.9/10Honestly, the game has a bunch of pretty cool ideas going for it. However, the inconsistency of the game made me unexcited to play it. There's plenty of potential for a great game (maybe more utility spells?) in here, but it's current iteration does not capitalize on that potential at all.			"

												I first saw a video about Ascendant and thought: ""Hey that looks great...I have to try it!"" After playing it I thought to myself :""This game looks great, feels great, sounds nice...but why does it beat me so hard!?"" Ascendant is hard, but its also rewarding and fair. I feel that every death came from my mistakes and not from anything else. Also there are a lot of things that you can customize your character with on your journey. Every run is different. But the ending is the same for me. Death. Hmm...but maybe after this run it will change? *accidentaly stabs himself in spikes* Or maybe the next one...			"

												I somewhat recommend this game because there is fun to be had and it looks really great.I enjoy platformers and recently I have been enjoying rogue-likes. That having been said, I'm going to delve into the negatives.  I honestly feel pretty mixed about it.Unlike Rogue Legacy, there are no real permanent passives that make you stronger as you do runs. The main thing unlocked throughout runs are descriptions of certain buffs/passive slots that are unknown until equipped/picked up. The problem with that is that you may reach a point where you  are capped by skill and can no longer advance and the game won't do anything to assist you unless you get lucky. The biggest problem with this model is... the game is too difficult to support it. This game either needs to be toned down in difficulty, or introduce permanent bonuses that will help you if you find yourself stuck. I wouldn't normally feel this way if I thought that you could beat it using skill, but honestly I feel pretty skill capped.  I ended up beating Baby Mode and while it was rewarding, it was also pretty frustrating to a fault. To beat Baby Mode, I had to choose Ghat, get fairly lucky with drops, and play extremely scared. It's not a good sign when you have to resort to using primarily long range skills to snipe baddies that are off screen in order to maintain your health just to possibly beat Baby Mode. Often times when I need hearts I'll get keys and when I need keys I'll get hearts. It's an issue that is exacerbated by the difficulty, the lack of drops, and the inability to gain hearts back easily.The combat is nice, but it is overshadowed by the difficulty. I want to fight close, but it's a lot riskier and attacking is somewhat clunky. During an attack animation you will not be able to move, essentially locking you into place. If you swing and miss, there will likely be a follow up attack since you are spamming the attack button, and you probably will be punished for it. The melee swing requires you to be pretty precise too, so it's not very forgiving.I had fun with this game but it's too frustrating an experience to continue further with no real progression.Suggestions for the dev: Implement positive progression in the form of stat buffs that persists through death.Reduce the difficulty of the game's 3 modes. (More drops, lower boss's damage/hp) "

Posted: February 1, 2015
												I don’t really have anything to preface this with other than I ended up being disappointed. Let’s get going.I – Story [1/10]Ascendant is a roguelike platformer from Hapa Games. The story is as follows: you (the player) assume the role of a demigod who has taken it upon his/herself to invade the realm controlled by your rivals. And that’s all she wrote folks. The premise is decent I suppose, but that premise is all there is.II – UI [10/10]The user interface isn’t bad. Health and mana are clearly displayed in the top left corner of the screen. The minimap is located in the top right and, to be fair, is one of the better minimaps I’ve seen in a game lately. It has multiple view styles and the game cycles through them automatically to best suit your needs. This feature was probably my favorite thing about the game as a whole. The menus were good and I had no trouble navigating around them.III – Gameplay [3/10]Despite the gameplay being rather solid for the most part, Ascendant gets old in a hurry. Puzzle solving, a staple aspect of platformers, is weak and scarcely found. The combat is okay.  You’ll cycle through the same few attack animations by mashing either attack button. One is a direct attack and the other can catapult your enemies across the screen in a direction of your predetermination. The magic ability the player has at their disposal is boring. It only has one function and  that is to shoot a projectile in any direction you want. On top of this, while you can parry enemy attacks, it’ll be a cold day in Hell before you can get the timing down.There is no persistent upgrade system and the game institutes permadeath. You can take this to mean that every time you die (which may or may not be often) you’ll be starting from scratch. While that doesn’t generally bother me in most roguelike games, it started to irk me after a time in this one.Levels and items found in the levels are also randomly generated. When done correctly, this is my favorite thing about any given roguelike game, but it almost felt like that was broken in Ascendant. Levels varied slightly, but enemies became overly familiar (especially finding the same bosses repeatedly life after life) and finding the same items over and over. It was unimpressive to say the least.IV – Content [8/10]Ascendant has a lot of content. Whether you will see it all is iffy, but it is there. There are about 16 different weapons to find/unlock during the course of the game. There were a lot of enemy types, but you may not see many of them. There was even close to 100 other items, which was a decent amount for a game such as this. Also, you had the ability to unlock other characters to play as; reach having their own pros and cons. Although the random generation seems to tamper with the content appearances, I can’t really fault the content itself.V – Visual [9/10]The art of Ascendant was, initially, what grabbed my attention when it came to the game. The graphics are very stylized and unique. It really makes it standout in the genre. The environments can be a bit homely at times, but I was never left wanting with character and enemy designs.VI – Audio [1/10]A final weak link in the chain, the music of Ascendant was very much disappointing. While it does change, it’s very quiet and easily drowned out by the sounds of combat and various other sound effects. It also becomes repetitive very quickly. If you were looking for an aural pleasure, you came to the wrong place.VII – Overall [5.3/10]Overall, I wouldn’t waste my time with this one. I’m glad I got it out of a Humble Bundle and that I didn’t for over the entire price tag.			"

												Ascendant isn't a terrible game... it's just not a very good one. The combat system is fun at its core, and I like the way it gives you slightly more control over your items than some games, but repetition kills it. You're forced to kill the same enemies so many times that it becomes hollow--especially since you can almost always pick them off a few at a time, and 75% of enemies in every room are either flies or normal grunts. And you're forced to replay the same levels over because the difficulty is very high. And there's not enough bosses either, so you'll face the same ones almost every run; nor are the bosses remotely balanced against each other (one of the early bosses you can kill unscratched on your first try, another one is ludicrously difficult even with great items and a full health bar).Production values don't help it--the soundtrack and graphics are both totally forgettable, and you will get bored of the appearance of the early levels very quickly.It's plainly, painfully obvious that this game is trying to be The Binding Of Isaac as a sidescroller. But ultimately, you're better off just replaying Isaac again.			"

												The music and atmosphere are great, and there's a wide variety of items to be had. Unfortunately the controls are floaty and imprecise, and combat often feels unfair when you have almost no time to react to offscreen damage. The game is hard, but unnecessarily so. Gamepad support is very poor. The game decided to disable my controller once a game had already begun, and the escape key only opened and closed the menu, forcing me to alt-f4. Upon deleting the game's settings in the registry, the keys remapped themselves to a sensible layout for reasons unknown.It seems to be on the verge of a very fun and rewarding experience, but the gameplay demands responsive and crisp controls that are sadly absent. This is especially apparent in the challenge rooms that demand precise movement. Games like Valdis Story do it much, much better.			"

												While having strangely appealing visual aesthetics game denies you from its content, it's simply too god damn hard and by hard i mean every game has to be a bloody perfect speedrun without mistakes as health is way too scarce. I don't mind hard, but when it's fun, here instead of fun game forces you to replay same stuff again and again to just die on some ridiculously designed bonus level that is nearly impossible to finish or a boss fight that may take 10+ minutes to finish which will blast you for 3 minutes and then allow you to damage it.Honesly I wouldn't be able to complete this game without cheat ever, even on baby mode. I guess devs should provide some kind of chapters for each character to start with the last state you've finished previous and make even easier mode, but i guess the name will be hard to come by, as what else can be more diminishing than ""baby mode"".Some fun statics:70% people died at least once.38% beaten spring19% beaten summer9% beaten fall4.5% beaten winter (won the game)P.S.

												I'm a big fan of roguelikes, but unfortunately this one falls short. More of an action platformer, this game has a great atmosphere but the combat was a huge let-down. Your moveset is limited to swing sword up or swing sword down and there are essentially no combos or strategy involved at all, only button mashing. The combat also doesn't have a weighty feel to it, you never actually feel like you're doing any damage, just swinging a feather around until the enemy gets tired and goes to sleep.			"

			COMPETITION ENDED! PD recommends Cheap Games here: https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/paradisedecay Many thanks to the Dev's for the Review Copy + 4 Steam Keys to Giveaway!		

It looks fantastic and has a superb graphic style and atmosphere. This is a a fast-paced and unforgiving beat 'em up that challenges you with a new world each time you play. It's action packed and has you taking on all manner of different demi-gods. The game oozes class in all area's and puts a lot of AAA games to shame. - Superb and highly recommended.			"

												No directional attacks when they are obviously required for the boss I'm stuck on - I have to throw enemies at it.Block doesn't work. When you press block and face at an enemy, it will still hit you. There is no real tutorial for either of these two things (even though I doubt there would be anything I already don't know).Right now the game is broken because of this. Would not recommend.			"

I haven't played this game for long enough to give a detailed review, but I've seen enough to know that it's horrible in most aspects. The art style for some of the things in it is pretty good, but the 3D animation doesn't go well with it, and I dislike the design of the enemies as well.2/10			"

												I can't play this.It launches. It runs. I can technically interact with it.The controls are borked beyond belief.It took hundreds of people complaining to get them to even realise that the method of selecting input device (hitting start on the menu screen with that device) is opaque and stupid.They didn't even realise that gamers like to rebind keys.I recently decided that since I was no longer enraged at the thought of this game that I should try it with a controller. One I've used with many other games. A 360-compatible one.Character runs full-tilt into a wall non-stop unless I press and hold left, and will not turn left no matter what.Perhaps this will be usable someday, but if their dev team is as stupid as the one member I spoke with, I have my doubts.

												This game is  the best rougelike there is, in my opinion. It incorporates brawler mechanics that keeps the player engaged and consistantly interested; to me it is stronger then the likes of Binding of Isaac, gameplay wise. The game also succeeds Aesthetically aswell. I was introduced to ancient mythology through picture books and games like Age of Mythology as a kid. These normally carried with them a more classical interpretation of ancient myth that I've grown accustomed to, with mythical creatures portrayed in a more literal sense, and ancient Gods being represented by rennaissance-inspired, realistic portraits.  However Ascendant tackles it's mythology theme in an abstract way that reminds me of Greek Pottery; grande, fantastic tales brought to life with minimal capabilities... and I think it works. The myths of Theseus and Gilgamesh in this game FEEL mythical. Aside from that, the effort that went into this game oozes out of everything. The Mythological refrences are often abstract and exotic; until playing this game I had never heard of Kamohoalii (The Shark God of Hawaii), or even the existence of an Irish pantheon of dieties which is well represented in this game. Even the tooltip descriptions of blessings and characters are poetic and well written. Clearly the developers put alot of time aside to touch up on the little things and make everything about this game worthy of the players time.The only real criticisms I have is that the soundtrack, whilst suiting the visuals most of the time, is repetitive and lacking in variety. Also, the Boss variety is severely lacking. The designs for bosses like The Burrower and The Maw and unique bosses like that are exceptional, but the majority of the bosses are just superstrong versions of regular mobs in the game. Boss rooms being a big part of the game, the lack of variety easily halfs replayability for people who don't have the patience to wait for Son of Grunty's shield to go down for the millionth time. Overall, I think this game, as a first title, is perfect. There isn't anything missing, and what is there is expertly crafted. That, to me, warrants a sequel with funding that allows for the extreme variety this game deserves.			"

												Mythology has always been an interest of mine.  This game gives you simple skill-based combat, platforming which is mostly easy, and the power of gods from around the world.  It has a unique vibrant art style and amazing soundtrack to support the theme of a demigod fighting to become a god.  There are 21 different gods and 3 ways to use each of their powers.  There are also 7 different characters to choose from which all require different play styles.  You unlock the ability to find more blessings, spirits, weapons, and spells as you discover more and defeat more bosses.The only problem I have with this game is a lack of indication as to how to progress in the fight against a certain boss.  I actually had to search the forums for how to make it come out of its shell so I could hit it.Overall, Ascendant is a pretty solid game with a lot of replayability through the blessings and character variety.  I would highly recommend this game to fans of rogue-lites, mythology, and challenging games.			"

												This is a decent roguelike side scroller that feels closer to The Binding of Isaac than Rogue Legacy.  The enemy layout and bosses feel to be more important than the layout of the rooms, along with the ""locked in until you beat everyone"" style of Binding of Isaac.  It feels a bit repetitive since I've only seen a handful of enemy types, but it still feels fun regardless.  I hope with some more playtime that it'll expand (and I expect it to) but even on the initial playthrough, I'm pretty impressed.			"

												Brawler meets The Binding of Isaac in this rogue-light sidescroller. You fight your way through a limited but nicely animated group of enemies while trying to get as perfect through the levels as possible and upgrading your character.Play through the four seasons, which a represented in eight worlds (early/late spring etc.) with a randomly selected boss at the end of each world.The combat itself is fun, you slice yourself in a responsive and fast way while launching enemies against walls, spikes or more enemies after doing enough damage to one, trying to get them into a staggering status.Dodge and reflecting projectiles are further elements that make the combat varied and challenging.With every run you will discover new items, spells and weapons that you can combine in hundreds of ways.If you are into brawlers that and rogue-light games this game is a must have.

												This game is a roguelike with fighting-game style mechanics. it's excecuted absolutely fantastically unlike a lot of other games in its category. However, it's lower indie budget tells. The art style is fairly unique and is rather pleasant, though it doesn't exactly scream AAA quality. The sound effects really ride the line of being kind of stupid, but it gets away with it mostly because of its art style. The music is good, but, y'know, it's not  Mass Effect or anything.Currently the game only has singleplayer and LOCAL multiplayer, but it's a hell of a fun time to play with your friends, or even on your own.

I'm working on beating the game on Baby Mode, and I have to hide my actions from him as I am sure he would see my shameful behavior as beneath men of our standing.

												I love this game.  It's a tease.  I have 24 hours in, just about, yet still am able to find myself killed in the very first boss level here and there. Using breaths, spirits, and weapons in unique combinations are fun experiements, but some builds just seem like sheer luck of the draw.  I like the unique graphics and kills are particularly gratifying (especially impales).  Using one enemy to kill another is a good time.  Some of the bosses are obnoxiously tedious and I have issues with my controller working properly with the game occasionally (which is always fixed with a single restart of the game), but those are my only complaints.

Every new playthrough feels different (at least after the 2 chapters - if you make it that far).The only downer is the controls and i am not talking about the ingame controls! The menu and journal is... ugh... at least confusing and doing its best to prevent you to get an overview or find the ""thing"" you want fast.To those who are like me and don't normaly play games like that... give the ingame controls a try once you get the hang of it the game is really fun ^^ (don't just throw it away after 10 min ... like I did at first )			"

												Still haven't made it past the second area because the boss kicks my♥♥♥♥♥ This is a 2D procedurally-generated platformer with rogue-lite elements. Kill things with maces, swords, magic and all that good stuff. The game looks really nice and each area's theme is based on the seasons of the year. One of the few games I know of that encourages using the bodies of enemies to kill other enemies. Only gripes are the sound assets because it makes the combat feel weaker than it looks and the enemy design/ variety could be better. But then again, I haven't made it past the second area so past that point there could be many more enemies. Overall it's a good game. There's quite a bit to like.			"
