												I started my Defiance experience on the Xbox 360. After putting a considerable amount of time into it, my character had vanished. I contacted Trion support and there was nothing they could do to help me. They insisted they do not save characters on their servers. Which is something I must ask why an MMO does not save character data on the servers.I stopped playing and I moved on. I migrated to PC a few years later and one day decided to pick up defiance again. As you see, I have 160 hours in the game on steam at the time of writing this review. I bought the game long before it went F2P, I also bought one of the DLC expansions. In total I paid the full $60 release price on Xbox, $20 for a steam copy, and $15 for the Expansion that I bought. The rest of the review will show how little their support cares about the customers.Just today, the day of this review, I recieved a notice that I was banned from Defiance. No notice as to why, just a notice telling me I've been banned. So I emailed the support team, asking why I've been banned. They replied with an automated cut and paste statement telling me I've been banned for breaking the terms of service agreement. Still no mention of an actual reason as to why I was banned. Breaking the terms of service is too vague for anyone to understand what went wrong. I reached out this time to an email I recieved on the Defiance forums, which is specifically for people who have been banned and would like to discuss it. (I would like to make a note that in the email with the previously mentioned support team, or in the Defiance launcher, it would be nice to be directed to the ban appeal email address, but both failed to mention it)I emailed this appeal address and the only reply I got was exactly this, ""After reviewing pertinent logs, we have determined that the action taken against your account was correct. We will not be reversing relevant suspensions and/or notes applied to your account."" What exactly are these pertinent logs? Logs of what. What was done on my account to cause this ban? This is still a question I have not gotten answered. They refuse to tell me what went wrong and keep replying with vague answers, which leads me to believe they have no real reason for banning me. Only some far cry of a suspicion. I rarely speak in the chat box unless someone is trying to speak to me. So it cant be something I said.I do not cheat, I don't see a point in this game, especially since it's mostly a PVE game, PVP is nearly dead.I do not use a bot, because that's pointless and literally defeats the purpose of playing the game in the first place.In the end I do not recommend this as Trion has shown me that the customer isn't very important to them, and they aren't willing to do what it takes to keep their players happy, especially considering the fact that Defiance is one of their many games that have a very small and decaying playerbase. They never upgrade the servers despite numerous complaints of serious connectivity issues both durring peak hours and low time as well. All they want it to pocket your money and run. As seen by the fact that they keep pumping out low quality MMOs with a sea of microtransactions. Hoping to milk one game as hard as they can and push out another game that's going to be dead on arrival. They danced around my questions and showed no interest in giving me any substantial details on why I was banned. Furthermore they don't listen to the biggest plea from the community. Fix the connectivity issues. Although it is free, I do recommend staying away from this game.			"

												I love this game but it is difficult to recommend. Here's my longest review ever. First, a description. Defiance is an MMO with a strong single-player plot to get you through quite a few hours. The story is interesting enough and the voice acting is great! This plot acts as an extended introduction to the game world. After that, you will need to find various public happenings (seiges, arkfalls, etc.) in which to help and compete with other players. There are also instances that spawn self-contained worlds. Some of these are PvP, others are cooperative. You also have daily and weekly missions to fulfill. All in all, similar to other MMOs. You get a cool game world and then comes the endless grind. The game is very much a glass half-full thing. First, I love the look, which is post-apocalyptic without being too dark and beige. Enemies are varied and interesting. But over the long haul you get used to them. No further mobs have been introduced. (Not strictly the case, but they are variations on the tried and true.)Your own character is rendered nicely and you can dress up in different outfits, if that's your thing. Though this consists only of changing two articles of clothing. You start the game by choosing one of four classes and one of four main EGO powers, which becomes your special ability. Over time you fill out other passives, actives, and gain all four EGO powers. Then you are just the same as everyone else. Yep, everyone has the same attributes! The classes don't matter either, and races are purely cosmetic... and look similar enough. As do (most) of the costumes. You can spend real cash on stuff that is just a different colour from what you already have. Ho hum.The gunplay is very good. In fact, though I haven't played them all, combat in Defiance is the best of all MMOs. Though it is third-person, it has the feeling of a FPS, which I love. You can get and modify different guns as you go on, though to a large extent there is not much difference between these either. Until you get to end-game, when you can no longer level (increase EGO), the most important thing is the EGO of your gun. Even 100 EGO matters and that's over a scale of 6000. The game is free to play, though you will need to spend money. First, buy all the DLC by way of the Season's Pass. Really, once you discover you actually do want to play, just buy this, or you will be restricted in several annoying ways. Besides, then you get to use swords! (Not an optimal strategy and kind of orphaned, but fun anyway.) Second, you will need more inventory slots, a lot more. Third, you will need more key capacity, or you will not be able to unlock the better random gear boxes. Overall, however, you won't need to spend too much.Several things in Defiance completely suck, the main one being that the number of sucky things has been steadily increasing. So what was a decent and fun game when I started is being squeezed out of existence by Trion. To the point that I will NEVER buy another one of their games. OK, let me list the sucky things.As mentioned, classes and races DO NOT MATTER. This is not an RPG at all. Which is a wasted opportunity. Swords don't matter, they are just fun for a while. Vehicles don't really matter, since they are almost all the same. A lot of guns, likewise. Certain in-game currencies that you can get free by playing are practically useless -- you will soon have millions of clams you cannot use on anything. However, the one useful currency, used to upgrade guns (arkforge) has become rare as hen's teeth, almost impossible to grind, so you need to buy it with cash money. At insanely exhorbitant rates. Or not get cool upgraded guns.A new fun and highly challenging end-game mode called Expeditions was recently added. But to play you need to spend a brand new currency that you get only in trickles and cannot earn. So you must buy these Hunter Requisitions with cash money. Or not play. It seems that Trion is now gradually introducing features people have asked for for years, like private instances. But you must spend HR to play these! PvP sucks and is highly biased towards the higher tier players. But it is a REQUIREMENT to play PvP to build your character to the maximum cap. Some of the other necessary achievements are worse than grinding, since they rely on luck repeated over and over. Or stupid actions no-one would ever want to do. Duels. Turret kills. Driving a big truck. Say no more. Doing well in an event and getting high on the leaderboard gets you nothing. Loot is not tied to doing well. Someone might spend 15 minutes grinding and get crap, while someone else who camps and shoots a mob ONCE will get a legendary. I have no idea who thought that was a good idea, but it is an integral part of the game. Really, Defiance is one big gamble and does not reward intelligence or skill.And now we have a new rarity (Supreme) that guns can be upgraded to.... by gambling on success, paying arkforge, bought with real money. Unbelievable.Defiance could have been so much more. It could have been Godlike!! But stupid punitive decisions on the part of Trion have ruined it. Nonetheless, it's still the MMO with the best combat system, so I play it. It's a shame that someone else can't take the exact same engine and build a good game on it.			"

												Bought this game on release, played it a bit, and then stopped to wait for it to develope a bit more before fully getting into the content. I recently tried getting back into it and what do you know, now it's a f2p. Not only that, but they want me to fork out extensive amounts of money in dlc to get the most out of a game that i paid for and supported in its earlier stages. This is extremely bad form and such a huge dissappointment... Won't ever buy from this team again			"

												It’s with a sad heart that I have to say this, but Defiance is slowly becoming a husk of it's former self. The game shows great potential and holds on to it for quite some time, but the final area and it's related missions seem to come across as a charred end, leaving a sour aftertaste. And while the end-game (Arkfalls and Sieges) does provide some moderate fun, the DLC remains a disappointment. In fact, I'll do you one worse, the Incursions event that came with the 7th Legion DLC actively bugs out Arkfalls, crippling both it and itself.There are goods and bads, but I figure I'll narrate them Chronologically.On a technical level,  Defiance does bring a few interesting things to the table. To put it bluntly, you can get a Borderlands vibe when relating to weapons and related ordinance. I do mean the first  Borderlands though, as the second one has a much wider and insaner variety of weaponry with far-reaching and different effects and methods. Defiance's guns tend to stick somewhat close to their Archetype, even between brands.Gun 'brands' generally differ in how the gun fires in a typical fashion. One does full automatic, some burst, some semi.You have the odd-one out, such as LMG's of one brand becoming an energy bolt launcher, and some shotguns double as spamming versions of Grenade launchers. The variety is interesting, but nothing that goes 'outside the box'.Shields are your typical run of the mill type with exchanged stats between size, recharge delay, recharge speed and the occasional situational buff.But what really stands out is how the level of these items is less significant than their rarity. Again, comparing to Borderlands, guns would become nigh-on useless if they were underleveled by 10 or 20 levels, unless they were exceptionally good.In Defiance, all the stats of the guns remain the same. Instead, with every grade of rarity, a random bonus gets applied. And with levelling comes increased chances of item rarity, as well as the more interesting brands. The early (Orange colored) Legendaries are often less interesting or bland guns.This keeps a level of equality amongst all the levels of players, allowing for a somewhat balanced PvP system. Progress and effort give you an edge, but not a great advantage.On top of that, you also have your EGO device, which you can use to make use of one of four ‘skills’ at a time. They are Decoy, Overcharge, Cloak and Blur and are very much doing what their name suggests. Accompanying it is an EGO grid of passive skills that either tie in with the skills or another context, such as getting hit or killing under a certain condition. While they are moderately interesting, there are no passives that truly stand out as ultimately useful or powerful. In fact, I would say they feel very underpowered.Storywise, it starts out cheeky and a little cliche, maybe even cheesy. But it remains bearable and even funny at times. The voice-in-your-head EGO device acts quirky and in general seems to be your spokesperson (your character plays the mute act) and moral guidance.And yes, the latter does imply that your character rarely seems to give the impression he/she has a mind of their own. Simply following orders whenever given, by anyone relevant.But the story starts to truly derail when you arrive in the final area and separated island called San Francisco. I say this to many people: Defiance is a great game until you get to San Fran.There is where things turn for the worst. The frontier before looks luscious and vibrant with all sorts of strange plants adorning the scenery. But in the final area, the ground is scorched and bland. On top of that, the side missions get even more befitting of a stupid henchman that the cutscenes imply only too much, being given in general by the single-most uninteresting character the game could provide: Eren Niden. Her same-tone voice and apathic nature really makes you feel like you’re the lackey providing the footwork for way more important people.The only upside, the Minigun challenge takes place there, which has you mowing down hundreds of Dark Matter. (which also happens to be the most uninteresting and annoying enemy faction you can imagine)Chronologically, this means the DLC ‘comes after’. And it does start out promising.The Castithan pack comes with five arena’s holding the same enemies you’ve been blowing up the entire time, with a narration that would have been acceptable without the intercom-echo effect it has while responding to your performance. The ultimate reward is access to laser swords, which in practical gameplay has too many drawbacks to be relevant/useful unless you dedicate a whole build to it.While I have certainly had better DLC, this pack does provide everything it promised.The second DLC, Arkbreaker, shows the descent of quality. People with the DLC can call down their own personal Arkfall and conquer it for new weaponry that functions quite different than the ones otherwise available. However, major arkfalls come with a Warmaster that requires defeating. And this is where it gets a little iffy.The Warmaster is nigh impossible to defeat (you are only given 6 minutes and it’s really a true bullet sponge) and requires either a big dedicated Guild to join in or a group of people with perfectly worked out DPS to defeat it.Unlike anything else in the game, this particular boss does not scale with the amount of present players, and has taken the wrong side of the spectrum in terms of compensating for this.Despite that, it looked new and was at least a little bit interesting. But the latest DLC, the 7th Legion...So far, 10 euro’s had yielded some content that was fun for at least a little bit. Even in it’s improper state, it was a new situation that was fun to adapt to.The 7th Legion DLC however brings no new content. Incursions are a series of random mini events you normally run into while driving by, put in a series dedicated to one specific enemy, and ends in a typical Siege of which you’ve done a thousand. In fact, they take place in the very location the regular sieges take place.The ‘new’ guns are simply reskins of the old ones with slightly improved stats, such as reload speed or clip size, with two new armors that has several versions with changed colors, and a hat. In fact, the ‘katana’ functions and even sounds the same as the Castithan Pack laser sword (humm included) but with there being no Legendary rarity available. So they’re inferior in power from the get-go.As said, the Incursions themselves are bugged, often overlapping with an Arkfall, causing it to cripple both until either time out (and in general these random events have 20-30 minute timers) so you can imagine seeing a server full of annoyed people.Now imagine you having to do at least 10 of these, in order to get enough ‘7th Legion reputation credits’ in order to purchase the cheapest item found in their vendor, which is a mod pack that synergises only with it’s own useless effect. To get outfits, you’ll have to grind 20 of these for the Loot Chest and hope to your Gods that it will randomly include the items that you want.And that’s it. There’s no new story, nothing truly new, even the new meshes used for this update are anything but impressive.So, if the DLC is anything to go by, Defiance is heading in the wrong direction. The 7th Legion is a shameless cash-in and I really wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that the confirmation of Season 2 is still up in the air.In conclusion: This game is dying a slow and painful death. It will take all the money it can get before several internet media will officially declare this game dead.Buy it for the price of a subway sandwich, or not at all. And forget about the DLC, even the Season Pass.Bottom note:Many still recommend this game. But compare their Game time with mine.I've turned this puppy inside out. You make the call.			"

												In short, now that it is F2P it's totally worth at least trying.If you like it, then drop a few bucks to upgrade your account. It's still a solid game and you will most likely enjoy it for what it is.Don't worry about the DLC packs right away.It also uses Rifts F2P model where all major content updates (from here on out) doesn't cost anything, and the store is more vanity/utility. The first seasons DLC still costs money though.It's not the best looking PC game though. Runs easily though because of that.While I experienced bugs at the start, I rarely come across them now.Since the game has come back on Steam as F2P, the servers have basically blown up. I have constant connection issues, but the game is free so still try it out. lolThe connection issues may anger some people though.In terms of graphics, it's fine. Clearly the fact that it was also made for incredibly outdated hardware on the consoles PS3 and 360 didn't help at all.It seems up in the air if the PC version will ever get a graphical upgrade, even just HD textures, so don't expect a pretty game by today's standards.SweetFX helps a lot.For gameplay I think it's actually really good. Looking at PvE it reminds me of Tabula Rasa which I miss SO much, and other third person MMOs like Global Agenda, there hasn't really been an MMO third person shooter with a big persistent world like this since Tabula Rasa.Games like Destiny, Borderlands and others don't have that. So if you like overworlds, that's a plus on this game vs the others.This being pretty much the only one out like that, if you liked the two MMOs I mentioned, you'll like this.It's also similar to Borderlands in terms of getting a constant stream of weapons and how the shooting mechanics work, but Borderlands isn't really an MMO so the similarities end there.The tie-in with the show is superficial at best right now. Season 2 seems to be the same as well, though the new Silicon Valley content links storyline, oddly enough, from the defiancefew.com website The shooting mechanics are good, the powers are good, though more variety of abilities would be nice in the future.You gain ""levels"" by increasing your EGO rating through achievement-like objectives and just getting ""levels"". Due to DLC5 making weapon damage scale to EGO rating now, it's a lot more traditional than it was. However, you can still do all content regardless of EGO rated, and you do get boosted if the difficulty level is higher than you can naturally handle.There is a decent variety of things to do now, with arkfalls, sieges, side quests, story quests, and emergencies.The driving is fun. Just going around the world jumping around on your vehicle, running over enemies can be enjoyable. I really hate the races though, the mechanics are horrible when confined in races.I think the storyline is good, not great, though the cliffhanger is a bit lame.The games chat works more or less like a traditional chat in an MMO now.However, this game also has a pathetically low amount of social interaction compared to other MMOs.No AH or mail system either.For PvP howerver, I would look elsewhere.It's been my stance that any MMO with a PvE overworld and instanced PvP will just never have good PvP. It's impossible to balance, and never will be.If they had just stuck with Shadow Wars (which is fun) and open world PvP, it would've been a lot better, but since it has instanced PvP, there's better games. TF2 is one I can think of off the top of my head and it's free.There is an in-game shop. Most of the stuff is vanity. Overpriced vanity at that.Also in the shop is lock-boxes that can get you weapons and mods, but you don't really need to buy them with cash (they are REALLY overpriced anyways, like $5 a box). You can also get most of the lockboxes in-game with the games currency.There's bag space, I suppose that might be needed for some, but it's not pay to win.However I think the biggest selling point is it's F2P. It's hard not to recommend at least trying it at that price. Especially with no monthly fee and nothing from the overpriced in-game shop item being ""necessary"", you can definitely get your moneys worth, and it's also easy to go back to if you stop playing for a long period of time.I can't really recommend the DLC Season Pass (unless it's on sale for $20, then get it) or packs though, unless you really enjoy the game and want to throw a bit more money at the developer.Not because I think the DLC is bad per say, but that I'm not a fan of the season pass system in this industry.DLC1 Review: DLC1 includes a small quest chain and 5 arenas, in which you go instead and basically just shoot a bunch of mobs for gear and rep.The reputation vendors sells a series of ""charge"" weapons, which are weapons you hold the shot button to charge up, and an energy sword which are basically lightsabers.You can also co-op the arenas now, so if you like doing instances with friends, it might be worth it.DLC2 Review: is far superior to DLC1. The arkbreaks you can call down are pretty fun to do, and there's always people doing them (though recently, it's died down a little due to loot reward issues). Even if you don't own the DLC, which would prohibit you from using the new weapons, it's still a good update.You also get daily/weekly rewards which includes money, resources and a ""battery"" that you use to call down the arkbreak arkfalls.There's also a small quest chain that explains the new stims and boost systems, as well as a small story quest that gets into the arkbreak system.It also lets you equip all the new weapons that drop within arkbreaks. Non-DLC owners can't use them.I'd say DLC2 is worth buying.DLC3 Review: Pass.What you receive for owning this is a samurai outfit, two new blue weapons (a sniper and shotgun) and a title.You also get access to a new vendor and daily/weekly contracts for a new faction.That's it. There's no quests and everything else with the update you can get for free.It's the worst DLC of the five, so you really aren't missing much if you don't get it.The incursion event weapons are tied to this DLC FYI.DLC4: I think it was pretty good. There's no new faction but a new lockbox tied to an already existing reputation.There's a bunch of new story missions which I find good enough, considering how starved this game is for new story.There's 9 new arenas, which can be done co-op, which are okay. I can see them being fun, but I personally don't care for themOwning the DLC gets you access to the new quests, one of the new lockboxes and a title. I think this is slightly better than DLC2, so it is the best so far.DLC5: Get it if you want some Arkforge for altering gear. You get 1k and some other stuff, so worth it if you want that.With the F2P transition, some of the new TV/Game tie-in missions have had the voice actors for the some of the NPCs change. It's by no means horrible, but you will notice and it is pretty jarring, though the updates are free so I can't complain that much.In terms of how the store works, it's basically the same as it was when it was B2P. The game takes Rifts model as opposed to say LOTRO or Secret World where content updates cost money. All Defiance content updates will be free.There is, what I find funny, a ""subscription"" option now in the shop. Which gives you various passive boosts to things like XP/Skill etc, as well as a 10% discount in the store.I find it funny because the game was B2P with no sub option prior to F2P. It's the first F2P transition I'm aware of where a sub option gets added to the game.Is the patron status worth it? That's up to you. Like Rift, it's nice but nowhere near being a ""necessity""			"

												It's great until you get to Alcatraz, then it's just a money churning machine. I can't give a thumbs up to anything that does this. The DLC adds very little in the way of story as well. Also, get ready for long drawn out periods where you don't get access to your controls due to knock back and stun attacks. I don't know if that is as annoying to you as it is me, but there will be many, many cheap deaths. I have to say I really like it in a lot of ways, thus all the hours played but everything is crazy expensive and certain aspects are just completely intolerable. It's worth a try, but don't buy the DLC right away because you might find that there isn't anything in it worthwhile like I did. In short, it is okay but it has a lot of bugs that need to be smoothed out and it isn't for everybody.			"

												I played this game for a fair bit some time ago. Eventually it just wore me down with repetitive, uninteresting quests that dragged out way too long. It just doesn't know when to stop spawning in yet another wave of identical trash mobs for the quests. I could maybe live with killing a couple waves of baddies, maybe disable a couple turrets, maybe another few baddies show up, and that was that. But no. The game won't be satisfied until you've killed 100 or 200 identical raiders or hellbugs for that one quest. I just don't feel like some badass space cowboy Ark Hunter.. I feel like an overworked janitor being told yet another kid puked in the halls and I have to go clean it up. I suppose some of these quests are meant to be approached as a world co-op event, but it doesn't account for there only being one player in the area. It just keeps throwing trash mobs at you. And given that as I write this there are only 574 players in-game, you might want to get used to being one of the (very) few players around.Also I just tried playing it again today to decide whether I'd keep it installed on my library or not, and I was having absolutely horrible texture pop in issues, or it might be more accurate to say whole-buildings-right-next-to-me pop in issues. Massive objects in the world would just flicker in-and-out of existance. (Running on a GTX 970)And I was just asked to kill a few too many of the Infinite Raider Clone Army. So my final verdict is that no, I will not be keeping this game installed. Here's to 15GB of free space in my hard drive. As to whether I would recommend it? Well.. the game is free, and it did kill a few hours for me. So it's hard to say no, although I don't really think it's a particularly good game. If you've got nothing better to do and don't mind a decently large download.. check it out I guess. But tbh you can probably find something better. I wish there was a shrug icon next to the thumbs up or down, but if I'm pressed for a yay or nay.. I vote nay.			"

												I cannot recommend this game in good conscience to anyone. There are broken promises abound, incredibly poor quality updates, and a fundamental lack of understanding at both developer and management level about the game. Between cheating in PvP not being addressed, the shallow content updates, delayed update schedule, and fumblings of even the most basic systems... the game just does not have much going for it.I have hundreds of hours logged into the game because of the old PvP community that has since disappeared. The final straw for me was when 100% damage mitigation was declared a legitimate tactic by the development team, even though it was abusing a very obscure game bug to achieve it.Some other issues with the game, as I perceive them:PvE Content: Overall you are looking at maybe 10-20 hours of story quests, maybe 5-10 hours of races and challenges, and perhaps 5-10 hours of instances.* The main story isn't too bad - mostly your standard MMOG quests. There's some interesting ones here and there, but overall it's an average experience. The final boss fight was actually mildly engaging, but that's probably the only difficulty people will ever face with the game.* Instanced dungeons were fun, but the game encourages repetitious grinding of them. This leads to the limited amount of them becoming stale in short order.* Challenges can be fun, they're probably one of the more enjoyable pieces of content in the game.PvP Content: Used to be okay, now completely intolerable. Due to a damage resistance bug, specific players have an unfair advantage the developers have said they are unwilling to stop. Therefore, players are not on even footing.* PvP queues were altered to allow Shadow Wars (""open world"" PvP) to start faster. This had the consequence of making the instanced PvP maps completely dead, they do not start anymore.* Shadow Wars take place in the open world, which was not designed for PvP. There's a serious lack of cover, dull terrain and paths, poor objective spacing, and are just overwhelmingly disappointing.* The first DLC update came with a new PvP map, which has serious graphical glitches (lighting breaks and makes your screen black), invisible walls that look passable, and a few other issues. Since that map never has enough people in queue, it was never fixed.Updates: Overall very slow to come out due to console restrictions, and sparse on fixes or changes. DLC is slow, vaguely outlined, and often fails to deliver your money's worth in content.* The ""Season Pass"" was supposed to be a one-year, 5 DLC package. As of the time of this review (November 25), only one has been released since April. There is no way all five will come out in a year's time.* The only DLC released was abysmally poor in both quality and quantity. The paid update was supposed to be a multiplayer horde-style arena, but was turned into a 5-wave single player instance. The leaderboards are bugged and constantly reset, making competition pointless. A truck with a mounted turret was scrapped due to technical limitations.* There's a fundamental lack of understanding of how the game works at the developer level. Patches often come in that do not address player concerns, but do the complete opposite of what is requested.* Weapons like the FRC SAW were nerfed due to AI not pressuring players enough, making them the leading weapon for PvE content completion. They were marginal in PvP, and became useless post-patch.Verdict: The game has a great third person shooter mechanics, and that's about all it has going for it. Content is sparse and shallow, with updates not adding enough to sustain interest. Developers seem disinterested and not engaged with what the community wants, which leads to very poor content updates. The PvP is no longer competitive, due to the bugs being abused and general lack of care on the studio's part.I would not recommend purchasing Defiance. If you do decide to buy it against this advice, then I would highly recommend avoiding the Season Pass.If you have any questions about my experience with the game, my review, or anything related, please feel free to leave a comment. I'm happy to discuss anything at all.			"

												I played for 97 minutes, total, in one night. The ego system is neat, and the ""mini instances"" are kind of cool, where you team up with other players to finish quests. I got an email the next morning saying that I was banned ""due to a violation of our Terms of Use, Code of Conduct, Privacy Policy, or End User License Agreement"". I sent the appeal email and never heard back from Trion Worlds Support. I didn't cheat, exploit, or do anything to get punished, but I was banned, sent a vague automated email, then forgotten.If you manage not to get banned for absolutely no reason, the game is passable.

												I rate this game 8/10.  Even though the game has been riddled with lag, bug, and balance issues, it's still a fun ride.  This game opened me up to Third Person shooters and now I'm always looking for the next one to check out.  The open world may not be as big as some traditional MMO's but it's pretty huge and there is a LOT to do.  It looks great, the combat feels solid, and the variety of weapon choices make it easy to jump in and start playing.  One issue that I've had with this game are the balance between vastly different leveled players fighting in close proximity, they have a system to balance things out, but it never seemed to work too well, leaving the lower level player (who may be in the middle of a story mission) running for his/her life instead of fighting on a level playing field.  The other issue is endgame content.  The game truly is classless, the class you choose lasts you a good hour at most, then everyone can do everything as they level, but once you max out your skill grid and finish the majority of your persuits, there's not much else to do.  There's really only one tough endgame boss, the Volge Warmaster, and the developers have such a problem figuring out how hard he should be programmed to be that sometimes he's almost completely unkillable, sometimes he's a joke.Complaints aside, I enjoyed the story.  I enjoy the combat and the ability to just run out there and kill things.  The random events that pop up on the map and the co-op missions are fun enough to keep you playing... And the game really does look and sound great.  Definitely recommended even amidst it's faults.			"

												Defiance feels like the ultimate tourist MMO.   It starts out with seeing the show on TV with the built in commercials.  ""Hey, that place looks shiny and neat!  Looks fun, we should visit!""  Then you buy your tickets, take the flight and arrive.  You wander gawking at everything with wide innocent eyes, having zero clue what the hell is going on, but man it looks cool!  After a while, you get tired of sightseeing, so you suck it up and decide to dip your toe into the pool, test the waters.  You grab what looks like a quest, studying the map for a minute, make a vague guess as to where you're supposed to go.  You hope on your rented ATV and head out across the country side. As you're riding, you run into what you think are locals.  They're mean and grumpy; they call you names and are zero help.  You put up with the angry locals for a day or two as you try and find your way around.  Eventually, you *think* you have a general idea of how the quest system works; you how know how to get to one or two key locations in town.  You know how to avoid the dangerous locals; you stick to the mildly annoying ones.  How you're having some fun getting into minor fire fights, picking up bits and pieces of armor and weapons as souvenirs.  You're amused, you're satisfied. Next thing you know, a week has passed.  You're bored with going back and forth to town and the sections you're familiar with.  Branching out to new areas feels like too much work.  It's been a week; you've had your fun.  Vacations over, time to go home. You uninstall, move on to the next game and tell your friends, ""eh, that games was all right for $5"", and now you feel more connected to Julie Benz every week when you watch the show because ""You've been there"". And that's all right!   "

												Was an amazingly promising MMO not to mention an MMO that intertwined itself with a major TV show. I was in the first beta, played literally the entire weekend start to finish and eventually got an Alpha invite. To this day I can still play on the Alpha servers if I so choose because they left them up for DLC testing. It was awesome for TRION to allow that deep community interaction because it helped me feel like I was a part of the growing process for the game. I watched and played as it grew and it was growing into something amazing.The game hit and I no-lifed the hell out of it. Drilling through all side-quests, main missions and getting some of the best gear. I dropped $180+ on this game because I saw how awesome it was becoming. I finished the story and just sat there like oh... What next? I tried the PvP and that was fun to an extent. A little different than Alpha but still very much the same. I ran around doing ArkFalls and as many side-quests as I could. Still not much to enjoy. By the end of the first season of the show, I had totally forgot about the IP. I stopped playing and stopped caring.I see an ad for Defiance a year later talking about the show coming back for season 2. I was like hey I wonder what the game looks like now with all the DLC. I join in and I'm granted a ♥♥♥♥♥on of bonus items. Like cool, sweet, what about missions? I get a couple mission objectives and I play through some all to find it's just complete rehashings of♥♥♥♥♥♥I played a year ago. There's almost nobody around to play with and ArkFalls are incredibly boring and repetetive.At this point, this game is nothing I can reccomend. I mean sure, jump in for a bit if you know nothing about the series and play for a solid 10 hours and you'll have a blast I'm sure. But once you get about half-way through, everything becomes so bland and nothing starts to feel fun anymore. I'm surprised this game is even getting support really. Just, if you want to, download the client and run around for a bit. Just don't buy anything for it at all. An absolute waste of money.			"

												This game turned from a fun game at the original launch of free to play on steam where i would have given the game a huge thumbs up..., to massive grind and (huge-pay-for-convenience-allignment) after the silicon valley patch..... and after this point, i can not in good faith give this game anything but a thumbs down.Lockboxes price increase incredibly and what you previously pre-silicon-valley patch earned for events/missions/general rewards was reduced by around 80%.To add to this the stability of the game is terrible with lag and disconnects is a very common problem.When you get to 4-5k level your orange weapons need a lot of arkforge to upgrade and you simply can not earn enough through normal playing in any reasonable amount of playing for 1 weapon let alone the mulitple you need for different combat scenarios.  You can of course buy arkforge from the shop though..... (which is really expensive IMHO)Another side note which is purely something that irked me, the time trials are required for advancing to the top levels, if you are not REALLY good at racing games, then you will not get a lot of pursuit points due to the requirements in the persuits for leveling.Conclusion if you wanna have a shoot around for a bit and are not interested in getting far, its fun and i would suggest this as something fun to do.... HOWEVER... if you wanna play seriously and get up to the high levels, you need a LOT of time for grind or a LOT of money for convenience . "

												A great game until your reach the point of the experience cap, not the level cap. This means that until you reach the experience cap you can play the game as you like and enjoy the game on your terms. You can use the weapons you like and play the events in game that you enjoy. Once you hit the experience cap however the game turns into a major boring grind. In order to advance yourself to the level cap you will be required to complete pursuits (specific goals in order to obtain part of a level). This quickly becomes monotonous as you no longer are playing the game on your terms, you are not doing things you enjoy as you already completed all the pursuits from the things you enjoyed on your way to the experience cap.In my opinion this is a terrible game design. Players should not be forced to do races, pvp, hunt for data recorders etc... to advance their progression if that's not what excited them to play the game to begin with. If you are someone who does not like pvp why should you be forced to do pvp events just so you can reach the level cap? If you are a pvp lover why would you want to spend weeks running around looking for data recorders just so your character can progress?To summarize, this game is wonderful while you are able to play it how you like and progress your character doing things you enjoy. once you have reached the experience cap it quickly becomes a chore and monotonous to a large degree as the grind to reach the level cap is made up of tasks you avoided along the way. I cannot recommend the game to people as I believe that games should be fun from beginning to end, not just the first half.			"

												I've put a lot of money and time into this MMO.  I fear more so than any before it, and that includes World of WarCraft and Star Wars Galaxies.  If it were still as active as it was when the first season of the corresponding television show that shares it's name aired, I'd recommend it to anyone.  But the truth is that it's not.  It has too few people to consistently do anything in the game that you cannot do in a single-player game, and ultimately it will eventually get too boring and repetative for even the most loyal players.  The television show was great and I wish it wasn't cancelled, but now that it is no longer running and Trion Worlds owns the game, it feels even abandoned by its developers for the most part.  At this time, I can't recommend this MMO.			"

												Bought the game when it wasn't F2P, it was great. Nowadays, we are still experiencing bugs from the beginnings, new bugs will be introduced with every patch. No wonder if we consider that the original developers has been fired.New playable content hasn't been released since years unless we are talking about in-game purchases of re-skinned weapons and RNG lockboxes. During the 3rd anniversary they mixed up lockboxes, everyone has received premium paid lockboxes - an impressive proof of the very low chances to get anything good for your money. Don't even think to waste your money for chances at 0.00001% and below - Trion wins.Discussing at the forums is pure waste of time. You are not allowed to discuss, leaving criticism thoughts - you will get into trouble for so many strange far-fetched reasons. Their meaning of 'unproductive posts' and 'posts with trolling purpose' differs continuously. They want to create a healthy community, yet they judge with changing conditions from user to user, if you are new, not having thousands of posts, you better don't even try to participate. Trion may insists that's not the case but in fact it is otherwise its done due to racism. Defiance Forums - Where the toxicity belongs to moderators and admins.Lastly, the servers are unstable, expect daily disconnects and hard-freezes especially on consoles but also on pc. Considering all points including the forums toxicity by moderators/admins, we don't have to wonder about the ghost towns across all platforms.#starttolerance			"

												The game had a very rough launch with bugs, Hence the low rating for the game by Meta. But those bugs are all but squashed now and the game is really solid. It's like a mix of swtor, and borderlands 2. The way the area's are created has a Swtor feel, and your running around shootings things much like Borderlands, or so I hear. (I never actually played either Borderlands, but that's how people are describing it). With only a few hours of game-play in it, I'm already getting my 10$ worth out of it easy, and the game story will draw you in. The characters personalities seem pretty solid as well, you'll hate them, love them, and get annoyed by the ones your supposed too. Ontop of that, the customization for your character is pretty legit as well, not only being able to choose which weapon and side arm you want, (which is no limitations, you could go sniper rifle/Assault Weapon Sniper Rifle/Bazooka, Pistol/Energy Gun, or even Shotgun/Shotgun) No limitations in mix and matching weapons. Just like Swtor you can break down your weapons as well for parts and income, or add accessories and mods to them which will boost their ability, as well as change your characters headgear, and outfit to mix and match. Definetly worth the 10$ easy.Cons: The few Con's I found are not huge, but could be a turn off for some players. 1) The starting area's at least are pretty empty. To me this actually enhances the feel of it being a wasteland. If there were 100's of people running around, wouldn't feel like that, so to me this is actually a plus, but for others may be a turn off. There is a helpful automatic party finder however, which helps to get groups. 2) The Chat system is totally implimented bad. You can never see what anyone is saying around you or in the area. To see it, you have to stop what your doing and press Enter. Which then a Chat screen the size of the entire screen pops up. Which only then can you respond. Terrible chat system for an action game, because half way through responding to what your friend just said your getting shot at, and need to stop. However if you use VOIP to talk with friends, again, the chat system is of no concern for you really.			"

												When Defiance released, I had a look at some videos on Youtube including Angry Joes Review and thought, ""another MMO ready for FTP in 12 months"".On the bright side I was right, Im now playing it because it is now FTP as predicted. I have not watched the TV show because it looks pretty lame, but if its as good as the game, I might eat my words twice. Because this game is FUN!!I have played over 45 hours in about 7 days since installing it. Its just a blast, you can ride a quad bike off a cliff, land on enemies and get kill points, barrel roll off the quad and start shooting while your still rolling. Its crazy, its brash, its got so many explosions your ears hurt and I LOVE IT!It reminds me a great deal of City of Heroes. I played about 18 months of CoH when it released. I played a normal gun toter just to be different and my game experience in CoH was pretty similar to Definace. The graphics are cartoonish but appropriate, they represent the world in a way that is suitable for the type of game and the way the action plays out. Sounds are good, the music is ok but can get repetetive.The range of guns and weapons is pretty staggeering and when you consider most guns have 4 modification slots and improvements to gain through mastering them, there is a massive amount of customisation. You can get a grenade launcher and give it rapid fire, incendiary and low recoil for example, its like a tennis ball shooter using fire grenades, its just MAD. There are assault rifles, pistols, auto and bolt sniper rifles etc etc etc, they all feel differrent and change appearance, feel and sound when you mod them.Missions are easy to find and plentiful. So far the best gear I have got has come from solo missions which provides incentive to keep doing them. The story line is acceptable and even good for an MMO.The community is happy, helpful and firendly. Coop missions are available but can be hard to get going because the open world play is so much fun and so varied, people just dont seem to play the zone missions much. PVP is optional and easy to join in. But keep in mind the game has been going 12 months so you can run into some badass hombres. I was shooting one guy in the head point blank as he lay on the ground sniping and he basically ignored me for the first 4 shots lol, then got up and one shotted me.... but thats the life of a noob right?The most fun I have had so far has been from the random events that happen a few times a day. Players seem to rush from all over to join in and even at low levels you can do some damage and get some good rewards while fighting massive exciting enemies in crazy open world combat.I am pretty impressed with Definace and I think like many MMOs it let itself down by releasing 6 months too early. If the product I am playing was the one that hit the market, Im sure it would have scored better.On the down side, lag can be chronic at times, but daily server re-boots fix it, so its often a matter of timing as to how much lag you suffer. You hear lots of people complaining about it on chat so I know its not just me. Server reboots seem to be around 7pm AEST but can vary.I recommend you give this one a go, I will be playing it for some time I reckon. Its nice to see a game that remembers games are meant to be fun.			"

												I have a lot of positive things to say about this game, but if you don't wanna read all that, I'll tell you my reason for not recommending it up front: this game gets stale fast.It's obvious a lot of hard work went into this game. The story is solid and the voice acting is top notch, which it should be seeing as how it's based off a TV show. The game starts off great - lots of side missions, a large variety of enemies, weapons and gear, a good perk system that makes you want to level your character... but I'm 60 hours in and I feel like I've hit a plateau. I feel like I've experienced everything this game has to offer, and now it's a matter of grinding my character for better (not different, just better) gear, so I can fight harder (not different, just harder) enemies and so on. I've fought every kind of enemy in the game a hundred times, found every kind of gun, done every kind of mission and there's just nothing new to discover. A lot of people seem to disagree with me, as there are tons of very high level players in this game, but I've just lost interest and am not entertained by this game anymore.For a F2P game, 60 hours of gameplay isn't bad. But MMO's are meant to be played long-term, with hundreds and perhaps thousands of hours of gameplay, but this one just petres out after a short while. It's free, so if you want to try it out there's no harm, and maybe you'll end up liking it a lot more than me. But I don't plan on reinstalling it.			"

Posted: August 19, 2014
												- I'll start from one of important mistakes I see in Defiance game Reviews - ""Similar to"". Game is not Similar to any other game in same genre, but it can remind many games you see before - Borderlands, Saints Row, BF, WH 40k atc... Also game is not standard and stamped MMORPG, don't wait Elves or Orcs here, it's Post Apocalyptic Earth, where is chaos and destruction.- Now will say about its gameplay - as I say game have nothing from standard RPG-TPSs, you don't have Classes here and not stuck to specific gameplay, shortly game isn't forcing you to play stumped class with stamped weapon, you are absolutely free in how, why and where to do, you can use any weapon, skill, so you are building your own gameplay, what is also very important and good for me, you are free to go and do what ever you want in Defiance world, also world is living its life and aggressively opposed against you, you have too many ways to progress your character and gameplay, sometimes it's confusing, but if you understand Defiance World it will become fun and easy.- Game is very specific in many ways, many things here are not explained from the beginning and new players can easily lost in Defiance world, but don't afraid, here is impossible to destroy gameplay, just do story and main quests and many things will become understandable for you. Defiance have very active and fun PvE and PvP content, in PvE you can move as solo same with friends and clan, on low levels much easier to do missions in solo because as more players are in same zone then harder is to kill enemies there for low levels, but moving in group will increase loot and fun, PvP content is very interesting, but feels unfinished yet, also DLC content makes it little unbalanced, if you are good TPS player you may not feel this,but if you are not ""Pro"" then you feel pain sometimes, especially on low, mid levels, DLCs give quite good shields, weapons and perks that in PvP are not OP, but gives not bad advantage to its owners in 1vs1 battles, but all battles are more massive than solo, also PvP here got many tactical nuances (they feel unfinished, but not bad for PvE oriented game), so it's not so big problem. It's not P2W, but with DLCs you will feel more comfortable with them more than without, but game is PvE oriented, so PvP here is like in many other PvE games, but quite fun as I say before.(*I used word ""level"" cos it's more understandable for new players, here is no level system, Defiance have progressing system called EGO Rating, which can remind leveling one, but is quite different thing)- Bad things I found here are : 1. side DRM and not best protected for now. 2. Game is forcing much to purchase Packs and DLCs what is quite bad thing for F2P games especially when game have no economical part at all, you can trade but it's useless here, its more forcing you to buy things you need, more then things you like to buy, in many F2P games you can purchase things in Cash and sell them to other players, so if some one didn't spend money, but spend time to farm he can help you to force your farm in exchange for the things you purchased for cash, so you get things you were interested in and he gets thing he was interested in. Or Cash exchanging system with other players which is becoming more and more popular nowadays and brings much more balance and fairness in game economy and gameplay, but trading with players is useless here, cos they can't use any content they didn't pay for and many of purchased things are untradeable, many games nowadays giving trading system when F2P players are working on PP players, what is way comfortable as for players who spend money same for players who didn't or can't and server got as money same massive amount of players what is very important for MMO games and makes them much more fun and interesting (game can't MMO ""Massive Multiplayer Online"" when it don't have mass), but for now Defiance don't have any kind of economical part and because of this game probably will lose massive amount of players on EGO Rating 5000-5400+ in ""endgame"". 3. You can't use Steam wallet to purchase in game items, content. 4. Still have bugs like, Mobs hiding in textures and server drops. 5. Game at the ""Endgame"" (high levels - high EGO rating) is becoming quite repetitive cos here still is not much high level content, it's more harder version of low level ones, you will repeat things that you already did on low levels, but on harder difficulty. Also can say that Developers are working much and fixing many problems and bugs one by one, also adding much of fun content, so it's not very good for now, but still is very fun and I'm sure that soon time by time Developers will bring much more fun, various and hope balanced content in, but for now it feels like they are creating Single player game more then MMO from Defiance economical system, which is not good for the game, I think, cos nowadays MMO economy is much more flexible then just DLCs.- Good things I like here : 1. Game is very flexible and gives lots of freedom if compare to many other MMOTPS-RPGs. 2. Quite cleaver AI that is very rare nowadays, they are not waiting when you will kill them as in modern FPS or TPS games. Also world here is living its own life what gives Defiance very specific atmosphere and makes it quite interesting. 3. You are not tied to specific Class and to its Weapon, you are mixing your gameplay and you are free in your strategy, you can change your play style in any second and play as you wish and not as Class specification forces you. 4. For F2P game with DLC system it is not P2W, but gives many interesting things that you will not care much about in PvP. 5. Very atmospheric for Post-Apocalyptic game, you will feel yourself in really destructed world and not in paradise. 6. Very easy interface with many possible tactical and role-playing styles, in RPGs for me it's one of very important things when you are not playing on Piano, but still have many possible steps to do, console interface for some PC gamers may become confusing in the beginning, but very soon it will become quite comfortable and easy to use. 7. Game hardness is quite interesting thing here - it's same time hard and easy, as I say AI is quite cleaver here, they are trying to surround you, hide behind object, always move and do any thing that will make them hard targets and they are trying every thing to make from you an easy target for them, also AI quite often working in groups and very cohesively, that makes game very fun and not so easy as many modern games. 8. Story line... Never thought that I will be so steeped in MMO games storyline and quests.- All written here are my opinions and feelings about Defiance, there are many things that I like and many things I don't, so I tried with my not best English (sorry for that) to explain my opinions about it, of course someone will agree and some one will not, but in last part I really can say that I Recommend this game, it becomes F2P so trying it is best way to understand you will like it or not, game is very specific in many ways and it make many players to love it and many to hate it, I like this game very much and still having lots of fun from it, there are many things to do and to have fun, also it's not stamped-standard MMORPG. It looks for now as modern gaming experiment, but in my feeling it's still experiment more and not finished product yet, but it have very big potential and I'm sure it can become really epic game, if Developers will work more on it, but despite this, game in this version is very, VERY FUN.- Not best, but not bad graphics and amazing atmosphere - 7/10, free and very flexible gameplay for MMORPG - 9/10, fun and various game modes - 7/10, sound and music - 9/10, controls - 8/10, AI - 9/10, progressing - 8/10, story - 9/10, Total - 8/10. So, I recommend it, try it,  but don't be hurry with your opinion, give Defiance some hours and start with main quests and then criticize it.			"

												I bought this game for $60 awhile back. It was fun if you played with a few buddies. The quest are quite repetitive. What truly disappoints me is that those who paid a good deal of money for this game did not get compensated at all when it went free to play. Anything would of been nice, in-game perks or cosmetics. We received nothing at all. It goes to show that this game developer doesn't care for its loyal fan base.			"

												I'll start off by listing what I like about the game because there's more of that than what I don't like, but the things I don't like are fairly major and far outweigh the fun parts to the point I felt the need to not recommend it. I also have far, far more time in this game than it shows because I played for quite a while before it was added to steam, as well as playing in the alpha and beta tests.The good:It's an easy game to just pick up and play for an hour or so at a time, there's absolutely nothing that tries to force you to keep playing for long stretches at a time like overly long quests or time gates like a lot of MMOs have. You can log in and do a quest or a couple conflict sites, maybe an arkfall, or just run around killing random things and feel like you've accomplished something.There's no real ""builds"", once you get to around 2k ego you can easily have all 4 active skills and most of the passives all maxed out. You're also not restricted to any particular weapon based on what ""class"" you choose when making a character, all that does is decide what starting outfit you have and that's purely cosmetic. You can use whatever equipment you want whenever you want to as long as your ego rating is equal to or higher than what's listed on the equipment, there's even multiple loadouts where you can completely customize your character's equipment, skills, and passives for different situations, essentially creating different classes that you can switch between on the fly.The weapon skills have been made easier to level as well, you no longer stop gaining weapon skill exp when the weapon itself that you're using is maxed out and have to stop what you're doing and reset the mastery exp for that weapon.The bad:There's really only a couple of things here, but one of them is big. Freaking huge. Almost game breaking even, at least in my opinion.The in game communication sucks, most people don't even notice it's even there for a long time and even when they do almost nobody uses it because it's such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ If you want to play this then get in a guild that uses voice communication because you won't get anywhere trying to use the in game text chat.The really big thing I don't like is this.....enemies auto scale to the person in the area with the highest ego rating when they spawn. The game itself is basically an open world map where you can go to anywhere at any time with no load screens unless you fast travel, and while this sounds neat (and to be fair, it is neat most times) it can easily screw people with lower ego ratings when someone with a much higher rating so much as drives past them. Any new enemies that spawn will be scaled to match that person and you can go from taking out regular trash enemies with 1 headshot from a bolt action rifle to suddenly needing 3-5 because the newly spawned enemies came in to match the person who zoomed past on their way somewhere else. It's not uncommon to suddenly be massacred by a wave of new enemies that spawned in and are an order of magnitude stronger than what you were just fighting a few seconds before.This wouldn't be so bad if it was only in areas like arkfalls where a lot of people are expected to show up, or in co-op instances where it doesn't affect anyone who isn't in that particular instance, but it scales like this everywhere and there's absolutely no way to avoid it unless all you do is solo re-run the story quests that have their own instances to them. The game itself is fun but it's very frustrating for new players trying to get started when they constantly get screwed over by the poorly thought out scaling system.The game USED to not have the kind of power creep where gear gets progressively stronger as you level and higher ego rating just meant you had access to more skills/passives and a wider variety of gear with better mods, but now it's like most other MMOs where you're forced to constantly upgrade your gear as it quickly becomes obsolete. To be fair you can upgrade your current gear with the salvage matrix instead of having to get new stuff, but it's a constant thing and you'll find yourself needing to stop and upgrade far too often, and you'll find yourself having a hard time deciding whether to sell loot or break it down into salvage to use for upgrades.If you like third person shooters with slight RPG elements and don't mind the horrible level scaling mechanics then you'll probably like Defiance, but if having enemies suddenly start spawning in with 3x the HP and damage output because someone higher level showed up doesn't sound like your cup of tea then you may want to avoid this game for now and see if that changes in the future.

												Firstly, the connection between the game and the TV show is absolutely minimal, so if you are expecting some continuity, forget it! There is no real story in the game, no complimentary information. Nothing.  And this is perhaps why the game seems so repetitive right from the start? Graphics and animation are reasonable. Animation is not at all smooth and movements not very realistic. Characters look disproportionate.  Your character is silent, which is a little odd. The maps are open-world and simply huge, and this is one of the games strong points. However, they are poredictably very dull and repetitive for an mmo which makes exploring seem rather pointless.Lag, at times, was also a real problem. Following friends they would suddenly lag for five to ten seconds. By the time they finally move they had jumped clean off the mini-map. Lag in combat, though, seemed low and perfectly playable. The interface is poor. Very definitely designed for a console! On the PC it feels awkward to say the least. Not all the keys can be remapped either. The chat is almost non-existent, so the game really doesn’t feel like an mmo at all. There is very limited social activity! You might consider that a good thing though!Skill mods are great, but you can’t switch setups.  On the really positive side of things, the game deals with multi-player combat well and the gun mods are excellent.   And I think those two points are really important. Get those two right and you have a game that a lot of people are going to enjoy. Not everyone cares about the story!So recommend or not? Sheesh. Another hard one! I think you need to make up your own mind on this one. If you want story and depth, then no, don’t bother. But if killing stuff is your thing, then sure. Why not?I am going to say no, becuase ""for me"" I don't think the game has longevity. But I would at least recommend trying the game and making up your own mind. Cus it's free.			"

												I have spent many years playing MMO's and gotten heavily into the whole Guild/Clan/Corp and group activity side of things, but now find myself tired of the constant demands on my time and energy for what is supposed to be a ""Game"". And thats not to mention the ott drama's that go with it.For that reason I find Defiance a joy to play.Jump in and out at any time and find lots of stuff to do but never need to set alarm clocks or meet schedules or get heavy in any way at all. Just easy come easy go fun stuff.I watched the tv series and enjoy it but do not play the game for fanboy reasons, I considedr that to be just a bit of spice in the mix.Yes there are bugs and glitches, yes you can be annoyed at things that mess up your progress, but I try not to sweat the small stuff, and in the end, it's ALL small stuff. Just a game.Trion have been regularly adding updates and dlcs that give new and more ingame choices, and while the server population varies at times of the day and times of the year, I almost always find other people ingame to join in with shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥up and chasing more pursuits.I like chasing the pursuits, collecting the gear and outfits, beating the challenges and driving all the different vehicles. It's fun.A lot of people compare this with Borderlands and say its not as much fun, but I don't like Borderlands, found it redious and annoying so hey, horses for courses I guess.Oh well, anothe Buck, another day in the Suck.

												Ignore all the circlejerk hate about this game being ""crap"" ""lonely"" ""pathetic"" etc. It is an amazing open world MMO which doesn't require a subscription. At the time of me posting this there is major changes in their staff and their new staff are working their♥♥♥♥♥off to bring us the best possible experience, at an even lower price! As for the ""lonely"" and ""no one plays it"" that's just an out lie. Just yestarday I was in a major arc-fall (you will see what i mean when you get the game :P) that 500-1,000 people must have been at. The servers also do an amazing job of not ♥♥♥♥ing up with that many people only loading what you need or what to see or what is in your area if there is not that many. If you do get this, or even if you don't, i recommend watching the Show on ""SyFy"" channel :) It's brilliant :D...9.8/10			"

												Very disappointed with this game. I bought for me and my gf because we are big fans of the show but sadly it fails to deliver. The character customization is bad, the story is bad, the missions are extremely generic... The pc port is not thought-out at all, lacking even the necessary hotkeys for standard actions, like shifting between loadouts (equipment) or even opening some of the menu tabs. The worst thing of all though is that although the game is advertised as ""pay-once"" it really operates like a free-to-play rpg, even more so than other f2p rpgs like Tera. Most of the cool things in the game you have to pay extra money to purchase and even when you create a character, out of the THREE (seriously, why create such a great story with more than nine races just to make three available?) playable races you can only play two, human or irathient, unless of course you pay an extra 10 (!) euros to be allowed to play a castithan. Well done guys.It really plays like a half-finished, free-to-play bad Borderlands ripoff. Wish someone had told me all this before I gave them my money. Or I had played a demo.			"

												Total failure from launch.I was one of those people who bought it early on at launch price.This has kept having massive price drops since then.There were tremendous glitches with the released game that were reported but never fixed from the alpha and beta test.Then there was the numerous accounts of cheating.  Trions fix was to weaken each weapon as it was constantly used for that.  They really should have never had client side calcualations for these things to begin with.  That makes it just too easy to send altered data instead of the real stuff.Then every time they fixed something they broke 2 others......and often didn't even fix what they released a patch to fix.  I don't even want to hear the term Freight Yard ever again.  I can't count the number of times they re-released it as fixed only to remove it again because they didn't fix it correctly.After that is the constant number of times the first DLC was delayed.  Not to mention the ambiguous remarks of content to come.  You can't promote something by simply saying ""it's something big"" or ""look forward to it"".  Give actual details.For storyline there were constant contradictions with it's side to side TV series.In all this game relied too much on the TV series.  I truly don't expect this game to fare too well for an extended period longer.			"

Posted: June 14, 2014
												!!! DEFIANCE !!!Defiance gives a completely fresh and new to the MMO-Shooter genre, With its focus primarily on PvE content. There is a large amount of content that the player is able to experience within Defiance, in a very large open world environment. Their dynamic content is extremely fun to play, using the RIFT/Guild Wars 2 Event content and twisting it to fit this new environment. The ground breaking link between game and TV show is a very interesting idea and it will be great to see how this progresses.I feel that the overall gameplay of Defiance is extremely polished and fun to play. It makes it easy for someone who is used to MMO’s who doesn’t normally play shooters feel right at home. MMO’s are my favoured genre and I found it easy to get in to and enjoy Defiance, not typically being a shooter player. This could be due to the simple and easy to follow tutorial in the game.However, there are certain shooter features which are sorely lacking in Defiance, prominent ones being the lack of a prone option, as well as no active cover options, like hugging and popping out from behind a wall. Addition of one or both of these would be a valuable addition to the game and could make the game play even more interesting. Furthermore, I personally dislike the camera view, I have never been fond of the ‘over the shoulder’ camera as to me it makes aiming feel wrong, and doesn’t seem like you are really aiming as the character, I would feel more comfortable with a true third person camera angle, from behind the character, or first person. The UI also feels rather clunky and less than intuitive on PC, having clearly been built primarily with consoles in mind.The fact that Defiance has been released on PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 will allow for people of both the MMO and shooter fan bases all coming together in a single game. Though, of course, these platforms will all be playing separate from one another (sadly). I would expect that the consoles will see more of the shooter fan base, and as such more PvP action. However, on PC I would expect that the game will be played more by the MMO fan base, and as such I would think that the PvP experience would be a little sparser.Having said that, Defiance has two options available to aid with initiating PvP, there is the typical small scale instanced battles that MMO players will be well attuned with, as well as a large open world PvP option known as the shadow war. The shadow war allows players to fight one another and claim control of territory, the more people who join the battle, the larger the area of combat becomes. Also, as more people join the shadow war more vehicles become available for use, some of which will include weaponry to aid in combating your adversaries. This could be an extremely fun way to play PvP and fight against your fellow players, rather than alongside them.I feel that Defiance is a great game and should at least be given a chance by both the MMO players and shooter players out there. It really is revolutionary to the genre, linking the game in with a TV show and all of the dynamic content available. It is also very refreshing to see an MMO-Shooter which focuses on PvE rather than PvP. I look forward to seeing how this progresses, and whether both the game and TV show will be able to endure together.- XeroSyphon			"

Posted: October 5, 2014
												UPDATE: The lag issues seem to have been fixed. I logged on recently to play it for a couple of hours: it is either that the game is in its usual state of hybernation between two Defiance seasons on SyFy or the devs indeed found and fixed the cause of the lag issues, but I was able to beat a major in-game event without lag problems.Since Steam does not offer a neutral rating option, let me just say:- As a long term investment, I do not recommend this game. Myself, I learned my lesson the hard way, spending way too much time on a game that had a promising start with decent story content that tied in pretty well with the SyFy series, but failed to realize its potential. With more than 1000 hours of gameplay all I can say is 'hope dies hard'.- As a casual, Choice #2 game that you can play while waiting for the next BIG one... why not? It's free (unless you plan to invest into Epic Lockboxes) so if that's all you want then jump right in.Just do not get your hopes up, take everything the devs say with a pinch (or, actually, a bucket) of salt and it will be fine.Review summary:This game is plagued by horrendous lag issues that the developers are unable to fix, and which will only get worse as they are about to introduce new content without eliminating the root cause of lag.  Gameplay is badly affected by controversial development decisions, too much reliance on the random number generator instead of creativity, decline in the quality of story missions.Before you try this game I strongly suggest that you check the Defiance forums at http://forums.defiance.com/forumdisplay.php?3-General-Discussion  and read some of the posts. In game activities:The game activities include various events like minor and major arkfalls (spaceship wrekage crash landing in the game world: players need to fight mobs to win the event and claim the loot), sieges, incursions, races, so call hotspot challenges (you need to massacre a bunch of mobs while watching and keeping your score multiplier up by killing mobs before the multiplier resets), daily and weekly contract jobs, normal and expert co-op maps, PvP maps and a so called Shadow War that is more or less a phase open world PvP event. Also, there is a story mission (Season 1, Season 2) and episode missions, plus various arenas (like the hotspots these are also score multiplier based shoot'em up events).(Caveat: if you decide to try the racing challenges, be prepared. Your racing experience can be ruined by the ""disappearing vehicle"" bug (yep, the vehicle sometimes vanishes for no apparent reason), plus race tracks are not phased or instanced, and hostile mobs can spawn on you and crash you while you are hoping to finally get that gold ranking that you need for one of the achievements. Some people welcome the presence of hostile spawns as an additional challenge, others consider it an unnecessary source of frustration: losing due to lack of practice/skills is one thing, losing due to a bad game design decision is something different.)Story and episode missions: while the story and episode missions for Season 1 were fun (lots of cutscenes, even including in-game copies of some of the lead characters from the TV series), Season 2 was pretty much a major letdown. Trion went cheap on the amount of cutscenes, there are much less of them compared to Season 1, and in some of the DLCs all you get is reading datapads or listening to some mission updates via your EGO implant.End game content:The only real end-game boss is the Warmaster, but you cannot create raid groups and even if you are grouped you can be easily dumped into a different instance, plus Trion nerfed the loot drop so much that currently it is a waste of time instead of a manageable challenge. (Extremely dedicated clans can still down the beast, but it requires meticulous arrangements).Cash store:You can buy a outfits (usually recoloured mash-ups based on a few basic variants), vehicles, various boosts (xp, score, reputation boost), lockboxes (that contain random selection of  weapons). The same lockboxes can be bought in-game for keycodes that you can earn by scoring high at major events (arkfalls, sieges, etc.). If you bought DLC 5 (Arktech Revolution), you can also buy Arkforge that you can use to upgrade your weapons (both rarity and rating).Lag, lag, lag, lag... and more lag:Still the game would be fun if it weren't for the lag. The lag is so bad that you can log in, do some solo mission without issues, but as soon as you try to participate in a siege or arkfall event (where the turnout is usually pretty high), you'll get de-synced from the server (which means that you'll see frozen mobs and players, or players who are still running around and shooting things you cannot see; your weapons do no damage, you cannot pick up loot drops, switch weapons, etc.) and after a while you'll either get disconnected with a critical timeout error or you can run around in an empty game world until you finally force-close the game or the server decided to miraculously re-sync you when the number of major events drop to a certain level and it can again handle the load.While the developers made some efforts recently to remedy a few cricital gameplay and balance issues, it is clear that Defiance is a despised stepchild of Trion. Support is so bad, it may take weeks to get a reply to your support tickets (or you need to complain loudly on the forums/contact the Community Managers). If you do not buy anything from their cash store, you are not entitled to chat support. Server issues are barely noticed and handled by the staff on weekends.In nutshell, after a decent start this game is now on a backburner. Trion will obviously keep the game running in order to meet their contractual obligations, but Defiance is definitely not a development priority.			"

												Edit 5/4/2016: Have been considering redownloading and giving it another go - very tentative consideration, mind you. I really loved this game, but the changes that caused my leaving still strike deep to my gaming core. If they fine tuned the mechanics changes, then it will be better gaming wise. But they still have all the extra money types, still has that P2W system (seriously, if you have to use real money to buy anything in game that benefits your character, that is P2W.), failed DLC promises (so DLCs are basically just reskins) and then free game status.It's not that I am upset about having paid and then the game go free not long after. I honestly don't care about that. It's the playerbase that comes with free games that sucks. You have your legitimate hard-up-on-cash players, then you just have the annoying ""griefers"" or whatever they're called. The latter taking up a majority of the free-player base.Sorry the show failed, but you can still save the game!(HINT: Auto balancing to where newbies and veteran players were ""comparable"" was what really killed this game. Playing it solo without my friends was tedious, boring and frustrating. If you didn't have a mass amount of people, you were pretty much guaranteed to die. You're only a newb for a short time, deal with it. Toughen up. Become a seasoned hellbug killer. It creates a better unity amongst the playerbase as well.)***This will be a long review because I am leaving my former review up so that people can see the drastic change of attitude toward this game.***Before April of 2014, I would have recommended this game to anyone looking for a good MMO to play. After April of 2014, my positive recommendation has become a great big, huge, monster of a negative. The core fighting style of the game was completely revamped in a way that drove off most of the player base, it has made the game 9 parts frustraing and the other part is a mixture of annoyance and some enjoyment (because the driving is still fun). Some, few really, will say that it is still playable and isn't that hard, to you I greatly disagree. Myself, my fiance and our mutual friend rocked this game every weekend and almost every weekday, doing very well on our pursuits, arkfalls and so on.Now, just 10 minutes of this game is enough to send us running in the other direction. It greatly saddens me that this game has been treated this way by Trion. Taking out the biggest part of the game and replacing it with something that it wasn't even originally in the field of vision during creation is stupid.On to the DLCs. I was left unimpressed by the DLCs, there were many promises before all 5 were released that there might be clan oriented things and other fun extras - but none of that has come. Instead you get some ""new"" missions and then a bunch of reskinned gear. Woohoo. Granted, my fiance and I each purchased a DLC (myself castithan and he Arkbreaker) and we were fine with doing so - until now. Now we view this whole mess as a great big waste of money. The DLCs have little to no real content, Arkbreaker being the most worthwhile. The last two DLCs were released with only a month difference, what does that say about the effort put into the fifth?This is my first negative review and I hate typing it because for the longest time I defended this game and Trion, now I just feel like a fool.Now onto the upcoming change in June. Defiance is going Free-To-Play...... with subscriptions (for xp boosts and such). It is being turned into a Pay To Win type game and to that I have a big resounding F-U-see where I am going with this. It is claimed that this was the intention from the beginning, but if you, like myself and many others, have kept up on this game since the beginning (or nearly there) you would know this to be a big fat, greedy lie. The devoted players who bought the game in the first place are getting screwed, like so many other gamers these days who put their trust and money into games. Everything is going pay to win and it is ridiculous. That was a HUGE reason why we first even bothered with this game, because the only things you had to pay for in the beginning were the DLCs.Now it is obvious that Trion just wants more money and doesn't care about the enjoyment of the players and certainly does not appreciate them.Stay away from this game unless you don't mind pay to win, even then I would suggest staying from it because they have broken it and have only been doing hokey ""repairs"" with the tech equivilant elmer's glue and scotch tape.(Sorry if this has a more rant feel than a review. Every time I start writing a review I get annoyed. I no longer have anything positive to say about this game. Trion, you really screwed yourself. This could have been an AMAZING game if you had just appreciated the players and what they had to say. But no, money speaks louder than the words of hundreds of players. And no trolls telling me ""but you have to have money to"", I know this. I know this very freaking well, and Defiance has been going on long enough that they don't need to pull these BS tactics to make more. If they had just released worthwhile DLCs they could have been raking in the cash.)PRE-APRIL 2014 REVIEWIf you are looking for a good MMO to play with friends that have a sci-fi-esque atmosphere. Look no further. At first I didn't even want to give this game a try due to the fact I don't particularly like the show. But I was pleasantly surprised when I downloaded the demo and found that it was not completely wrapped up and tied in with it's namesake. Shortly after experiencing the gameplay and the kick bum driving physics, I bought the game and haven't regretted it since.With the upcoming update this month (February), the chat should hopefully be fixed and increase my enjoyment of playing even more. Myself and two friends spent almost 2 years looking for a MMO we could enjoy together and this was the one we stuck with. We didn't want something that was pay to win or had monthly fees and this game does not have those two things. There is DLC content, but the nice thing about that is that you do not have to get them to continue the game (I.E. You want to get to EGO 4000? Buy DLC 2! It's the only way you're gonna get it.), they are purely additives, which is how a DLC should be, imo.It does, like many games, have bugs and glitches. Personally I have not come across any that have brought my gameplay to a halt. But at the moment I haven't even reached EGO 1000, so I am certainly not as far as many other players.Download and try the Demo first! This game may or may not be for you so you should definitely test it before making a commitment. It's pretty much perfect for me!! If you are still wary about purchasing it even after the demo, I'm sure it will go on sale for a reasonable price soon.Edit: Chat has been fixed! It is a HUGE improvement and because of the goodly change, I ended up making a new in-game friend! The first in my 70+ hours thus far :D			"

												(This review needs an update, due to it being outdated)This game belongs in the pantheon of great Shooter/RPGs/MMOs!.You could definitely see it as a fine working mixture of (in order of)Borderlands/Halo/PlanetSide 2/RAGE.The world is quite large & encourages you to explore it, there are a lot of random events such as saving troopers, helping take out enemies, races, Arkfalls (in orbit decaying Alien/Votan 'ship parts', that have technology which is valuable - in the game it's rare weapons & more, that crash down to Earth with a type of enemy usually occuping it's vicinity once it 'landed', that are scavenging it) & much more.Suffice to say, there is a healthy amount of content, which has been significantly improved since it's initial release (April 2 - 2013). The game is 95% PvE oriented, with the remaining 5% being a ""Shadow War"" PvP type mode in which players compete for point control, often granting things like the aforementioned Arkfalls.The graphics are extremely decent for an MMO, and should run smooth on most machines/setups, even during large player amounts. Of course, using the control panel of the GPU to enhance the it further - can never hurt, I'd recommend adding extra anti-aliasing at least.The character creator is quite weak, not having sliders or anything of the sort, only pre-determined eyes, face build, lengths etc. Although there are 3 races to choose from which are Humans, Irathients & Castithans. Irathients being more feral & spiritual-minded, whilst Castithans are the more 'civilized' of the 2, although you NEED to buy the Castithan Charger DLC to be able to choose the Castithan race. (I recommend getting all DLC, in the form of the season pass).There are LOT of weapons & types in it, comparable to Borderlands - there is every weapon you can imagine, also Alien AKA 'Votan' weapons & you can also add weapon modifications (that also change the visual appearance of the weapon), and there are types like Electricity, Poison, Fire etc..The main story missions & side missions are very numerous, especially when owning all DLC. But you will often find yourself doing those Arkfalls, which is highly enjoyable & quite rewardable.This is probably one of the best MMO shooters that I have ever played.Now that it's Free2Play I highly recommend everyone to try it out.Also if possible, watch the TV series (it's like Game of Thrones but Sci-Fi based).Personal score: 8/10Best regards,Dukhat			"

												Defiance feels like a Fallout and Borderlands mashup in a very good way. Gunplay is solid and you get the expected amount of MMORPG stats and grinding.Where it falls short is in the showstopping bugs and lag. As of 5 September 2014 main missions required to progress through the campaign are simply broken. On my first character I got stuck approximately two dozen missions in. On my second character the second main quest completely broke rendering me unable to obtain the first vehicle or progress the campaign. Humping it on foot to do side quests isn't particularly pleasant.Checkpoints don't trigger, things don't spawn, and general ""Huh? What's supposed to happen?"" moments, at least for newbies, abound. Time trial route points don't show (or take too long to appear) making it pointless to try, and you'll desync from the server a lot, requiring logouts which sometimes work for a while before needing them again.One might point out that of course MMOs can and always do have network issues, but a quick perusal of the official forums indicates that these same issues have been ongoing since at least mid-2013. It's a shame that I can't really recommend Defiance based almost completely on technical issues. I do hope they iron out the problems eventually.			"

												This USED to be a good game. Now you can barely play and can't get support. I am unable to log in due an authenticator issue. The newly added Glyph launcher (a completely useless, ever updating, advert-spamming game launcher) insists I enter an authenticator code ... even though I never set one up.It takes months (literally) for support to contact you about anything, and then it's some automated crap asking if the problem has fixed itself magically, because it's been open for so long. I paid for this game, but I can't even log in to play anymore.Don't spend money on it. Ever since it went F2P - massive lag spikes and increased support response times.My advice:Do not pay for any software from Trion. Let others pay for it.Then when they open it up to F2P, come play for free at other peoples expense.Act like a total knob in the game, run hacks, cheats, etc. There really is no downside that way.Enjoy			"

												Why I recommend this game:-It's free, definitely not p2w. -There is no ""class"". It is all based on what weapon you decide to use.-You can join in a 'boss' fight with others with no party or any hindrance to others.-Mobs are scaled to your 'ego rating' or level, so they level up with you.-When others join, mobs are also powered up to give a challenge.-There are plenty of 'pursuits' or achievements to try and attain.-Fast travelling (teleporting) to towns is free, and can be done in combat or not.-There is a self-revive which refreshes itself after a while, and others can revive you. If not it only costs a little money to be resurrected at the last checkpoint you activated.Why I don't recommend this game:-Gameplay may be boring after some time, grinding map events for exp but the same goes for most other mmos-Inventory is very limited and there is no bank, Only 35 slots whether you equip items or not (Expansion requires cash)-Bugs or glitches are not uncommon.-Your 'ego rating' or level grows pretty fast so you have to upgrade to a new weapon often.-Weapons are of random drop, all types and rarity. Unless buying from a 'supplies' vendor, theres no guarantee to what weapon you might get from bosses.-Some weapons are DLC locked, you can get them but they cannot be equipped.			"

												5/10The game isn't bad, it gives you an hour or two of fun playtime and story. But way too much forced content, and the devs have no idea what leveling is. -The NSFW part of the game means they shoehorned a few swearwords and sexual themes in after writing and voicing the script using voice actors of famous 'Fisher Price' toys. It really has no place in the original script and you can easily tell how forced it is.-Leveling is a joke in this game. The devs tried to make it as even as they could across all character levels by increasing dps as you level up while keeping npcs HP the same. Some where around 50,000 HP for not even dangerous npcs. This is all fine except for if you're starting out, and your anywhere under level 100 and your dps is say 10, you will have to shoot the same npc for minutes to kill each one. Breaks the line between 'Challenging' and just plain unenjoyable.Pros:Cool communityMap, HUD, Level Design, Mission Scripting is quite nice. Well done and pleasant to look at.Lots of voice actingPretty Cool loreCons:No LevelingBuggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Worst in game menu UI by farNSFW part is a huge faceplam "

												I beta tested this game and non of the suggesstions I made were ever implementated. Suggesstions that many reviewers rage about. The game was supposed to work with the show and vise versa which seems like just a huge flop now. This game honestly doesn't introduce anything new or creative that can't be found in other free MMOs. the game mechanics are ok however the vehicles are clumsy. The missions are repetative just like the battle music when you run into an incounter. None of the quick instances on the map make you feel like you're adding anything to your faction or the story but rather just there to fill in the space.			"

DefianceDeveloped and released by Trion Worlds[www.trionworlds.com] who are the creators behind Rift, created a Sci-Fi MMO that has lots to offer. I have logged 20 hours in the game as of this writing and I want to keep playing more why? Well because its a Free To Play MMO that has me entertained and its really good.I was first involved with this game back in Alpha and Beta and I did like what the game offered and the sci-fi MMO game it was but I didn't get the game on release for a few reasons such as the price, it needed some more polish from its Beta period but the biggest reason was the idea of it being pushed out to meet the release of the TV series.Now that the game went free to play on Steam I decided to download it and try it out. After playing for many hours here is what I have to say.Starting off you only get two character slots, I usually don't play more then 1 or 2 characters so thats ok, for those who like to play every class or combination of main skill talents then there options to get more slots by either a monthly subscription or paying to open more of them.You can choose the race you want to play and the class you want them to be as well as well as the gender. The classes you can choose from are Outlaw, Machinist, Survivalist, Veteran and the playable races are Human and Irathients.The game has a fast lead in to the action and gets you going nearly right away. The intro cinematic isn't to long but long enough to get you into the story and your interest perked in the game.As for the missions in the game there are oh so many. The main story line are done as Seasons like the TV series. There are also many, many side missions, I mean many. There are also in game events called Arkfalls.ArkfallAll players are alerted when a major Arkfall is taking place, and even the environment changes to set the mood. Skies blacken, falling meteorites can be seen falling from space into the Earth’s sky and finally slamming into the ground.Minor Arkfalls occur frequently throughout the Defiance world, and involve the descent of small clusters of debris from space. These can be usually tackled by a solo veteran Ark Hunter or a pair of adventurers, and can be completed in a shorter span of time.There is so much more to talk about with missions to do but I will say that you will come across lots of things to do and you won't have to worry about looking for what to do.You can add mod slots to weapons to be able to add a mod to it. Master a weapon to increase your skill on it and increase the weapons rarity to increase its stats.I really liked how you can change your characters appearance with outfits and helmets. This doesn't do anything other then a cosmetic look. The whole game is voiced to so need to read lengthy mission logs. You will even recognize some some of the voices. I think a few voices actors did work in the Fallout games.Everything the game offers you don't have to pay real money to get, just spend the time getting your factions levels up or saving your in game currency called script and then purchase it.I played the game with the Xbox360 controller and the game really is made to accommodate it.Overall I am very impressed with the game and hours of play it offers and for being a free to play game it is definitely worth the price.Pro'sLots of game playAuto join for events and missionsEverything is voicedHidden Vendors to findCustomizable appearanceIts freeCon'sIt had a bad launchSpecial codes from the tv series to use for game only available to the USI give this game:ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː			"

												Definace in itself is a pretty neet shoorter/MMO game. But when you look at the game and how it connects to the series and how much 'Free2Play' the game it, I really would not recommend it.The only thing Defiance shares with the series is the name and general settings. Okay, you start with Nolan and his adopted daughter in the San Fransisco Bay area (were they not in the Defiance area in the series?), but that's basically all that connects this game to the series. YOU WILL NEVER REACH DEFIANCE ITSELF! IMO they basically could have ditched the whole Defiance series link and just made it a generic non-IP shooter.Then Free2Play... I've bought the game when it was still Buy2Play and because of that I have certain 'benefits'. Heck, I have even bought the season pass, but by now the greed of TRION almost made those purchases pretty much void. With the latest patch I have gained limits to my daily and weekly gain of a lot of major (currency) items that I need to progress through the game. This means that upgrading my gear will be slowed down by at least 75%, and it's the gear upgrades that are so important in the game. And though I have a higher limit on those gains because I've purchased Defiance and the season pack, I really can't imagine how bad it'll be when you're a 100% free player.An other thing that bugs the hell out of me is the ca$h $hop. It has so many overpowered and game breaking items in it (mainly in lockboxes so you have to gamble on what you get to start with) that the PvP aspect of the game has become heavily Pay2Win!In general, it's a good game, but as usual the greed of TRION has made the game unplayable, unless you either subscribe to the game (what's the use of a free game then) or are willing to spend a lot on the ca$h $hop			"

												When it was good, it was good. When it was bad, it was horrible. Having put far too much time into this game, all I can say at this point is that a MMOFPS needs to have less game-breaking updates, and more sustained group experiences beyond the random pick up group. Pass on this, at this point, and try something else that is a more concretely designed squad based game; someday your MMOFPS prince will come, this meanwhile is a bit lackluster. "

												Excellent game. Its really a players prefrence on what they like to do. If your the type of person that can kill millions of AI in assortment this games for you. If you like pvp its got that too but its more coop based. Third person shooter, lacks some of the standard controls(Like LEAN, slide, use cover) but has some non balance attacking abilities dmg increase, cloak, distract and sprint.Overall I give the game a 9/10 as a mmo coop shooter, 7/10 as mmo pvp shooter, and 8/10 as a standard mmo. Perks- Ingame micro transactionsExpansionsGame completeness (very few bugs)Multiple AI types, missions, modes, raids ect...Great graphicsGreat musicGreat sound effectsBalanced weaponsoptimizedCons-Well the salvage system apears to be a crafting system but its more of an upgrade currency sink, I just feel this game could use a crafting system that works off the salvage.Game play can get repetative, but its fun to repeat so who cares.

												Finished all the main quests today, as it appears theres nothing else left other than grinding same stuff over again, and with how dissapointing pvp turned out to be its time to move on. Its shame this game is such a mess as the world based on series is a great concept, and overall idea is nice.pros:- cool idea to mix mmo with a series and add new quests related to it as the show progresses- visuals are okay, nothing amazing though- quite big map and it was fun to explore it- some nice weapon ideas- quest cinematics were quite well done (at least for the first half of it)cons:- very limited options, game looks and behaves like a bad console port- if you havent watched the series, main quest makes little sense- most of the costumes you get look very similiar- the amount of bugs is pretty crazy considering game is over year old (models going invisible, random lag spikes/crashes -     game doesnt even pop an error for about 10 mins, making you run arround when you are disconnected, vehicles dissapearing sometimes while you mount them, crosshair disspearing and going console mode (no crosshair and auto aim) randomly, theres propably more, thats all I remembered- half way through main quests they have diffrent voice actors, with HUGE decrease in quality both in acting and actual audio quality that sounds like home made recording- quests are very repetitive, basically only 4-5 variants of mission over and over, either bring something, go somewhere or kill few waves of enemies- theres no storage for your characters- skills are mostly passives, with only 4 actives to choose from, can only use one- a lot of game content locked behind dlc paywall- co-op instances and missions were incredibly boring, just waves after waves until you get to boss- no classes- only 2 pvp modes- the pvp in the game is horrible mess, it looks like alpha state. Theres a ton of glitches, wallhackers, aimbots, and apparently dev doesnt care about making a proper anti cheat or even banning hackers, most basic stuff using cheat engine seems to work, ppl using blatant speed hacks and dmg hacks. Then comes the problem with weapons, the only viable ones are sniper rifles, grenade launchers, shotguns and infectors, funnily enough except the sniper all of those require little to no aiming, aoe weapons hitting as hard or harder than single target ones. You either use the glitches and the overpowered weapons or you gimp yourself- felt more like single player game for the most parttl;drPlay it only if you enjoyed the series and want nostalgia ride, otherwise stay away. You can get about 20-30 hours doing only main quests, but to be honest I quite regret doing even that, at it was plain dissapointing for the majority of it.3/10			"

												Having ""just""played 13 hours I do not even have average knowledge about this game.But I know, I had 13 hours fun. For free.So much fun, I checked the DLCs, considering already to buy them in the future.But I will be able to play a lot more before I will buy the DLC, there is no need to buy in the beginning if you just want fun.I am just thinking... melee weapons, other character slots... sounds nice... later :)This is a 3rd person shooter, is has an open world and I played alone.Most of the time. The way missions and events - as far as I have seen - is great.You drive somewhere, to a mission for example and you see missions left and right.THEN, a road block. Perhaps some NPCs fighting against each other. Perhaps even already other players like you.It is your decision. Do you ignore the road block, drive through or around it, or do you stop and fight? Or do you drive through it and stop at the next hill and use your sniper to do the mission, or just help a bit.Now imagine, the little incident is becoming dangerous, you can just run away.Or you stay. And perhaps other players join and help.Nobody ever said something stupid like ""don't steal my kills""or such nonsense.It is all just shooting of the finest, pure action, driving like crazy and shooting like in Borderlands 1.Lots of weapons and extras, tuning of weapons, different perks like better criticals from behind, from above or if you kneel. Or you just take all three and kneel behind the enemy on a hill?I was so far playing the story missions, some other ones or just helping other players.Who cares? I drive around to a target, but if I see something of interest, I go there and shoot a bit.I LOVE my sniper rifle, my invisibility which allows me to go around the enemies with the shield to kill them from behind, I love my little quad and I like the game.The music is ok to good, the graphics are ok to good, the gameplay is good to very good and the handling is very easy.If you like shooters and do not try this FREE to play game then you are doing it wrong!""Free to play"" does not mean ""access to everything"". That should be clear.But you can have weeks or months of fun with this game.Me, I am after 2 days thinking about th DLCs. Because I want more of the story.Try this game. It is fun (but sometimes there are disconnects, for me, ca.  4 times in 2 days).Come and get it!-----------------------------------------------------------------Now 32 hours into the game I start to hate it.I am a soldier, a killer, a super human with build-in healing and whatever.And that sucker lies to me all the time, and says ""go there, there is what you want"".I go there, it is not there. I go back, he says ""oh, sorry, never again will I lie, it is there"".I go there....And againAnd again.THE HERO SUCKS! THE HERO IS AN IDIOT WIHTOUT BALLS!If you really want a nice story, do NOT play this game. The idiotic behaviour of the protagonist - me! - is driving me crazy!------------------------------------------------Ok, I could not resist. I played again.And I liked it again. Story got better. But I still want to shoot the idiot who lied to me.Good game.			"

												Have had Defiance a long time now and never thought about a review of it. (Was to busy playing it)I bought Defiance back when it was buy to play, It was fun. Lots of people everywhere, insane amount of weapons, vehicles and so fourth. The game has a few DLC's some are worth it some are only if you really want them. As much as I do enjoy playing (still playing as of today) the player base has fallen a lot. Where I used to see 100's of players I now see a handful, but Trion are still supporting the game and its enjoyable.For Free to Play, nothing wrong with downloading and giving it a go, got nothing to lose other than some internet data :)Skia Dela'Morte - Insane Castithan Homicidal Killer of Defiance!

												Although the lore is interesting, and the companion Sci-Fi TV show isn't half-bad, the overall game gets boring quickly. The missions are repetitive ""go here, kill this"" over and over and over. And that's just the primary missions, the secondary ones are even worse.After a while, there's not much else to do. Complete missions to get small bits of story. Do secondary missions to grind RNG drops for decent gear. The co-op gameplay isn't bad, but even then there aren't a lot of them, even after all the expansions Trion has made for the game.I can't comment on the PvP, it might be worth it if that's your thing. But, I never cared a lot for PvP in MMORPG's.			"

I played this game when it came out on console, had fun with it on both platforms but it is lacking compared to most MMOs. If you are wanting to just try MMOs out then give it a go, if you are looking for a great MMO I'd move a long.			"

												So I put 800 hours into the game on PS3 (I know I know, I'm a filthy console peasant blah bah blah) until I finally put this game to rest. I started right around start of the volge warmaster and stopped at the alcatraz update so here's my review note that it may vary slightly from the PC version but not too much hopefully. I am slightly biased towards liking this game because it was my first MMO.Pros1. No class restrictions. When you start out you choose one of four classes which the only thing you get from them is an exclusive outfit which everyone replaces quickly.2. Outfits- 90% of the outfits can be unlocked without having to pay for any of them and in my opinion all the paid for outfits are junk. The weapons unfortunately have a single unchangeble skin each. 3) Weapons- The variety of weapons is almost on par with borderlands with everthing from guns that infect you with minature parasites to shotguns that shoot grenades,4) DLC- The DLC are average price at $10 each so it's nice to pick one up every once in a while (I recommend 7th legion as your first you get your sword and some good guns.) They said from what I remember that they were going to leave it at the current 5 DLCs available right now. 5) Gameplay- The way it feels as you aim and shoot is nice. It's third person but your character never seems to be in the way of where you're shooting.6) Arkfalls- These are massiveplayer events that are constantly happening (I""ve never seen less than 2 or 3 on a map) where you will either be clearing waves of small enemies or fighting one giant enemy with 40-50 people backing you up. It always feels as though your part of something greater. 7) Clans- The clans are good and never in the way. You can get bonuses from being in clans that have more rep. Never fear for those who want to start up a clan just for themselves or for them and their friends, the rep is rather easy to earn and going solo you'll have the max tier reward in a month. Much as I hate to admit it this wonderful game has downsides.1) Trolling- Not as big a problem on PC from what I've seen but on console people will use high FPS guns to crash other people's games. Group members can be kicked by group leaders and if you're doing a random 4 player ""dungeon"" you're giving others the chance to troll you.2) Servers- They are rather laggy on console you couldn't go 30 minutes without getting booted from the server on PC i only got booted once in the 5 hours I played and that's because my router suddenly reset itself.I'll post more eventually but I'm tired.

												This is a typical MMORPG, but with Sci-Fi theme instead.Things I like:- Plenty of different things to do.- Lots of action.- You are free to explroe the world and go where you want to.- You will loot things regularly, but it's not a loot bonanza.- Several different weapons to find or buy, with different qualities.Things I don't like:- Too few grenades to find.- Too few tooltips, not everything is easy to understand.- Talents are not that interesting, they are very situational and not often useful.- Somewhat lack of information, more tooltips would be great.

												Todays date is April 16th 2014, and at this point the game is completely broken by the new DLC Arktech Revoltuion. They have ruined a game I loved and made it completely unplayable, all the missions are so hard now that it has made the game repetitive and boring. Even the best guns in the game now do little to no damage, you have to shoot even the weakest enemies 4-5 times in the face to even make a dent in them, it is very stupid. How is someones eyeball stronger then a futuistic sniper bullet? Thanks a lot Trion for taking a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥on my favorite game and ruining it for me!			"

												This game IMHO rates 5 stars. The fact that is a MMO SHOOTER RPG and it is linked with a TV series is awesome. Jump in and be whoever you want and go shoot stuff up wherever you want... insane. BUT!!! THE GAME IS 75% OF THE TIME UNPLAYABLE DO TO LAG AND SERVERS KICKING YOU OFF. I've been playing for about 6 months but friends of mine who have had the game since pre-order say thats the way its always been. When the servers are running well the game is AWESOME, but that is very rare. For that reason I have to say do not get involved. Because on an awesome day when everything works well you will do what I did and invest in the DLCs. Then after that when the servers are kicking you off or youre running around doing your ""keep moving so you dont get killed through the minute to 2 minute long lag spurts"" that happen multiple times especially in group endeavors you'll hate yourself. The game has been out over 2 years now and the server problem still has not been fixed also it seems by reading forums tht no one in chare of the game gives a crap. I've read through multiple forum topics and have yet to see anyone in charge of the game reply with fixes or condolences. Tonight I went on and did my usual, go on late when theres less people on, and stay away from arkfalls, incursions, etc, and I got kicked off twice in 7 minutes. Save your time and invest it in something else.			"

												I have decided the Defiance MMO has a slightly bad wrap. I really enjoy a lot of it. In many ways it includes the things I like from GW2 and The Secret World.Nice implementation of random event spawning, easy and engaging story, slick co-op objectives on missions, reasonable graphics, simple combat/weapons, slick vehicle implementation, and nice skill slotting.What it suffers from mostly is poor MM implementation. The chat system is awkward, the mission co-op mode doesn't even require you team unless you specifically choose to do so, and customization of your character is limited - set outfits rather than outfit bits to mix and match, but I was definitely spoiled by CoH there. In addition the weapon system modding could use some refinement - too many weapons not enough mods, and the reputation system could use a little more explanation (tho I am getting that down now some, too).All in all, I give it a A-/B+ as a game. B- as an MMO, far from the horrible reviews I've seen. Maybe I haven't gotten to end game issues, or grind problems. Definitely worth playing.			"

												Do not buy this game, I got it on the steam sale when it was $5 and because i enjoy the show. After playing for a bit i intially enjoyed the game given it's set backs of a plethora of glitches and bugs. Such as my vechicle randomly de-spawning as i'm driving along and leaving me stranded in the middle of a mob of enemies, weapons randomly dissapearing from my loadout then re-apperaring later at a random moment. But most notibly is the Trion Dev's SHAMELESS push to almost force you to buy their in game currency called Bits with real money or else your progression is slowed to a SCREECHING halt after the recent DLC, Number 5 called Arktech Revolution. This dlc, changed the game so that eneimies are now so redicously over powered, you would have to spend about $200-$500 real money to power up your weapons and armor just to survive as they also nerfed drop rates to an absymally low rate.Do not buy this game, do not support Trion.  Go spend your money on something else...Anything else. Literally. Anything else. "

												Firstly, for an TPS RPG MMO, I give it 9.5/10!Download the game for free, play the intro part, get a ride, find your first major arkfall, and join with 30 to 100 other people shooting everything in sight - you won't look back.  There's truck loads of guns, the loadouts aren't complicated, and the loot system is personalised.  The game has heaps of variation, and there's always something to do that fits your mood, from quiet story mission progress, where sometimes people will turn up to help, through minor arkfalls, where you'll often find a relatively small group of people, to those major arkfalls which are usually quite massive and intense.  There are plenty of other types of events too, and your EGO rating scales according to the difficulty of the event at hand, whether it be an arkfall, incursion, or something else, so you'll never be too far outgunned.If you do get into Defiance, I recommend getting the Season Pass, it will unlock many new features, offer some bonuses, and adds more content, but it's by no means required.  The paradise patron pass is good value for money, if you don't mind spending on your games.  I played WoW for 7 years, so I'm used to paying to play.  I don't recommend the Recruit, Hunter or VBI Ultimate Packs.  The character upgrades only apply to one character rather than all characters on the one account, which is silly in my opinion.  It is cheaper to buy Bits (ingame currency), and purchase the particular character upgrades that you want at the time.Pros:There's a lot to discover (including some stuff that might better be explained earlier - spikes and stims)Defiance has a lot of variationMajor events are only about half an hour long, and there's plenty of themUnique and interesting leveling and skill system (EGO)Plus many moreCons:Once more than about 60 people are playing in an event, lag can start to creep in, although I personally have never been disconnected.  The larger events (100 people) can get very choppy indeed at times.  Having said that, it's more common for about 30 to 50 people to turn up to large events, depending on time of day.			"

												440 hours was loving the game. While almost everything was lacking the certain somthing but still was rather solid. There is a reason why I have put in 440hours however the problems have shown their face with the most recent ""DLC"".For starters this so called DLC really adds next to nothing new to the game but rather fully reworking the AI and difficulty systems that the game once had making this ""DLC"" more of a major patch. Now normally a combat rework is a good thing depending, but this one was made to give end game content that little bit more and make it so your level actually ment more then a simple e-peen status but in doing this Trion has managed to make the game near impossible for low-mid level players.How the combat system works is that depending on what your and your freinds combined ego rating is depends on the threat level of the area you are in is. Now the problem with this is the MASSIVE divide it has driven between lower and higher level players. This means that if your level is only 20 and a ego 5,000 comes by it will instanly jump the area threat level to 10 (the highest) and then it will take that level 20 his entire ammo load (ammo load not clip) to even have a chance to kill 1 mob while having to be dodging for his life as he will be 1 shotted.This is a major problem and has already driven the masses out of the game but there is worse to come. Being a mid level player (like myself) ego ~3,000 and every zone you enter the threat level is 7. Issue here is that at ego 3,000 there is no real weapon part from maybe a ground punder or sniper that can kill a mob without using an entire clip. BTW these are just normal mobs not bosses.... Also the fact that after spending 440 hours in the game to build up my gear and was hitting 1st in alot of world events only to have most of my gear now useless is a real off putting experience.End result from this last ""DLC"" Trion seems desperate and seems more like a big -give us money and get lost- kind of deal rather then a -This is for the players- like it should be. The population of the game has plumated and i don't see a near recovery but what i do see is a game in desperate need of fixing or it will go under fast.			"

												It was a good game and I did enjoy it to an extent. The largest problem I had in the game was the fact I kept getting weapons I couldn't used due to them being part of the DLC's. Without the DLC's you will get reall good weapons, but you won't be able to use them. It makes it difficult to keep the inventory in check because of this and to get more inventory you will need to use actual cash to get it, amongst other things as well that will give you the boost to win. This also includes PVP, most players have the money to get the best gear so if you're playing for free you will have a bad time. If you want to win the game you need to have the money to do so.			"

												As much as I would love to recommend this game, I can't.The gameplay is repetitious and extraordinarily dull. The story is, well, boring..the quests are common fare for MMORPGs, they get, again, repetitive quickly. The idea of, essentially, ""rifts""(sound familiar?) in the world that all players have to join to close was cool originally, but there's zero variety in how the scenarios play out- Blast hellbugs, kill queen, repeat.  If Trion wanted to make a new MMO, they could have at leasted evolved their ideas a bit.Another issue is that the weapons don't feel powerful when you shoot them. It feels like you're clicking and boom - burst of color, bad guy dead. Not satisfying in the least.Loot? Well, guns and a smattering of armor. Nothing really stood out. That leads me to another point - The game's presentation feels horribly bland after about an hour of play. After an hour, you have essentially beheld all the environments within the game, barring minor variations. Leveling up and skills? Really basic, not many options, not much class diversity. I had no urge to keep doing quests and closing rifts, as the rewards for doing so, and leveling up, were underwhelming.I had hoped that this would be a great sci-fi MMO game, but it's not. It's mediocre, at best, just like the show it's named after.			"

I couldn't screenshot the original thread and show you the conversation because the developer thought well to delete it to censor my opinion: it wasn't fair to remove the price tag, making the game free to play, giving nothing in return to the customers who previously bought the game, and I made clear how such nefarious commercial move discuraged me from even trying the game.10/10 would get banned again for suggesting a developer a better commercial strategy.Obviously, I didn't even try the game: developers like this can go to hell.I'd rather buy from Ubisoft, and I'm not kidding.

												Defiance was a ground breaking game.  A 3rd person MMO tied to a TV series that was highly entertaining at first.  As with many MMOs that lack a direction, the development team decided to modify things that weren't broken and add crap that made the game not fun.  As it stands today, this game is for you if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over.  If you like to feel like the gun you are using is really a pea shooter.  If your idea of DLC is the same content played in reverse, the same content with more bad guys, the same content in the form of an arena, the same content in a different area, then this is probably the game for you.  Even better is that they can't make that same content play correctly most of the time.  I'd still recommend playing this game if you enjoyed the show.  It is worth a play through, but not worth spending any money on.			"

												Defiance is something of an anomaly in the MMO space. It is at once massively multiplayer, a third-person Shooter, and an Action-RPG in the vein of Borderlands. Its setting and story are also tied to a Syfy network television show that could markedly increase the game's depth. Defiance is also daring. As the first MMO to launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, it claims a first for the genre. In short, the game ventures into unproven yet well inspired territory. The question, then, is whether Defiance ever actually develops into something unique and worth returning to. The answer is yes but with some caveats.You play the role of an Arkhunter: a souped up, AI-enabled treasure hunter. Your “goal” is to search out alien technology to help return the world to its former, pre-alien invasion state. Very little is explained as the game opens. All you know is that you are returning to Earth on a space freighter and are shot down. But from where and by who? You meet a scientist with an “Ark Core” and he explains that it will help him restore the planet, but how it will do so is left a mystery. When you crash land, the pieces start to come together, but ever so slowly. As you progress through the game's story missions, the shroud begins to lift but it feels drip fed and late. The narrative in Defiance attempts to emulate the bread crumb model of television delivery, flush with mission-based cutscenes and full voice acting, but without background it feels hackneyed.On the surface, Defiance looks much like any other sci-fi shooter. Your travel by foot, ATV, or car, meeting soldiers and survivors in a terra-formed and nearly unrecognizable San Francisco Bay. You kill mutant soldiers and Hellbugs and, if you're anything like me, occasionally take your vehicle on a bit of a tear and launch yourself from hillsides. Then the RPG-inspired and elemental-tinged weapons appear, and you begin to notice the masses of other people chipping away at missions, and the similarities begin to shed. Defiance’s two key selling points are its vast array of weaponry and its dynamic content. As you venture through the game, you will come across firearms ranging from pistols to LMGs and grenade launchers. Many of these have special attributes such as damage-over-time modifiers or stuns. The “infector” for instance, is an automatic pistol that causes parasites to burst from fallen enemies. My current favorite, is a shotgun that electrocutes my enemies, snaring them for a few extra blasts.Arkfalls are the most prominent form of dynamic content. Similar to RIFT's rifts. In these random public events, rocks fall from the sky and waves of enemies swarm forth culminating in a final boss battle. At the end of these, all participants are ranked on a leaderboard and rewarded by contribution. Sometimes Arkfalls come in sets throughout a region requiring that you defeat several in a row. As you venture through the world, you may come across other, more subdued events, such as saving a group of ranchers from raiders or an EMT vehicle from a mutant ambush.At its core, Defiance follows a traditional MMO progression model, notably lacking levels and classes. Completing missions earns experience and money which are then used to upgrade and outfit your character. In lieu of rating players by level, Defiance uses something called an EGO rating with which you unlock perks. In practice this system is simply levels by another name. Players still receive power boosts at regular intervals. Perks can also have a profound impact each player's aptitude on the battlefield.Defiance uses engaging episode missions to advance the story. These feature characters from the show with full voice acting and cinematic storytelling. You will infiltrate bunkers, take over cell towers, plant tracking devices to find lost citizens or wipe out Hellbugs that have infested farmer's fields. The missions are varied, entertaining, and make the game worth playing. Side missions are a different story. They are plainly excuses to get you into combat. Often located on the side of the road, you kill mutants or bugs or tag dead bodies. They are disappointingly repetitive and if the shooting model were any worse, I would have called them boring.Challenges, however, are unique. These missions are instanced, objective-based, and repeatable with the goal of earning a high score on the leaderboard. Playing well rewards you with experience and money but the real allure is asynchronous competition. Tasks generally require killing enemies against a timer, surviving waves with a special weapon, or racing vehicles through checkpoints. Although fun, challenges seem more like a diversion than a core gameplay feature.Competitive multiplayer works well, even if it is disappointingly sparse. As with many MMOs, there are some balance issues that players have to deal with. Leveling players will naturally be at a disadvantage to those with higher EGO ratings but the differences aren't game-breaking. A skilled beginner could trounce an unawares veteran but at the most basic level, a more experienced player simply has more perks and better gear.While Defiance nails its most important qualities, it misses others entirely. Trion earns the record of being the first MMO launch to launch simultaneously on three platforms, but in order to accomplish that feat there is an unmistakable feeling that the PC version is an afterthought. There are bugs, missing features, and a user interface that feels cut and pasted from its console edition. To put it in perspective, Trion Worlds is the same company that sold RIFT by trumpeting their vast MMO experience. Even though the development teams are different, this paltry port job is inexcusable from a publisher who has told us, literally, that they know better.ESC key to open the main menu actually closes the game for some players. The game can be unresponsive or even minimize itself. Core features are missing, such as the ability to take a screenshot or open an actual mission log. Even something as basic as chat is far from functional. Quests glitch, often with NPCs getting stuck on terrain. Enemies spawn in odd, out of the way places. Trion has taken steps to correct some of these issues but many still remain.At its core, Defiance is an exceptionally fun game but its shortcomings can be craterous. Defiance lacks the humor of Borderlands but retains all of the gun-hunting and combat that made that game great but the bugs and interface issues are a problem. Patches will surely address these but that does not take away from the fact that the game suffers for its week-one presentation. Even with the solid core to pick it back up, it may be difficult to convince people to come back. If you can get through its shortcomings, Defiance is well worth a look.			"

												Defiance has gone through a few changes since when it was first revealed. For some, the game was lackluster but they enjoyed the three season long TV series. For others, they prefered the game over the show.Either way, there aren't that many third-person MMO shooters available on the market and the game does a decent job of being one of your options. The way you can group up with others as you're doing a mission or world event and leave to do your own thing, all without having to go through the UI to form parties is nice, and how enemy encounters scale based on the number of surrounding individuals is a good mechanic as well.The only thing that'll likely cause new players to have a rocky start is how weapons can have nano effects which allow for more damage based on the type of enemy they're fighting - For example, bio is preferred against enemies with high armor plating while electrical deals the most damage to the shields of an enemy.Besides that, the game is free and can be enjoyed without the DLC. If you choose to get them, you'll have access to a third race, ability to call down arkfalls, and a bunch of minor things that don't really detract from the main game. No harm in giving it a look if you want to shoot things from a different perspective.			"

												Played some minutes and I don't like it...I don't like:-The optimization.-The story.-The system.-The character customization.-The CRUEL players.I saw some reviews, some guys bought the game before the game became free-to-play, they paid 60$ (or € if you are from Europe), and you don't gave nothing to they for buying this game. That's very unfair in my opinion.			"

												This game is alright but don't go jumping into it expecting a huge, massive world with a thriving community.  I suppose you could compare it to Rift (which I've never played) or like Tera Online's Nexus events.  Seeing as I have never played Rift, I'll try to sum up what ""Nexus"" is in Tera.  Essentially, a large number of players converge into one area to team up and fight a large number of mobs that pop out of different Nexus portals.  It's essentially one huge cluster♥♥♥♥ of players doing nothing tactical or strategical.  They're just killing mobs.  That basically sums up Defiance.  It's like taking one small part of an MMO and turning it into a game.  And adding guns.  In fact, you could probably go hundreds of hours into this game and never talk to a single person.  I kid you not.  There's no marketplace and trying to chat with any one is a big pain in the butt.  Just about anything you do in this game is just one big cluster♥♥♥♥ of players running around and shooting things.  There is no need to talk to any one because there are no tactics.  While I can see the appeal of this game to some people, I personally cannot recommend Defiance in good faith.  Go play Borderlands for your shoot-em-up looting fix.  Or, go play a real MMO and enjoy their ""rift-esque"" events.  This game just lacked soul to me.			"

												Very nice game, Alot of neat weapons and clearly was a good game.Downside is Graphic's, Server's and worst of all which too many people dislike about the game... Is the OVER PRICED DLC's.Now the DLC's are nice if they come with good content.A Familiy member of mine paid for DLC but their was no Discription of what came WITH the DLC's.He was disipointed with both Support and the DLC's.He still play's the game today.Unfortunatly, their is hardly any new and decent content.Sorry guys but your going to be dissapointed at my Meta score data...5/10IF you ask me about DLC's i might as well separt them from the base game.2/10And base game ALONE.8/10Edit: I Do not recommend this game anymore because everytime i get a problem with bugs and lost inventory i get bad responses.Its driving me nuts getting responses like as if support is a bunch of robots.They clearly don't care about the players because they are indirectly giving answers.Such as when i asked about a Catylist injector III and they are talking about lost inventory. WTF?!?!!?Also with my farther when i helped him do a report for his Cluster Granade...They tell him he broke it down. He bought it from a person named DSW and he checked his inventory it was not their.SO Why are their a bunch of Robots behind Support?Steam, i am glad i did not buy their DLC's myself...Their DLC's are Money sucking just for free.I Seriously don't know how many others have similar issues but my guess is a fair few.I only changed my review due to the fact that Defiance Support are slack, and are not helpful at all.Not to mention their is no patch infomation on whether the Catylist injectors are removed or not.It hurts me now to even think of this game as its giving me such crap i don't want to play it any more.PS: How is it that i get the highest damage in a Shadow War match yet i only got 3 kills and 13 deaths?What bull...

												This game is very Trion. As with many of their games they'd just be better off going completely serious or silly, but they always choose to go half way and do both. The game's a bit buggy and its a painfully obvious console port. I haven't even figured out how to form a group yet because a lot of these menu things are so unintuitive. The inventory screen is a vertical list without any way to sort through it properly.The vehicle mechanics are actually good and they can be used as weapons. It functions surprisingly well as a third person shooter. Guns can be customized in many different ways however you can only carry two weapons at any given time.Some characters are terrible, some have terrible voice acting, the alien curse words are plain annoying, and the combat music is insufferable after a while.Basically, it deserves the 6/10s you see it getting all over a place. There's plenty of potential here but again, Trion made it.			"

												Pretty solid, playing with my real time friends  and we're pretty happy right now. The charming side of Defiance is it kinda reminds me Mass Effect & Borderlands. Their animation is really good so you can really feel the combat. Also the amazing thing is Defiance's potential. If developers don't forsake this game defiance will be shine in near future. AnywayUp(s).Animation, combat sytem, potential, weapon system, quest system, new guild system (arkfall) Down(s)Bugs (they are fixin' it so np), not enough players (i couldn't get 1 hold and capture game in 6 weeks, beside shadow war pvp is pretty dead) , Small world map. for 9.99USD you can find better? no definetly not.

												A cult favorite of mine, and the first MMO to ever coincide with a live-action TV show, Defiance is a unique MMO to say the least. Trion Worlds is most famous for there other MMO, Rift, however Defiance features a unique blend of open-world combat, free-roaming and large scale boss fights. In terms of weapons, think of Borderlands. Defiance has hundreds if not thousands of different weapons, shields, and more. The game also sports a vast collection of vehicles to chose from including a limited edition 2013 Dodge Charger specifically designed for the vast and rugged terrains of Defiance. There is also a huge amount of character creation, including tons of in game armour's along with some purchasable items such as hats, armour's, shields and more. The grind is real, but it's not a big issue in Defiance because the ranking system is fairly balanced and easy to rank up.I'll admit that the quests are a bit repetitive feeling, but the overall game is very enjoyable and it remains in my top 5 MMO's I have played thus far.

												I asked for help with a scrapper uprising. Within a minute I see around 20-30 people all with different vehicles on the horizon coming to my aid. This game, hands down, is the best FREE game out there. It is very high on my list of games, but it is second out of overall games. I'm sorry but Fallout 3: GOTY Edition beats it just by the story.EDIT: Screen shot of the madness that happened after I called for help.

												Defiance is a great example of what free to play is capable of and what it should be. Literally only 5 restrictions for free to play members and none of it makes an impact on how you want to play and beat the game. This is a very unique game that adds free missions for each episode of the TV series that comes out adding more content to a game that is packed with missions and sidequest to do. THe game has so much lore and interesting races you want to find out about but leaves you wanting more. Now when this game first came out it didn't have half the content it does now and people that shelled out 60 for it might have felt smited. But the game has come a long way since its release and rewards those who paid for it by getting a bunch of extra goodies that help them progress faster then f2p members. Music and sound is decent but mostly forgettable also voice acting is not very good but some funny lines. This game has hundreds of hours of content that can keep you very busy but alot of the missions might feel the same and repeat a bit along with the daily arkfalls. . Grouping up with your friends is extremely fun and even has a go to friend option never being left behind. Defiance shows up other MMO's that it is possible to have perfect controller support. Community is very friendly and often revives you if near. The PvP is a really interesting concept but can't hold up on this game or its engine due to overpowered wepons and unbalanced ego abilities. Easily the best part about this game is its gun and looting system. There are hundreds maybe thousands of different guns to buy loot find upgrade or even be given to after a mission. With all different stats colors abilities there are so many combinations it's unreal on par with Borderlands. I will actually say the guns here are better then the Borderland series cause the guns actually all look different not just different colors. THey have everything form pistols to infection guns that spawn headcrabs and parasites on enimies. The only thing holding this game back besides its PvP would be the servers. They are constantly adding updates or tweaking things so the servers go wonky often reulting in disconnections, severe glitches, and other characters all looking the same. In the end some of the missions get repetitive server issues often and PvP is lacking. It is defintely a game you should check out and invest a little time into.Final score 7/10			"

												I would not reccommend this game as a long term form of entertainment. The storyline is trash. So incredibly bland and uninteresting. You dont benefit at all from playing the storyline missions, either. There is no incentive to do the missions because you get really crappy weapons. Once you get a few good weps, you pretty much learn to ignore everything else. The gameplay is pretty robust, but the missions are extremely repetitive. All you do is kill enemies (all of them) or go interact with objects in order to complete missions. Playing with friends makes it fun, but there doesnt seem to be a clear method of actually doing missions together. You can form groups and clans but there isn't much explanation on how to do other group activities. The most fun events were the Arkfalls becasue they were so chaotic and so many people were playing at once ( easily 60-80 players at once, with little lag!!). However, there is not much variation with them. They are all pretty much the same. PvP was put together as an afterthought, it seems. They realized they could re-use all their previously build mechanics and only have to make a few extra TDM and CP maps. Its really not that fun, unfortunately. The Shadow War looked cool, as it allows a 64 vs 64 open world match. Unfortunately, I've never played with more than 20 people at once. The co-op is also very bland.The interface of the game is pretty much ported from a console. Buttons look like list items and things that are supposed to be clickable dont look like i can click them.The chat is a joke because a.) nobody really uses it and b.) as a 3rd person shooter, you are shooting and playing the game looking at your crosshair and enemies most of the time. People were trying to get my attention in game and I had no idea because the chat window was completely hidden except for a transparent blue bar. I messed up some missions because I didn't know people were talking to me. Really got under my skin.Anyway, it actually has a better feel on a console. I played it on PS3 too.It seems really cool at first. You're gonna love it at first. Play it for a little while and learn how things work before you drop money.			"

												When I first played this game I thought it was pretty fun. Also I expected that there would be more content released but  I was wrong. There are essentially only 3 enemies to fight all with bad AI. The environment is pretty but gets boring very quickly. Questing is very tedious and redundant.Game feels like a watered down co-op version of borderlands. Honestly it feels like the game is missing half of its initial content, this is an obvious money grab and it's just not worth your time even in this F2P form with microtransactions.4/10			"

												This game is great. This game makes you team up with complete strangers, whether you like it or not. If you go solo for, say an  Arkfall, you will die. If you go with a dozen people (which is almost guarenteed with Arkfall Sites, especially Major ones), you will have a higher chance.This game has little to none glitches and bugs for me. The only one I've encountered is throwing me off my car as it disapears while I'm riding it. Other then that, I haven't found anything.I am rather picky when it comes to PvE games. I enjoyed PlanetFall until the major update, and then I never looked back. This game, has yet to dissapoint me. With a great storyline, level up system, and weapons, this is one of my favorite PvE games so far.  The Sword is pretty awesome too.Let's talk about EGO Rating. EGO Rating works so that you earn X ammount of EGO for certain things. Level up? 10 EGO! Finish a pursuit? 5 EGO! etc. This is a rather creative twist to this game. EGO Rating is required to have more Perk slots, loadouts, and to upgrade your EGO Power. This, along with leveling up system, makes this a favorite for me.Leveling up system you say? This games Leveling up system puts you in a square/rectangle, with one of 4 Ego powers in each corner. The rest is filled with perks. You pick one Ego Power in the beginnning of the game, and if you want another one, you need to build across the grid, grabbing perks until you reach the power of your desire. Lets talk about Arkfalls. Arkfalls are special side missions where you need to do a certain quest. Defeat 3 waves, break a crystal, etc. Then, you get the Arkfall SItes previously mentioned. These put you inside a Arkfall, fighting off enemies. There are 2 Arkfall SItes: Minor and Major. Minor ones send you in, you kill some people and bam! uncommon loot, with a rare chance of rare. However, Major Sites send you into the Arkfall, and going deeper inside to fight a creature. You get much better loot, and a bunch of xp. I have only found 1 Major during my 8 hours of playing, which I consider myself lucky to find. I have, however, particapated in multiple Minor Site raids. All in all, this game is absolutely amazing. 17000/10. Make sure to buy it during the Winter Sale, as it is only $5 right now.			"

I have only found 1 Major during my 8 hours of playing, which I consider myself lucky to find. I have, however, particapated in multiple Minor Site raids. All in all, this game is absolutely amazing. 17000/10. Make sure to buy it during the Winter Sale, as it is only $5 right now.			"

												It's the first MMO game I've played, Actually I don't like to do lots of things to reach high level but this game has balancing of the level for people who are fighting in the same area even in PvP new good players can get some high lvl.But the main point for me is freedom, you might have something to do even nothing to do. Meeting with some nice people and see they revive or help other unknown players. Trying to understand people in difference countries because not everybody use English language. Easy words are being used for making new friends instead of silence or racism.In my opinion this game is still not perfect for pvp, At the moment, the new daily contracts are too hard to do. I didn't mean fighting to the monsters is harder but THE WAY TO  DO THE CONTRACTS ARE HARDER  FOR MANY PLAYERS. The Hunter Requisition is the main problem. 3 points per week for people without Patron pass and 10 /weeks for those have still not enough to complete the whole week for all contracts. Seem like Free to play players are forced to Pay for Patron or the hunter requisition points. How about everybody get 10 points per week and the people who have Patron pass get  the hunter requisition x2. At least the low EGO rating might have a chance to get some reputation points from completion the daily contracts which are linked to the Expedition in Alcatraz.Playing in Expedition is very fun for lots of people. Also it can make people have closer and better relationship then we would have a nice social in this game, Don't you think so?I understand that Trion has to get income for running the server and employment. Find the area that 3 of us can go together. The 1st one is you, Trion. 2nd are people who willingness to pay for your game. 3rd are Free to play gamers and other economists.I apologize for incorrect grammar... :(As I said, I'm looking for some nice gamers who understand the difference of players, But not anyone who try to be better.Thanks for readingBorn2BAngel			"

												After consideration, don't waste your money. In reality, this game is the same thing as every other MMO out there right now. Go here, kill this, do this, collect this thing, bring it to me, ok now go here, do this, collect this crap, do this thing, kill this thing, ok now go here....... etc etc ad nauseum. If you want a good MMO, I would look more at other more established titles. Considering the developing studio has been dissolved by the parent company... I wouldnt invest much into this. I am disappointed that I spent the money for the preorder.			"

												Okaaaaaaay, so.They've repackaged all the DLC into a new Gold Edition, but they don't allow anyone to buy a single pack of the DLC by itself, or discount the Gold Edition in accordance with DLC already purchased. So, if, say, you've spent 15 dollars per pack for 4 of the packs, and only need 1 pack, then you don't pay only 15 dollars for the gold edition (like other bundles on Steam which will discount accordingly), they expect you to pay 40 dollars for the whole Gold Edition, negating the 15 dollars per pack you may have paid previously. This is an asinine business practice that seems to be dedicated specifically to getting around Steam's auto-discounting on bundles. As a result, I cannot give this game a thumbs up. If they revise this cynical and greedy pricing system, I may revise this assessment of Trion saying ""f--k you"" to the people who purchased their product. But a far more likely scenario is that Trion won't do anything, I'll forget about this review, and their company dies a slow death that's been 10 years coming, same as all MMO developers.			"

												You can play for about 3 hours before you feel like there is very little to do.  Not only is the ARPG/MMO itself very barebones, not even close to the other game touted by Trion Wolds, Rift, but customer service is practically non-existant.  I have been locked out of my old Trion account for years now due to changing e-mail addresses, and every time I try to pursue it with Trion, I get nowhere.  Until this company begins to show interest in serving its existing customers, like back when they started, no Trion Wolds project will ever see another dime from me.			"

												Defiance is a shooter MMO on the one hand very classic and stravisto in environments, in the design of the game world and the kind of quest (and basically also in the plot). Yet his approach as ""light"" genre, its component PvP fluid and natural, the sheer size of the map and his not wanting to be social at all costs make a title for this rather atypical and interesting. With a graphical more polished, less bugs and a better AI, it would be able to pursue even more ambitious goals.			"

I really think this is a huge reason why I'm going to lose trust for the F2P gaming model.			"

												I always get temp to come back playing this game, but i haven't done so yet. The fact is, every Trion World game starts off great, but eventually they all get worse, due to the lazy devs who ignores the community and their concerns and only seems to care about money. I will list the pros and cons to give you a better idea, base on my opinion on how i feel about the game and what needs to happen.  Pros+Massive open worldPVE WorldGreat soundtrackLots of maps, areas and locations to exploreFun Driving AroundPVP, hardly any cheatersAmazing Story-lineGreat Single Player ExperienceGreat Community Clan and Group FeaturesCharacter CreationLots and lots of missions, questsRandom loot dropsEasy way to make money is to sell loot, trust me. Performance is really good, Quad's recommended thoughCass Ducar is a great character and beautiful for a VG Character ;)  Events are fun and exciting Cons-Sick of glyphNot enough vehicles in the game. This game should have at least 50 different vehicles. But it only has about 7 models, all with different colors lol. No Vehicle Customization Can't use extra mode vehicles Vehicles which were in the game were only for the holidays and special events and promotions, instead of the devs adding them all in the game so we can have more, they continue to ignore itRemoving Snow from Snow events. Their excuse, because some people complain about performance drops. I ran this game using a GTX 550 ti, 4GB DDR2 Memory and a Q6600, the snow never cause any performance drops. How are you going to have a snow event and then removed the snow? Player population dropping due to greedy company and lack of new content and the right contentNo Market placeNo way to sell carsNot enough eventsNo snow event to stay in the gameCharacter Creation kinda limited Character Customization is bad95% of all the clothes you want to wear are locked behind a pay wallOverprice DLCSNo Sale on DCLSNo Xbox one or PS4 port in sightFear of this game not going offline for play before its shut downLoot drops are awful and can be improved Recycle of same guns over and over again, devs trying to fool the public into thinking they are new, but they're not. Same weapons with new names, remind you of something? Yes, APB Reloaded. Bottom line: Either port this game to Xbox one and PS4 and upgrade with new HD Graphics, a ton of new vehicles, add snow events that says in the game with snow falling, new events, fixed the loop drops , new story modes and missions, add new weather effects, expand on the character creation and customization, allow us to be able to use 90% of the clothing which are locked behind a pay wall.  Give us all the DLCS for free. OrShut down defiance, and make a new game. So ATM i do not recommend this game, don't get me wrong its fun and exciting, but once you play it, trust me despite all the content, it will get bored fast. That's because you soon realized all the great content and stuff is locked behind a payment method, then they want to charge near 400 bucks to buy DLCS? Recommend games you should check out similar to Defiance, but better:Hellgate LondonSection 8: PrejudiceBorderlands SeriesGlobal Agenda			"

												I've played it since initial release and it was and still is amazing.Pros:- vehicles (from ATVs to Trucks) with great navigation- player customization (not only face/race but outfits/headgear too, with great variety)- excellent weapons (from heavy machine guns to laser swords!) with visually improving mod attachments- tv series crossover (it's really nice to meet TV heroes and fight side-by-side with them)- great player voices and voice acting generally. Some great actors were cast in recurring roles.I love the psycho male voice, he's like the Joker from Batman HAHAhehehihihihohohuehuehue!- massive open world (one of the greatest parts about any videogames)- creative enemy units (raiders, robots, insects, zombies and high-tech ninjas, they got'em all, of all sizes and shapes)- great story/questline (and a lot of story-like maps in the lobby system)- seamless co-op! (and great PvP for who likes this sort of thing)- constant events and ballanced leveled up- interesting, satisfying, colorful graphics with a solid post-apocalyptic vibeCons:- can feel lonely if you don't play with a friend.- can be difficult to get legendary item drops- some random encounters can be overwhelming (dying a lot a lot) if you don't have enough participants to have your back.- can be difficult to manage inventory space (I have about 4-5 legendaries I don't use but don't feel like I should drop or destroy either). but yeah, my inventory is always stacked.- player-to-player trading can be difficult to do unless you join 3rd party sites and even then you may not have takers- after about 300 hours or so can become repetitive, yet events can refresh the feel of it- the new implants/perks things is a bit complicated, but after you get it, you get it.- Story/new Content DLCs are still expensive. I'm hoping for a 7th Legion discount still :PBottom line: Get it! Play the hell out of it! Enjoy this awesome San Francisco Bay area and ride the wheels off of the vehicles! Also, get a sword and slam the ground! Also, get a sniper rifle :D Also, if you want legendaries, look me up!			"

You'll spend a lot of time fussing with weapons, trying to figure out what mods and stuff to keep in your limited inventory- but I love that you can kind of specialize in certain weapons (grenade lawnchairs!), you get a great ""mount"" very early on in the game that is quite fun, and a lot of the events are not only common but a lot of people join in. Like 40+ people in one field killing giant beetle mutants. Also, lots of explosions. Also quick teleports. I also maybe like to see San Francisco totally torn apart. I'm kind of addicted.			"

												The game itself is okay.  The gameplay is good enough to finish the base storyline of the game, but the story itself is forgettable. The PvP is horrible with most people using 1 or 2 particular weapons and the rest taking so long to kill that the people wielding the 2 powerful weapons will almost always destroy you even if you get the drop on them.  I am adding to this review now because Trion has started banning people from their Steam forums for talking about bugs that have existed since the Beta and have not been fixed even now, and for talking about their paid shop policies in a negative light.  I don't agree with the public censorship of my rights to free speech, and thus I am now boycotting all Trion products.			"

												It's a laggy, buggy mess.  I stated so in a discussion post on Steam when someone asked if they should buy some premium content.  Although I stated it as an opinion, for many players that has been a FACT.  My post was removed and replaced by a suggestion on what to buy response from a dev, and I was banned from the forum.  The show was cancelled by SyFy.  A show that was supposed to tie into the game and vice versa.  That gave me little hope for the future of the game, one of which I had a passing interest in revisiting.  However, the game alone is mediocre at best.  Not the worst thing I have ever invested time in, but it gets repetitive real quick.  My feelings on this are my own, but I know they are similar sentiments that are shared with many others.  And I'm definitely off-put by the dev bullying.  That has never been right, and never will be.  I will never touch another Trion game again.			"

												The first season of the TV show was most excellent. The first few hours of this game were equally so. I played back when others did too. The last time I tried it, however, it was haunted and lagged to death. This is not a combat system that you can lag through and enjoy. If you stumble into the wrong difficulty enemies, everyone's a bullet sponge and no amount of MIRV style artillery and missiles and miniature supernovae will make them flinch. I'd only recommend this game to time travelers, who are able to get it the month it launched and have a riot of a time. For those of us still clinging to this particular continuum, move on.			"

The only thing I can see wrong with defiance is that there are just not enough players. This brings me back to the free to play release being a great thing for the game.

												If you like Borderlands, then you will love this game! If you hated Borderlands, you still might want to give this a try because it has everything that Borderlands lacks. Defiance is a post apocalyptic game where humans and aliens try to live in peace on a Earth that has been so vastly changed by terraforming and everything isn't completely made of tin roofs and signs. You play as an ArkHunter and your main job is to complete missions for NPCs. You can also do side missions and challenges, they are fairly fun but do get repetitive after a bit. There are also missions called ArkFalls, a gaint crystal falls from the sky and either mutants or Hellbugs are around it. After the typical 3 waves of badies are gone collect all the goodies on the ground and stuff your inventory. Its a pretty decent challenge if you play alone but its much more fun and a bit more difficult if you play with a huge group of players. If you'd like to play with a friend, its so easy to team up! I always play games where I co-op and i gotta say, this was extremely easy to connect to. For me, there is very little waiting time for things and smaller areas to load. The game play is pretty smooth although it can glitch up a bit (a main mission's enemies wouldnt appear once for us but it did come back the next day). I find the controls to be very smooth and very easy to move around. Even the driving is pretty smooth, on the road at least! you can take your vehicles off-road and its one heck of a ride. There are some ramps and cut off roads that are awesome to jump off of. Just be careful of rocks and road blocks, you'll either get stuck or explode and be ejected from you vehicle into a horde of badies.The guns aim well and are easy to control but it can be overwhelming trying to find the right gun for yourself and applying mods. Often times you'll have more weapons and grenades than you'll know what to do with. Its a bit confusing and a lot of trial and error and you will have to sell a lot of items but at least you make a lot of ingame money. Although you can buy things with real world money i really didn't see the need to spend money on in game stuff.  This game is so much fun and for the price, i feel very satisfied and to me it is very worth the money (mine was a gift though, thanks Vader!).  I usually never write reviews to games but this one truly deserves to be reconized for its great game play, good story and the amount of hours you'll spend on it.			"

												Defiance has been fun so far, you can play alone and do missions solo or team up in a group to do them, i would say its more fun to play as a group but not totally needed. Graphics are clear enough and gameplay is easy. There are however some issues like not being able to log in, getting kicked out, game crashes but i kinda expect that these days with any online game as none are perfect, Do you have to watch the tv series before playing? i would say it helps if you want to follow the story and understand but not really important if you just want a fun online shooter with some friends. All in all despite its problems i would say its not a bad buy for the price and on sale well worth it and hopefully the developers will keep supporting this game for as long as possible as with good support it could be excellent.

												the last boss took at least 9000 hours to kil him. I played with 100 people and couldnt kill the last boss. He had some kind of steroids that allowed him to gain up to his entire health bar. And lets see how much health he has. it took all of my ammo to do at least 1/4 of his health. And this game is so action packed! 10 missions in a row all we had to do was run past the enemys to talk to someone. Then, we would have to go all the way back traveling at leas 5 km. 0/10 would not reccommend.			"

												As a fan of the show, and of MMOs in general. I really wanted to like this game. I was pumped when the whole thing was announced. A sci fi MMO that ties in with a TV show?! Brilliant! What a great idea!  I tried, lord did I try, I even brought a few friends in who didn't last nearly as long as I did.It only shows 0.5 hours played for me, but that's probably cause I uninstalled and reinstalled a couple times. I'v certainly put more than 100 hours into this. Probably closer to 200. I don't have anything to point out that others haven't already. The game is repetitive and lacks anything original. It sucked me in at first, but once the questlines run out, you're basically just driving around the map looking for group events, a lot of the time, by the time you get there the group is finishing up and you missed out on most of the good action. It's really not awful, it's just not a game you're gonna sink 300+ hours into. The reviews say mostly positive, but if you're looking for a game that's gonna hold your attention for a while. This is not it.  "

												I was first bitten by the Free to Play model a few years ago and have not looked back since.  I have tried many games at this point and have seen them run the gambit.  Defiance contains the polish and content that is worth your time.  I played for many hours before opting to reward the developers with some of my cash.  Note is was not necessary for gameplay or needed for progression.  Defiance has an interesting story line that piqued my curiosity enough for me to check out a few episodes of Defiance on Amazon Prime, and plan on continuing to watch.  It is my understanding that there are codes given out at the end of each episode for free in games items.  These rewards are only given out during an active season and as we are in between seasons I am NOT able to verify this but am hopeful.  The game does not really hold your hand and the community is small so expect to have to figure some game play mechanics on your own.  I encountered some minor lag issues and quest bugs but I have not anything that is completely broken.  All in all this is one of the better Free to Play MMO’s out there.  Give it a try I think you will be pleasantly surprised!!			"

												Review by xTzharkz.Short version: - free to play - pay to win - OK storyline - Skill/perk tree - good graphics - good voice acting - good animations - open world  - lots of weapons/vechiles - tons of quests/challenges - PvP possibilitySo yeah the game is OK since it is free to play. I did play it before when it cost like 20 euros. It is fun to play for some time but then it gets sort of boring because most of the stuff is same. Go there shoot done - I guess that is what this game is about but still, every mission like this.I do like the fact that it was possible to do challenges to unlock new looks/vechiles. Combat system was great. Enemies with weakspots so had to think how to defeat them. Also is possible to just duel with others which is fun if other player is at same skill level.Playing with friends is what makes it more fun - can fool around. Otherwize gets boring after a while.Since it is open world there will be many high level players who are very powerful and just killing all the monsters when there are those events. Which made it so lame because going to event with a huge hype and all I could do was watch those huge rocket explodions. Yeah.. was sort of disappointment.Anyway I still recommend to try it out. It is free. xTzharkz [Eric].			"

												BORING, I ran out of intersting things to do. Now that may be because I had this game for xbox 360, sadly paid the $60 when it game out and played about 200 hours. So when I came to PC I got tthe game again. It had been months sense the games release, nothing new, of course. Same old boring♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got an hour in and I realized how dumb the story is and how much time I would waste in a game like this. Im not saying don't get it, but mentally preapare yourself for some dull action, story and a vast open map of nothingness. Oh did I mention how repetitive it is. You and everyone else will end up doing to same thing constantly. shoot a giant bug queen and her minions for loot, you will drive from arch fall to arch fall doing this, and its the same damn bug queen and you kill it the same way, everytime.

												This third person (over the shoulder) shooter is also an MMORPG. It incorporates skill-trees to upgrade your perks and it's incredibly fun using them. At first, buying this game was a nerve-racking experience because who wants to devote 10 bucks (at the time) to a game that you'll never play again. HOWEVER, after taking the chance, I was really impressed. The free-roam feel is amazing and I finding yourself in rough situations is something that can happen often if you go too far without help. Thankfully help can be given by random strangers passing by. It's challenging in some areas but enough to only make you wanna push for more, rather than rage. Figured I'd write something for this game since there are so few reviews on it. I hope you enjoy the game!			"

												If you are looking for a resounding ""Yea, sire, this is a truly great game of video. Thee shalt pay much of thine coin!"" in this review, then you have not played this game. In my experience, it is a great game, with some okay potential, although this has gone downhill fast. with shallow storylines, uninteresting characters, and an underwhelming ""Silicon Valley"" update (be aware that that was Trion's BIGGEST UPDATE YET), this is not a game to invest money in.ALTHOUGH!The lore and world, combined with plentiful serious moments make up for all of this. It is an open-world MMORPG. You can always skip the main questline and do what you wish. It can be your own story, with a little grinding. Try to make up a story in your head, and ask for RPers in the Chatbox. You won't regret it, and it can be loads of fun.ALTHOUGH! (again)I did not do this. I feel the main storyline is lacking. The only good characters in the beginning easily lose their influence later on. The bad ones, like Cass Ducar, get better toward San Francisco, so just bear in mind that opinion. The show does nothing to complement the story at all. So, I recommend you experience them as seperate franchises.(And the show becomes a bit of a soap opera, so the game is still better.)I believe that Trion has lost it's footing completely. They can only keep this game due to a vast amount of product placement by Dodge. SERIOUSLY, WHY THE HECK IS DODGE SO IMPORTANT IN THIS MULTI-FACTION CRISIS? HECK, EVEN THE ""MARK OF THE DEFIANT"" IS THE DODGE LOGO!Excuse my rant, but Trion is putting a minimal amount of work into this game. The DLCs are pretty much just a few new vendors. (Excluding Gunslinger Trials, Castithian Charge, and Arkbreaker) You will like it for a while, but I recommend other games for long-term. It functions best as an F2P game.The weapon mechanics can be summed up in one quote. DEATH TO ALL PLAYERS -Trion Worlds. You can shoot an enemy in the face 20 times, leaving him with 60% health. Mind = blown. There are no people who do PvE anymore, so you pretty much solo everything. All the enemies have bulletproof faces, so you have to do them one at a time with five other enemies firing at you. The weapons are all horrible. An assault rifle 4 levels below an LMG still does more damage. The tolerable weapons have little ammo, so you need to constantly reload and backtrack 200m just to grab some ammo. All in all, this game is a great challenge to skilled gamers such as myself and everyone that can stand this game. There are really no reasons to keep playing other than that. I'm moving on to another game.Sincerely,Your Supreme Presidente,Mechawomp			"

												The game has a lot of potential however it chose to be a generic TPS mixed with MMO, the shooting mechanics are nothing new and dull. I greatly enjoy this game especially when done with friends also the way equipment works as opposed to other MMO's which have level caps on equipment (as if wearing a level 35 helmet when I'm level 34 will make my head explode) instead you can use all equipment at any level. The most similar game that can be compared is planetside mixed with rift. Note: Game is going F2P			"

												I have spent 522 hours playing this game in the past 3 months, I got to say that the game has potential, but unfortunately there's a lot of bugs within the game that make the experience completely frustrating adding the lack of quality customer service. It seems that they are more focusing in giving a copy/paste response and blame the developers which by the way will never give you any kind of response for any in game generated bug report. So basically there's no feedback if your issue is going to get resolved or not, One thing that I would like to rescue out of this game is the forums community which seems to be really strong and has more lore than what you could acquire with their developers or CS reps.Now as a closing, all this game experience leave me with a bitter taste. Trion Worlds would be definitely a company similar to Turbine Inc but even worst.			"

												I don't have many hours, and I'll probably keep playing because the gameplay isn't horrible, but I'm giving it thumbs down for one big reason. A patch released in 2013 that broke the launcher for windows 64bit users is still unfixed in 2016. On the forums the dev's recommend uninstalling a windows security file that the game conflicts with to resolve the issue. Which means they acknowledged the problem and said who cares. The only other way to play the game is to always run it as administrator which bypasses the security issue.In the end the gameplay has me coming back, but I would never spend money on a game when the devs treat the fanbase this way.

												Defiance's greatest problems are the complete lack of variations, and a progression system that feels like you're not progressing at all. You'll soon realise that there's basically less than a dozen different missions which you repeat over and over again, and that gets old VERY quickly, even though it's fun in the beginning. It also has one of the worst UIs I've ever seen, I can only remember FFXIV's (first version) as an example of something worse.Don't waste time on this, pretty much everything else out there beats this game.

												Defiance is definitely an interesting game.  The storyline starts off well, but I felt somewhat cut off from what exactly was going on.  I progressed, I participated in collective, massive battles of 50-100 people, I participated in the instance levels that came with the game.  It is definitely an TPS and it works well for the shooting part.However, if you haven't watched the show this is based upon, then you will definitely lose out.  I have not watched the show, and I barely knew what exactly was going on.  The military was involved somehow, and the sidequests made very little sense.  Some of the missions were super difficult for 1 player in story mode.  And I was armed to the teeth with grenades and assault rifles.  What really ticked me off is that I would kill enemies in my story instance, use up all my grenades doing so, one person survives and kills me off.  What happens?  The story instance restarts with all the enemies coming back alive to full health and ammo.  Except I have no grenades and no ammo.  Every time I had to restart, the story instance would restart and I would not.  This happened many times, and eventually I was spending an hour on a simple mission, because I had to kill every enemy all over with next to no ammo and grenades.The massive battles were interesting, but there were no rewards other than shared xp (amongst a hundred people).  Also turns out I can explore the whole map at any level, and there is literally nothing that interested me landmark wise.  Everything is almost the same everywhere.  The skills were decently thought out, and the skills as well as the lack of lag and graphical distortion were really the only positives for me.Don't get me wrong, if you enjoy TPS and you have a few other friends who like 'em and you wanna just fool around in an MMO with guns, then maybe this could be a game to do so in.  But it loses it's fun very fast.  In my personal opinion, it was not worth the buy.			"

												Smooth and sweet! I have to admit. I was EXCEPTIONALLY skeptical of this game and tried the free trial thinking I would hate it, and end up uninstalling it. I had just uninstalled Neverwinter, a title run by the same company that made another mmorpg. They used allot of elements in their first mmorpg (Star Trek) in Neverwinter and it felt so bad and horribly cloned I could not stand it. In TRION's Defiance, I was very worried I would be playing RIFT like character models. However, it was NOT the case. I was very surprised at how smooth the character was moving around and how engaging the story was. There are cutscenes and an over all story arc that pulls you into the world and makes it feel living.There is an opening cutscene very egaging and interesting to watch. It ties in fluidly to introduce your character and put you right into the mmorpg open world. This is a hard concept most developers CANNOT pull off. If you read my Neverwinter review, you would see how I was so dissapointed that the game has a great system of cinematics mixed with in game gameplay for the first 5 levels, then abruptly cuts off and leaves you with rinse and repeat quest hubs and over all compelling story. In fact, most games are like this. Or you do a bunch of meangless tasks to hit that one point in the game that unlocks a small video file to show you what is going. But it feels awaward at best and interuptive and more of a ""reward"" for reaching this point in the game.In defiance, this is not the case. The movie starts and then the action and what happens next and how the movie cuts in the game is SUPER fluid with everything you interact with. I was so impressed with how this made up the world that as an FPS and as an MMORPG this out performed almost all games I have been testing over the years. Especially the F2P... I am just blown away at the quality and detail used to create the ""I am here, and have a mission, and it is important"" feel of the game. The publisher uses NPCs that mix right in with the cinematic scenes. It is very generous to give the story telling in a smooth, interesting, and over all pleasing game play experience.When not doing the main story arc missions, you will run across ""side quests"" or live events happening all over the living world. You have open world littered with buildings and forest and encampments well entrenched. There is no stretch of land not used to it's potential to create the living world. As you travel you can pick up these side quests and help some fellow troops pinned down in a persistant battle. You can help link up to a computer system or enter a gun fight  to give aid to your fellow man in arms. These are the ""visible"" side quests on the map. There are allot of activities and war far events that are popping up off the radar that make you stop pathing to your quest and end up fully engaged in an entire other aspect of the game. I often found myself heading to my quest objective marked on the map, only to run across my people pinned down by gun fire asking for help. As soon as I enter the live zone the objectives are displayed...perhaps other players are already inside progressing and I am much needed back up as an extra gun...You see, that is GREAT co-op mmorpg features that bring people together! A live, persistent world always doing things that, if done together (or solo) will reward and not feel meaningless.As an MMORPG this game shines! It also has arc falls that bring people together for mini raid battles. EXACTLY like in RIFT. This is a meteor like thing that drops from the sky and you have to kill off the enemies waves, and then strategically shoot at weak points in the crystal. The more people doing it the better and it was not surprising to get into a group of 20 easy. There are several mission types and enough things to do to keep replay ability at a high.I did say ""a meteor like thing"" because I have no idea what the TV show has explained about these. As a player who never watches the series I was a little lost in the dialog at times. They talk about how it is bad these aliens are doing things or this technology does this or that...I was totally lost. But it is clear that you are human. Earth was attacked. Technology was to blame. And it is now your mission to help the resistant movement or something rather. So the story is given out on a need to know easy to take in basis. And honestly, I like it! It is interesting, engaging, and works perfectly to get us moving along the path. No ""You are hero fighting for wealth and kingdom"" bull crap. A real cinematic and game play experience to push this fantasy world forward. If I had on negative point, it is that in character creation, you have a choice of voice for your avatar, yet he rests silent in the cut scenes. It also is not DEEP as other mmorpgs as far as crafting and getting lost in menus and micro managing your stats all over the place. But it gives you just enough to be deep and thought out.The skill system for example. YOu pick what kind of soldier you want to be and form this out through skills. You start on a grid and start with a choice of 4 points to start branching out in. Stealth, speed, damage, defense skills etc... I chose a cloak that makes me hide from enemiesrefills my shield for about 5 seconds. After I chose this base skill, all the other skills around it unlocked and I Start building out. I can give bonus to critic damage by crouching. OR chose bonus dmg to enemies rushing you...So you start to see, if you are a fighter that likes to hang back and crouch behind a object, you can build this kind of character to suit your game play.If you like to snipe, you can get scopped bonuses. If you like to rush it you can get bonuses to that. The developers logically and awesomely built the skills and game around letting you fight how you want. I have tried so many FPS and you have to do one thing or the other, and in general all game play is the same. In this, you are complimented to play at your rhythm, style, and nature.			"

												This game looks decent enough to try but after spending a couple days playing it, it no longer is a decent game but a terrible game. The game has been out for over a year according to wiki but this game has tons of bugs with 4 DLC with a 5th suppose to be released.The game mechanics are broken in that since you're actually required to shoot the mobs, the mobs love to teleport due to glitches. Kinda hard to hit mobs when they teleport around. You carry limited ammo and if you choose sniping, you will quickly find yourself out of ammo or praying that you take down the mob in 4-5 head shots(not kidding about the amount of headshots). Instances are not bound by walls so if you were to get knocked over anytype of short barriers and into the water, you will die or spend 10 minutes getting back into the area if you are able to get up the shore.The community is worse in that nobody really communicates in this game other than if you are in a clan. You are limited to only type in chat when you are at the main play screen, not the loadout menu or any other menu. You can't skip cutsceens and will repeat cutsceeens regardless of the amount of times you are redoing an instance. There is no actual player class. That is the only good thing going for this game except good luck getting a great weapon for the style you want to play. Some of the other weapons are broken and will not even damage mobs on explosion.			"

												2/6 GreenbeansGame has a grinding feel and loot system similar to Borderlands, which gives it that appeal. It's combat and large global events - such as arkfalls - are also fun, but it is terrible as an MMO. It feels like a really bad single player game and that several strangers have invaded the campaign; other players online will literally see you get into a fire fight, kill some things that are shooting at you, look at you with an emotionless gaze, and then drive off. Also, voice actors for characters in the game suck, to put it quite simply.			"

												I'd played Defiance over a free weekend, and wasn't sure about it... figured I pick it up for near free later. Then I watched the TV series and liked it a lot... so I bought the game ($7.50). It goes on sale on Steam for $5 on occassion - like now). I like it. I just started playing it and I'm pretty addicted. I understand the dev (Trion) bungled a lot since launch, but they seem to be straightening out their act.  I'd call it a mix of Fallen Eartch and Borderlands. It has a good mix of PvE, Co-op, and PvP.			"

												This game showed a lot of promise originally and reminded me of an open-world Phantasy Star Online so I was riding on a nostalgia high horse when I started playing Defiance. I liked the story missions and even went out of the way to do all the side missions. I liked the lack of the MMO Trinity in dungeons and the PvP was refreshing with a choice of instanced or open world.I bought the game for several friends in fact and we all enjoyed it together.2-3 weeks later you've pretty much done everything the game has to offer a few times and up to a dozen times and more of other certain aspects and all the magic is gone. The show is suppose to time in to the game and vice versa but that's all but vanished and died.They did add some melee weapons as well so updates are still happening but at an incredibly slow rate (maybe 1-2 a year given current track record) and none of these really add any content for the endgame.If you're looking for something to last you the weekend than by all means get the game, it'll occupy your time nicely.But, if you're expecting something you can keep coming back to? Look elsewhere.			"

												I have friends who ask me about games like this, so I'm writing this up real quick after jumping in for a short (2 hour) refresher on the gameplay.First off, the top reviews on Defiance's store page are spot on. To sum it up, the game suffers from a lack of depth and the developer's/publisher's detachment from what little game community manages to build up.It's free to try so feel free to try it since its gameplay is somewhat fun (aim for the face, body shots mean absolutely nothing no matter what gun you're using), however I couldn't stress any more that investing money in the DLC and microtransactions isn't worth it.Also as a side note, there were significantly fewer players around when I tried it again (on the weekend) so I can imagine the community's dieing out.

DefianceI really like playing this game! Defiance is now a free to play game so no investment other than your time is needed to play and enjoy this game.  I initially purchased Defiance while looking for something new to play with my family.  I did not have any expectations for this game and had never seen the Scify TV series, but I was surprised to see that even my wife liked it and she normally will not play a shooter, even if it is an MMORPG.Game DesignDefiance has a lot of good design features with it like dungeon/pvp grouping tools as well as a limitless questing network.  The game uses a feature for looting similar to Rift, also a TRION Worlds game, in that you do not have to be grouped to receive loot from a kill.  The game uses Rift's rift (outdoor raid) feature but calls them ark falls.  The game also uses a system that allows players to play with others at any level and still receive xp and loot.  This is a double side coin that can make game play feel very repetitive.  The leveling prgress in the game are not your typical 1-50 levels.  In defiance you level to 5000, although I do not believe it takes any longer than the more traditional level design of 1-50.  With your levels you get points to develope your character's talents/trates/perks. Unlike other MMORPGs, Definace does little to specialize classes/races.  Other than the Castithan race which gets to use a dagger/sword melee weapon, there is nothing special about picking the race or class at the beginning of the game.  StoryDefiance's lore runs hand in hand with the popular TV series on the Syfy network.  The game and TV show writters/developers work with each other to make sure what one does, the other does as well. They even went as far a putting in a gamer's character into the show after holding a contest to pick the lucky gamer.  The GoodI really like the control and gameplay.  The loots system is great.  When doing an event or quest the item rewards are based on your level, not the zone.  The grouping system works very well for PvE and PvP.  The game is interwoven with the TV series. The BadGraphically, the character models could look better.  The game engine is last gen.  Because the NPCs adjust to the level appropriate for the gamer so to speak, the game feels repetitive even when completing new quests. And last, there is no class specialization or specialized class missions so there is no value in leveling more than one character which limits replay value.ConclusionDo I recommend it?  Absolutely!  It is a fun game that is now free to play so you have nothing to lose but the time investment of trying something new.

												This is a gamepad-friendly third-person shooter, that takes a lot of influence from games like Borderlands. Enemies tend to be bullet-spongy in this open-world RPG. You'll have access to your own vehicle after a short while, and you can purchase more than one.  Your character's armor and weapons can be modded by buying parts with money you made from selling loot, or by stripping parts off of the weapons of fallen enemies.  Weapons vary all the way from healing tools to multi-grenade-lobbing doomsday devices.  You'll always be on the lookout for better stats.  This is the functional predecessor to games like The Division, but you will run into players everywhere, and random group instances are aplenty. You don't necessarily need to roll with anyone else. You will bump into other people, and you're on the same side, so the tendency is to help one another. You don't make dialog choices, and some quests are text-based, but the game really feels alive, despite the fact that the story NPCs kinda always just sit in the same spot. This game has so much amazing free content, I bought a $5 hat for my character from the cash shop just to support the developers. The cash shop sells nothing but vanity items and minor boosters. The boosters will not necessarily make you better than your friends, you'll just gain a little more XP for an hour or something like that.  There is honestly so little reason to spend money, the game is so full already, I honestly don't know how their business model works. This is one of the best F2P TPS MMORPGs out there. It's free, so if you think I'm wrong, who cares? Try it!			"

												Its an ok shooter. BUT; considering the sheer number of micro transations in it; it leaves A LOT to answer for.  Its fun; but its far to repetative. It relies too much on transations; I actually reccomended an award for it ""Most Micro Transations in a Free-To-Play"".  I've played my fair share of them; while Combat Arms holds a VERY close 2nd in this catagory at the very least CA comes through with above average connectivity; and well better graphics.  For the staggering $$$ that is being thrown at this game it should have by this phase of its life had several graphics upgrades as well as monster additions and less leaning on the micro transactions.  I can get behind a free to play that has a pay wall or two (fashion and some extra inventory space/faster and slightly better pay for weapons) but this heaping pile of trash can't really even boast that.  Sure you pay around $20.00 for the ""gold pack"" but if you look at the higher tier packs you really get next to nothing for the Breath taking $150.00+ for advancing packs..... Having payed into Skyrim about that for all 3 DLC (and the accompaning hard drive to fit the ever expanding eye candy mods) I can say this game has NO excuse for the Garbage Truck Sized Turd it jams into your eye... it is reminiss of the scene from TWD when Negan was talking to Rick and had just carted away all their matresses... yup.. just.. like.. that.

The worlds are fairly devoid of players. The AI is miserable. PVP is busted. The story is unbearably cliche, even for scifi. Stat trees are boring and unimaginative. It's a grind. A long, long grind.It has its ups. The world is colorful and quests are dynamically delievered similar to a Guild Wars 2 fashion. There's a large variety of guns, but don't let that fool you because most of them are worthless.If you need to get your SciFi fix, then give it a try. After all, it's only $10.

												If you seen the TV Show; Defiance on the Sci-Fi Channel, then you know the story of this game. Some of the story missions are taken from the Episodes from the TV Show. Dispite the EGO System suffering from a Level inflation, it's very hard to get up to over level 5000 and over if you put in alot of hours of playtime. Also, I find the PC Version has a very stable connection as opposed to the PS3 Version where you get stuck after finishing a mission or the Server Timing Out.			"

												Okay I put quite a bit of time into the retail version of this game. It is a 3rd Person MMORPG which ties into the tv show of the same name. I enjoy it as it has an open world to explore, story missions, episode missions, arkfall events, competitive and co-op modes. The weapons are quite varied but they don't scale with level, although rarity can make a big difference, You pick an ego power but basically level up various perks. So a low level can balance against a high level. I find it fun and it reminds me a bit of Warhammer online, which was another under-rated game. Also you don't have to play it constantly to get the most out of it, but can just jump in for quick games.			"

												This game is actually great fun, id reccomend it if you were looking for an entertaining game. doesnt take long to get into the thick of battle, nor is it hard to find a mission to do. Best part,they even offer pvp matchmaking in game, where teams can fight over control points on a huge scale area of the normal map. (normal players can still pass through the area making it harder to find your targets, since pvp players have no nametage)			"

												A game I first played on the PS3, this game is basically a third-person Borderlands. In this game, you help your boss, Mr. Von Bach use ark-tech to do whatever crazy stuff he wants to do. The ark-tech was the thing that destroyed the world in the first place.One thing to note: Rocket Launchers get 50 rounds. That is extremely overpowered. Especially when you don't need to buy ammo, you get it for free. This is an extremely fun free open world MMO shooter. The only problem that it repeatedly has is the server. Friends will often lag slightly when driving places. Or the server just won't work at all. Arkfalls are the easiest ways to get Scrip (in-game currency), weapons, and experience to level up your EGO level. I recommend doing those when you get the chance. Even appearing last-minute gives you rewards.			"

												TLDR: Defiance is a few mechanics short of being an awesome game. But, still very recommended.PROS1. It's one of the few Shooter MMORPG that's a legit questing experience, rather than a survival game.2. The controls are pretty smooth (not Warframe smooth, but maybe CoD smooth)3. Nice graphics4. Open World with almost no invisible walls.5. Similar to WIldstar, their F2P version is the base game and subscribing gives you extra rewards, instead of making you OP.6. Various ways to level: Standard Quests, Timed Quests, Arkfalls (random events), Battlegrounds, etc...7. Nice selection of weapons.8. Although there's no real difference between any of the races or classes (aside from looks), your skills and abilities (like talents) and choice of weapons and playstyle is what makes you unique. 9. You can stealth, go berzerk, throw out decoys or become a blur.10. It's an actual PvE centered MMO shooter! CONS1. Bots2. The AI in the game is kind of stupid...Fallout 4 has a pretty good AI, where you can hide in shadows, sneak, and mob have a field of vision in which they can detect you. In Defiance all of the mobs pathing is the same so if you run around a corner and stay against a the wall, you can gun the NPCs down one at a tipe, as they run at you in a single file line.3. P2W, you can buy currency that buys better gear, and you can buy better gear with real money.4. Vehicle is fun to use but has a slight learning curve.5. Chat is isolated in the bottom right, so unless you're on voice coms, or constantly looking at the chat bar (only shows one line of chat at a time, when minimized), it almost feels like a single player game, with other players running around.6. Character creation is very limitted.7. No real difference between the 'class' or 'race' you pick.All in all, this game is fun, and in some situations it's flaws is what makes it entertaining. It's definitely worth trying out, but be warned, it is a pay to win game (if you want to PvP).			"

												Defiance is a Third Person Shooter action game with MMO elements. It features some fairly well done combat mechanics (namely, moving and shooting is pretty robust) and a full campaign. I've probably burned around 85 hours on it by now, and have a pretty high level character.That being said, Defiance has a lot of problems that I can elaborate on.1. Combat: The game can go from laughably easy to incredibly hard based on the drop of a hat. Wide, open free roaming environments can lead to long range combat to reach an objective, but then upon reaching the objective enemies spawn in point blank.  The shooting elements handle well, the enemy types can be fairly diverse, but with the exception of the very powerful Volge enemy types (think, large metal roboguys who can almost 4 shot you near the beginning of the game) enemies are kind of weak unless in very large numbers. The AI has some predetermined behaviors that are easy to learn and counter for, and occasionally you'll have a lot of fun fighting off multiple enemies at a time. However, the difficulty scales very inconsistently, often going from cakewalk to instant death depending on the location and mission.2. Single Player Elements: Campaign missions are not consistent in their difficulty nor are they especially interesting after having done one of the four possible types of mission. These types essentially are ""Go here and push a button, kill the guys, repeat"", ""Go here and shoot some guys, grab a thing and come back"", ""Go here and do this repeatable quest"" and ""Go here and do a minidungeon"". The single player parts also offer a plot involving an ""Ark Core"" or whatever said plot-driver is and a few characters who are generic and underbuilt. Final boss is a refreshing dose of difficulty, but is both too little and too late to make a huge impact.3. Multiplayer Elements: Coop and Competitive multiplay exist in Defiance. Coop modes have Dungeons and more Organic repeatable missions that reset periodically in the world. That being said, Coop tends to be incredibly easy for essentially the vast majority of the game's possible playable parts- save for one AND ONLY ONE segment- the Major Ark Fall that is called down by players buying a purchasable item through the Defiance store. This Major Ark Fall event features significant quantities of per-player scaling robobaddies ready to screw you up. That being said, the Major Ark Fall calldown is only difficult for its final boss, which is something of a behemoth of incredibly frustrating AoE attacks and is basically unkillable for the most part (unless, say, an entire clan of orginized players goes after it with a very specific technique). Competitive multiplay is by queued instance only, it seems, although there is a ""Shadow War"" pvp event which I have never seen in action. Multiplayer has some balance issues due to the weapon generation systems, currently (01.11.2014) there is a sniper rifle that can charge up its shot, and break appart the shot into individual shots (making a sniper with a tight shotgun like spread). This ""Surge Bolter"" style of rifle is incredibly overpowered at this point, due to a balance patch that made all Semi-Automatic rifles do more damage than previously. I figure this weapon is probably bad for multiplayer just because it can 1 or 2 shot people really frequently and has no accuracy modifier caused by movement/standing/jumping.4. Logistics: The menus are awful, but navigatable if you learn how they work like I did. That being said, they desperately need some serious revisions especially in the Item Comparison department (which is currently, essentially broken). The modification section of the menus, known as the ""Salvage Forge"" is used to modify weaponry to make them have extra magazine size, a scope, ect, as well as to reset the ""Weapon Mastry"" points on a weapon, to make it able to level up player weapon skill despite having been used a lot by the player. The player to player interactions are also somewhat flawed, the ""Quick Menu"" features multiple types of functions that CANNOT BE ACCESSED ANYWHERE ELSE. This basically means that the radial escape menu and the various player menus regarding character are all disconnected from Adding friends, joining a clan, ect.5. Overall Opinion: Say, a 1 point game is something like Full Spectrum Warrior (an unworkable piece of garbage), a 5 is say Dead Space 2 (Working, but lacking significantly in some serious aspects regarding player experience) and a 10 is closer to Half Life 2 (arguably one of the best experiences gameplay wise in my opinion); Defiance is a whimpy 4/10 because of many reasons stated above, and some others I haven't gotten to. I really, really love third person shooter games, and this one in particular captured my attention with the decent combat mechanics and the layers of possible depth (unlockables, however, are all that are left by this point), but lost me because of failure to carry through an enjoyable experience. I still had fun with this game, but often only because of shooting a badguy in some kind of impressive way (see: 360 no scope with that overpowered sniper rifle I talked about), or laughing at my friends when we could make the game's party functions work for us. If it goes on sale for 5 bucks, I recommend trying it out if you're really into the Borderlands style of game (respawns, MMO format, active weapon play, decent combat mechanics) but I strongly suggest bringing some FRIENDS or you will probably never be able to justify the ~18gb of this games overall size.

												I will let it be known i've bought this a few years since its launch so its not as bad for me as say people who had it  at launch but this game still has many flaws within its system and thats not even adding UI eyesores like the chat. But what this game has going for it is a constant stream of activity even if there are times where you wont see another player for a good 4-5 mins depending on the time of day. I'd really say this is a heavily unfinished product, i dare even say its a tv/movie license game at its worst and even the developers see that now that they have set it down to 9.99. Trion whatever the hell you were thinking it may have just screwed you because now as is this is barely even worth the 9.99 you brought it down too and i hope for both our sakes the gaming community learns from this. With that said if you are willing to buy it i assure you will at least get some fun out of it but definitely nowhere near what everyone was expecting before its release.			"

												In this game, you run from area to area shoothing things with no real objective, ever. You get experience based on how much damage you either heal or inflict. The amount of experience gained from healing is ridiculously higher than what you gain from dealing. The weapons you acquire are just garbage after a few levels, and based on the amount of damage you inflict creating a circular problem that is only solved if you sink money into this crappy, crappy game. The story line is horrid, and the reasons to keep playing are limited to a lack of anything better to do at the time.			"

												SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS COME SEASON 2 OF THE SHOW.Seriously though, they are clearly busting♥♥♥♥♥at Trion to get this game sorted for what little resources they have left to do so, but the DLC has been sparse, the greatest ideas thereof have been CUT (No Raptor? really?), and in general the game is still a mess in a lot of ways, other reviews already posted go into better detail than I ever could, peruse at your leisure.Overall though, definitely good cheap fun for $10 but I still hesitate to run out and yell ""BUY THIS!"" like I have for so many similarly underrated and similarly priced products. Well, this isn't the former, but you get the idea.			"

												For 10 bucks, the base game is a pretty fun co-op experience.  Bring your own friends though, because the broken in game chat system won't help you find people to play with.  The story is also decent if you are playing solo, and pvp can be fun until you discover how imbalanced it can be.  Regardless, this is a solid 3rd person shooter for 10 bucks.			"

												This game is great! Bought it during the sale for just $4.99, more than worth it. I haven't tried the DLCs yet though, but the base game itself is epic. There are lots of players in this game, it's really an MMO (for now), the graphics are nice, loot is very cool, tons of guns to use ingame. My favourite part is when dozens of players gather at the same times to participate in an Arkfall. It's really cool. There are also PvP / Co-op missions where players will have to queue for. I reccomend this game, it's really worth $4.99. ~79/100.			"

												Defiance was big on potential but short on execution. Trion obviously cut corners under pressure to meet the deadline, however issues existing since launch (such as a broken chat system, and glitchy and jarring audio dialogue including from the overtalkative and much-despised ""sidekick"" named EGO) have been repeatedly put off as a priority in favor of new items for microtransactions. During the last show season, the new ""weekly content"" mostly turned out to be audio recorders that players had to hunt for - ""live events"" such as the plague infestation were few and far between, which was a solid negative mark for a game premised on fluid interaction with the TV show. The fact that Defiance dropped from $60 to $10 in less than a year should be a red flag to anyone contemplating buying it.			"

												I have too say i really enjoy this game.If you are new too MMO or MMOish type games this is one to get.Its easy to pick up has good controls and good storys and decent gfx.I got it just to try out and i think im going to get the Season Pass when i can.This game is a decent 3rd person action RPG game.And you can get this game pretty cheap on sale like i did, so its well worth the sale price and some!! I hear there isnt much End Game but its real nice ride till then.So i say give this one a go!!!**A little update** If you like Borderlands 1 or 2 game play style im sure you will love this game! Its like if Mass Effect and Borderlands1/2 had a baby and a MMO game got into the mix you would give birth to Defiance =D Ive put a few hrs into this game now and its pretty good if you like alot of action,yeah alot quests/events can be repetitive but there is so much action you dont seem too mind.

												I bought this game when it was $15, logged all the hours I have listed and then uninstalled it. I've taken a look at the game since it went F2P and I'm not impressed.First, all the content initially promised is still lacking; We were told that there would be 6 playable races, we have 3 (with the 3rd still requiring you to buy the Casti pack if you want to select it). The DLCs we were teased with in order to get us to buy the season pass do not exsist. What we got were crappy, half-♥♥♥♥♥ minor add-ons that aren't worth $10 and add little to the game. Aside from Arkbreaker, the one DLC to be worth paying $10 for, the rest only provide you with reskined weapons, new costumes (that odds are you won't want) and some diversions that don't last long for most people. And the type of content you'd expect to have been free (new co-op maps, weapon and mods, reputation missions, etc) are all effectivly behind DLC paywalls, even now.On top of that, your character has little to no personality. You literilly don't speak a word, even when you'd expect your character, who is supposed to be this uber-badass, would actually speak up. Instead you get a ""voice"" that you can change at will, which is really just a bunch of random crap that your character will spit out in combat or when you get in a vehicle. The rest of the time, you'll hear EGO, who sounds like the annoying evolution of the ""Hey, Listen!"" fairy from Zelda on the N64.EGO powers are bland and often make little difference in most fights, including bosses. Weapon stats are the same, and all higher rarity weapons give you are more pre-opened mod slots and bonus abilities on the weapon. After a while the game becomes an near endless grind to get all your weapon levels to 20 and your EGO to 5,000. At 200+ hours in and having finished the game (save for the last boss, because ♥♥♥♥ a solo only boss fight with 3 phases, one hit kills and no chance to replenisn ammo or HP between phases), my character is only at 1,700 or so and I've only gotten 2 weapon levels to the max, so you do the math on how long it's take to do it all.As a F2P, you're welcome to give this game a go. But honesly, even now I don't see it as worth it. Unless Trion drops a massive series of tweaks and updates, the game is effectivly just as bad (if not worse) than when I stopped playing.			"

												Defiance isn't really a bad game. In fact, now that it's free to play, it's worth spending a weekend in. The hybrid skill system allows for a diversity of play styles that its direct counterpart Borderlands lacks, first of all-- the prevalence of the ""Re-Spec"" button and its relative cheapness means that it's worth experiencing the game from all four skills. The game has lots of spontaneous quests that can give more meaning to the world than going from point A to point B.As far as gameplay, it's basically Borderlands trying to take itself seriously. That means a couple things: more serious story, for one, which isn't necessarily bad, but is really quite average. The guns are more bland as well, to fit the 'seriousness', which in turn makes gameplay more, well, average. Defiance is a game that suffers not from any fatal flaws but from being only okay at everything it does. It gets dull because there are no highs and lows, only flat lines.This is a great game to spend some ten hours on, sure, but after that progression becomes so slow and encounters so repetitive that it's better to simply uninstall.

												This game is average. It's more of a co-op multiplayer shooter than an MMOFPS. If you wanted MMO features, I can only tell you that these are in small numbers and pretty much bare bones. If you wanted your classic MMO just with shooter features, you will be sorely disappointed.The ""quests"" aren't taken from NPCs in towns (there aren't even any towns, just some peaceful areas amongst the battlefield that is the rest of the map) but they are spread across the map and they're always about activating some things or killing enemies or both. Thing is these quests become very quickly very repetitive and boring. Also, you can do the same quest multiple times as enemies will respawn rather fast after you completed it (which, imo, is very lame and breaking the immersion). The game is FILLED with visual glitches, such as players disappearing from in front of you and reappearing, which looks quite bad when you got a lot of players blinking as you approach them.This game is pretty mediocre for our time. I'd say it's actually a more complex Global Agenda than an MMO.			"

												Meh, it's not terrible but it's not great either.I spent a good half an hour travelling to the next part of the mission campaign, half an hour of driving. Now you might think that sounds enjoyable but it was not, it was boring. Scattered across the map are some optional minigames which are okay, but I just got bored and the missions seem to drag on a bit too long.However, this game has some pretty decent graphics for an MMO, so if you've got some expensive hardware you might enjoy this game's looks. The PVP is alright, it wasn't special, if you've played some of the other PVP modes in games like Tomb Raider and (insert another generic triple A here) you'll know what to expect.All in all it's a typical F2P with a tonne of microtransactions, if you want to change your look it's gonna cost you, if you want a different coloured quad bike it'll cost you some of that moolah.

												I really don't understand all the negative reviews. I think this is a great game, I enjoy it very much. Easy to start, you can play only 20 minutes if you like. And it's free, you know. You really can easily put 100 hours in and still enjoy it, for FREE. I bought the season pass anyways, it's just costs as much as a normal game would.I like that there are short and long mission, big events with about a hundred players, you can hop in for only a few minutes or take part in hour long events.I've played about 140 hours now and haven't ever felt that I need to put real money in the game. I bought the season pass DLCs only out of respect for the developers, and still didn't finish all the mission in them.Locations and events are kind of repetitive and reused a lot, but every now and then I change my gear and gameplay changes a lot with a new type of gun.So, I think the game is worth trying and putting in the first 5-10 hours of getting the feel of the game. Anyways, the best part starts when you get to the second big location, to your 3rd fast travel point.			"

												This is probably the best shooter MMO out there.  The community is actually nice (when they can type!) and people listen and respond.  The action is crazy fun, the vehicles are fun to drive too.. getting air off a big hill is awesome.  And the weapons.. so many different types and all with their own upgradable parts that each of their own stats.It's definitely worth a try (It's free to play, so.. why not?).EDIT:  Just to add a few things:  The show crossover is getting really interesting.  You don't have to know anything about the show to be able to play the game, but it's pretty cool to recognize the races and some of the people in the game as also being in the TV Show.I have to say also, after playing Firefall for awhile.. Defiance is truly a superior game in every regard.  The only thing you can do in Firefall that you can't do in Defiance is fly.. if you put points in the right area.  And all that gets you is a few less hits from melee mobs and a whole lot more hits from ranged.There really is no better shooter MMO out there.  And with all the new content they add pretty much weekly, Defiance is growing and changing all the time.			"

												If you stick to F2P in this game it isn't bad as far as I can tell. However if you want to pay their packages are a bit absurd. For instance you can buy all dlc content for 60 dollars and that isn't all that bad. However they have special sets of armor that can cost upwards of 145 dollars, yes you get some in game currency. Although if I am paying 150 dollars for a game then I expect that to also cover the cost of all the dlc's and more. On top of that if you go with a monthly plan that is another 6 to 12 dollars a month depending on which plan you get. To top it off there will always be more packages to buy so a month down the line the new set of armor may be another 145. If you compare this to the pricing of something like WoW where it is 20 for a combined package of all previous WoW items and then 60 to 70 for the new expansion and then something like 6 to 12 a month and thats it then the pricing in Defiance is just absurd. It's a shame too because it really has the MMO Borderlands feel to it.			"

												Defiance... If you enjoy an open world, free roam, multi-mission, mmo, rpg style, guns, pvp, coop, welllllll daaang! The list will keep on going. To me this game is like Firefall/Warframe. A mix of Borderlands classic looks for vehicles, armors, and weapons. Ark Falls as you level up prove more challenging and drop goods from beginning to the end of every battle. The game seems to go with your pace of leveling. So however you play in any game, will reflect on how quickly you level, gain awesome mods, weapons and more. Along with areas showing more side missions than you know what to do with. Group up with 1 to many people or run like a lone wolf. You like racing? Alone? This game has it... putting you up against the world of players on the leaderboards. PVP your style? Defiance has got it! Mind you this game has its bugs, quirks and lag points. Like with any game you find yourself immerced in an open world of gliches and lag spikes along with a rich world of never ending adventures! So with that, hope to see y'all on the battlefields of Defiance! ~D (Admiral Hawke - Defiance)(Now, NSI-DiabolicaHawke, Founder of NSI Nothing Stops Insanity)			"

												This ain't the best game around, but it is a fun experience.The chatbox is annoying, but the devs said they would update that soon.Other than that there's a lot of fun to be had.There's a lot of focus on combat and driving around ( you start out with a quad and you can buy some faster vehicles later)You can choose from 2 different races ( 3 if you purchase the DLC that's coming out soon)Also the game had a recent price drop so it's now (only) €9.99			"

												Ignore the metacritic ratings for they are not even close to this games real rating. The real rating should be around an 84. Defiance (in my mind) sounded too good to be true, and also since movie/TV show tie-ins usually suck i wasnt counting on defiance being as good as it acctually is. The shooting is solid. Maybe not the best in the world but its still up there with most third person shooters. The story, although ""meh"", has some pretty good characters. The voice acting is usually on par with the characters but could have been done a bit better. The amount of guns in the game is amazing! It's almost borderlands MMO style and finding new guns to use is never a hard task. Either way you look at it defiance (though rough in some areas) shines in a sea of TPS MMO's. With its lack of any subscription fees makes it all the more enjoyable. All-In-All it's better than wow, nuff said.			"

												I have played this game from the begining. And let me tell you it has been a bumpy ride, but i think that things might be getting better. With the last few patches alot of the gameplay has improved. In the begining i gont know how many times that i was just totally owned by every random encounter i passed. Not fun, there was alot of rage quitting involved. But i just played for 4 or 5 hours straight the other nite and it was very enjoyable.  I am still exploring the whole new free to play experience but so far it seems to be ok.			"

												The game was a Mix of Sandbox Mass effect 1 playability with a healthy dose of Borderlands weapon systems, the story line is deep and worth following and replayability was very high as the events are different every time as player characters are the random element.Cash shop is has become PAY TO WIN only real life cash required.There are quite a few bugs still not removed from the game and the chat /GUI has a console feel but its being reworked. Bugs that never got fixed and escalated..Over all i'd say this game is worth a 3/10After the changes between the second last and Last expansion i can no longer recommend this game, Trion literally destroyed a lot of the gameplay and made the game Pay to Win ...Stay clear			"

This game is no where near as bad as neverwinter, not to hate on neverwinter fans. Anyway great concept, upgrades for a special ability, balanced gameplay, nice looking characters, nice character creation even though it doesn't have as much variety as other games like saints row, it still gives you enough to make an appealing character.

												It's OK. I dont like the fact you have to buy the game and there is still a micro transaction store. Games that do greedy stunts like this usually fail and this game is no exception. The only cash shop items that matter are the item boxes and those can be obtained in game. So it is not P2W but is highly pay to accelerate. Most of your customization also comes from the cash shops.Aside from that its not bad the guns are fun to shoot and there is alot of variety. The mmo aspects seem to be lacking, but you can join in on a mission in progress as they are not instanced. I have not played long enough to comment on the end game content.It is also very repetitive. Seven hours in and can already feel the grind. There is hardly any variety in the mutants you have to kill in this game and it gets very bland and boring quick.			"

												Have you ever played a kind of bad game then still play it for some reason? This is one of those games.This MMO is set in the future. Humanity was forced to have literal illegal aliens migrate to their planet and technology greatly prospered. But however, there is one faction that is like so damn xenophobic. It is the Dark Matter. Dark Matter are these cool looking space xenophobes who make up the alien races that came from the collection of illegals. Honestly, I think my favorite MMO villains are the Dark Matter. Plus, they have giant robots. Pros:PvP is easy as hell. Just get a radioactive SMG and a grenade launcher. I once got this amazing score by blowing up almost the entire enemy force. They all cloaked and for some reason decided to go in this corridor where I was. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was being looked at so I fired a couple of grenades and detonated them. Got a couple of kills so I proceeded to then just blow the HELL out of that corridor and got more kills. Explosion simulator 10/10The enemies are pretty cool. First we have cybernetic miners who for some reason are very hostile. Next we have mutants. The mutants are a huge threat. They seek to invade D6 like their communist brethern. Woops, wrong game but still...they're pretty much a threat. And finally, we have these giant space armored guys who for some reason remind me of something that I can't even think about. Oh, right! They remind me of the Combine Empire. We also have these space robots who basically robotify you from inside-out. Scary as hell.Cons:The Loot System has some problems. For some odd reason the game reminds us of Borderlands yet there isn't any notice-able gun variety. The quests are very dull at a certain point. Reputations are easy/hard to acquire for some reason to me.My 100% organically grown oranges disapprove of the cons. Ergo, it is a con.The Final Verdict:This game has that weird attraction. It most likely will attract you back if you think about it. Anyways, this game is recommended if you just want to have fun. Believe me if you will, this game is as easy as cooking Meth in PAYDAY 2.

												This game is amazing and fun. IT would be a lot better if I did NOT have to deal with constantly fighting with Glyph launcher. I dont see the point in having it available through Steam and be forced to have ANOTHER game launcher when Steam is more then enough. Even though you have to install a un needed program, this game is still worth playing. I would how ever mention that you should watch the show before playing. Otherwise you might feel a little lost in the game			"

												Defiance, here are my thoughts on this Massivelly multiplayer bro shooter. Defiance was a licensed collaboration between Trion World and  the SyFy chanel. Becuase of that fact this game was well funded, but i also think this game may have held back by it's telivision roots. In television ideals and designes have to work within budget, anything to expensive to recreate on television ends up on the cutting room floor. Fast forward to 2015 when the show was cancelled, now the team at Trion Worlds can do what ever they want, so what have they done?Here is my opinion!

												Defiance is labeled as an Action, Massively Multiplayer, RPG game.  Although it's a MMO without the usual MMO game subscription, the 3rd person combat action mechanic is comparable to pure 3rd person shooter games out there today such as Ghost Recon Future Soldier and Dead Space III.  On the RPG side, it's a bit reminiscent of Borderlands I-II, Dead Island and of course Dead Rising II OTR in terms of the questing, collecting items and...

PvE is where the game focuses on. But again there will be a lot of loot you're unable to use without the expansions.The absolute most annoying thing is the newest update. There is an item in game called a cyber rig. It allows you to enhance your style of gameplay. The issue is unless if you're willing to pay the company money, you will not be able to get this item except for 3 times a week. Even if you're successful on the missions, its still only a chance. If you fall in battle it cost another token to continue. Horrible way to make the cyber rig in the game and giving yet another way for pay2win players an advantage in PvP.			"

												I've only played Defiance for about an hour now, but I'm already well into downloading this game patch, and I feel I know the game well enough to write up a review.Defiance is a neat data entry simulator where you go to http://orcz.com/Defiance:_Arkfall_Codes and enter 120 of those codes into the Defiance website. Once you've done that, you've won the game! :DYou can continue patching after you've beaten the game. I guess that's like new game plus or something. Right now I'm making a neat Minecraft village while the patch continues. You should see it; it's pretty cool.In conclusion, I would recommend Minecraft for anyone looking to make tiny forts while stuff downloads. :3			"

												Defiance. Have you watched the TV series? Cool, you'll probably be one of the people who understands why that's the name of this game, because there are suprisingly few allusions to it in the game of the same name. That's fine with me, but if I hadn't have watched the show I guess I'd still be wondering if it was one of those gritty, angst-ridden titles that never really lives up to what the Dev's have delivered. Don't get me wrong, I have really enjoyed the time I've put into Defiance so far, and will continue to put in because I am keen to see how it all plays out, but this is a game that definitely has it's great points and also areas where it deserves more work.I have a realtively shallow background when it comes to MMO's, so I was pleasantly surprised to find one that for the most part felt like a single-player with other people running around going about thier daily lives. Being free-to-play is what drew me in in the first place, as I'm currently fascinated with what kind of stuff people consider to be worth absolutely nothing at all (a strange concept considering the amount of work that goes into making a game), and quickly fell victim to the (obviously successful) not-so-micro puchase system. I blame one of my mates who I convinced to play with me, as I probably wouldn't have bouth the DLC if he didn't, thinking that maybe it would have unlocked other territories or given me extra loot capacity, and I was very dissapointed when that was not the case for $20 (AT HALF PRICE!) worth of investation. Yeah I got extra missions and daily currency, but it basically amounted to sweet-♥♥♥♥-all in the grand scheme of things.On the upside though, cutscenes in one-off co-op missions is very enjoyable, especially when they are often funny (in a Borderlandsish way), and they don't seem out of place with the main missions so you start getting a real feel for the characters. In short, Defiance is worth the 14GB download just to play the series missions if nothing else, but I doubt you'll be able to help yourself from getting out and about if you go in with that intent...Key bindings were pretty easy to configure to suit my usual play style, although I'm yet to find a better place than Alt for dodge because I'm not used to being spoiled for choice, having both dodge AND jump. I haven't really played around with in-game voice, but Raidcall seems to be the common theme amongst the clan I hooked up with. That's also something worth a mention - there are good bonuses to being in a clan and having friends. Being able to teleport to them any time you like is the one I have used the most, but you can also recieve boons just from being in a clan. I found this to be a novel concept, and the navigation thing helps get bulk numbers fast for the good instances.There's probably heaps more I could waffle on about, but the main things are that it's a 3rd person shooter with a pretty straightforward RPG system (the most intense decision you'll have to make is what outfit shows of your characters boobs the best), basically troll-proof, and it's free. Why not eh?			"

Today I'm uninstalling it because they failed to send me the authentification code for over an hour, although i used the same ip adress, and checked remember my location. Useless login options.

												Ignore all the people complaining about DLC or being a crap game etc. The game all in all can be harshly argued its pay to win due to some things not being available without paid dlc but in most cases you can work around that fairly easily if you put in the time. The game as a whole is great, little buggy and laggy from the massive amount of people in one place but it's tolerable. There's tons to do and a ton of diversity as far as weapons and (sorta) mobs. Thing is though the game gets stale STUPIDLY fast especially if you're alone. There's random world events and dungeon things you can do but you'll quickly go through hundreds of them within your first few hours of playing and you'll think ""Hm, wonder if there's anything new"" and then you'll realize no, there isn't. I played on XBOX first and the game was great but again, I found myself running around with no real goal in mind and couldn't get back into it			"

												I'm gonna go with a pros and cons type review so here it ispros:-There is a variety of missions, side missions, races and rampages-Many guns(YES)-Vehicles and if you are too lazy, quick transports -Nice (but not too detailed) character creation (not the best but still nice)-You actually need to level different kinda weapons to level up so you get to experience different combat styles -You can choose between various voices for your character-Team work isn't necessary unless you need to do co-op maps-PvP is challenging(which is a necessity)-Missions to level up make you experience different sides of the gameCons:-Help desk isn't very useful (it hasn't been for me at least)-Team work can suck because of certain player types-You can pay to be superior to other players-The game starts to repeat itself after a while especially once you have done the main missions-BuggySo all in all, you can enjoy yourself playing the game but get ready for the rocky parts of the road.

												Played it for a while. It's a pretty good game altogether, but not my taste. I prefer shooters where cover and headshots really impact the game, but this game does neither. Sure, headshots give double damage, but the enemy still needs 30 shots to go down. I can see how many people would like this game, but I personally don't. I'm giving it a positive review because I think it's very solid, good lore, good enemies, nice variety of weapons, impressive online experience (playing with others actually increases enjoyability, which is rare in mmo shooters nowadays), massive world to explore and a pleasing visual art style. I dislike it personally due to a lack of direction at the beginning, as I came for a mount promotion from another game, and I dislike how the interactions with npc work (stale animations, almost no cutscenes, straightup lame characters at times) and having a hard time to find places for me to level have made this game a bit cringy to me. I advice you to play it nontheless, because I think people could enjoy this enough to sink a quick 300 hours into it.			"

												To be honest overall, this isn't really a bad game in general, though it should still be noted that this WAS a retail game gone to a free-to-play format now but don't let that alarm you, as for me at least the whole ""pay to win"" concept doesn't exist in this game, unless you count that for looking for flashy and in style from the game itself.However the only main issue I'm really getting from this game overall is some lag issues here and there forcing me to miss most of my shots when they should have been registered client-side as the game seems to think I'm just standing still server-side when I'm actually moving, aiming, and shooting client-side.Besides that and whatnot it wouldn't be a terrible idea to try this game out, however I would at least get far and play the game long enough to understand at least SOME concepts of it before considering on purchasing some of the content this game has to offer such as the season pass, but I still have much to look into the other purchasable content other than simple cosmetics.So yeah no I wouldn't deem this a terrible game just because of some of the lag issues and it's a ""bullet-sponge"", honestly anyone who's complaining about a game being a ""bullet-sponge"" more than likely only has the poor tastes along the generic lines of battlefield and/or CoD which still just essentially and sadly reskin, remodel, and reuse the same things under a new cover.

												Im here to warn you that if you want to have the most fun with this game, prepare to shell out an extra 10 dollars for the arkbreaker dlc, as many guns are restricted from use unless you have it. There are things in game called ""Major Arkfalls"", which are very fun, but you need the arkbreaker DLC to summon one, and use many of the guns you get as a reward. Otherwise, you wait around for someone WITH the DLC to come along and activate, which sometimes could take up to 20 minutes. Like I said, don't get unless you will buy Arkbreaker DLC or have a friend with it that will play with you.			"

												Let me start off by saying that Defiance gets more of a bad wrap than it deserves. Let me just get the negatives out of the way first. It's true the game is far from perfect, and there are better MMOs out there. It's also true that it is basically a watered-down Borderlands. With the upcoming switch to f2p for the game, as a Deluxe Edition early buyer, I'm more than a bit disappointed, and I feel that loyal players deserve more than what Trion is giving them after this change. It's sad that after already having to buy things in the cash shop from the very beginning, the players that paid 60 dollars for the game still aren't getting completely compensated when all they are giving them are a few extra inventory slots and a few character slots. Character slots should be unlimited for those that bought the game in my opinion, and the game needs to increase its inventory slots overall, because the number you were given pretty much made you want to buy the expansion in the cash shop long before the game went f2p. Now that I got that out of the way and off my chest, I will tell you why this game is very dear to my heart.The TV show is extremely entertaining and is a great show. The events from the game that tie into the show make you feel like you are part of the world's history, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, it is rare to find an MMO with a storyline, and this game does this extremely well using cutscenes. Defiance isn't genre defining, but it's definitely a fresh take on the gameplay from Borderlands, as the first game to be connected with an on-going summer TV series. It's kind of fun to have an MMO version of Borderlands, which I always felt like Borderlands felt like an MMO without players. The game has had a few glitches here-and-there, but nothing really game-breaking has ever occured in the many-many hours I've spent playing this game. The characters in this game are charming and memorable, which is more than you could say for the characters in the vast majority of MMOs. The cutscenes allow characters to express personality, and the voice actors do a good job of breathing life into the NPCs. As far as MMOs go, I could see if the hate towards this game was because of the always-existing cash shop, but most of the hate seems to be directed at the gameplay. The gameplay is not bad, it just needs a tad bit more polish. This game is worth giving a chance. While it may not be for everyone, enough players have fallen in love with the game's charm to allow it to survive this long despite the struggle to keep players interested. The TV show is doing fairly well, and hopefully by going f2p, this will allow people to experience the game and see what has charmed so many people into sticking with a game that often gets more negative reviews than it deserves. The game sets out what it intended to do for the most part, but as of right now, there are no incentives to play as the other races, so hopefully specialty missions will be added in the future. If you only intend to play through the story of the game, you have nothing to lose. It isn't a bad game, and deserves more love than it gets.			"

												TL;DR:  Worth picking up if you find it on sale.This game pleasantly surprised me.  I managed to pick it up on Steam Summer Sale for 50% off.  It gets -slightly- repetitive while levelling, but no where near as much as most MMO / Grindfests.  It mixes MMO / 3rd-Person Shooter exceptionally well, and it doesn't try to force you to work with people (you can run through the entire storyline solo).  It's multiplayer offers several different modes of PvP combat, Co-Op missions, and a Rift-Like system called ""Arks"".  You are an Ark-Hunter, after all, and choosing to  help your fellow players in these big (sometimes massive) battles is rewarding both visually and inventorily.  Also, Vehicles!  In an mmo.  Summonable, like mounts, but vehicles!  And they act properly like vehicles.  That's almost a miracle.All of that said, this game is still pretty easy to put down.  Despite everything I like about it, I don't think I would be nearly as happy with the game if I had paid full price.  For everything it does that is unique, there are 2 other things copy and pasted from previous MMO's.  I suppose that's to be expected.The characters can be a little dry at times, but the storyline is solid.  Character creation is GREAT for a FPS, and Lacking for an MMO.  Buy it if it's on sale.  It's worth it.  I don't recommend paying full price.			"

												So far I like it. Looks super, sounds ok and feels great! Is fun to own mutants and gameplay is good, even for casual player like me.I dont know anything about society yet, but for mmo shooter with rpg Im really suprised.World seems to be huge and for short play I meet different types of monsters.If U r bored and look for something new, even for fun this is good. Remainds me MassEffect and MetalGear.			"

												Way better than the metacritic score makes it out to be. An awesome MMOTPS (Massively Multiplayer Online Third Person Shooter) with aliens, and awesome vehicles. Yeah, the story is pretty dull, and the enemies are pretty uninspired, but I have had so much fun with Defiance that I just don't care.			"

												This, is one of the greatest games I've played in a while, with good graphics, and an even better story, along with the beautiful systems that involve level ups, weapon upgrades, and the inventory, it is almost flawless aside from the few bugs, such as the world being invisible, flying away when going on ladders, and the Kith and Kinship mission glitch, I give this game a solid 10/10.

												Like one of my friends suggested - this game does feel like Borderlands with a wasteland-ish theme, and at £6.99 it's a good deal in my opinion. You can either play against players, or just play the story. There are a lot of quests to do, and the map is pretty big. Well worth the money.			"

												To be honest overall, this isn't really a bad game in general, though it should still be noted that this WAS a retail game gone to a free-to-play format now but don't let that alarm you, as for me at least the whole ""pay to win"" concept doesn't exist in this game, unless you count that for looking for flashy and in style from the game itself.However the only main issue I'm really getting from this game overall is some lag issues here and there forcing me to miss most of my shots when they should have been registered client-side as the game seems to think I'm just standing still server-side when I'm actually moving, aiming, and shooting client-side.Besides that and whatnot it wouldn't be a terrible idea to try this game out, however I would at least get far and play the game long enough to understand at least SOME concepts of it before considering on purchasing some of the content this game has to offer such as the season pass, but I still have much to look into the other purchasable content other than simple cosmetics.So yeah no I wouldn't deem this a terrible game just because of some of the lag issues and it's a ""bullet-sponge"", honestly anyone who's complaining about a game being a ""bullet-sponge"" more than likely only has the poor tastes along the generic lines of battlefield and/or CoD which still just essentially and sadly reskin, remodel, and reuse the same things under a new cover.

												Im here to warn you that if you want to have the most fun with this game, prepare to shell out an extra 10 dollars for the arkbreaker dlc, as many guns are restricted from use unless you have it. There are things in game called ""Major Arkfalls"", which are very fun, but you need the arkbreaker DLC to summon one, and use many of the guns you get as a reward. Otherwise, you wait around for someone WITH the DLC to come along and activate, which sometimes could take up to 20 minutes. Like I said, don't get unless you will buy Arkbreaker DLC or have a friend with it that will play with you.			"

												I had some issue with this game initially and it would lockup no matter what video settings I played with. Luckily that seems to have been fixed with after a couple patches/updates. Other then this technical issue I like this game. Fun to play, good story and interesting visuals. It does have a bit of an odd UI in places and for some reason I have had issue using weapon mods but I think that is just a learning curve. Overall I would recommend this game and have enjoyed it greatly so far.			"

												So many bugs...The game itself is pretty great, considering that it is based off a mediocre scifi-series that got canceled long ago, one would expect worse. The battles are fun, there is always something to do, the pay-to-win is not too extreme. However:There are countless bugs which utterly ruin this game and which remain unfixed. The helpdesk shows that they are always overloaded with tickets from players apparently.The bugs range from annyoing to completely game-breaking:- Particularly in open dungeons such as bases and mines the enemies will only spawn with 30 and more second of delays. It is entirely possible to have half-explored an outpost just to find oneself suddenly surrounded by enemies- During big battles particularly when lots of action is going on and many objects (mobs and players) are on-screen the engine will suddenly stop displaying anything dynamic. Only the architecture of the map will be shown. It is therefore impossible to avoid damage from mobs or to revive other fallen players as they simply do not show up at all. The sounds show a battle still going on and the minimap shows everything, but its invisible on the main screen- There is a rather late quest in the main quest line which requires to speak to an NPC near a mine. The NPC could be seen walking around from far away (50m or so) but approaching it made it dissapear. Restarting the quest did not change anything, neither did waiting for less traffic on the server. Such a quest-stopping bug after 4 years on the market is frankly intolearble.- there are many more annyoing bugs but these were just the ones that came to my mind right now.I would like to add that these technical bugs are unrelated to the hardware of my computer. I have an i7, 32GB of ram and a GTX950.			"

												The game is not bad. I played it for 10 hours.As a sniper/assault rifle.The quests are a bit samey, but ok as they are at least in different areas each time.It is nice that as a sniper, I can 1 hit kill with head shots.But I notice your guns never seem to get any more powerful, but enemies progressively take more shots. When I stopped, those e-rep people took 4 head shots to put down, that excessive when there is like 20 of them shooting at you. Or an entire clip from the assault rifle per bad guy. That's extremely excessive for a shooting game.And cover is useless, that's a big flaw. You can pretty easily be shot through cover, and you can't shoot from cover. Your shot often seems to just hit the cover in front of you.So I end up just standing in the open shooting everything, then running to cover and hoping my shields recharge before the bad guys are on me.But then grenades and bazookas ruin that strategy. So I end up ""extracting"" over and over.It would be nice if this game had greater numbers, but less required shots to put them down. And make cover actually work properly.Simple fixes but they would improve the game immensely.Also, I have trouble paying for the game. We know they have already had lay offs, how much longer is this company going to survive? How much longer will this game survive? I am a casual player, some time on weekends only and only in the fall and spring. And maybe an hour each night. So I want the game to last long enough for me to play it fully and get my value for the money, and I don't think I will be able to. Think of it like a broken Mass Effect, a cover shooter where cover doesn't work, guns don't get stronger, enemies don't understand cover and the RPG elements are minimal at best.On the plus side, the combat is way better than say, star trek online ground combat.

												I played AMB 3 (Advanced Mission Beta 3 or whatever) and I have come to say I like it, yet not. Here are some things below that I think need changing...Bug FixesFIXED >> * When you restore functionality to each secondary radio tower (KTAM East, West, South) you fall from the sky after the cutscene.* Sometimes, bullets don't hit targets. (Especially noticeable with manual sniper rifles.)* Sometimes, shots that should be missed, hit.Things to Improve* Textures. They look okay for mid-HD range, but not high-end HD (1080p+) range where they can have washed out edges, etc.* The sun. It's basically a blurry blob when at the edges of the horizon.* Render Distance of players and enemies. I don't like how enemies and players look like they're slo-mo / lagging at large distances. That said, sniper rifles are useless when trying to see enemies far off, because the render distance for entities is so low.* Culling. Get rid of it.* Enemy AI Line of sight. It pains me to note that cloaking gets rid of aggro, yet going behind buildings doesn't reduce aggro when alone at all. Come on guys, we aren't Minecraft.Things to add* Unique skills / etc. for each class chosen. For instance, the machinist could have an activated skill that places a dispenser of sorts similar to that of Team Fortress 2 so that players don't have to go all the way to the nearest ammo refill point. Veterans could have a passive that makes them better at LMG spread (more accuracy) without the need for perks.* An auction house system to trade directly from scrip to bits and vice versa. As well as an auction house to bid / buy out items / mods, etc. The AH would be a stand-alone EGO via a holographic emitter of sorts in each major NPC village (including the starting one near the crash site.)* An explicit mod attachment tutorial.

												At first I was interested in playing this game, and once I saw it become free I jumped on like many other people. The first hour or two was a blast with my friends, until we were bombarded by unimaginal lag and server problems. My friends stop playing at that point out of frustration, however I wanted to be able to continue on so I played alone. I enjoyed my time for slightly longer until I was hit with glitches in the game which make it apparently unplayable for people who use AMD processors. My computer froze up a total of 3 times before I became fed up with the game. When I looked it up to see what the problem was the only answer was to update my drivers. Doing this gave my computer the blue screen of death. This game was enjoyable for the short time I played it, but i felt like i was playing a pre-alpha with all the crashing. Honestly i expected more from a game that used to cost $60.			"

 ENABLE THE WINDOWS WORKSTATION SERVICE! This game does work and it is worth the trouble to play it.I've followed every suggestion from Installing DirectX, deleting logs, adding .dll files, installing and launching from Glyph Launcher, Firewall and Router settings, adding appdata folders, down to attempting to play on all realms NA EU and PTR. I've even pinged the game servers with CMD and returned 54 57.. By far the worst option was to steam verify the files... The game disappears and users must redownload / install the game... The glyph launcher will even forget the user and they'll need to login download / install updates again. I've spent 100+ hours and 100+GB of data attempting to install this game properly... Every time thus far I get ""Critical - The Defiance service is not available. Please try again later."" a message box at the front screen... So I just installed from an actual steam gift of Defiance complete with a game code for the first time but a second time in total and have allowed the steam game verify cache to download an additional 14GB of files it wanted.. ""77 files missing"" from verifying steam game cache... Still the same error...  So I adjusted my firewall and admin settings and then verified the game cache once more... Now it is downloading another 7.6GB but this time it called it an ""UPDATE"". Now the Glyph launcher has forgotten my login... and I am downloading the same 500Mb patch I already downloaded... Just waiting to launch Defiance and either play the game or check the DefianceStartupLog once more and then verify steam game cache if it goes critical... Yeah it went Critical so I am now downloading the ""Missing 77 files"" for the second time... where did they go when I downloaded them the first and second time? Counting the first installation and now this gift installation this will be the fourth time I've downloaded the 14GBs of the game... The 8.8 Hours I have spent ""Playing"" this game have all been hours I've spent Trubbleshooting defiance either in the launcher or the Defiance Critical service not available game screen to try again or quit. Now since that didn't work I am downloading the PTR through the glyph launcher that steam defiance play opens... Maybe the PTR will work... After this I am not downloading ANY MORE OF THIS GAME! I am done.Well now that I have enabled the Workstation Service... Allow me to tell you that this game is worth all of the trouble to actually play it.  Closest like game is Borderlands. It is a Borderlands MMO. Tonz of monsters to kill with many different weapon types while navigating a wasteland via ATV / Off-road Vehicles alongside 15 to 50+? other players. It's a follow the leader open world repeatable mission filled action packed non stop explosion in your face WAR. I've never heard more weapons being fired at once in any other game I've ever played.

												Game sucks. Played the game for about 2-3 hours and realized that the amount of lag is not worth playing the game. If you do play this game, you will get a mission every 1-3 minutes, nonstop. The waypoint finding in this game is terrible, it takes atleast a minute to place a waypoint. After a couple of missions, you get a car. Spawning in the car takes a minute or two. The only problem with the car is that it will despawn whenever you render in a lot of enemies or other things.I just find this game terrible.			"

												Defiance is great for what it is, Giant monsters and fun guns. Wouldn't say the story line is the best, however if you are looking for a casual game to play with some friends that just want to run around and kill giant monsters with a large number of other players, this is the game for you. However if you are looking for a game to be the one MMO you play for a long time you may want to look elsewhere as sometimes the game gets fairly repetetive by doing alot of Arkfalls. They seem to release new content fairly often as well. Overall, I'd say pick it up with some friends, its well worth the low price.			"

												Defiance is an AMAZING open space third person rts real time mmo moba shooter board game. It ticks all the boxes right, and I knew I was in for a treat as soon as I read the 40 Page Manual. The attention to detail gets to me, if it's the voice acting from Samuel L. Jackson, or even the superior curved outline of my female dragon dwarf mages♥♥♥♥♥ Needless to say, lactating is frequent and often when you play this game. I have since logged 200 hours since my first spontaneous lactate, and it still feels as good as it did the first time. Enough with the dream juice, Defiance being a moba mmo shooter, I was skeptical of it being a success or not, but it took off. Yesterday about 8 Players logged in! This was an immense feat, and the dev's rewarded us loyal members of the lactation nation a free wristband. I would pay for this game multiple times. The replay value is excellent, with over 3 quests to grind on.10/10			"

												Yes I recommend this BUT you should still think twice before you open your wallet.Pros:It's a good game. It's not very taxing on your system and has some quite solid gameplay mechanics. Chat was updated recently and the game certainly feels more alive than it used to.If you just focus on the game then it's very good.Cons:Trion. They don't really seem to care for their game anymore, the people at customer support don't listen to you (from my own experience at least) and it doesn't really seem to tie into the TV series in anyway (which I was led to believe it did). The main characters from the TV show appear VERY briefly at the start of the game and then they appear briefly for a short, optional questline that isn't available all the time. It honestly felt to me like they were just thrown in for the sake of calling it ""Defiance"".The DLC is pretty abysmal for DLC. Supposedly the next DLC will be HUGE with LOADS OF CONTENT!!! But given the way the previous DLCs have gone, I find this highly unlikely. The DLC should really have been released as free content updates via patches rather than being sold for £6.99 each (as much as the full game atm).tl;dr - It's a good game, but don't expect Trion to give a damn about you....or providing DLC worth a damn.

The only thing a little confusing was the Market or Merchant it was kinda weird how you couldn't buy a better gun, you have to earn it through missions.

												Despite what it says, I only played 3 or 4 hours. I was AFK for the other time.Game started good.-Good graphics-Decent controls-Random drops (which I like)-Skill movesBut then... I got to the season 2 and saw what I think are HUGE flaws/nuisances-Unlockable fast travel (visit place first)-Extremely long drives-Weak weapons-Powerful enemies-Annoying voice repetitionI could deal with the unlockable fast travel, fine. I could deal with the driving, whatever. I could not deal with the fact that it is insanely hard to do things alone. I understand that events are meant to be done with other players, but even the main story missions become ludicrously hard in SEASON 2. Just...why? WHY did the make the game so hard that it REQUIRES friends? WHY did they make it so you can't get away from enemies due to lack of cover? WHY did they make the game a ball of rage? I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend the game unless you like extremely hard third-person shooters. This brings me to think that, despite the game having what I thought was a good start and good base ideas, it just brings too much fury into the combat to make it fun.Rating: 5/10 Average			"

												The jist of it: Try it. Move on. I don't recommend spending any money on it.Rage mode activated:One of the worst games I've ever played, and I'm serious. I played this before it was on steam/free to play. It's bad. Repetitive. However this isn't very different from other MMOs.Hands down THE worst human anatomy on the 3d models. At the university where I graduated as a designer, they would've failed these guys with their ""humanoids"". Please, study anatomy before you model a human being. Or at least look in the mirror.What's worse than the 3d models, you ask? I'll tell you. The animation. The running animation especially, in a game where 90% of the time you're running, you would expect the animators to put more than 5 minutes into it. That is not how a human being runs. That is not how any being runs.Now onwards to the actual game mechanics... there is nothing new to see here.Damage system? Well, they have a skeletal damage system. No, actually, I think it's just extra damage for headshots. However you will still need to pull off 3-5 headshots on eve the weakest mobs to kill them. It's really unrealistic. 3-5-15 headshots for some monster, alien from outer space, Keith Richards? SURE! But you are shooting other humans. With sniper rifles. Point blank. IN the head. Ridiculous.Some say the scenery is great... well, I do like the roads and the fact that you get a pretty decent vehicle mechanics, which makes me think these devs should've made a racing game instead. And when I say decent vehicle mechanics, I mean marginally fun, not at all realistic or that make any sense.I could go on but you can try for yourself because it's free to play now. At least they got that right, it's free. Because some peopel paid for it before and they were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Defiance is a game that does a lot of right but the wrongs are very loud. That doesn't mean the game isn't any fun, just that it feels like it's just at its infancy and it depends a bit too much on the show to keep growing. I won't talk about the story of the game here, just know that the main story line is long enough to satisfy most people. Outside of the main story the rest of the gameplay relies on events and like I said, the TV show. With the TV show the game gets episode related content every two weeks. That gives you the opportunity to unlock outfits and/or weapons.The main attraction here are Arkfalls. After the latest DLC these are even better. They vary in size, from what we call a minor arkfall to the Arkfalls in which you can go inside the ship to loot it or fight an epic boss.The game has different types of instances that are replayable and enjoyable. For example, the original 7 co-op missions had certain tasks (pursuits) that you needed to accomplish in order to unlock an outfit. Now they have expanded on these co-op missions by adding previously solo missions, including the last game mission. It won't count towards your story progression, but if you're stuck, it's a good way to see what other people do and get some first hand experience before running the mission again. There's also the PvP instances and the gigantic Shadow War, which doesn't throw you in a different instance. You and your team fight against another human controlled team in the map where everyone is playing. People outside the shadow wars can't shoot you, but NPCs can and will. if there's an arkfall where the shadow war is taking place the visuals get impressive.There are also emergencies which is not so different than other MMOs spawn events and Sieges, which happen at different locations every hour. These are fun ""team based"" missions, it is smart to wait for more people before you start siege. Think of it as horde mode so you'll want to get a high rank and make it as far as possible within the time limit.There's a lot to do in Defiance (I don't recommend the PvP though, its probably doing more harm to the game than anything else, they should have just made Shadow Wars the only PvP in the game) and the shooting mechanics are really fun. Driving is also enjoyable and you can play by yourself but you'll never be alone. With the new changes it is easier to notice when a friendly is down so you can revive them.I hope Trion focuses more on the bst parts of the game (the co-op parts) so this thing can grow into an amazing experience. Red 5 ditched PvP from Firefall 'cause it wasn't working, Trion Worlds should do the same in Defiance.			"

												Everyone keeps giving this game such gripe! My girlfriend bought it during the last steam sale for $8 bucks maybe? And I've put over 21 hours into it, so I'd say I got her money's worth. The game is fun though! At least in small doses. My only complaint is the PvP is absolute crap. But if you just stick to story and killing stuff, it's actually a grand time. The show tie-in's are few and far between though. If you watch the show, it's worth a few hours of your time. Expanded, cannon, universes are always worth your time.			"

Is fun to play when you get better weapon and better stuff and you can get free vehicles by doing the mission it doesn't cost any money to buy them (If you just want to drive a normal vehicles) I rated this game 8/10, a lot of online player inside when you team with them and fight the enemy. I compare this with Borderlands, I can say that Borderlands are really bored then this. This game just make me enjoy a lot then Borderlands, been enjoying playing this game for 30 hours and have some nice and cool weapons. Worth to play it if you like a game with storyline, and PVE with other online players.			"

												I don't know where to begin withAre you searching for free MMORPG wihich actually is freeAll you have to do is grind which is not endless don't expect that we will get anything just by staying afk in the gameWeapons, Armour, Nades - all have rarity and all types of rarity are obaintable for free and we can upgrade them easily whenever there is huge gap between our level and the their levelVehicles - we have to find the hidden shops on map which sell vehicles for a reasonable price not too expensive for anyone or complete goals in the game We can participate in arkfall, arkbreaks, seige for free we just have to stay alert when they are activeOutfits - yes this are also free and there is variety of them which suits everyone's taste just complete the goals in the game There is drop in framerate for me when there are players swarming for arkfalls, seige or arkbreaks so i just go afk but then i dont get anything so i try to shoot aliens around me			"

												Huge pro:- The community. As you will drive around the desolate ruins of what used to be San Francisco, you will feel lonely. If you see any event on the map, go to it - you'll be amazed. No matter that you just started playing, if you get there you will be helped back up by fellow strangers.- Quite linear gameplay.- Huge map to explore, expect to die if you venture too far (won't lose anything, though).Cons:- DLCs. Expect to get mad if you don't want to pay anything for this game, you can get good weapons, but you will get very good weapons that require DLCs.- The grinding: you will be able to pay for your stuff (such as weapons and aesthetic armor), but if not, then expect to grind A LOT.- Far too ammo friendly, you'll never run out of bullets.

												Defiance is that co-op game you’ve been looking for to play with all your friends or family members.  The co-op is very easy to get into and if you want to play on your own you can but it’s just as easy to join other players to clear some missions. The environment in Defiance is beautiful and even with fast travel available I mostly only use it to sell/buy things at the shops because driving around is just so much fun to do with all the jumps, hills, cliffs and a stunning environment that you just never know what you’ll run into, and sometimes that just happens to be the face of a mutant while your speeding off a cliff at 90 miles per hour. Ark falls are a lot of fun to do, and most of the time for the bigger ark falls there is about 40 people vs a giant monster, it’s almost like a rave party except one with bullets, lasers beams, and explosives, and afterwards everyone gets to go home with an big bag full of goodies and sometimes even some rare item drops.Defiance really reminds me of borderlands in some ways, and in many ways I've enjoyed it more than borderlands 2 personally. Defiance is really like a combination of Borderlands, Mass Effect, and some kind of amazing off road racing game. Defiance doesn’t really give us anything new, ground breaking, or revolutionary but it does deliver a solid top notch game and will provide you with many hours of entertainment. If you haven’t given the game a chance yet, go for it, it’s only 9$ and it’s a lot of fun. Although defiance is really fun, it isn’t perfect and does its fair share of bugs and glitches like this one glitch were I couldn’t finish a mission no matter how many time I tried to redo it, until the next day I was able to complete it without an issue, With that said don’t be scared off or be too worried as that is a rare occurrence and most of the time corrects itself so you can avoid giving birth to an elephant in extreme rage and go off chaseing some arkfalls or play some other missions untill its avalible.Pros:-	It only costs 9$ and with no subscription fee-	Amazing Co-Op (or Solo gaming if that’s your thing)-	Replay ability-	Beautiful environment-	Good Story-	Driving mechanics and vehicles-	Smooth Gameplay-	Cinematics and voice over are well done for an MMO -	Open worldCons:-	The odd Bugs and glitches-	Could use more instruction for new players at times-	Pick up’s can be a bit over whelming for new players-	No ability to store items-	RepetitionOver all on a scale from 1 to 10 I would give the game 8.5 Out of 10.

												A decent multiplayer third person shooter, somewhat reminiscent of Borderlands in terms of the skill system and loot. The MMO aspect isn't something you'll see a lot of, many missions are instanced and most competitive PvP stuff puts the players on separate maps.The story is, somewhat surprisingly considering it's based on a TV show, not particularly intriguing, the mission get somewhat stale after a while, but the setting - the overgrown United States after a failed alien terraforming attempt, is interesting in concept. As game mechanics go, it's solid for the genre, and it does get pretty cool when you team up with a bunch of other players to take on the timed world events. The player base has started waning at this point though, and other than the major arkfall events you'll rarely come across any larger crowds. At this point I would not recommend the DLC, they just barely provide what was promised in the season pass description, mostly coming down to a few new weapon types and missions, all taking place at the already existing land mass from the core game. Unless the specific weapon types in the DLC description seem to suit your preferred play style (I did like the charge weapons added with the first DLC), you'll probably not get much out of them.As for the game itself, it's not charging a subscription, and I haven't found the need to use any of the stuff available in the microtransaction store (which mostly boil down to limited time XP gains, random weapon packs - which are very easy to get with the in-game currency - and some costumes), it's pretty solid at what it tries to do, but not as ambitious as you would hope hearing the talk about an MMO third person shooter. At the asked price point I think the base game is definitely worth it, but I'd hold off on the DLC until a sale.			"

												From what I have played so far, I can say I really like this game. There are cutscenes for main missions, if you are into that sort of RP, however your character does not speak. Most people that I have come across are willing to help you with a mission, especially if you are in the same proximity as their quest. Starting off very early you are granted a vehicle which you can use to get places faster, so you do not have to spend real money to get a vehicle. Never going to pay a cent to play this game (or so I think), but I am not having problems buying/finding better weapons as I earn in-game currency for completing quests. Have not queued for any PVP since that is not my thing, but I would assume it wouldn't be bad. I will update this review as I play more			"

												its a good game, but toooo transparent. I like playing only if I have free time. the graphics, and game play can use an upgrade saying comparing to other games that I play on a daily basis. Its not a bad game, but controls feel too loose, it doesnt take much skill, and it CAN be very repetative and boring. The running and walking and even driving feels like its a grid, nothing is smooth and fluid. I can see why it went from thousands of players down to 400, it just lost its fun factor because of that and many reasons. I wouldnt recommend because how it feels when playing, it was cool in the begining but quickly lost its fun factor and would hate for others to buy the game, but lose interest in it from fixable things. It should have an update of the not fluid movements and driving to make it MORE realistic, possibly graphics so its not so plastic looking, the way the guns fire and its effect on enemys plus more.

												Haven't played too much but it was worth the download. It's a shooter meets MMO. Things to know- You can run out of ammo and you need to know how to aim. - Tutorial sucks so look up how to roll and crouch.- The starting weapon is only that, you can use any weapon you find so pick your background based on what looks cool or you like the idea of. You aren't trapped to one weapon.- The main ability u pick seems to unequip after you learn it, so hit L and click on it and look for an equip button on the bottem of the screen.- Main abilities seem to dictate playstyles, don't pick cloak if you want to be brute force. - Playstyle meaning things related to that will be selectable perks.- The Main abilities are Stealth/Killing power ranged/Misdirection and Movement killing power melee. There are melee enemies that will get up in your face so the last one certainly is a valid playstyle.It's fun and fast gameplay and it's free.			"

												Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ, i downloaded this game some time ago, and i played 5-6ish hours ang got bored, i picked it up again because of good reviews and used my controller with it, this game is AMAZING, its fast paced third person borderlands-army of two style combat without the cover system, kind of like a third person borderlands with a rehashed color pallete and a non comical artstyle, but dont worry, this isnt exactly like it, it only resembles it a TINY bit, the game's main story line is far longer than any of the borderland games, and after that they are ""episode"" missions, which follow the story of the TV show, imagine if the walking dead had a game that had no relation to the tv show, and had its own campaign, but when you finish the campaign you get the play through ALL of those episodes, yeah this is like that, but for the defiance tv show, its an allround AMAZING game, the world is huge and their are vehicles, and still its like a half an hour (in real life time) drive from one area to another, its an amazingly well crafted world very similar to fallout 3 with a hint of gears of war artstyle, all in all if you are not a dumbass and if you have a functioning brain you will like this game, oh and dont dabble on the bad reviews, most of them are about how this game was pay to play but went free 2 play right after some unlucky shmucks bought it, so dont worry about that, try it, you'll love it, especially with a controller, love that vibration (that was not a sex toy joke).

												A very neat game that suffers horribly from lag and latency issues. In a sentence: MMO Borderlands. The good: Open-ended world where every event is scaled down to your (and level of those who are with you) level. Almost right away you get a ride! Free to roam everywhere. Great concept!The bad: Unfortunately not as great of a scenario campaign, and open world doesn't add much to a railroad script. Everything is competitive so cooperation isn't really encouraged. You would think twice about deploying damage booster in a middle of a crowd of other players, because it gives +100% damage to everyone within it's radius. Bonuses/items received at the end of the mission are based on what you placed in a ladder of everyone who attempted that mission with you.The ugly: would not recommend. Mission progress is not tracked, and it is very possible to get DC due to lag, halfway through an hour long mission. Very frustrating.			"

												Pretty good game! I didnt expect to like it and yet here I find myself wanting to play it. Definitely gets harder as you play, especially when you get to missions where there's nobody to help you out. The creatures you fight are constantly changing. There's so much action going on in this game, you'll be on you way to the next mission in the main story and pass straight through an arkfall and two episode missions, it's pretty cool. You can always just drop what you're doing and help people out with the missions that they're on if you really wanted to. It's completely open world and there are so many different weapons and perks. It's kinda like Borderlands, but without the comic book graphics. I can't really think of any downfalls to this game, I haven't seen any glitches or experienced anything that made me wanna rage quit yet. So it's definitely worth trying!			"

												Defiance in my opinion is a solid free to play MMO. The game feels like they took the combat stylish gameplay from mass effect added in a borderlands looting system. And then to top it off gave it the overall feel of star wars the old republics MMO feel. The game is much more fun if you play with a friend and keep at the same pace.  To me the game is a little confusing at first. Gameplay / Mission wise if you didnt play from launch. (Because the game is alinned with the TV show defience and is added on with each season. ) it almost feels as if you just dont connect as well with the game.Story wise the game is very weak i probably would understand it more if i watched the show but i just dont want to put the time into the series quiet yet. And another part i felt about the gae that hits the story hard is that almost all the characters voice acting sounds like the producers walked outside found some random hobo and said they would pay for his meal if he did one or two voices.Another thing i must add is character customization is there just minimal.  just dont expect a level of cuztomization like skyrim or SWTOR.BTW the game is much more fun if you play with a friend.So really all in all despite a couple bugs (None game breaking) its a solid MMO/RPG to the genre. And since its free now theres no reason not to check it out. Defiance is a ton of fun and can give you a great time. Thank you!			"

												I don't like MMOs. I have two main reasons for that:1) Mechanics are always pretty much the same, point, click, skill hotkey, etc etc2) Fantasy-Japanese-Medieval-Magic theme over and over again, with silly storyes and sexist characters.Defiance has neither of them. Althought it shares common aspects of any other MMO, this game has a good controller suport, to start with.I know it's not the first MMO shooter, but it delivers pretty well in that aspect, it vaguely reminds me of a MAss Effect X Borderlands feeling.Now, the game has several problems, like being almost constantly laggish, enemyes have questionable AI and interfaces are quite confusing at the start.But somehow this game got me coming back at it.Another good thing is that I find myself useful in every event. In other games, as you join up early and powerless, your useless, but here I find myself on the top 5 players every time.And that´s another great thing, now that it's free. Almost any event or just anywere you're going you'll end up having a lot of other players helping you out (by helping themselves out), and no argument and crying around about sharing the loot.Story here is not great, but is quite engaging. Quests are a little repetitive (go somewhere, shoot enemyes, activate something), but it has kept me hooked.I've never spent real money buying items for the games, but I might give it a try on this one, just to support it.

												I just started playing this, and while the acting is pretty cheezy the gameplay is quite fun with a lot of variety in the weapons. I like that each class is actually viable instead of one being clearly superior as is the case in some other MMOs. All in all a very good game especially at the price (free)			"

												This is a GREAT game! the bad reveiws are mostly from people in the beta or have played for less then a hour. the only problem i see is how o controls are first setup and you can fix that if you want. the good things for this game are: its free, you can pay but it isnt requared like some mmos that you can't do any thing on unless you pay (example: wizards 101), the game has a good but not great story but i haven't done the whole story, very little system usage for a game, and more.even if this game was 30 bucks i would buy it i give it a 8/10			"

												 I was sceptical about getting this game when it was first released. So i didnt, But after the end of the first season of the tv series i was dying for more and with a summer 2014 release i couldnt wait around , i ended up buying the game and i doubt i'll ever regret it. The Game world is Amazing , the story is immersive and the multiplayer elements are truly Brilliant. I've made some great allies during Story missions and even Co-operative assignments. Having only spent around 50 hours ( at the time of writing this) Experiencing this game i havent even scratched the surface of what this game offers. To put it simply , This game puts the ""Massive"" back into MMO 10/10			"

												If you are not the usual mmorpg guy or if you are bored of them or if you want something new try out ""Defiance"". It  is so different to all other mmorpg's. It is a third person shooter, you fight with guns only. You need to get in dungeons sometimes or your quests are events in wich everyone can participate and there are big events appearing on the map where many players take part of. The events difficulty is always adapted to the number of players, so you could do them alone. There are everywhere small shipments being attacked by some enemys and random ""Archfalls"" where you get eqipment if you do them. i would call the game pve coop and Remember IT IS ALL A SHOOTER^^.

												Ill do a quick pros and cons and then just write my opinion about it.Pros:-Its probably the best MMO SHOOTER out there right now.-You dont need to pay any money to be ""good"" at the game.-The english voice acting is pretty neat-The story is fairly interesting and well designed-The open world gives you a great travel system. Quicktravel to friends, quicktravel to cities and drive a car, which levels with you.-Multiple weapon levels, aswell as each weapon being masterable, giving an additional statbonus-it reminds me alot of Mass Effect and Borderlands, both being very good games-Time limited open world events. Arcfalls, Incursions, everything to gain levels and items quickly and while having fun-Co-op missions with a cool story-When you join a group or one of the previously named your level gets raised to a specific point so all members deal the same amount of damage-Buying a dlc doesnt make you incredible op. It just enables you to use more, slightly stronger weapons aswell as names, cars and other stuff.Something between pro and con:-The game is not always easy to figure out, making it sorta harder for newbies. Then again, there are alot of games like that, e.g. Dark Souls, which is equally non-explaining and loved for it. For me the game was pretty okay to figure out, some things though are still a bit in the black.-The car handling. Mostly a pain in the bum-bum (cause no swearing on steam..) , sometimes good to handle.-Some weapons are dlc exclusive. You can still get them and sell them, you just cant use them-Enemies are extremely twitchy. They dodgeroll when you shoot, they strafe while shooting and they randomly switch targets. I dont know if its supposed to be THAT hard to shoot someone or if they just aggro randomly.Con:-Some missions are repetetitve, having you ambushed alot.-Some missions are very short. You can finish them in 30 seconds because its just ""Pick this up and done""-Small open world events are fairly annoying-The german (and I guess every other but english) voice-over. Horrible stuff.Server lag and bugs:-(bugs)Its pretty common to have lag, but I guess this is why the game got rated so badly. Sometimes you drop out of the server, losing progress in the raid you do at the moment. Otherwise its fairly forgiving. In an hour it happens ~3 times max. Its not that big of a deal, its mostly when you are in the inventory and it doesnt load.-(server lag)Some days the server is pretty filled, making you headshot someone that falls down about 3 seconds later. Sure, its annoying, but its very rarely like that. Most of the time its pretty responsive.My friend and I played it for free for quite a while (about 10 hours), being hooked by the gameplay. He played alot of MMOs back then and Im a fan of shooters, making it a good game to play together. So we decided to support the developers, buying two seasons passes. Thas 60 bucks, about as much as any EA game.			"

												Defiance is an unique game.Its a very innovative MMORPG i like refreshing peaces of work like this.It combines some of the best things of some other games.It has an open world where you can do pretty much anything.It has a Co-op that is very good.It has a well thought PvP system and nice PvP events in the Open world area.It has tons of different weapons and on top of that any weapon can have a different kind of ammo and effect(nanoeffect).Which makes the game weapon wise very divers.The graphics are actually pretty good and the game does not lag that much for a game with good graphycs.The only downside of it is that the environment is too still...everywhere you go you switch between two different styles of backgrounds barren lands and alien plant green life.NOT MUCH DIVERSITY IN THAT ARE.Which can lead to Boredom. You have to choose from four different skills which are awesome.You can use one at a time but can pretty much have all of them and switch between them.Overall i would give the game an eight out of  a ten.I recommend it to all who are looking for something new and fresh!

												This game has few MAJOR problems because dev's wanted as many players/platforms into the game, but theres also alot of stuff i like in a game. Thats why i am still playing this. There has always been problems with different computers not performing as the best. So that is why this game needs serious fixing.I recommend this because i like the consept of DEFIANCE, some pvp elements are quite fun, voice acting is good, story line is exquisite and someone has to get those arkfalls.Pros.1. Alot of players.2. Very enjoyable gameplay. (exept sniper)3. Dynamic events.4. Challenges,contracts,missions everything i love in a game.5. GUNS, LOTS AND LOTS of guns, one for every mind.6. Loot system is quite good. (There is an in-game market, where you can buy lockboxes that contain weapons and other misc. items)Cons.1. Draw distance is horrible for pc players or anyone who enjoys sniping at long distances, you get invisible enemies after 100-150 meters. (PS3 and xbox360) Pc players could always look at the options and choose options that suits their systems.2.  Not that much graphical options...3.  Gameplay gets repetetive after 13-16 hours.4. Market. This just sucks. You can actually buy lockboxes from there, those contain weapons and other misc. items. Sometimes this game feels like Pay to Win...5. If there is too many enemies in one area you will only see the enemies and not the players... Makes it kinda hard for medics. For example one event there was about 40-60 players and suddenly there was only me against 40-50 enemies that suddenly lose health and die.			"

Personally i think it's a better version of Borderlands because of the MMO aspect. It's really a lot of fun.Sure there is DLC and yeah it's probably important to get to comepete everything but! It's fun so far without. I would suggest becoming a patron though.			"

												I initially bought this game during its initial release and found myself at a point where there was nothing left to do in it, and so I told myself I'd put it aside for a year or 2 before going back to it.I find myself quite disapointed as the game appears to have gone the full F2P mode, with a lot of paid content, and that's simply not the game I paid for. I was quite disapointed with the results upon returning and have decided that it is a game that I will most likely never touch again.GG/10			"

												Defiance is a fun shoot-the-bad-guys with the added twist of story linkage with the Tv Series.  I really enjoyed playing it with my partner, and I particularly liked the style of minor/major quest lines.  it was enjoyable and spread the game out so the main quest line didn't advance too fast.  However, it unfortunately became monotonous fairly quickly and the lack of any ""shiny loot"" other than newer guns lost my interest.. I do look forward to those awesome purples etc			"

DEFIANCEWell its all-in-all a great game, even graphically considering how im running on LOW and it still looks great.PROS-FPS-MMO-RPG-Literal RPG's-Open world-Great Story-Spectacular Leveling system-Good Loot RatioCONS-Buggy/Glitchy-most cosmetics are end game or somewhat risky challenges-Dedication (Max LvL Cap is 6,000)VerdictFirst look, i hated it. Sounded like some stupid 3rd person piece of garbage FPS trash thrown out for the micro-transactions. I EXPERIENCED the first 5 mission and immediatly fell in LOVE with it. Defiance has a great story, almost as if reading a book. The weapons vary, which is good, and the fact you can mod it is better. Best of all is the 'Mastery'. Mastering a gun means hard work and a lot of bullets, for an extra effect or even an extra buff to the gun. The Events that happen around the world are perfect, Public Sieges, Major-Minor-Normal Arkfalls, Shadow wars, its just too good. Though encountering a few bugs along the way i say Defiance is worth it, even for F2P who are cheap and tired of TF2's 7 year olds.			"

												I really enjoy playing the game in short bits. Very entertaining at first. After a while it becomes too linear. I only made it to about 4000 EGO level (out of 6000) but there really is nothing left to keep playing towards. It felt similar to how Borderlands gameplay progressed. Once you've seen all the (very similar) fights, you just do the same thing over and over in hopes that the enemies drop better weapons. No crafting, no skill required after you master the mechanics about 20 hours into playing. PVP is a nightmare for low levels. They immediately pit you against other players who deal 30x the amount of damage you can. I stopped playing after about 200 hours simply because there is nothing left to do.			"

												I started a bit ago and been having a blast.   Mostly i have been working on raising my weapon skills and learning the game bit by bit.  I usually do a bunch of events and mini events and slowly been moving across the map.  Flying through the quests would make you to weak and not nearly as much enjoyable since you would miss so much fun content and unique environments. Joining a large clan has been helpful for events as you can telport to any clan player instantly. The only money i have spent is to purchase two inventory upgrades to get 30 more slots.  Which got easier when i figure out i could store mods on purchased weapons that already have all the slots unlocked, so 1 slot could technically hold 5 items (1 weapon and 4 mods)   I kept a list of weapons I liked for awhile until i got good at recognizing the types that i prefer for each.  Now i just have a spread sheet that lists the mods that are stored so i can get the ones i want easily. I have around 1500 ego now and all my weapon skills are at 10+,  I dont really feel like I'm missing anything yet by not having any of the dlc's.   Some weapons can only be used if you have teh dlc but there are so many others dropping that you can use, I just break them down.  Speaking of the large events they are a blast, you start in one area of the map and do bunches of small events all across a large area until you get to the main event then it's a battle royal of death and destruction.   Don't let the skill system get you to bothered i had over 55 points saved before i even spent on any of the small skills other than decoy.  I finally spent those and in a few days ago and got all the main skills i wanted,  and now i'm already back up to 40+ points so i'll start buying some others to try custom setups. The best starter items i would go for is Decoy as your main skill.Cellular ArmorDetachmentSelf MedicatedRegenerationTime OutPumped UpExcecutionExcape ArtistFailsafeMax all them out and youll have a solid build of skills then you can spend the others however you want to play around.  You can only have 9 skills active at a time so no worries. The more playing around casually you do the more fun you will have with this game, Flying through all the quests to get as far as possible makes you miss out on most the immersiveness.  "

												If you ever played RIFT this can summed up quite easier by mashing Borderlands + Rift together into a over the shoulder shooter. It's so much fun seeing the ArkFall land down on the map and cause mass chaos in the world to keep you on ur toes, I think the game is great and the show is really well put together as the two follow same story line (and the main characters in the TV show move around in the game as things happen in the show) If you like borderlands for the action you will love this game so much more but it is a MMORPG so commence the grind but tons of weapons to try out.

												Highly recommend! With over 800 hours in I finally decided to write this review. It's a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter with a huge variety of weapons and every weapon has 4 mod slots, even beginners can start modding almost right away. You can easily mod very cheaply or use high end mods that are available thru vendors bought with earned scrip or from drops and lock boxes. This game is free to play yet not pay to win. Anyone can get legendary guns without paying a dime. There are a number of items you can buy with real money but they are appearance and convenience like extra inventory space or key slots but again you do not need to buy them to play through to max level and see and enjoy all content and dominate in the instances. The graphics while not great are quite good and very detailed and the player models look great but movement is not as fluid as it could be but you will hardly notice because you will be having too much fun shooting and shooting and shooting so much content it gets insane! The weapons are a joy to use and modify, their mechanics and sounds are mind blowing, the explosions are huge and the enemies are everywhere from easy to extremely hard.This game has the least amount of chat drama I have ever seen and very few trolls, the players are mostly helpful and joining a clan makes it even better. PVE and PVP, your choice when you want and as much as you want. It's free! Give it a go!			"

												The Defiance is a 3rd person shooter with a very realistic graphics and fast-paced action. In terms of game mechanics, it is purely identical to Borderlands. However, with all the potential for interaction, adventure and intrigue derived from the TV series, it COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE. Instead of a unique taste of the Arch, we receive another copy of Fallout: New Vegas, but drastically simplified. Lack of distinct classes, professions, specialties and crafting, as well as lack of dynamic universe, economics, personal wealth (only cash and cosmetic gear), zones of control and conflicting factions is imho a drawback, not an advantage. The few options for character's development are all explored very quick, and the game becomes repeatable.This game has a vast potential of evolving into a perfect and detailed MMO game, but as of today, it will only satisfy shooter genre fans. I recommend the game for its great graphics, cool multiplayer map events and its potential for future development. I have high hopes that the game will be continually upgraded.			"

												A post-apocalyptic third person shooter MMO. Pay once, but full of microtransactions of cause.I really like it, it's very fun to play with friends. Has good missions and a decent story. It also has pvp and dungeon match making as well.I'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes third person shooter MMOs or post-apocalyptic themed games.			"

												Installed this yesterday evening and have clocked up 9.5hrs.~When you first start it seems a bit low-budget and a bit like a B movie, I wasn't so sure at first, it just seemed a bit thrown together, but, if you stick it out until you've done the first few main story quests and stumble upon some public geared events you may well start to enjoy it. There's plenty of players online that you bump into, random side quests and lots of public events you encounter when just travelling to and from your objective. In that respect it's been a fun few hours.If I had to describe the game it's Mass Effect meets Destiny meets fallout with some RIFT style random events you get caught up in. Playstyle is very much like mass effect, it's third person offset camera, with basic run and roll / dodge but lacking the cover system. The way you run around dispatching enemies in various environments and zones reminds me of playing mass effect vs destiny, the hud animations when you collect items and interact are similar too.There are quite a few similarities to Destiny whilst on that note. So if you are looking for a sci-fi fix of that type then take a look at this. I think Bungy had quite a bit of inspiration from this. I played Destiny from beta and release, leveled up a Hunter to 30 with all legendary and exotics, did all instances / strikes and put in a hell of a lot of playtime (then got bored and sold it along with the PS4) so I have seen all of it.The environments the art style and post-apocolyptic battle of Defiance much like the (rather poorly explained) battle of the traveller and environments. Certain mobs look very much like the Knights and others (and raiders look nearly identical to some of the enemies on earth, mutants with swords charging at you very similar in idea to the vandals concept).Scenery is of a very similar style, certain outfits and gear look similar, the HP system and hail-of-bullet style play and mob encounters are similar too. Even down to the rocket / thrust system on mounts and the way mounts are summoned and an AI 'ghost' style entity guiding you. I have the cloak ability and building on other specs similar to the hunter style play. There are certain things it does better too, like the fact that it IS open world, and not just some crappy restricted zone or 'patrol' style small planet map. The actual social aspect that was heavily lacking in destiny is in Defiance. I could actually see me getting more play time from this.I'm not sure of the longevity of this game at the moment, there is a very big map and several continents to explore, I have travelled to quite a few zones already but I am still discovering places, I feel the combat may get a little tiring, but there are plenty of weapons and a lot of modifications that you can do to them (you can modify the stock, barrel, scope and ammo / magazine type).There are a ton of micro-transactions, the store has a lot of gear you can purchase, but they have to make some money somehow since it's gone F2P right? The servers won't run themselves! I haven't found yet however that I need to buy anything, quests do the standard MMO thing and reward gear, be it weapons, outfits or shields / mods, so there is plenty to keep you going while you assess whether you really do like the game or not. And if you like it, why not buy a weapon or outfit, it's cheaper than a pint of beer...Some good and bad points so far:+ Graphics are very pleasent - nice effects, nice level of detail and terrain looks very good, models look good too+ Well designed environments+ High FPS - even on highest settings performance seems very good, never dropped bellow 60fps once, even with about 100 players on the screen in a total frag-fest+ LOTS of action - if you like unleashing a hail of bullets and projectiles into enemies you will enjoy it+ Lots of gear - Weapons, modifications and equipment available even without buying from the store+ Zero server and connection lag experienced thus far+ Good sound FX+ Open world - no real set path, do anything you want and at your own pace+ No leveling system - as such, this is a postive I believe, new players can instantly join in with veterans and have fun+ Skill trees with lots of progression+ If your into the series, this links in nicely and has episodic content that carries over to the game+ Fast travel if you want to get somewhere in a hurry- Widescreen users may experience 'vanishing' textures and objects on high settings - after some play time (memory leak?) although the game still looks great on medium and this problem will go away- Story is a bit bland - not very well explained, not engrosing or that interesting in game- Music - gets very annoying after a while, the combat music is limited to one track that really gets on your nerves, at least you can turn it off- Some enemies have way too much hp - and not in a good way, IE in certain quests the mob won't kill you, you won't be worried at all but you will roll around shooting him for about 10 mins getting very bored with his never ending HP!Overall if you have a few spare minutes, are bored and fancy just trying something new, then for free it is really worth a shot.

												If you ever played RIFT this can summed up quite easier by mashing Borderlands + Rift together into a over the shoulder shooter. It's so much fun seeing the ArkFall land down on the map and cause mass chaos in the world to keep you on ur toes, I think the game is great and the show is really well put together as the two follow same story line (and the main characters in the TV show move around in the game as things happen in the show) If you like borderlands for the action you will love this game so much more but it is a MMORPG so commence the grind but tons of weapons to try out.

												I've played this game for a while and from the beginning i loved it it was not laggy,graphics were not too bad,good charecter creation all the classes can use each others weapons,I would rate this a 8/10 just because the graphics were a bit low, For ten dollers this is a good game, weapon element was awsome had shock and crossive im not sure if there is any more but all the weapons look cool and the level system is not normal they dont use level 1,level 2 thats is cool i've played for a while and now my level is 101 thats why i said that they did not use normal level system. :DDD i would recommend this game :D but now comes the bad part in the beginning you have to use real money to buy cloth and cars, cars dont have much those are the only problems. Thanks for reading this i hope after you read this you will buy this game.			"

												Highly recommend! With over 800 hours in I finally decided to write this review. It's a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter with a huge variety of weapons and every weapon has 4 mod slots, even beginners can start modding almost right away. You can easily mod very cheaply or use high end mods that are available thru vendors bought with earned scrip or from drops and lock boxes. This game is free to play yet not pay to win. Anyone can get legendary guns without paying a dime. There are a number of items you can buy with real money but they are appearance and convenience like extra inventory space or key slots but again you do not need to buy them to play through to max level and see and enjoy all content and dominate in the instances. The graphics while not great are quite good and very detailed and the player models look great but movement is not as fluid as it could be but you will hardly notice because you will be having too much fun shooting and shooting and shooting so much content it gets insane! The weapons are a joy to use and modify, their mechanics and sounds are mind blowing, the explosions are huge and the enemies are everywhere from easy to extremely hard.This game has the least amount of chat drama I have ever seen and very few trolls, the players are mostly helpful and joining a clan makes it even better. PVE and PVP, your choice when you want and as much as you want. It's free! Give it a go!			"

												The Defiance is a 3rd person shooter with a very realistic graphics and fast-paced action. In terms of game mechanics, it is purely identical to Borderlands. However, with all the potential for interaction, adventure and intrigue derived from the TV series, it COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE. Instead of a unique taste of the Arch, we receive another copy of Fallout: New Vegas, but drastically simplified. Lack of distinct classes, professions, specialties and crafting, as well as lack of dynamic universe, economics, personal wealth (only cash and cosmetic gear), zones of control and conflicting factions is imho a drawback, not an advantage. The few options for character's development are all explored very quick, and the game becomes repeatable.This game has a vast potential of evolving into a perfect and detailed MMO game, but as of today, it will only satisfy shooter genre fans. I recommend the game for its great graphics, cool multiplayer map events and its potential for future development. I have high hopes that the game will be continually upgraded.			"

												I originally chose not to recommend this but it honestly has some charm. It's not exactly super deep yet but the dungeons are excellent, the cutscenes and voice-acting can be cheesy but it's usually pretty good. There are tons of guns. Headshots/skillshots are rewardly handsomely. THere are actually adequate challenges where encounters can be vextremely difficult but possible to overcome. The open-world events are often quite... eventful, for lack of a better word.Above all else, for being a F2P open-world mmo, it's amazing that I've played this long without the game shoving microtransactions in my face. I haven't been stuck behind any paywalls either.			"

												Solid, Fun MMO shooter that mechanically is similar to Borderlands. It is doing something that's never been done before, tying into a TV show on SyFy and events from the game influence the TV show and vice versa. The game has had it's fair share of hiccups, but Trion has done a good job with constant patches. A Huge DLC pack is set to come out late July. Game plays best if you join up with some friends. After 200 hours, I can say, Defiance is really, really fun. It's the first MMO I've been able to get into.8.8 out of 10.Use my referral link if registering an account (and/or buying the game):http://www.defiance.com/en/welcome-to-defiance/?rc=XYDRD3FWKK6722MDPZTK "

The game itself has a few kinks to be worked out, mostly related to the menus and I'd like more quests and less in-world events, but for F2P game with premium expansions, you can get your feet wet for free, then go as deep as you like depending on how much you're willing to spend.

This game is so fun to play alone or with friends and there is a lot to do considering it is a free to play game. I will upate this reveiw in the future but for now here it is. PROS- Extremely fun gameplayGreat shoooting mechanicsIts DEFIANCE the game, what is there not to like since they slammed the show. bs if u ask me CONS- Micro transactions are far to expensive and should be cut to half price permenently There is a stupid amount of bugsbad lipsycing in scenesDon't listen to the negative reveiws as I gave this game a chance and I love it. at the time of posting this i have 14.3 hrs put into the game It will no doubt be around 100-200 hrs within a month because this game is so addictive and fun. I will probably put money into it once a couple things go on sale as it really is a great game. I sometimes forget that it is a free2play lol. GIVE IT A CHANCE IT IS REALLY FUN, WATCH THE SHOW FIRST AS YOU WONT BE TOTALLY LOST WITH WHATS GOING ON AND WHAT DOES WHAT WHEN YOU START!!! -Do not buy rust (bad game) :)  "

												Love this game, almost all the players are great. you can follow the storyline or you can go play with other players or you can play with other players going through the storyline. there is so much space on the server that it can easily uphold the stress all the players put on it. there are also various challenges and minigames that you can do. there are several ways to earn the money that you use and you can trade items with other players. there are only a few confusing  things in the game, but the players will help you and sometimes, literally, walk you through the parts you are having difficulty with. This game is great. I have only had the server lag one day when the servers were updated with some incompatible software. The problem was located, isolated, and fixed when I logged on the next day. so the maintenance crew is great. Awesome game.			"

												Before I get into detail, I'd like to say I feel really sorry for those who bought this when it cost $60. This game is a free-roam shooter with many similarities to the Borderlands franchise. It's not the most amazing shooter you'll find, but I can definitely say you will get your money's worth now that it's at $10. It's kinda like borderlands styled co-op with MMO at the same time, you'll meet a LOT of new people and fight to compete in arkfalls, volge sieges, and considerably more. The leveling system is very slow in relation of start/max level (10/5000, I'm around 1500 now) and such is often also the case with finding new weapons, but the game does have updates, plenty is subject to change (they certainly have room to improve). Again, not the greatest game, but if you've got 10 to spend and want a new game to hang with friends in, this is a pretty good idea.			"

												Ill do a quick pros and cons and then just write my opinion about it.Pros:-Its probably the best MMO SHOOTER out there right now.-You dont need to pay any money to be ""good"" at the game.-The english voice acting is pretty neat-The story is fairly interesting and well designed-The open world gives you a great travel system. Quicktravel to friends, quicktravel to cities and drive a car, which levels with you.-Multiple weapon levels, aswell as each weapon being masterable, giving an additional statbonus-it reminds me alot of Mass Effect and Borderlands, both being very good games-Time limited open world events. Arcfalls, Incursions, everything to gain levels and items quickly and while having fun-Co-op missions with a cool story-When you join a group or one of the previously named your level gets raised to a specific point so all members deal the same amount of damage-Buying a dlc doesnt make you incredible op. It just enables you to use more, slightly stronger weapons aswell as names, cars and other stuff.Something between pro and con:-The game is not always easy to figure out, making it sorta harder for newbies. Then again, there are alot of games like that, e.g. Dark Souls, which is equally non-explaining and loved for it. For me the game was pretty okay to figure out, some things though are still a bit in the black.-The car handling. Mostly a pain in the bum-bum (cause no swearing on steam..) , sometimes good to handle.-Some weapons are dlc exclusive. You can still get them and sell them, you just cant use them-Enemies are extremely twitchy. They dodgeroll when you shoot, they strafe while shooting and they randomly switch targets. I dont know if its supposed to be THAT hard to shoot someone or if they just aggro randomly.Con:-Some missions are repetetitve, having you ambushed alot.-Some missions are very short. You can finish them in 30 seconds because its just ""Pick this up and done""-Small open world events are fairly annoying-The german (and I guess every other but english) voice-over. Horrible stuff.Server lag and bugs:-(bugs)Its pretty common to have lag, but I guess this is why the game got rated so badly. Sometimes you drop out of the server, losing progress in the raid you do at the moment. Otherwise its fairly forgiving. In an hour it happens ~3 times max. Its not that big of a deal, its mostly when you are in the inventory and it doesnt load.-(server lag)Some days the server is pretty filled, making you headshot someone that falls down about 3 seconds later. Sure, its annoying, but its very rarely like that. Most of the time its pretty responsive.My friend and I played it for free for quite a while (about 10 hours), being hooked by the gameplay. He played alot of MMOs back then and Im a fan of shooters, making it a good game to play together. So we decided to support the developers, buying two seasons passes. Thas 60 bucks, about as much as any EA game.			"

												I don't normally spend much time writing reviews, but this game needs some attention.Pro's: damn fun game.very good physicsGreat eye candyUnique advancement systemCan play alone or in groups (spend most time alone on short long in's)Con's: Way to many server time out disconnects.Loss of progress on Instanced missions when disconnected for server timeouts.Lost loot due to server timeouts.In short My Adult son who has been my game partner since 1997 through doom series, quake series , unreal series, serious sam, duke nukem, halflife series Final fantasy several versions , Planetside2 and many others, will not play this game with me because of the frustration of time outs and difficulty in grouping effectively. There has been some improvement of late but still the only real problem area I can see is the server disconnects, It is especially disconcerning half way through the really cool cut scene movies that detail the next mission step. All of the special effects are way cool but is seems that to many people are trying to access the available bandwith at the same time. Late night local time seem the least affected as game population appears to be down, but on a weekend afternoon, way to busy to have good consistant game play. I am a big fan of the TV show and has been on my autotune list since the very first show and this game translates well from it. Great time, but the average game play is a bit like a feeding frenzy, even though reviveing a down player has it's rewards few seem to care and revives are few and far in between. A revive self or by another player keeps you at the battle site, where a extraction take you out to a respawn point pre set in the game map close to your current location , or maybe not. so you stand a great chance of not being able to get back to the battle ground where you hard won items rot. frustrating. All in all I think I will continue on with this game as when it works it is real fun. it has been a while since the action on screen has me ducking and dodging in my chair. (Flashback to Doom)good Hunting All.			"

												I entered this game knowing absolutely nothing about the show on which it is based, and after over 380 hours of gameplay (and still having not watched the show) I highly recommend it to anyone interested in 3rd person shooters, scifi-fi games, and MMOs.  The game itself has a few kinks to be worked out, mostly related to the menus and I'd like more quests and less in-world events, but for F2P game with premium expansions, you can get your feet wet for free, then go as deep as you like depending on how much you're willing to spend.

												The Defiance is a 3rd person shooter with a very realistic graphics and fast-paced action. In terms of game mechanics, it is purely identical to Borderlands. However, with all the potential for interaction, adventure and intrigue derived from the TV series, it COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE. Instead of a unique taste of the Arch, we receive another copy of Fallout: New Vegas, but drastically simplified. Lack of distinct classes, professions, specialties and crafting, as well as lack of dynamic universe, economics, personal wealth (only cash and cosmetic gear), zones of control and conflicting factions is imho a drawback, not an advantage. The few options for character's development are all explored very quick, and the game becomes repeatable.This game has a vast potential of evolving into a perfect and detailed MMO game, but as of today, it will only satisfy shooter genre fans. I recommend the game for its great graphics, cool multiplayer map events and its potential for future development. I have high hopes that the game will be continually upgraded.			"

												I started a bit ago and been having a blast.   Mostly i have been working on raising my weapon skills and learning the game bit by bit.  I usually do a bunch of events and mini events and slowly been moving across the map.  Flying through the quests would make you to weak and not nearly as much enjoyable since you would miss so much fun content and unique environments. Joining a large clan has been helpful for events as you can telport to any clan player instantly. The only money i have spent is to purchase two inventory upgrades to get 30 more slots.  Which got easier when i figure out i could store mods on purchased weapons that already have all the slots unlocked, so 1 slot could technically hold 5 items (1 weapon and 4 mods)   I kept a list of weapons I liked for awhile until i got good at recognizing the types that i prefer for each.  Now i just have a spread sheet that lists the mods that are stored so i can get the ones i want easily. I have around 1500 ego now and all my weapon skills are at 10+,  I dont really feel like I'm missing anything yet by not having any of the dlc's.   Some weapons can only be used if you have teh dlc but there are so many others dropping that you can use, I just break them down.  Speaking of the large events they are a blast, you start in one area of the map and do bunches of small events all across a large area until you get to the main event then it's a battle royal of death and destruction.   Don't let the skill system get you to bothered i had over 55 points saved before i even spent on any of the small skills other than decoy.  I finally spent those and in a few days ago and got all the main skills i wanted,  and now i'm already back up to 40+ points so i'll start buying some others to try custom setups. The best starter items i would go for is Decoy as your main skill.Cellular ArmorDetachmentSelf MedicatedRegenerationTime OutPumped UpExcecutionExcape ArtistFailsafeMax all them out and youll have a solid build of skills then you can spend the others however you want to play around.  You can only have 9 skills active at a time so no worries. The more playing around casually you do the more fun you will have with this game, Flying through all the quests to get as far as possible makes you miss out on most the immersiveness.  "

												This game is a BLAST! After going through an easy tutorial you are open to roam a large open-world on a vehicle you can spawn out of thin air, then come across random multiplayer events, like going through waves of enemies protecting an 'Ark', with other people (very epic). I especially LOVE the combat and gameplay, it is SOOO satisfying, for example:  Snipe a dude, throw a grenade, blow up an explosive barrel with enimies around it, then pull out a machine gun and go crazy while rolling inbetween corridors. Also the enviroments are AMAZING! like the Golden Gate bridge all broken and old, and i like the fact that what you see... YOU CAN EXPLORE! The graphics and story are also amazing for a F2P game and not to mention the game is completely FREE, and in my opinion it is Not Pay-to-Win either, YES you can by the coins that let you buy ingame items, but you can get the coins yourself and buy and sell using IN-game currency. Did not pay a Cent of real money. The ONLY downside is the servers are down alot and occasionally the server lags, but... WHO CARES? I Love this game, i made this review when i have played only 4 hours of the game and it is already my top 10 games list..... just try it out! *also, the TV show is complete and utter CRAP*			"

												Highly recommend! With over 800 hours in I finally decided to write this review. It's a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter with a huge variety of weapons and every weapon has 4 mod slots, even beginners can start modding almost right away. You can easily mod very cheaply or use high end mods that are available thru vendors bought with earned scrip or from drops and lock boxes. This game is free to play yet not pay to win. Anyone can get legendary guns without paying a dime. There are a number of items you can buy with real money but they are appearance and convenience like extra inventory space or key slots but again you do not need to buy them to play through to max level and see and enjoy all content and dominate in the instances. The graphics while not great are quite good and very detailed and the player models look great but movement is not as fluid as it could be but you will hardly notice because you will be having too much fun shooting and shooting and shooting so much content it gets insane! The weapons are a joy to use and modify, their mechanics and sounds are mind blowing, the explosions are huge and the enemies are everywhere from easy to extremely hard.This game has the least amount of chat drama I have ever seen and very few trolls, the players are mostly helpful and joining a clan makes it even better. PVE and PVP, your choice when you want and as much as you want. It's free! Give it a go!			"

												The game is definitely worth the price (since it has been reduced so drastically), but I don't think spending the extra money for the Deluxe Edition is worth it. It's literally a red suit that looks (personal opinion) stupid, a rocket launcher (that you find for free and with better stats later), a shield (same as the rocket launcher) and a coloured quad bike you can't get anywhere else (oh noes! Not like you can get a free, faster quad bike later on, or a free dune buggy, or just buy a car). The only thing worthwhile on the Deluxe Edition are the boosts, but even then, they aren't necessary at all.Why do I think the game itself is worth it? Well, I'll give both sides:Good:*Runs very smoothly in combat (even when it seems laggy I've never had a problem hitting my target)*The graphics are decent (they're not Crisis but they aren't Minecraft either)*The game is genuinelly a lot of fun!...at first*Arkfalls are a lot of fun to go to (at first anyways), too bad some of the cool co-op mission bosses aren't available in the main game*Clothing; all the clothing you can buy in the store for real money (do you like microtransactions) can be acquired for free (in different colours bearing in mind, so they may look better or worse) by completing challenges or missions*Leveling and progression system; there's a lot less of a difference between a EGO 5000 character and a EGO 50 character than most MMOs... the only differences I can think of off the top of my head are: more chance for nano effects on weapons (fire, syphon health, electricity, etc.), more bonuses on weapons (e.g. x1.25 mag size); access to more co-op missions (last one unlocks at around 500 EGO anyway at the time this was originally written); more perks on the EGO Grid (skill tree) and more clothing unlocked (through the missions/challenges). There's probably some I missed, but health, shield capacity and weapon damage only very, very slightly scale with your level, so in terms of health and raw damage, there isn't much difference between the two charactersNeutral:*I've never played PvP so I can't give my personal opinion, but according to the forums, it is heavily biased for certain weapons/EGO powers (meaning it could be difficult to use others effectively unless you know what you're doing) and it has been ignored for a long time and could use new featuresBad:*Crappy launcher for patches. On PS3 I've spent 2 hours patching, only for it to come up with a failure and start from the beginning... 3 times! On PC though I don't think I had many problems, but maybe I was just lucky*Fake patch notes... maybe they've stopped it now, but they seem to like to put old news into the patch notes to buff them out a bit, when in reality they've changed very little*Can you say 'repetitive'? Because that's what this game is after a long time playing... I guess every game does this, but the co-op missions are repetitive (no randomisation in any way, even with enemy spawns), the little random events (don't know the proper name, where you'll find a derelict vehicle on the road or a hellbug nest or some other small event) are repetitive (after a while, especially when your EGO calls out to you repeatedly to check them out), driving around the world is repetitive (more on that next), the whole damn thing just feels like a bit of a grind once the new game sheen has worn off...*Driving feels empty... oh I don't mean the physics, which are a load of crap (wanna drive through that wooden fence in your truck? NOPE! Wanna drive over this rock? NOPE! You get stuck on the rock/smash right into it and lose all your speed. This happens on everything you touch, at least you can drive through other players or this'd be a major griefing tactic). I mean just driving around the world makes you feel like you're playing a singleplayer game rather than an MMO. The chat is barely ever used (and for good reason too, in its current state it is bad, though it's meant to be getting fixed with the 7th Legion DLC patch) and players either don't load their appearance (this has been updated with a slider in the options menu, which allows you to always see the appearance) or just don't load at all, so you very rarely see anybody driving around that isn't at a fast travel point...*The DLC is pretty poor so far, the Raptor vehicle is terrible and the arena is just that; a PvE arena that loses its magic after a couple of tries. The new Charge Blade is cool though, fun to use (if a bit suicidal) but you need to know which enemies you shouldn't attack or you'll get creamed :P Arkbreaker was... good for the free player, but not so good for the people that buy the DLC; all you really get for buying the DLC is the ability to call down Arkfalls; the thing is, most of the time, if you wait for 5 minutes somebody else will call it down anyway.Additional:Looking for two pretty decent builds? It's best to make your own, but if you want a template:http://forums.defiance.com/showthread.php?50876-2-High-DPS-BuildsArkfall codes:http://orcz.com/Defiance:_Arkfall_Codes#Arkfall_Codes_List (enter these onto the 'My EGO' page on the Defiance website)Weapons guide:http://defiance.junkiesnation.com/2013/04/09/tips-and-tricks-weapons-guide/Oh, and give the site Raptr a go; they give away free content for many games regularly, all you need is to have Steam hours/achievements to qualify for the free rewards (you'll have to check back regularly though, because it doesn't seem like they notify you of when rewards you qualify for are available very well)			"

												In repsonse to horrible review left by MAXIMUS (have played many hours on another account)""As an RPG it has little in common with the TV series other than some names, races, and a couple of characters. As an RPG it pretty much totally lacks immersion.""1. I'm happy this has less in common with the TV series, b/c it sucked, and it's plenty immersive.""The GUI is poorly designed and needs an overhaul.""2. The GUI is perfect, sleek, out of sight and not intrusive or overencompassing.""There are WAY too many forms of currency.""3.Picture world invaded and destroyed by Aliens, do you think the surviving humans will have 1 organized unified currency?  No, they wouldn't anything and everything would be used as currency, thus resulting in many, there's some more immersion.""In-game communication with other party members and/or players is horrid. ""4. Build yourself a bridge and get over it, Discord for god's sake.""Mission/quest tracking is terrible.""5.Yes if you are blind and can't look at your mini-map or spin your camera around to find a glowing marker.  You would have starved to death in Vanilla WoW.""WAY, WAY, too many weapon options! No one wants to take the time to figure out all that!""6. Are you kidding me?  Go play Spiral Knights you weeb.""Stupid weapon designs. A grenade launcher that shoots a grenade that has to bounce once before detonation? Absurdly impractical. What intelligent person would design a weapon like that?""7. Sounds like you need to git gud and just learn how to aim. Weapon design's are awesome btw.""What's with Pumpkin's in March??? Yes, pumpkin heads and Christmas trees in March - That's just bizarre""8. You sound like a 45 year old soccer mom who doesn't understand that you can eat cake when it's not someones birthday.""No one over 10 likes a bullet sponge boss!!! Someone innovate, PLEASE!!!!""9.

												Picked this game up for about $4 on sale and I must say, I've definitely got my money's worth from it with about 114 hours worth of gameplay at the time of writing this review.This game plays out very much like an online Borderlands, for better or for worst. The game play is a pretty straight forward with a basic run and gun core gameplay. There are a wide variety of weapon types to choose from, allowing players the ability to customize their character exactly how they like them with no real restrictions as to what weapons can be used by which class or race. There are also a host of abilities that can be used to aid in breaking up the monotony of the run and gun format, much like Borderlands, but often times I have found that they are not essential to game progression. The world is large and feels adequately inhabited, with a number of random missions going on at all corners of the map at any given time. The map itself is gorgeous, with a fair amount of variety from region to region. There are also a number of different gamemodes available to offer a little variety with the world. Everything from time trials on ATV, to special events where you battle progressively more challenging enemies, to multiplayer PVP. And now for the drawbacks. Because the game has the same gameplay mechanics as Borderlands, it can get very monotonous. For the most part, this is counterbalanced by a wide variety of weapons which offer different challenges when fighting enemies, but still the format of running around shooting enemies over and over can get boring. While there are a number of different random missions that crop up all across the map, giving you the opportunity to get additional money, the missions fall into only a few different categories and after a few hours of gameplay, will become less interesting and more of an annoyance due to the lack of variety. Another disappointing aspect is that while the weapon types are varied, the number of available weapons of each type are not so much. There is no real variety to the weapons themselves, unlike Borderlands. In Borderlands, if you found a specific weapon you liked, you could search for additional variants of the same type that offer additional perks or slightly varied stats. In Defiance, once you find a weapon you like, you're pretty much stuck with that same weapon. The only possible choices you have is to find some mods to give it a few additional stat bumps or find the same exact weapon in a more rare version for a few tacked on perks. There's no real variety and aside from personal preference, no obvious reason to choose on weapon over another. Finally, my last gripe is with the PVP... PVP can be a bit glitchy at times. Sometimes when you go to join PVP, its supposed to teleport you to the area where the PVP is going on, but it doesn't, leaving you to commit suicide to fast travel to PVP since often times its a few kilometers away. I've also seen the respawn screen glitch and not allow you to respawn. I waited nearly 10 minutes, with the sounds of the battle continuing in the background. The buttons would respond on mouse over and when clicked, but it would not allow me to respawn. I ended up having to restart the game to clear this fault.Overall, for a pretty fun casual Borderland-esque game, I feel that it is worth the money, especially if you pick it up during a sale, but be warned that a lack of variety can make this game feel a little monotonous, especially on longer play sessions. Also, I hear that the game is a lot more fun if you drag along a few friends... I'd rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5, since really only a few minor tweaks to the game could definitely improve the overall play value...			"

												This is like Borderlands without the atrocious humor. Great gameplay. Plenty of things to do.  Unfortunately the inventory system is a complete mess, co-op multiplayer could/should be improved and there are still annoying bugs here and there. But you can't get wrong with Defiance, especially since it's now FREE TO PLAY! (not pay 2 play) One of my top favorite game!			"

												Defiance is an interesting game world, in parallel with it's TV-series Defiance. Defiance is a decent 3rd person shooter game, with a deep and interesting story-line. In combination with the TV-series, it makes the game even more interesting. Special dynamic events that keeps you interested, even after finishing the main story-line. And with special missions that are linked with TV-episodes. However Defiance is pretty pricey for what the game represents, and technically does not introduce anything new in the MMO world.  But the leveling system is something unique and matches very well on how you advance in the game. And it leans on the mechanics that sometimes it is more interesting to play this game with a friend.			"

												This game isn't bad actually.  I Bought it on the Winter sale for $4.99  and with over 30 hours in I certainly have gotten my money out of it.  That said the Server is Dead, when I look at how many people are in the game at one time on steam the most I have ever seen is 700 people.  That is really sad for an MMO.  I just play the game like it is a single player game and that is how I get my enjoyment out of it.  I would like to do more Like PVP battlegrounds, but I was in the queue over 3 hours last night just to get 8 more people to PVP.  I want to invest in the DLC, but I am afraid that this game is going to end up shutting down do to low populations. The point is I do recommend the game as it has good game play but don't expect to see to many people at once.  I would like to see more people get into this game as I think it is a little under rated and does have good gameplay to it.  I would also hate to see it go away, because unfortunately that is where I see it heading with the empty servers.			"

												It's an MMO, but it doesn't feel like one.  That's the biggest thing in a nutshell.  MMOs generally have that vibe about them that says, ""Here's a skill bar, pick some powers and use them as needed.""  But Defiance doesn't do that.  It's more, ""Here's a gun, go kill some stuff.""  I love that.  Borderlands of course comes to mind, but it's not really an MMO.  The closest thing I can think of that even got close was Hellgate London[hellgate.t3fun.com], and that game sucked.  But why did it suck?  Why does Defiance not suck?  The difference was that Hellgate gave you guns, sniper rifles, and so on, but accuracy didn't matter.  If you shot the enemy right in the face, it still did it's calculation vs. your accuracy level to see if you made the hit.  That drove me berserk to no end.  Defiance isn't like that AT ALL.  If you have the skill, if you can hit a target, YOU HIT YOUR TARGET.  This single feature above everything else defies anything bad about the game.  It is truly a single player feeling game on a multiplayer environment.  Never once have a shot a bullet and lag caused me to miss.  NEVER.  This is why Defiance is the best shooter MMO that has ever been released, that defies the rules of MMO bringing people who hate the traditional MMO experience back into the fold.  Like me.			"

Overall its a good game, If you like third person shooters or mmo's you should buy it.			"

VERY nice F2P, MMO, open-world shooter.   Join forces with others on the server to dispatch mutants and other foes and save your allies in a surrealistic, post-apocalyptic environment.  Lots of features and upgrades, including ability to spawn an all-terrain 'sport-bike' (and later, a 4WD vehicle) whenever you need one.  Good variety of terrain, structures, and targets.  Weapons are quite decent, too.  Well-deserving of a Level 5 badge, if nothing else...Check it out.  Five-finger discounted...☺			"

												Before everyone/anyone decides to say, I am warning you right now: If you don't like this game for certain reasons, then thats fine by me. However, for those of you who constantly bash this game after not even plying it or giving it a fair chance, I'll say this right now: QUIT YOUR WHINING AND DEAL WITH IT! THIS GAME WAS MADE THE WAY THEY INTENDED TO. NOW SHUT UP ALREADY! Now, down to the review. Defiance is honestly in my opinion one of the more interesting mmo type games out there. To me, it offers more than what you want to expect out of it, which in my case, is a really good thing since it adds more playability to the game. I would go into the details of how good this game is to me, but honestly, if you really want to know, play it yourself and find out. Also, one last thing before I end this review. I want everyone who plays this game to know and give me your suggestions about this game versus Destiny. When I mean suggestions, I mean the pros and cons that these games have other each other in terms of good or bad. Besides that though, if you do decide to comment on that subject, then feel free to go ahead and do so. I'm mainly asking because I think Destiny does have a     lot of problems and good things to it like Defiance. Also, if you do comment, don't just sit there and say that this game is better just because it is. "

												Edit:  30 hours in, and still having loads of fun. Borderlands meets Rift. I recommend using an x360 controller for the driving, and mouse/keyboard for the combat.2 hours in and it is feeling pretty good. I didn't care for the tutorial at all, it almost lost me. Once I found a cool pistol with acid (radiation?) damage and a sniper rifle, I was having loads of fun. Def gonna play this one for a few days.			"

												While this game is pretty fun, and even with minimal social interaction, its managed to hold my attention for a solid 29 hours in three days. However, it is painfully apparent in the first five minutes of gameplay why it went F2P. The character rendering is sub par, the voice acting is just God aweful and the story isn't very strong. Still, fun game, worth a few hours just to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I've gone through a lot of games, including a lot of shooters and MMOs, but I try to stick with games I consider rating at 8 or 9 out of 10. I think Defiance is a fantastic, amazing AAA game. I have no idea why the Metascore is so low, but I'm guessing it's because there was a hype machine associated with it both online and on television (SyFy) due to the fact that this game was produced alongside the TV series, and such hype machines tend to go overboard. There's a lot of action, some decent RPG elements, a decent shooter mechanic, AMAZING graphics, MMO scope, multiple storylines, and a changing world. It's not without occasional glitches, such as missions that don't complete correctly, but it's still a great game. Highly recommended.			"

Not all the bell's and whistles of other mmorpg's like WoW but not all the free for all bone heads either.  The new chat function was a big win for the players and allows you to be more involved with the other players finally.			"

												Now, before anything, I hate 3rd party DRM. Steam is enough, we don't want your turd client bloating our computers. Ok Trion? As good as this game is, Glyph is poo and you know it is. Also hot diggity damn the patches are big, so be aware of that before you decide you want to play this. This game follows a TV show on SyFy, and it is a really good show and you should watch it, but you may be thinking, is the game as good? And the answer is yes! I would venture to say that the game is better, because you have more stuff to do, and you can explore the world that you see in the show, and you can do quests that go together with the show.This game is an MMO, and that means there are a lot of people in the server with you, and they can help you complete missions because they have the missions too, which is awesome and its a mechanic that makes this game sometimes. You are not just running around killing stuff by yourself you are running around killing stuff with a random person, it makes an otherwise empty world feel alive, which is awesome. There is also something cool about seeing someone fly down the road in the opposite direction while driving alone, its a little thing, but I love it.The theme mainly has to do with Mutants to start with, and it is fun shooting and looting alone, but with a friend it is even better. This game does take a while to download though, but I think it is worth the wait. You are a Ark Hunter, who was implanted with an EGO device, which is sort of like Cortana. And you are on a ship, and it crashes. And you have to help with everything. Not going into anymore detail as not to spoil it.I think this game succeeded in making it feel like a single player game if you want it to be, but still being an MMO, which is rare, because you don't have to be in a huge party to do anything, which is great for someone with major social anxiety like me ;)I am surprised that the game is still good after it went F2P, I expected P2W everywhere, but luckily, we didn't get that, and I am thankful. You can still buy different versions of the game ranging from 20-100 dollars, which I would never do, the game is fine in normal state, and you can just buy the DLC if you really want too. Which I have no opinion on since I don't own the DLC.I don't like MMOs as a general rule, but I am in love with this game. It has it faults, but everything does. I give this a 8.75/10 The Deductions are as follows:-The Client feels unnecessary and almost like bloatware.-The game can lag, and kick you off, making you reload which can be annoying mid mission.-It made me lonely.

												This game was around here for a season or so, and now it became free-to-play. To be honest, I never really seem to care about Defiance while it was in stores with that heavyweight price-tag. Nothing special, as I was thinking.Yesterday I downloaded it just to see what it's all about, and here -bam! - strike! This is one of the most exciting action-filled MMORPGs out there, because it does taste like a sweet mix of Borderlands and Halo, combined with MMO-mechanics and a freakin' HUGE open-world. The setting looks a bit weird, like if Mad Max would meet Johnny Mnemonic along with Claptrap and Master Chief.Played it 4 four hours straight without a break - haven't been into a game this much for a long time. Highly recommended to all MMO and action lovers out there. Especially if you enjoyed the life on Pandora.			"

Even though its not following SyFy TV Series plot the game itself has excellent storyline for the massive multiplayer game. Didnt finished whole game to be true but I intend one day. A plenty customizable borderlands+halo look alike RPG shooter. Honestly I was quite positively surprised with the game, I did play it with my friends and had a lot of fun. My recommendations.

VERY nice F2P, MMO, open-world shooter.   Join forces with others on the server to dispatch mutants and other foes and save your allies in a surrealistic, post-apocalyptic environment.  Lots of features and upgrades, including ability to spawn an all-terrain 'sport-bike' (and later, a 4WD vehicle) whenever you need one.  Good variety of terrain, structures, and targets.  Weapons are quite decent, too.  Well-deserving of a Level 5 badge, if nothing else...Check it out.  Five-finger discounted...☺			"

												You start out designing a hero from a very limited selection and run around a tutorial that can be disrupted by other players while you fight monsters and mutants that are incapable of hurting you while you head shot them with a POS pistol. Playing with friends is very difficult as you can see and add them while not sharing missions/victories and having no discernible way to differentiate them from another random person on screen or map until you're close enough their name appears above the them. I admittedly did not give this game much if any time before removing it from my PC; that is how boring and unattractive this game is. I get that it is free but there are so many MMO's that are free to play these days and this falls well below the curve on every reason I play them.			"

												A fun game thats poorly managed and poorly optimized and has very overpriced digital items in the ""Bit store"" (DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OF THE DIGITAL ITEMS, IT's NOT WORTH IT). You can expect server crashes, server lag and quite a few game bugs. Once you grind through all that and find some friends to play with the game can be quite fun but repetitive. Expect to experience a divided community between Patron Holders and Non-Patron holders. Recommended only if you're bored and looking for third person shooter thats somewhat free to play but expect to run into a lot of pay walls and a lot grinding to level up. Not recommended if you dislike over priced digital items. SO I'm not recommending this game based on the over pricing of digital items and pay walls to have the full experience. Good luck.			"

												This was fun. Now i got every EGO square unlocked and my high tech camo armor. Once i have everything i get bored quick. Of course they keep on releasing ""new"" guns, but they're just the same old scrap with different stats and/or texture. Same models.I cannot recommend it because just like MechWarrior Online, there is close to no developement. In 4 years only got a story part that takes 30 minutes to do, if you remove the driving part. They only make events or so called new guns to keep on milking the cows. Also good old bugs that have been there since the start and never got fixed.			"

  Just another amateur scam scheme.  Don't even waste your time downloading it. You HAVE to create an account BESIDES your Steam account in order to play. But doing that appearently takes forever to register with their servers, since I did that and still cannot login.  Cannot be recommended at all.  "

Not all the bell's and whistles of other mmorpg's like WoW but not all the free for all bone heads either.  The new chat function was a big win for the players and allows you to be more involved with the other players finally.			"

												Now, before anything, I hate 3rd party DRM. Steam is enough, we don't want your turd client bloating our computers. Ok Trion? As good as this game is, Glyph is poo and you know it is. Also hot diggity damn the patches are big, so be aware of that before you decide you want to play this. This game follows a TV show on SyFy, and it is a really good show and you should watch it, but you may be thinking, is the game as good? And the answer is yes! I would venture to say that the game is better, because you have more stuff to do, and you can explore the world that you see in the show, and you can do quests that go together with the show.This game is an MMO, and that means there are a lot of people in the server with you, and they can help you complete missions because they have the missions too, which is awesome and its a mechanic that makes this game sometimes. You are not just running around killing stuff by yourself you are running around killing stuff with a random person, it makes an otherwise empty world feel alive, which is awesome. There is also something cool about seeing someone fly down the road in the opposite direction while driving alone, its a little thing, but I love it.The theme mainly has to do with Mutants to start with, and it is fun shooting and looting alone, but with a friend it is even better. This game does take a while to download though, but I think it is worth the wait. You are a Ark Hunter, who was implanted with an EGO device, which is sort of like Cortana. And you are on a ship, and it crashes. And you have to help with everything. Not going into anymore detail as not to spoil it.I think this game succeeded in making it feel like a single player game if you want it to be, but still being an MMO, which is rare, because you don't have to be in a huge party to do anything, which is great for someone with major social anxiety like me ;)I am surprised that the game is still good after it went F2P, I expected P2W everywhere, but luckily, we didn't get that, and I am thankful. You can still buy different versions of the game ranging from 20-100 dollars, which I would never do, the game is fine in normal state, and you can just buy the DLC if you really want too. Which I have no opinion on since I don't own the DLC.I don't like MMOs as a general rule, but I am in love with this game. It has it faults, but everything does. I give this a 8.75/10 The Deductions are as follows:-The Client feels unnecessary and almost like bloatware.-The game can lag, and kick you off, making you reload which can be annoying mid mission.-It made me lonely.

												Before everyone/anyone decides to say, I am warning you right now: If you don't like this game for certain reasons, then thats fine by me. However, for those of you who constantly bash this game after not even plying it or giving it a fair chance, I'll say this right now: QUIT YOUR WHINING AND DEAL WITH IT! THIS GAME WAS MADE THE WAY THEY INTENDED TO. NOW SHUT UP ALREADY! Now, down to the review. Defiance is honestly in my opinion one of the more interesting mmo type games out there. To me, it offers more than what you want to expect out of it, which in my case, is a really good thing since it adds more playability to the game. I would go into the details of how good this game is to me, but honestly, if you really want to know, play it yourself and find out. Also, one last thing before I end this review. I want everyone who plays this game to know and give me your suggestions about this game versus Destiny. When I mean suggestions, I mean the pros and cons that these games have other each other in terms of good or bad. Besides that though, if you do decide to comment on that subject, then feel free to go ahead and do so. I'm mainly asking because I think Destiny does have a     lot of problems and good things to it like Defiance. Also, if you do comment, don't just sit there and say that this game is better just because it is. "

												I personallly enjoyed this game for the short time I played it. It's simply not my cup of tea, but none the less is a great, well made game. I purchased this game shortly after it first released and was quite fun to play. I'd sit back some nights and play with my father and it was quite a bit of fun. It's F2P so honestly you have no reason not to give it a try. :)			"

												TLDR: This game is basically a more serious, online version of borderlands, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Its free so it's definitely worth the time to download and have a play around.The main problem i have with the game could be summed up by a description of one fight. I was doing a story mission, running around a ranch shooting raiders. so far so good. I then saw a miniboss on a nearby rooftop, so i pull out my sniper rifle, and shoot him in the head. his health bar stays the same but the damage readout says 4000 damage. i empty the rest of the clip into his head. not only is he still standing, his health bar is almost full. So, skip to the sixtieth headshot i get on him, and i've run out of ammo. i pull out a light machine gun and close in. five hundred rounds later, he's at 60% health. i'm not quite out of ammo but he has been spamming grenades all around me and now there's nowhere for me to go that doesn't have a detonating grenade. i get one-shot and go into bleedout. i revive myself and run behind a building.i see an ammo crate, refill my ammo, and ~150 headshots later he dies.So my problem is that enemies are far too bulletsponge-y. A basic, unarmoured bandit, with no helmet, will often take two, three or four headshots from a sniper rifle, or dozens of point blank headshots from an assault rifle, SMG, LMG etc.This, combined with the fact that enemies will just keep spawning faster than you can fill them with bullets means tht the gunplay is a bit of a letdown. quite a big problem, as a lot of mission objectives involve 'interact with this object for five seconds without taking damage' objetcives, meaning you either cheese it with cloak, or you spend 5-10 minutes in the same area just mindlessly killing the same enemies over and over again until you've got a five second window. Fast-spawning mobs would be fine, if they died quickly. bulletsponges would be fine if they were finite, which wouldn't really work in an MMO. sadly, this means that you can snipe everyone in an area, walk up to the objective and find that there was really no point because the enemies have respawned already and you're stuck in the same close quarters battle anyway.Aside from that, it is a good game. the fact it was originally not free to play means that the microtransactions aren't built in from the ground up to be 'necessary', vehicles are actually vehicles, not mounts, and you can do some fun stuff with the jet-booster quadbike you get half an hour into the game			"

												Writing from a PS3 standpoint, Defiance is a great game in which you appreciate the community action in which you can team up with others to take on naturally occuring events. The Action is great, there are many stories and the opportunities are endless. Not many options for creativity of choice, character customization is blah, skill set up is weak and bland (EGO system) and the graphics are par.			"

												If Borderlands and Gears of War had a baby, and WoW and Planetside had a baby, and then those two babies had a baby. This would be that baby.This game does feel like it was developed for  potatoes console, which it was. But still a fun game overall. Tired of playing an MMO and looking for a raid group for hours? Good, you don't need to wait in this game. Arkfalls happen dynamically and scale based on the amount of people that show up to do it. Whether its just you, or 50 other people trying to kill the big dudes, the challenge stays the same. Individual gear drops are awesome, nobody steals your loot, and the loot that drops is always geared towards your level. If you find baller gear at level 100, you can keep leveling it up with you to 4000+ if you farm (or buy) the arkstuff to level it up. Overall, I'd say 8/10. Better than most MMOs I spent 50+ bucks +subscription on.			"

Game is fun, but get rid of the pay 2 win, scammers. Also I understand people purchased this game for $50, and were not refunded in anyway. Yeah... Nice.... What's wrong with you people, and a TON of games that do this mechanic of pay 2 win. Anything you pay for in a purchasing content in the game should be of ZERO benefit to out-perform people. I made this mistake 5 years ago spending like $2k on Perfect World, and $1k on Eden Eternal, for these games were just getting popular... And the trend still continues.... I stopped after that.QUIT MAKING THESE GAMES, either put a $50 price tag on the game, or make it free to play. Get out.			"

												Generic MMO, with guns. Nothing to see here. I still cant understand how is it possible to waste dozens of gigabytes and make a crappy character animation. Lots of settings are not customizable or are too generic to give you any control at all.The world is crap, the story is ridiculous and except for your sidekick, there are no interesting characters. There are only 9 types of enemies and the challenge this game gives is about how many bullets you can shoot and how many you can take.This game screams ""I am a console game, dont bother with me.""The world is huge, but that adds nothing to the game but download size. Its an empty experience. Cars are there to take you to places which is just another boredom trip, but you also dont need them because you can just teleport to the location (which considering this game's quality can even be considered a good point). What this game does right, many other games often do better.Controls suck,Graphics are so so with really crappy animation being its trademark, Sound is repetitive and annoying, Social is whatever. I even brought a friend in and I regret for both of us.Character progression locked if not by gameplay, by DLC which must be bought. Forget PVP which is DLC bound.Guns suck. Snipers will feel totally useless, smg'ers will have some fun but will need to keep an annoying walk home to refill bullets. Go rifles or shotguns and you may even get a decent score against those people who play this 24/7. Whatever you decide, prepare for lots of WTF when you get a pickup in the middle of a fight and your best weapon gets traded by a piethrower. Enjoy getting shreded while you try to change weapons.Their distribution platform ""glyth"" sucks.If you have plenty experiences with free to play mmorpg and mmo's, you will see nothing new. If this is your first MMO ever, you may even like it because of its fresh interface. Everyone else please avoid and do yourself a favor. If you want to save time wasted installing glyth try their better game ""Archeage"" if you will, but dont keep your hopes up.			"

												Horrible game. It isnt just the stability issues, the pvp imbalances and exploits, the lack of significant content that becomes all too quickly repetitive,  the lackluster DLC(s) with delays(first took close to 5 months of multiple delays before releasing, the poor support, and more. No. It is, at its core, Trion's complete and utter consistency with which they have mismanaged, every step of the way this game to the point that problems are the norm, not the exception.The recent December 10th DLC 2 release (also 5 months of hobbling/delaying) has riddled the game with yet another round of issues, nonsensical changes, and instabilities.  Even allowing players to ""test"" it didnt change the the release of it making the testing rather pointless.Dont buy into the ""well it has potential"":  8+ months in and these issues getting worse should indicate quite adequately for that to not be the case.150+ dev staff that worked on this game up to launch were now reduced to nothing after 75% staff layoff round followed 2 months later with its studio closing.  Since then(and since the take over of Scott Hartsman as CEO of Trion) the game has continued to degrade.And according to Forbes, this was an 80 million dollar budgeted game.  AAA in budget.... D- in result.Avoid this game, even at 5 bucks, if it goes free to play, or otherwise.  If you already own it thinking for 5 bucks you couldnt do worse(yet you can), dont waste your money on any of the DLC's or season's pass. Trion has more than adequately proven that they are incapable of redeeming this title or their reputation.			"

												From what I could experience, the game is good. What's killing it is the lag. I tried to do a mission, arrived in the area where I am supposed to rescue someone, but I don't see anything. I then start looking around, for a good 20-30 seconds, and then everything appears, my shield is down, and my HP is half gone. So I take my gun, shoot the enemies, and realise none are shooting back. Another 20-30 seconds goes by, those enemies are dead, and so am I, since in that time new enemies arrived. Unfortunately, those severe lags makes the game unplayable. Of course, if this gets fixed, I will change this review.			"

												Honestly, a game that should have had more content. A great core system, and unique gameplay.  Defiance, a new, fresh sapling, planted in the grove of TV shows, small among the larger titles, microscopic. However, it began to grow quickly, soon bringing ample fruit to Syfy. It began to grow and grow, to be almost as large as the others. The fruits were rich, and the tree ever-growing. Then, they decided to try something. Another group, another sapling, grown to intertwine with the first tree, creating a masterpiece, whilst also adding more fruit to their harvest. The second tree swiftly grew, as large as the first, maybe even larger. Both trees kept growing, and producing their fruit. Soon, though, the largest tree began to stop producing its fruit. Syfy decided it would be best to simply cut it down. They took it, leaving the younger tree alone. The tree still flourished, its fruit just as sweet as ever. That was soon to end. The tree was built upon the foundations of its elder. It was never supposed to stand on its own. It slowly began to stop growing, and slowly, its fruit, too, began to decline. The Developers tried desperately to keep it alive, to keep it well. Soon, they even went so far as to allow people the fruit, without charge. This slowly began to help, but it would never be enough to recover. The tree still dies, and there is only one thing that could save it. If they were to begin the cycle again, by planting the seed of Defiance, letting it grow in place of the elder, and supporting the other tree. Both would flourish, producing its sweet fruit again, for both the Developers, and Syfy. However, Syfy has a different plan. Planting trees that swiftly produced sub-par fruit, and die as quickly as they are grown. None surpassing the duo known as Defiance. Syfy seems to be ignoring the looming issue, that Defiance seems to have been one of the few decent trees they had planted, and they had ignored it, and simply cut it down as it began to decline.

												Yep its a 3th person open world MMO-FPS. Its pretty much Guild Wars 2 + Borderlands = DefianceSouds like the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea ever doesnt it? Yeah but something is just... not as it should be... something is missing. I cant quite put my finger on it just yet but something is holding it back from beeing ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome"" to just ""pretty good"".Pros:- up to 64vs64 PvP (PvP also provides exp)- random events where tons of people group up and OWN♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- Graphics are nothing special but still pretty good.- Customizable weapons. Borderlands style - a few parts to replace + weapon effects like fire, toxic etc- enemies have weak points (different for every creature) so good aim is required to deal more dps.- fully voiced- doing quests is optional, you can level up from events alone- levels dont really matter. Cons:- The menu is terrible, obviously made for consoles- the EGO (or talents or whatever you like to call them) are pretty... bland and at times i feel like they're even pointless.- out of the 7 alien races (+ humans) in the TV show you get to pick between just 2 (3 if you get the DLC for it)- lack of wildlife, enemy variety and a rather small map. I mean c'mon its the post apocalyptic-ish teraformed Earth, they could've done alot more with that. It could be easily fixed in future expansions though.Theres alot more little things that i like/disslike about the game but all and all i'd give it a solid 7/10.Its still a fun free game so i'd reccomend you to give it a try, its not like you're losing anything.

												Yep its a 3th person open world MMO-FPS. Its pretty much Guild Wars 2 + Borderlands = DefianceSouds like the best ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea ever doesnt it? Yeah but something is just... not as it should be... something is missing. I cant quite put my finger on it just yet but something is holding it back from beeing ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome"" to just ""pretty good"".Pros:- up to 64vs64 PvP (PvP also provides exp)- random events where tons of people group up and OWN♥♥♥♥♥♥br>- Graphics are nothing special but still pretty good.- Customizable weapons. Borderlands style - a few parts to replace + weapon effects like fire, toxic etc- enemies have weak points (different for every creature) so good aim is required to deal more dps.- fully voiced- doing quests is optional, you can level up from events alone- levels dont really matter. Cons:- The menu is terrible, obviously made for consoles- the EGO (or talents or whatever you like to call them) are pretty... bland and at times i feel like they're even pointless.- out of the 7 alien races (+ humans) in the TV show you get to pick between just 2 (3 if you get the DLC for it)- lack of wildlife, enemy variety and a rather small map.

Would not recommend playing it. Just a waste of valuable hd space that you could use for other things like pics of that hot blonde down the street for... research. Go play Borderlands 2 with  few friends  instead. You'll have a much better time.			"

												As a priced game, I am not sure if this would be worth your money. But as a free game? You have to try this. Even if you don't like the story, poor acting, repetitive music or other many other things. The gameplay was done better than most of the triple A games that you see now. Even though it's boring, there is a sense of addiction that keeps bringing you back. Free to Play or Pay to Play More? You'll still have fun, and this game won't treat players who don't pay as second class players. If anything the paying players may be at more of a disadvantage.Still recieves updates. They recently added an entire but undeveloped (so far) large Island called Silicon Valley and it's not a DLC. Potential of things to come.EDIT: I forgot to mention that this doesn't feel heavily like an MMO, the elements are there but it's not too distracting. More often than not you will appreciate having other players with you.Overall review: Meh but if you have some time to kill give it a once over.			"

From the environments, vehicles, characters, enemies, moving trees, weather... it's amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. We need more people to play. I wonder if this is a cross platform though. It would be nice. The free roaming map is huge! Come sci fans play this game! I don't like overly complicated games... real life is hard enough. Good way to release stress.			"

												Been playing this game for a while since i found out it existed as F2P (Don't judge me on that :P ) If you read the other reviews you'll tend to see alot of ""It's repetitive"", ""It's buggy"" and of course ""HAXORS"". I can safely say that it's true (well except for the hax. I haven't seen any yet). (To get an idea of pace here's a taste of what is known as a Major Arkfall (they take some strategy to complete in time) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbnXdifbkMA )On the note of repetitive: You play an MMO. This is what they are. I've played my fair share and they are very much a case of ""Get this and go there"", ""Kill those things before they break that other thing"", ""Protect this very important person"" and of course ""You have to kill everything that comes in here but there will be waves of them so just get comfy"". There are MMO's out there with a story but even those are kind of crap.On the note of bugs: Quest bugs. OH GOD THE BUGS.. The game has them in a literal sense (Hellbugs) and in a programming sense (events that won't complete). I raged so hard on one of them because I'd wasted a good 15 mins protecting a crystal before I realised the event bugged out and there was nothing coming to get it.Can I recommend this? Hell yes. I'm having a bucket load of fun blowing stuff up and joining Clan mates on Warmaster events. It won't be for everyone and I haven't had to deal with the Helpdesk yet (touch wood). Heck I'm even thinking of buying DLC.. Maybe.			"

												At first this is fun, even if you never saw the show. But after a day or so you quickly realize how boring this is going to get.The perks are simple. 1. An open world, low skill based MMO. I've taken on enemies I probably shouldn't have and survived. And much like GW2, a far better game in my opinion, you don't NEED a party to help each other out.The negatives are a little more.1. It doesn't require that much skill honestly, repetitive missions.2. Seriously sick of killing numerous bugs and bandits over and over and over and over and over and......getting it?3. If there are tutorials for 75% of what you should know, I can't find them. What I have had to do is exit the game and go watch a plethora of youtube videos just to get an idea of what the hell is going on. 4. Anyone who tells you the graphics are awesome, should go back to consoles and stay there. This game looks like it came out in 2003. 5. I fell 1000 meters and didn't die, yes that's a complaint. It's showing a huge flaw in the simplest aspects of a game.FInally, the biggest negative is the world. It's Earth, but not Earth. It's been 'partially' terraformed? That doesn't make a lick of sense. Lightsabers make more sense.In the end, you might like to keep it around for a quick and easy way to blow off steam, but there are better games out there even for free.			"

												Basically a third- and (when scoping guns first-)person Borderlands-ish MMOFPS with a thus far smaller cast and perhaps less crazy and silly attitudes but providing seemingly just as much things to shoot and collect and some maybe interesting lore and story though I won't judge now because I'm not too far into it yet.Areas are wide, cars can be spawned anytime, there are fixed hostile places to shoot mobs up at, main/side missions to pick up in the world and seemingly random events spawning all around. Indoor environments I haven't seen so far. There is very little direct interaction with the environment besides some gear vending machines, mission-specific buttons and terminals to use (like, no NPCs to talk to, no doors to open, no secret caves to discover) but the random events are aplenty and they can distract you and keep you busy all the time if you let them. They don't provide anything worth of attention story-/narration-wise, often it's ""just"" about you collecting some Alien flora, reviving/supporting NPCs in distress and generally shooting up hordes of enemies but thus far I'm not bored by it. It's fun to shoot stuff up and loot and level up and all.The ambiance is generally good. Graphics are okay for a MMOG. I noticed a few nice music tracks, there are some reoccurring characters who are fully (and nicely) voiced having distinctive looks and their own but not necessarily too original personalities (so far: a kinda hard-boiled military guy, some sexy female Alien mercenary/hackwiz and some cocky senior researcher with what sounds like a German name - but thankfully he is fluent with his English so it's not 100% stereotype).Immersion is sometimes broken a bit when random events/groups/fighting spots appear because they do so quick without much introduction and hesitation and without much respect to the player's location, just as they disappear into thin air the same way afterwards. If you stand still in the middle of some lost, lonely road it can very much happen that a minute later a car barricade spawns around you with allied NPCs defending it and hostiles swarming it. One event has you defend a weapon vending machine and even if you are browsing it's corresponding buying menu the whole assets will vanish a minute or so later regardless if you've finished your purchases or not. That can feel awkward.Combat is real-time shooting. Third-person by default but some scoped guns let you go into first-person. Shoot, dodge, loot, shoot, dodge, loot. Loot contains ammo, cash and gear of various rarity stages. Revive or heal another player with a support gun maybe. Partying up is not required for these basics to work. XP is gained by finishing quests and killing stuff, every player apparently gets his own loot, certain random events encourage to fight together for their difficulty while others can be soloed with relative ease. Sometimes metaevents seem to spawn that have people drive across various places of the map in attempts to stop some hostile incursions or such. Especially multi-stage siege events require numerous players to fight together. There seem to be some other modes besides this open-world free-roam like PvP and special co-op which includes a matchmaking and seperate maps by the looks of it. At a time you can have one active combat skill and two gear-related boosts (one affecting a small area around you and allies within, one only aiding you) with cooldowns. There is a skill grid to put level-up points into but that grid has you mostly acquire passive perks that boost your effectiveness with certain ways of combat rather than to give you active skills and thus the combat is initially dictated by what guns you use in which way. Some enemies have shields and armor, some guns and grenades have elemental attributes and there are regenerative shields you equip which play into this too. In the early phases fighting weaker enemies this doesn't play too much of a role but I expect this to get more important later on as I've already encountered some small bosses who are probably cracked easier when paying attention to these mechanics. There is something what felt like a class-selection to me in the beginning but it looks to me as if lines are rather blurry and you aren't forced as much to stick with one way of fighting.Hostile AI is rather dumb. Enemies basically swarm you heads-up. They evade to the sides if you shoot, but I think I'm beginning to understand their patterns (at least those of the humanoid enemies). They have certain weak spots (humanoids mostly their heads, big bulky armored ones others which cripple them, critters elsewhere). They do have nice animations and effects and there is a quite some good lore-wise variety even in the earliest parts of the game: There are always some enemies attacking at range and some going for melee, but they have distinctive looks that make me want to know more about them and the background of their factions. One enemy pool for example consists of somewhat ghastly humanoids who, once killed, spawn futuristic revenant-like creatures that could have been inspired by Final Fantasy: Spirits Within.Parts of the interface could feel a bit more intuitive. I'm particularly struggling a bit with the one that allows you to salvage and put mods into your guns because it requires too much back and forth I think. Others are pretty fine, and technically the game runs and looks well. Controls are easy and reduced to a minimum, the character creation is having some but not massive options. After an opening cutscene where you crash with a ""Stratocarrier"" onto what could be our earth or not (I haven't understood thus far; there is some terraforming talk but there the area map has locations named like earth-places such as ""Silicon Valley"") you are quickly dropped into the game and can get going on your own or follow the storyline.

The character animations could do a little improving but overall theyre not that bad.. Interface is pretty confusing in the beginning, and is kind of still pretty confusing to me.

												Very fun. At it's core it's a basic 3rd person action shooter, but you play it online with many other people. Sometimes it's a little buggy and the social features could use some work but the gameplay is solid and there are a lot of activities to do. It's a good game to play every once in a while for some decent sci-fi blasting.			"

												Basically a third- and (when scoping guns first-)person Borderlands-ish MMOFPS with a thus far smaller cast and perhaps less crazy and silly attitudes but providing seemingly just as much things to shoot and collect and some maybe interesting lore and story though I won't judge now because I'm not too far into it yet.Areas are wide, cars can be spawned anytime, there are fixed hostile places to shoot mobs up at, main/side missions to pick up in the world and seemingly random events spawning all around. Indoor environments I haven't seen so far. There is very little direct interaction with the environment besides some gear vending machines, mission-specific buttons and terminals to use (like, no NPCs to talk to, no doors to open, no secret caves to discover) but the random events are aplenty and they can distract you and keep you busy all the time if you let them. They don't provide anything worth of attention story-/narration-wise, often it's ""just"" about you collecting some Alien flora, reviving/supporting NPCs in distress and generally shooting up hordes of enemies but thus far I'm not bored by it. It's fun to shoot stuff up and loot and level up and all.The ambiance is generally good. Graphics are okay for a MMOG. I noticed a few nice music tracks, there are some reoccurring characters who are fully (and nicely) voiced having distinctive looks and their own but not necessarily too original personalities (so far: a kinda hard-boiled military guy, some sexy female Alien mercenary/hackwiz and some cocky senior researcher with what sounds like a German name - but thankfully he is fluent with his English so it's not 100% stereotype).Immersion is sometimes broken a bit when random events/groups/fighting spots appear because they do so quick without much introduction and hesitation and without much respect to the player's location, just as they disappear into thin air the same way afterwards. If you stand still in the middle of some lost, lonely road it can very much happen that a minute later a car barricade spawns around you with allied NPCs defending it and hostiles swarming it. One event has you defend a weapon vending machine and even if you are browsing it's corresponding buying menu the whole assets will vanish a minute or so later regardless if you've finished your purchases or not. That can feel awkward.Combat is real-time shooting. Third-person by default but some scoped guns let you go into first-person. Shoot, dodge, loot, shoot, dodge, loot. Loot contains ammo, cash and gear of various rarity stages. Revive or heal another player with a support gun maybe. Partying up is not required for these basics to work. XP is gained by finishing quests and killing stuff, every player apparently gets his own loot, certain random events encourage to fight together for their difficulty while others can be soloed with relative ease. Sometimes metaevents seem to spawn that have people drive across various places of the map in attempts to stop some hostile incursions or such. Especially multi-stage siege events require numerous players to fight together. There seem to be some other modes besides this open-world free-roam like PvP and special co-op which includes a matchmaking and seperate maps by the looks of it. At a time you can have one active combat skill and two gear-related boosts (one affecting a small area around you and allies within, one only aiding you) with cooldowns. There is a skill grid to put level-up points into but that grid has you mostly acquire passive perks that boost your effectiveness with certain ways of combat rather than to give you active skills and thus the combat is initially dictated by what guns you use in which way. Some enemies have shields and armor, some guns and grenades have elemental attributes and there are regenerative shields you equip which play into this too. In the early phases fighting weaker enemies this doesn't play too much of a role but I expect this to get more important later on as I've already encountered some small bosses who are probably cracked easier when paying attention to these mechanics. There is something what felt like a class-selection to me in the beginning but it looks to me as if lines are rather blurry and you aren't forced as much to stick with one way of fighting.Hostile AI is rather dumb. Enemies basically swarm you heads-up. They evade to the sides if you shoot, but I think I'm beginning to understand their patterns (at least those of the humanoid enemies). They have certain weak spots (humanoids mostly their heads, big bulky armored ones others which cripple them, critters elsewhere). They do have nice animations and effects and there is a quite some good lore-wise variety even in the earliest parts of the game: There are always some enemies attacking at range and some going for melee, but they have distinctive looks that make me want to know more about them and the background of their factions. One enemy pool for example consists of somewhat ghastly humanoids who, once killed, spawn futuristic revenant-like creatures that could have been inspired by Final Fantasy: Spirits Within.Parts of the interface could feel a bit more intuitive. I'm particularly struggling a bit with the one that allows you to salvage and put mods into your guns because it requires too much back and forth I think. Others are pretty fine, and technically the game runs and looks well. Controls are easy and reduced to a minimum, the character creation is having some but not massive options. After an opening cutscene where you crash with a ""Stratocarrier"" onto what could be our earth or not (I haven't understood thus far; there is some terraforming talk but there the area map has locations named like earth-places such as ""Silicon Valley"") you are quickly dropped into the game and can get going on your own or follow the storyline.

												Only fond this game from a youtuber, then watched the serise.I got this when you had to pay for it, even then i think its wroth the money., the bonus now is cos it's free to play they give everyone who brought the game little bonuses =]For a free to play game you can't go wrong, ok yes it can get reppetative, but a lot of MMOs can. its easy to connect with your friends through Steam and it still clocks your hours of gaming. I've brought the expantions which give you more missions, an extra area of the map ( a little small but tougher enimies) and new weapons and skins. There is no need to buy the expations unless you're really into it, so it really can just be free.Overall for a F2P you can't complain much. In MY OPINION (yes what i think so this is not fact), its a good fun game which can entertain you for hours.Download it for free and try it out yourself.(FYI, I'm dyslexic so sorry if spelling grammer and all that jazz isn't very good).

												Definately a fun game. While the community isnt growing, the devs still care about the players are release content constantly. HOWEVER: DO NOT go into this game thinking it's free, since it was a previous pay to play game, it definately has microtransactions. I bought the game before it was f2p for $15, and when they switched over to f2p, i got a few exclusives, but it was enough to keep in the fight for leaderboards and not fall behind people who constantly spent money. I would recommend putting in a little bit of money just to be able to do some extra stuff (something useful though, not a weapon crate or anything, but something like the keycode capacity upgrade, or something along the lines of that.) and if you don't want to, at least get the DLC, its actually something worth buying, not like a COD map pack or anything. The game itself plays similar to Destiny, constantly grinding, but still a ton of stuff to do. It also follows along with the TV show, so as new seasons come out, so do new missions.			"

												When you first get in to the game it might seem like any other MMO/RPG game as you always see. But I gotta say, this game does bring some new things to it. Sadly I still think it needs something more unique about it so it's not too similar to the other MMO/RPG's. But try it, you might like it!			"

												What I will say is that Defiance is surprisingly fun, I honestly thought it would be just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ F2P Shooter title lacking actual substance like China lacks freedom of speech; however upon playing it for about an hour I realised there was plenty going on at once but not too much to make your brain melt out of a lack of coherrent streamlining. HOWEVER, Two things really bug the crap out of me: 1. If your playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller; don't get used to it, it bugs out after about 20-30mins of gametime wherein you can no longer sprint and your guns will either fire uncontrollably or won't fire at all leaving you to run in headfirst and attack the enemies with the butt-end of your gun; slowly chipping away health while you ponder to yourself about how much trying to bash someone's brains in with a rifle stock would actually hurt them and how tired you'd be after doing it once and realising there's about 10 more guys firing at you that you've also got to kill. Although this can be very easily rectified by unplugging your controller and using the mouse and keyboard (simple right?) 2. Enemy Healthbars are fine, no problem with the idea of them, but if you're going to make the full bar itself a backdrop for the amount of healthe enemy has left, DON'T MAKE IT THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING COLOUR HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ It can be SO difficult to actually see how much health some ♥♥♥♥ing mutant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has left when you've got 20 of these shitgobblers charging at you. BUT ON THE WHOLE, I do reccomend Defiance as it is nice to see that some developers actually do put time and real thought into their games and not do some copy-paste job with a slightly different name and $2 hooker makeup on it while it screams ""PLEASE LOVE ME I REALY AM DIFFERENT NOW, I'VE CHANGED, HONEST""			"

												Alright. Defiance. Where to start? I think I'll start with basic information.Defiance is a free-to-play third person shooter MMO. It has some basic mechanics such as vehicle use and your firefights, but there's also your MMO elements such as weapon elementals, 4 abilities each with its own unique skill tree (grid). Most of your time will be spent probably looking for some pretty snazzy loot. Or, you could take the team approach and go hunt down some ""Arkfalls"". More to be explained.Story:Defiance is set in post apocolyptic alien America, in the California region. It is based off of the SyFy show, called, well, Defiance. Your job is to locate and collect the Ark technology to cleanse the earth of the aliens who intend to, well, as most aliens do, take over the planet. (That's the jist I believe. Haven't done too much story, and haven't started the first season yet).Gameplay:Gameplay is exciting and is sure to keep your attention. You'll have to develop skills with your weapons (you rank up each specific weapon type to gain perks for said weapon type, e.g. Bolt Action Snipers or Pump Shotguns.) that can be used for aid in combat. You'll also want to learn to develop combat strategies for all of the different types of enemies ranging from weak Hellbug Skitterlings to massive, tanky Minigunners.Graphics:Graphics are surprisingly well done for a TV show game. Yes, I'm aware some aren't terrible, but I was't too impressed with a few. Defiance look stunning. I love wandering around gazing at the various sights. It's a pretty good visual to have.Flaws:I feel like there isn't enough depth to the co-op. Pretty much everything can be done solo, with the exceptions of Arkfalls and the major events that occur over time. Missions can all be solo'd if you have the weaponry and levels.Another thing is the level system. This one isn't a super big issue, just felt strange, so I listed it as a flaw. It's so strange. You have these numbers that just kinda rise and fall as they're needed, aside to your permanent level. It's hard to explain, but you'll see for yourself.Overview:In general, Defiance is a solid game. Free to play, everything that can be done with real money can be done with IN GAME currency, so there's no need to spend your hard-earned cash on some shiny new weaponry. Unless you're impatient, of course. The gameplay feels solid, and I enjoy playing with friends despite the somewhat visible push for co-op.Based on my experiences with a lot of F2P games and how Defiance stands out, I rate Defiance a solid 9/10.

												This game was a very smooth and glitch-free 3rd person shooter, darn near the best I've ever played. It was free to play but the purchase of the ingame content was not nessesary to really enjoy the game. Out of nowhere, Glyph would start and not bring up the log in screen. I tried as far as completly removing and reinstalling the game but to no avail. The eight hours it took me to reinstall was the maximum amount of effort I am willing to put in to get it working again. There is no live support and although I really loved the game, I am moving on. Poor support, breaking for no reason, Locking me out of a game I enjoyed, I cannot recommend a broken game.			"

												Very interesting f2p you should try. It's really a hit or miss, honestly, but it managed to charm me. So basically, Defiance is an MMORPG but in a TPS point of view. Think of it like borderlands, but with more people running around, and events/instances to do as you travel. Honestly, it's really fun, but it's really confusing as they don't really specify where or how to get to your story quests, and you'll often find yourself lost, but hey! The guns are pretty sweet in this game, and it's pretty cool in what you can get.			"

												Very interesting f2p you should try. It's really a hit or miss, honestly, but it managed to charm me. So basically, Defiance is an MMORPG but in a TPS point of view. Think of it like borderlands, but with more people running around, and events/instances to do as you travel. Honestly, it's really fun, but it's really confusing as they don't really specify where or how to get to your story quests, and you'll often find yourself lost, but hey! The guns are pretty sweet in this game, and it's pretty cool in what you can get.			"

												You know, I used to play this game daily with my mates when it became free or so, and we played the hell out of it. Time passed and no interesting updates came, nothing that would make us want to play this game any further came, so we abandoned it until we saw any updates. Alcatraz came in, so I decided to redownload it and give it a go... BUT WOE IS ME, my account and details had ALL been wiped, and with it, my season pass and the separate times i bought the DLCs gone down the trash. My money, gone. And so is the same case for many others whom play this game. The Devs don't even give special bonuses or any type of compensations for those whom bought this game when it first released. I had put up a support ticket so they could resolve my problem and get my account back, but WHOOP-DEE-F*CKING-DOO!!! NO, NOTHING, NADA, NO RESPONSE! It's been about a year since and not a single thing has been fixed. THANKS FOR NICKING MY CASH TRION!!!! F*CKING DIE IN A HOLE/10, DO NOT EVEN TOUCH THIS.			"

												i was sceptical when it came out as a 60$ game but still whant to try out now when it came out as f2p it feels a great game eaven i was going to buy it game feels great as a free 2 play game i never feel need to pay my own money for cosmetics or guns pve feels that it's little should have more to go but pvp is very stable guns feel stabilazed, and farming for money do not take a lot of time. so pros/cons  pros:-stable pvp-great land marks -great mmo feel-everchaging storymode (at the end you can restart story mode but it will have other storyline than you had before)-no need of p2w-great types of missions-no mission restart cons-pve need upgrade (some enemy ai to powerfull at the start)-poor character customization options -poor animated cinematics "

												Defiance is not that bad but it's also not all that good. However, it is a decent TPS multiplayer shooter that does provide some enjoyment.Essentially, this game becomes extremely repetitive in a very short amount of time. Everything about it is mediocre. It really does nothing all that great.The vast amount of bugs, bad balance, terrible chat, smallest MMO game world I have seen, small amount of content/story, boring grinds, and awful design decisions tends to drag this game down. Like say....PvP. Worst ever!However, I do enjoy the PvE MMO aspect since it's fun to mindlessly kill the terrible AI; it takes no skill what so ever +1. This game is really easy to play which is about it's only saving grace and the reason why I still log on occasionally. Mowing down hordes of enemies with up to 50 players at once is kinda cool which no other current online shooter I know of offers this atm. The shooting is pretty smooth and fluid so it's quite playable. Lastly, chasing loot can keep a player going even if the RNG is awfully bad. It is a nasty grind though, so beware.Problem is, the content in this game is lacking and due to the now bare bones dev team: new content and updates are far and few between + poor in quality/quantity. :(Recommending Defiance only if you can get it for 5 bucks or less. It's good fun as a PvE game if you want to relax and shoot hapless AI.Rating: 6/10			"

												So far this is pretty fun. If you have issues playing through steam. Do not use the steam shortcut or the button in steam. Just go to the folder where the game is, make a shortcut of GlyphClient. For some reason when using steam as a wrapper causes bad errors. And when buying the extra stuff through steam, like weapon pack ect.... You have to REDEEM THE CODES once inside the game to get your goodies. So leave game, buy. Restart using your shortcut, once you enter the game the key code will appear in a box in the upper right, type that code. Ideally restarting through steam, you can copy to clipboard. Can do that first, close it. Go through GlyphClient.As for game, it is kinda like BL as a MMO. Some aspects remind me of Rift. Cutscenes remind me of The Secret World, using your toon and what they wear in the cutscenes. I was so worried about it being terrible. Well... if a game makes me wake up early the next morning yearning to play it, then it is good in my book.Driving is, eh... could be better. Mainly turning controls, would be nice to loosen or soften it up some.Aiming is good.Rolling is really nice. Love it!Story so far, ok.For now. Only 5 hours in, so... things can change.			"

												What I will say is that Defiance is surprisingly fun, I honestly thought it would be just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ F2P Shooter title lacking actual substance like China lacks freedom of speech; however upon playing it for about an hour I realised there was plenty going on at once but not too much to make your brain melt out of a lack of coherrent streamlining. HOWEVER, Two things really bug the crap out of me: 1. If your playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller; don't get used to it, it bugs out after about 20-30mins of gametime wherein you can no longer sprint and your guns will either fire uncontrollably or won't fire at all leaving you to run in headfirst and attack the enemies with the butt-end of your gun; slowly chipping away health while you ponder to yourself about how much trying to bash someone's brains in with a rifle stock would actually hurt them and how tired you'd be after doing it once and realising there's about 10 more guys firing at you that you've also got to kill. Although this can be very easily rectified by unplugging your controller and using the mouse and keyboard (simple right?) 2. Enemy Healthbars are fine, no problem with the idea of them, but if you're going to make the full bar itself a backdrop for the amount of healthe enemy has left, DON'T MAKE IT THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING COLOUR HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ It can be SO difficult to actually see how much health some ♥♥♥♥ing mutant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has left when you've got 20 of these shitgobblers charging at you. BUT ON THE WHOLE, I do reccomend Defiance as it is nice to see that some developers actually do put time and real thought into their games and not do some copy-paste job with a slightly different name and $2 hooker makeup on it while it screams ""PLEASE LOVE ME I REALY AM DIFFERENT NOW, I'VE CHANGED, HONEST""			"

												Alright. Defiance. Where to start? I think I'll start with basic information.Defiance is a free-to-play third person shooter MMO. It has some basic mechanics such as vehicle use and your firefights, but there's also your MMO elements such as weapon elementals, 4 abilities each with its own unique skill tree (grid). Most of your time will be spent probably looking for some pretty snazzy loot. Or, you could take the team approach and go hunt down some ""Arkfalls"". More to be explained.Story:Defiance is set in post apocolyptic alien America, in the California region. It is based off of the SyFy show, called, well, Defiance. Your job is to locate and collect the Ark technology to cleanse the earth of the aliens who intend to, well, as most aliens do, take over the planet. (That's the jist I believe. Haven't done too much story, and haven't started the first season yet).Gameplay:Gameplay is exciting and is sure to keep your attention. You'll have to develop skills with your weapons (you rank up each specific weapon type to gain perks for said weapon type, e.g. Bolt Action Snipers or Pump Shotguns.) that can be used for aid in combat. You'll also want to learn to develop combat strategies for all of the different types of enemies ranging from weak Hellbug Skitterlings to massive, tanky Minigunners.Graphics:Graphics are surprisingly well done for a TV show game. Yes, I'm aware some aren't terrible, but I was't too impressed with a few. Defiance look stunning. I love wandering around gazing at the various sights. It's a pretty good visual to have.Flaws:I feel like there isn't enough depth to the co-op. Pretty much everything can be done solo, with the exceptions of Arkfalls and the major events that occur over time. Missions can all be solo'd if you have the weaponry and levels.Another thing is the level system. This one isn't a super big issue, just felt strange, so I listed it as a flaw. It's so strange. You have these numbers that just kinda rise and fall as they're needed, aside to your permanent level. It's hard to explain, but you'll see for yourself.Overview:In general, Defiance is a solid game. Free to play, everything that can be done with real money can be done with IN GAME currency, so there's no need to spend your hard-earned cash on some shiny new weaponry. Unless you're impatient, of course. The gameplay feels solid, and I enjoy playing with friends despite the somewhat visible push for co-op.Based on my experiences with a lot of F2P games and how Defiance stands out, I rate Defiance a solid 9/10.

												This game has done things no MMO has ever done. Every shooter MMO i have ever played has been HORRIBLE. horrible gun mechanics, horribly made, and confusing. This MMO does it perfectly. With random events, beautiful scenery , and huge map, this game has some ""Next gen"" Features that are just coming in other games today! (such as random events in gta 5. They made this game before gta 5 of course) It was next gen before we even knew what next gen is . With immersive gameplay, extreme fun with friends, and for being that kind of game you can just hop on and then hop off, i rate this game a 9/10. The only complaint i have is: the animations seem a bit choppy at times. But afterall, it is a mmo! This is the best MMO i have ever played graphics wise, besides Elder Scrolls Online. But Come on now, its kind of hard to beat skyrim.But anyways.9/10. Must buy if your a fan of borderlands, fallout, or the MMO Category of games.			"

But either way it feels nice, with 3 races to choose from and an interesting power skill tree line, and planty of guns, grenades, and sheilds to collect all around and all the mission and bonus missions they give you i believe if you like it you'll play for awhile.Honestly i give this game a 3.4 out of 5 and thats just for now since ive only played roughly through the beggining, and i can say its gotta decent story line so far~ So check it out it's not bad`			"

												Defiance is not that bad but it's also not all that good. However, it is a decent TPS multiplayer shooter that does provide some enjoyment.Essentially, this game becomes extremely repetitive in a very short amount of time. Everything about it is mediocre. It really does nothing all that great.The vast amount of bugs, bad balance, terrible chat, smallest MMO game world I have seen, small amount of content/story, boring grinds, and awful design decisions tends to drag this game down. Like say....PvP. Worst ever!However, I do enjoy the PvE MMO aspect since it's fun to mindlessly kill the terrible AI; it takes no skill what so ever +1. This game is really easy to play which is about it's only saving grace and the reason why I still log on occasionally. Mowing down hordes of enemies with up to 50 players at once is kinda cool which no other current online shooter I know of offers this atm. The shooting is pretty smooth and fluid so it's quite playable. Lastly, chasing loot can keep a player going even if the RNG is awfully bad. It is a nasty grind though, so beware.Problem is, the content in this game is lacking and due to the now bare bones dev team: new content and updates are far and few between + poor in quality/quantity. :(Recommending Defiance only if you can get it for 5 bucks or less. It's good fun as a PvE game if you want to relax and shoot hapless AI.Rating: 6/10			"

												Defiance was a game i went in expecting a more negative approach due to past readups and reviews.  that clearly ha changed.I'm suprisingly enjoying defiance more than i thought, but it's a game where i have to put the use of the word 'average' in all aspects because it doesnt have a lot of fluff or flare.combat is average, graphics is ok, mothing buggy in terms of gameplay save the server instability at the moment, everything just works.  I feel ok about that,  nothing in the cash shop boasts a true advantage over another person in terms of power.  mainly conviences and whatnot. possibly dlc advantage but its flatline minimal and doesnt exactly boast a huge difference.   you can activate major arkfall and minor arkfall sites bu thats about anything i see as a distinct advnatage, anyone and everyone can freely participate and recieve rewards although some are dlc locked.  some of which, are alterations of already avalabile weaponry.controls are good, but for it being a TPS my aching pain of NOT having a camera hop button is just something that all TPS type games should have.  however, defiance here has it fairly tight to the player to not make a huge difference, and, reliably dipicts weather or not you can hit then with color identifiable crosshairs.i'd call it passable in my book but dont expect a bedazzled kind of shooter.   its a TPS DIY perk/active system that bottom line works, and i'm ok with that.

So I not only recommend playing, but totally telling you to download ASAP.Also, it´s FWEE. Not SW:TOR free, or GoT free, it´s free, with minor annoyances.

It's VERY different from any traditional MMO, more like Borderlands with♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of people. lol  Stay away from the quests / story though.

												i bought this on launch day, paid 40dollars. i spent 200+hours in this game, just to realize how meaningless it was to put some effort in this game. you can just keep grind grind grind grind grind all day long to find epic weapon. and when you finally get one, you will be pretty dissapointed. yeah! its rare and named is in orange color! lets look at the stats...wait, i see barely any differenth between comon weapon. this game is massive grind fest which rewards you with almost nothing. rushing to random event and showing off your name on the score board was fun, but that was back then when people actually played this game. i feel nostalgic,			"

												so far, so good... this game feels a lot like 3rd person borderlands, except you dont get a better weapon every 12 minutes... sure it has many glitchy, sometimes frustrating flaws, but it is hard to not want to keep playing this game... i have watched a few episodes of the show, and i guess they kinda tie into the game, but the game is faaaar more entertaining.  it takes a good 7-10 hours to really start to appreciate it.  You can tell the devs were shooting for a cross between BORDERLANDS & DESTINY and this isnt a bad thing... I cant complain about the execution because it IS free, and definately not pay-to-win, but lets face it- the voice acting is stale at best, and repetitive, but you will keep coming back for that sweet, bitter sweet gameplay... one beef though- A THIRD PARTY APP TO LAUNCH THE GAME WHEN I DOWNLOADED IT FROM STEAM IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY! (to be fair the glyph app is not to intrusive, but just hours after downloading the game i had to download another 1 gb update, and another 750mb update a few days later... come on guys, new content is great, but i barely got into this game at over 17 hrs- i dont need the content for the level 1 milliion people just yet!)  i'll continue to play this game untill the paywall hits, but i have a feeling that will be a while from now.  If you are considering downloading this FREE GAME, just do it, i doubt you will be dissapointed!  SOLID 7/10			"

												This is what Destiny wishes it could be now the story of Defiance is sort of new (I say sort of since I have no idea if this was done before) so good on them won't spoil it though. Combat is nothing special so don't expect anything new shooter wise although they added melee weapons so that might spice it up a bit. The environment is large so plenty of quests and activities to do here so no worries; Customization is limited at character creation only allowing you to pick between 3 races Human, Irathian, and Casitan then customizing the face of said race and what background the character has, but it gets more variety in costume armor (armor that serves no purpose other than looks) only thing is you can't mix and match individual pieces and armor color. Ok now the main thing about defiance is their ArkFalls these can range from small 3 man sized falls to raid sized falls that need multiple stages for completion like Rift's system and completion of said Ark Falls allow you to get some good loot and with the addition of being able to call down your own Ark Fall you can basicly use these to level your character and EGO power and their tie in to the series which every season gives a new set of quests so even more stuff to doSince the series has now ended now we see if Defiance can bring in any good events without relying on the series also in my haste to make this review i forgot to mention ""classes"" those are basicly useless they only really serve to give you a starting costume armor set and a primary weapon that fits each ""class"" veterans get the assualt rifle, outlaws get a shotgun, Engineers get a LMG, and Survivalists get sniper rifles; but any class can use these weapons any way so again classes are useless same with races so i would say that Trion Worlds should remove that or rework it like maybe make them more important like each class has a higher proficiency with this weapon or E.G.O power. Now there are 4 E.G.O powers in the game with a possible fifth i don't remember if that was only during an event and not added in permanently but the four main ones are Overcharge which increases all damage output and increases accuracy as well, Invisibility self explanitory only thing that should be mentioned is that your damage is increased while invisibility it active but it's only for the first shot so make that shot count, Decoy makes a hologram that all enemies attack although player characters will ignore it you can switch with it to attack from behind enemy lines, and finally blur this increases movement speed and melee damage so really good for up close and personal fights gives a bit of damage resistance to. I hope that this review helps people and to anyone who found this helpfull thank you			"

												So here I am, sitting at my computer clicking back and forth, back and forth.I've wasted an hour just clicking in circles on my desktop, without actually doing anything.I think about playing a game before work -- no! I just woke up from my nap and I can't be bothered, especially when I have to pack up soon after and leave to earn a paycheck. So here I am instead, writing a review of Defiance.Did I enjoy this game? Yes.Would I reccomend it? Yes.Would I play it again? Not likely, except for nostalgia or boredom.Defiance was special to me. Not being much of a television person and more of a book person, I never watched a bit of the series; however, the game does a very decent job in catching you up to speed. There are moments where the voice acting gets a little cheesy and you automatically assume ""Okay, I guess this Nolan guy is important, because he and the chick with a bad sunburn have their own cutscenes."" The reason it was special to me is because it is a very unique experience, very creative gameplay, I put countless hours into the game, and replay value was very high. Let me emphasize on ""was"" for a second.As stated before, I put many hours into the game, and I know for a fact there are players who may have put ten times that amount into it. There is a point where almost any game has been spent of its replay value, and Defiance definitely does have it around 175 hours. Paying for DLCs did extend this time somewhat, but not by much. If I were to go back into the server right now, what would I do? Raid more bases? Accomplish more missions? Replay storylines again? How about attempt the Trollmaster Warmaster for the thousandth time? There lies a point in one's video game life that you continue to play a game beyond its playability, just to earn the points and countless hours and extend the life of your character.Much like work, that I'm now late for.

												First off, lets state the obvious. This game is pretty simple.Its very.. Sandboxy you have free choice and go pretty much wherever the hell you please. Leveling in this game is a bit different, than other MMOs I've played, you gain them rapidly when you participate in the large open world raids known as arkfalls. Fast travel in this game in my opinion is amazing, not only can you fast travel to major points on the map but you can also teleport to your friends which is really nice. The mounts in this game are pretty awesome if you're a gear head, you get four wheelers, Dodge Challengers and Durangos, and dune buggies. There are two paid vehicles, a trophy truck and some sort of SUV/buggy which can carry four people (yourself included). You're also a demigod in the sense that you are the master of gravity, can literally jump off the top of a mountain and no take any fall damage what so ever (Woohoo physics be damned). The freedom of combat is outstanding, there are no classes in this game. If you want to be a LMG toting maniac with a super stealthy sniper rifle, go nuts! Want to carry TWO rocket launchers?! Who am I to say no! The game DOES lag time to time, which the server does restart every so often to counteract.The grind does get boring, and god will this game suck if you don't have friends who want to play with you (Trust me on this.)So this all being said. Is it a good mmo? Eh a bit. Is it a great time killer? Hell yeah.			"

However, after many updates and the soon F2P release I feel as though it has started lacking more than just a lack of content.

												Grudgingly, I admit that I like this game.It has grown on me over time. The combat's not all that special, and the weaponry does leave much to be desired -- larger ammunition banks would be nice, even if I have to sacrifice other ammo to carry what I'd like.I just like the world it's in -- sure, it's post-apocalyptic and kinda dreary, complete with the equivalent of zombies (HI AFFLICTED!)... but sometimes, the fights actually get hard.By and large, people seem to work well together, even without communication in chat. Someone will often run over to pick you up if you are incapacitated. Someone's often running around with a BMG and willing to sacrifice their ability to damage things to help with keeping the team alive a little longer. I haven't run into any pay to win quirks yet. Even the tier 4 lockboxes can be acquired with in-game currency.It is, however, worth it to try to locate an original Defi box set, and activate the code. The perks are worth the minimal cost.			"

												OK, so I'll keep this brief; I really wanted to play Firefall. That being said, it's a dead game and I've been burnt before by investing in dead games (I'm looking at you Star Legends) so I thought I'd give this a try. In the short time I've played it, I've noticed that: - the graphics are very last gen; I don't care if it's an MMO- the enemy AI is hilarious; literally, I can stand next to a dude and just unload in his face whilst he looks the other way- char customisation is basically ""outfit"" and ""helmet"", afrer the facial/hair presets are chosen- classes don't exist at all, purely cosmetic and even then few optionsI know I'm being quite shallow here but I'm surprised it's done this well. I really did want to like this but I just can't.			"

												Dear developers ,Please resolve the server issues .We love this game but the lags are spoiling the entire gameplay. Had to play the same mission 3, 4 times because server lagged and mission wasn't completed . More problem is faced during an arkfall. The game lags so much that even we cannot revive ourself neither can we revive others .Pressing E doesn't work at all. Please fix the issues because all these are really affecting the craze to play this game. If this continues i am sure the game will loose lots of players.I got a cool weapon during an arkfall but wasn't able to take it coz game was lagging.Hope it gets resolved soon. Looking forward to a nice lag free update in future and wish that the game keeps attracting more action , graphics loving players. Thanks ...Souvik			"

												No real point to the class system, mission system, UI, crafting, ect...vehicles are straight forward. Another micro transaction game, not exactly pay2win  but for how they nickel and dime you for anything decent you'd think there would be alittle more substance. Was a creative idea having the game progress with the syfy show.... But the show is being cancelled so take a guess at the future of the game.			"

												So lets start by saying i have about 100 hours on the xbox version which is the same game just not as good looking. Now than, stay away from this game don't waste your time or your money. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible, the gunplay is average, the quests are boring, there are enough bugs to make you think the game is still in alpha. You will be doing the exact same thing that you where doing in the beginning of the game until you get to end game where you can do expeditions which is a poor mans version of dungeons in any other mmo. So why did you play 100 hours you ask but still give this a bad review? Well mainly because it was something new that i've never seen done before and what seemed and still seems like a really good idea so I kept going on and on hoping for something to change only to never actually happen. Now I can't say I didn't enjoy defiance or else there is no way that I could of managed 100 hours, however then they did something that they should never do to a player, they banned me.Before we get into that lets talk about the website and how god aweful it is, I still have no idea how to get to the forums from the site, thank god for google. You know that little button that is at all games websites that say ""contact us"" ya its a broken link. When I finally did find the support page and submited a request I got a responce almost immediately and you know what it said? This is not the support you are looking for and then they gave me an email address to the ""correct"" support. I sent them an email about 10 days ago now, haven't heard a thing.Now why did I get banned? Reporting a bug, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not. I found the forums started trading with people and then the holliday event came around and I found a bug having to do with the reigndeer that could really♥♥♥♥♥♥off new players so I went to the forums and reported it like you would do in every game and what developers love customers to do. With in an hour I was perma banned. Now imagine this for a second, this is you but you spent money on this game, now you get banned for reporting a bug.			"

												One of the best and well made games I played. Pleases both the PvP and PvE cravings, and stays fresh for a nice long time. Some quests might seem repeatable and just recycled, especially the side missions, but the story-line swipes that little flaw right under the rug. Has a nice steady pace with the growing of your character, so it barely seams to easy or to hard. Highly recommended for those who enjoy 3rd person shooters; not to wide explore-able areas; for both co-op and solo-players.			"

												Well let me start by saying... don't go into this game expecting it to be flawless they only got 3/5 things right... but looking past 2/5 the game succeeds were it counts for about 1/2 of the audience. Good:Combat: Awesome well done feels smooth with no lack of the word headshot! its like mass effect 3 combat system combound with borderlands 2.gun crafting: Enjoyable and gets you excited for what your gun may become next and how you can modify it to your playstyle.global events: lots of content for you to just mindlessly grind on. including Many Rift like ones with invasions and raids. though alot of the random ones you will just drive by.bad:Story: do not expect a story or lore that issnt hidden. massive waste of time.questing: all quests are the exact same (kill, interact with an object, turn in) if you find one quest out of this formula give it a golden star sticker! despite those last two concidering i only spent 5 dollars on this game and sunk 50+ hours into it... the game does still have a sucessful outlook but will still have fallen short. worth the money for an enjoyable ride with many diffrent ways to go about approaching a situation. the epicness of the modding system is the main reason why combat is fun... did you spec in damage reducting with distance while standing still and do you focus your mods on percisely headshotting your foes from a distance.or do you charge with shotguns and blades playing it risky? do you focus on supressing your foes with fire and large box mags?and there is were my 50+ hours went... machineguns!!!point is its worth 5 bucks... we spend more on minecraft for no story and all gameplay.

												Defiance is fun for casual gamers. There is a lot of content (quests, mini-events, Coop/PvP instances), but not that much end-game content (PvP is still fun for when you've done all quests).Gameplay, story, and coop are very decent, but might seem too simple/easy for hardcore gamers.The concept of adding content as the TV show progress was interesting, but asside from the first few months, new content is rather rare. And that's what disapoint me much: they sell the game and have a In-Game Store, but have less new content than many free-to-play MMO.Maybe Season 2 will change that, but I don't plan to purchase any more DLC.

												A good hybrid-esque shooter with a persistent world and mmo elements. Somehow both frustrating and engaging at the same time, Defiance has elements I've never seen in other MMO styled games, particularily the way events and side-missions are triggered by proximity in the world, rather than static quest-givers in some central hub location. The downside is sometimes you're a little lost as to what you should be doing and the distances involved to get places can sometimes be staggering for new players. Another frustrating part is that the controls and interface was clearly designed for consoles, which is great and all, but don't translate well when mapped directly to a keyboard and mouse. I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys multiplayer shooters.			"

												""Free to play aspect of the game experience""Well, just finished Defiance all the story lines and side missions and played some pvp.I reached 2k ego So I guess I fully know the game.So lets start it. Basically the game is repetitive before you obliterate me and say ""DUHH IT IS MMO YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥!!""Let me explain please. It is repetitive in a sense that there is nothing that exiting or clever in the missions. they are run of the mill go to the location kill some dudes collect or activate a gadget and go home or defend the gadget and THEN go home.Yes the story is slightly and I mean really slightly like 1 % above average. And I am comparing apples to apples that mean other shooter's like this. At the beginning the missions are simple and to some it is easy but it depends on your common sense to use cover and good eye to shoot SLIGHTLY MOVING TO THE LEFT MOBS! But when you venture to a bigger ego places the artificial difficulty spikes are insane ergo zerging tactics are annoying. You get swarmed by 30 - 50 npcs you have to kill them all because even one hit will disengage you from ""hacking"" the consoles. They had put in some distractions like using op weapons to decimate your unsuspecting dump Npcs and car races against time they are fun bat they lose there UMPH after you achieve the silver reward. And afcourse we cannot forget the arch falls that appear, bat they are glorified hidden side missions that you don't have to do afcourse you get sometimes good items, bat the main thing you will desire after countless arckfalls is the key codes that you can use to purches ""chests"" that has the real guns that you desire like ""legendary""Speaking about the weapons they are dull, dull because the rarity does not mean a lot the difference is additional stat. Basically the standard of old 2004 MassEconomy well economy does not exist in this game neyther auctions or banks and the currency it is chicken feed useless you YOU GET THEM SO MUCH YOU WHANT TO SPEND THEM ON SOMETHING USEFUL BAT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T SPEND YOUR MONEY BECOUSE THERE ARE NOTHING TO BUY FOR IT NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL!!!..... sorry for that.The pvp is simple, it is fun to play against your ego level persons bat not so awesome to be against a team of MAX level SUPER dudes, bat I guess we can not avoid that  are we?And last but not least the stability of the game. Well from my experience there are some bugs that the developers can fix, especially bugs related to missions that basically forces you to wait for a day so that you could do them but they are rare but still extremely annoying.To summerise the game is averageThe missions are run of the mill, the rewards are dull. more interesting thing that missians some times give are voiced codec's and other codec's you have to find and they are not easy to find whit out a guide. It lacks of npc variety. The story is slightly above average It has in game store (TO BUY ULTIMATE POWER !!!!)F2p restrictions to some will be unbearableSo my recommendations is: just do the main missions because they are interesting  and everything else is run of the mill old mmo garbage.So the final verdict is: radioactive legendary potato out of arckfall			"

Cooperative at its heart, weapon modding, special abilities (stealth, decoy, power ampl. etc.), side missions (including racing courses, time trials, quick-shoot challenges), memorable characters (some from the TV series) and some good story missions.I found the difficulty not too hard and it's especially good when you do things together with other players.

												1st review ) I have  played a bit and i can say that i really loved the game...Its so awsome, despite the 15Gb its totaly worth waiting...FPS+sci-fi+awsome graphics+awsome gameplay+awsome atmosphear+ many other awsome things=♥♥♥♥ DEFIANCE ♥♥♥♥Rated 11/10Just grab your gun and go shoot some mutants :D or pick your vehical and make some ROAD KILL's !!!!!!!!!2nd reviw) so time have passed still i play and recomend the game but now i got more experience and knowlage to write something more focused and accurate.i will focus on writing about cons1)The game is really fun to play but after some time-levels its becoming really boring due to repetetive objectives in missions2)no matter what when you play a mission always enemys call reinforcements (and i mean dozens of new NPC coming to fight you....3)Enemys are becoming boring after a certain time (beacause in every mission you have to kill so many of them)4) You always must clear the whole enemy waves.... and its not only boring due to huge amounts of npc's but beacause they got really heavy and turf to break shields 5)If you want to go big you must pay.... yep you cant solo-ing if you dont pay.. or you can but you need nerves of steel and enough script for revives6)Even legendary weapons are beacoming useless after 100lvls...7)Some missions are really unplayable beacause of unmodified hard-challange AI (Extream Damage or life or both) such as Seasson 2 mission's8)You should buy dlc in order to unlock some features (weapons,more slot in your inventory,more keys to hold in your backpack etc)9) you can get dlc items but you cannot use them and you must either buy the dlc or either sell-break them (i had the luck-missfortune to find some legendary items that needed dlc.... and i had to break them down....... so sad....)10) even in main missions you NPC companions DONT deal damage... they cant even deal enough damage to scratch enemys shield's.... so again you are on your own...So i would recomend it BUT if you download the game be ready to let it after some hours This game is like a new toy to a small kid,first he is happy and play all the time with itthen he start play less and less frequentlyfinaly it either throw the game in trash can or put it in a place and never go for this toy again			"

												Having played this game on both the Xbox 360 and PC both, I heartily reccomend it for the solid, if not sometimes slightly glitchy gameplay.  It's fun, fast-paced, and challenging in a way that makes you want to be stronger, instead of just making it a boring grind, perhaps because in many cases, there will be players around to complete the same goal as yourself.

												Really well done game. I'm not usually one for MMOs (like to pause my games), but this one is extremely compelling. From the large map to the super interesting story; Defiance is a great Free to play MMO that is definetly worth your time. Love how the world feels ""alive"" and the fact that so far it seems not to be pay to win.			"

												Honestly most  free-to-play games I've played are absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥This game however is not. I'm always accidently getting myself into trouble, accidently biting off way more then I can chew, accidently launching my car off the sides of mountains, accidently joining fights with other players, but then I make a friend. I don't think you can use a mic in this game but the silent communication is almost better. The graphics are great for a game you don't have to pay for, or pay to win. One of my new favorite games.

												TL;DR: Enemies glitch horribly: they teleport everywhere and flail like they're at a bad rave when they get hit.I like the concept, I really do. On paper, this MMOTPS sounds great, but the glaring issues in combat really hold me back. Granted, I have barely scratched the surface with this game in regards to it's content, but my first impressions are mostly positive. The environment looks nice, good weapon variety so far, voice acting isn't too shabby, story seems interesting, and the skill tree is functional with a couple interesting passives included. But...It's pretty hard to enjoy any shooting game when the enemies randomly teleport all over the place. There have been regular occurrences where I have tried to snipe enemies from a large distance away, only to have my target decide that he doesn't feel like walking and suddenly teleport into my face. No, this is not a game mechanic of any sort. It appears as if the monster is a friend of mine with a really bad internet connection, and I'm seeing him rubber-band all over the place. It's like the monsters are lagging horribly. Even when they aren't teleporting, the animations when they get hit are so glitchy that it's sometimes impossible to predict where their hitbox will be after you hit them. Getting headshots is a nightmare, since their head is choppily flailing all over the place like they're at a bad rave.If the enemies did not teleport and dance horribly when they get shot, then maybe I could recommend this game. The combat is actually quite fun; there are a few different types of enemies that more or less act the same, but are still fun to kill. There is a type of alien (Hellbug Warrior) that has a weak spot on his rear end that crits when you shoot it, similar to a headshot on a human. The movement is good, and the skills are fun to use. It's just hard to enjoy the game when you're constantly frustrated by magical teleporting enemies.			"

												I must say this game has some rough edges but i'm still enjoying the experince of the game, the pros you have all types of  weapon you can upgrade, costumes a plenty although some do look the same.The bad! Laggy servers  with high rate of disconnecting,some mission get olds quick, drop rate on gears, to even to get anything remotely decent you have to rely on lockboxes which  sometimes they don't help at all.  The map are barren nothing to see there.Driving mechanics are not all that great but it beats walking lol. My opinion on all of this is just that my opinion. My rate on this game a solid 6.9 would be a  7 but just to much to really dislike about the game. but i still enjoy palying all the same . Good day to you all.			"

												200+ hours and stll loving it! Don't listen to the bad reviews (if there are any) Plays like a good FPS with plenty of action and damn near endless story line missions. Like Skyrim some of the side missions are better than the story line missions. Season 1 story line takes approx. 65-75 hours (depending if you have help) and there are still hundreds of hours of side quests left to do. Ark Fall scenereo's will consume your every waking game minute as you will find youself stopping what your are doing and joining 50-100 other players to take down a HUGE unique boss and it's minions for loot.Literally 100's of guns and the ability to have up to 5 mod slots per gun for basically unlimited customization! And YES your mods DO show up on your weapon for others to see :)~I highly recommend this game...especially considering there is no monthly fee's at all. Just buy the game for it's ~$10 price and game on! Friends; be sure too hit me up in game-- Lvl 600 and raring to go! And for all else...I'll see you in the pvp zones!			"

												I highly recommend this game.  This game can be picked up and played for short or long periods.  Matchmatching makes it's easy to find quick teams for instances both Co-op and Player vs Player.  The open world map allows for free movement, taking on quests when you feel you want to, and for teaming on the fly.  Players can move in and out of quest zones while having the benefit of other players moving in and out of these zones as well, all the time helping each other without having to go out of their way to do so.  Events happen on the world map regularly which draw players to those events creating quick and frequent teaming which only requires the players be in the same area working towards the same goal.  Customizations of weapons is not only visual but intuitive and allows for the players to ultimately decide how they want to play.After playing this game in the Demo (F2P) for almost 50 hours, it was without question that this game is worth the money.

												A really refreshing MMO that doesn't have all the fantasy driven elements like dwarfs and elfs and so on.Also a good variety of quests, side quests, dynamic events all over (although many are to repetetive), weapons and characters.Updated this review to not recommended since like many other free to play MMOs this has begun the path to pay to win. You can not, repeat, CAN NOT play end game without spending real money.Play the game for a few hours, days if you wish. It's still good at start but fastly becomes boring, repetitive and soon you will realize that you Have to buy ingame currencies and more from real money.			"

The F2p aspect in this game is nothing, because you pay 1,000 in total to just play this game. 0/10			"

												A first person shooter RPG that goes a little flat after you get about 20-30 hours into it.  Defiance nominally is linked with the TV series by the same name.The gameplay's strongest elements are working together for regular in game events involving shooting up landed ""arcfalls"". There is only moderate character customization and most of the game involves picking up a large assortment of dropped weapons then selling most of them for a small amount of credits.  These credits can be used to purchase... guns maybye.  The economy isn't particularly compelling, honestly.If you enjoy the elements of flipping through dozens of gun drops to find the stats you want, like in Badlands but want more of a sense of working with groups to take down enemies, this might be up your alley.  If you want a solid PvP shooter MMO or solid character driven RPG experiance, you will probably want to look elsewhere.  If you just like shooting stuff, it is a good enough game.It is important to note that the X-box, PS3, and computer versions of the game all have their own servers and cannot interact.  I purchased the X-box version of the game previously and cannot access my X-box characters for the computer even though I have the same user ID.			"

												So, you're debating whether or not to buy Defiance, given that the critics were not kind to it for its less than stellar launch.But I want you to take a moment and think.When did any MMO have a perfect launch?Even World of Warcraft had it's fair share of bugs and glitches.Most of these problems are fixed by now, anyhow.The shooting feels incredibly satisfying.The driving, while nothing to write home about, feels stableand it's awesome to plow down your enemies with your vehicle.Athough, I would love to have a vehicle that allowed shooting, or allowing a friend to ride along and shoot.As far as content goes, aside from the main quest,you can do a multitude of stuff ranging from world events (for example saving ranchers from raiders or participating in a skirmish against the Volge), to questlines related to the show ( which are marked as 'Episodes'), various sidequests ranging from easy to hard and mini-games.Besides that, there's also Co-op and PvP skirmishes, but I haven't experienced much of these so I can't offer my opinion on them.And it seems that, as the show continues so will the story of the game.If you like the show or a sci-fi nut like me, give it a chance. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												I don't usually write reviews for games i play, but I thought Defiance really deserved one.  I am not a FPS/TPS type of gamer  so this is generally the type of game i wouldn't play.  After i played for about 4hrs i was hooked and really started to enjoy the game.  The graphics are very well done and i haven't noticed any lag issues like i have with other Trion games.  There are some cool elements they continued to use from Rift which are fun and rewarding such as: Arkfall (similar to closing rifts in Rift) and Incursions, which can be very rewarding and worth your effort to do them.  There are also random smaller events you can do like: protecting E-reps, collecting materials or just blowing mobs away.I know i only have 18hrs logged into this game so far but it will be a game i'll continue to play.  My best advice is to join an active Clan and most of them can show you the ropes and get you started.  I found one on the forums which was a good group.Another element of the game which is really awesome is the music that cuts in while doing events.			"

												--------------------- 55 H O U R S   P L A Y E D-----------------------I like this game becouse it's evolving with the serial ""Defiance"" and that's good.There are a bit more bugs than I excepted : - like falling off the map and more more thers but the game it's pretty good and i hope that the developers will solve the bugs.The story line...I don't really know what to say about it....boring.All the NPCs will never but never help you.Only the turrets in some mission but rarely.There are a TON of waves of mobs and that makes the game boring.And it's repetitive.I like the Arkfalls and the daily events and rewards.I like that you get A LOT OF GUNS from them and keycodes and xp.The events are grate and from them you can learn to play in team.The community is nice and NOBODY,EVER will blame you for a kill.Everybody gets xp.The shooting part is good.The bad part is that you need to waste a lot of time farming to get a good gun.But if you don't want to farm you could just do the main mission and buy mods to upgrade your gun.I like that.I feel like it's a copy of Borderlands with a lot of waves of mobs and a lot of cool bosses.The monsters from main missions are not too OP so you can do the missions easy.The graphics are pretty good and there a lot of cool looking particles.There are some visual and graphical bugs,of course cuz Defiance but i hope that in the future it will be better with no bugs.I hate SHADOW WARS.There are a lot of guys with OP guns.You should fight against people with your EGO LVL not with guys with 5900 ego.                               ----------------C O M I N G   S O O N--------------------			"

Posted: September 11, 2016
												This game reminds me of when I was in grade school. When I was in 3rd-4th grade I made all A's in my classes. The classes weren't that hard and everyone thought that I was this super smart genius child. As I got older, my grades began to drop as the classes got harder. ""What's wrong with you?"" ""You're so smart! You should be doing so much better than this!"" I had built up a reputation of being so smart that when I got to something that challenged me, everyone assumed that I wasnt trying to do well. I feel that Defiance suffers from a similar problem.There's your tldrDefiance suffers from the same problem that other Trion Worlds games suffers from. Much like ArcheAge, another F2P MMO released by Trion, I really, really like this game, but i just can't bring myself to say that this is a game that everyone should play. Obviously, I have some serious love/hate issues with Defiance. To better illustrate this, let me point out some pros and cons.+Excellent gunplay - I seriously feel that the gunplay in Defiance is one of the most solid gunplay     experiences I've played with in other MMO shooter games. Obviously this is an open world game, so dont compare this to COD, but considering all the effort that was put elsewhere, The combat in Defiance is an excellent experience.+BALANCE - I feel that creating a balanced game in an MMO setting is arguably one of the hardest things a developer can do, and as with the aformentioned ArcheAge, no matter what happens, there will always be one specific class that can outperform the other classes (ie. Archers in ArcheAge). However, what Defiance did, and i feel that more devs should do this, was that all abilities are available to be unlocked, regardless of any specifications put into your character. This is through the EGO system (basically exp). As your EGO rises, you can purchase new perks and abilities, and eventually unlock all abilities available to everyone, however you can only use 1 ability at a time.+Great Storytelling - For those of you who maybe didnt play Defiance when it first launched, Defiance was actually a tie-in to a televison show on SyFy by the same name. The concept was pretty cool (in my opinion at least). As events unfolded in the show, events in the game would occur, and vice versa. so obviously, the writers of Defiance (the show) wanted to deliver an experience that would be engaging to the players of Defiance (the game). As such, the entire story of Defiance (the game) was developed in close conjunction with the writers of the show, and well, they arent professional writers if they were bad. Also, the show that the game originally launched with has since stopped airing, or has gone so far under the radar that I can no longer find it on any current tv network and I think that's kinda funny.-Pay-to-Play(?) - So I actually bought Defiance when there was still a $10 price tag on it and honestly I kinda regret doing that. Since I did that the game has gone F2P and has seen a resurgence in player activity, BUT Trion still needs to generate revenue somehow. Trion has released several DLC packs for Defiance as tie-ins for events that happened in the aforementioned televison show, such as the Castithan Charge pack which allows players to play as the Castithan race. Normally this wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the Gunslinger Trials and the 7th Legion packs. This problem does extend to the other packs, but I think that the Gunslinger trials and 7th legions packs are the worst. The problem is that, like in other MMO's you can recieve weapon loot from fallen enemies, BUT you can also recieve weapons from the DLC packs. However, YOU CANNOT USE THESE WEAPONS UNLESS YOU PAY FOR THEM. This is a huge problem if you love a great loot system like I do, because you can hoard all these weapons that are considerably better than the weapons you currently have, but if you dont pay actual real-world money, you cant use these weapons. I've seriously wanted to buy the packs just to get access to those weapons, but I refuse to spend more money on an F2P game to get access to weapons that I can get in the base game-Lack of direction - IDK if this is the right way to phrase this, but despite all the effort put into the story, I dont really care about it. I like to play a game that challenges me, and the best way i usually think of to find a challenge is to move on to the next area with tougher enemies. Apparently you shouldnt do this, because it can ruin some of the story, but like I said, I appreciate the extensive work put into the story, but I just dont find it super interesting.So, to summarize the points that I made, I really do think that Defiance is a fun game, but it suffers from a problem that Trion has had yet to fix in this game or in many of their other games. However, this game is F2P now, so take my advise with a grain of salt. Play this gameForm your own opinionIf you really like it, give in to Trion's iron grip on your wallet and buy the Season Pass for some extra fun. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10I really want to like this game, but there's just so much in the way of this game being great.			"

												I played this game when it first came out, tried the show, didn't get hooked on either.I returned to it a few months ago, and it felt much better than I had remembered it. It just feels like a hugely refreshing departure from other MMOs I've played (LOTRO, STO, WOW, Guild Wars 2, DCUO, TSW, SWTOR).  Here's where it stands apart: 1. Real player agency, in terms of skill, vs. the rule-based mechanics of most MMOs.  You can always get slightly better with your aiming and tactics, as in any FPS, and the game rewards you for it.  It just feels better waiting for you to reload while running for cover than waiting for your skills to refresh while you stand there.2. One of the better told stories in an MMO.  The writing, staging, and VO work of the character interactions make storytelling in LOTRO, STO and GW2 look like puppet shows.  The only MMO that holds a candle to it is TSW.  I might say SWTOR too if their stories weren't so badly written and full of cookie-cutter animations. 3. Generous business model.  The only money I've had to put into this is for inventory.  I've never felt like I was being held back in terms of capabilties, as long as I took time to understand the upgrade systems.  Sure, there are a few things you'll miss out on, but none of it is gameplay content, and none of it is required to enjoy the game.4. Best vehicles ever.  Seriously, after playing this, it's SO hard to go back to LOTRO's horses, SWTOR's pokey ""speeders"", or anything else.  Defiance is so confident in giving the players speed, it feels like they solved some technical problem that no other MMO has figured out.The only downside I can think of is that after 2 hours or so in any given session, the sameness of gameplay and enemies creeps in. It's true what they say.  But I quit and come back in a day or two, and I'm having a blast all over again.			"

												The Arkfalls have been some of the most fun at this point. The main story quests are good and the side quests are fairly good but can get a little repetitive. I think the only thing I really don't like about the game is that the AI seems a bit helter skelter. If I'm hiding behind bushes and snipe someone, all of a sudden every single person around the one I sniped knows where I am and starts bum rushing. That doesn't seem right. Beyond that, I think with more quests, more interesting Arkfalls, and more multiplayer events, this game would be perfect.			"

												This has been one of the most fun experienced I've ever had. the graphics are good enough to where they aren't outdated or destracting. The framerate is smooth even on a toaster. (tested on a old dell i3 with intell hd graphics), and newer i7 w/ gtx 960M laptop. there's an active community, which i do hope increases with the next big update. You can shoot stuff and go pew pew! also, the ammo count isn't to stingy. People will help you low level. I have never ran in to a troll, only an occasional potatoes, which is ok. They don't disrupt your gameplay in the open world.the only downside is that the instanced base matchmaking is horrible. You'll need to join a clan if you want that. If you are looking to make this game some casual fun to play on your free time then this is it! Hardcore or instanced-based activies are too much of a chore to get invested in to.			"

												i initially bought the game because it was interesting, i like the fact its open world and i like that you can more or less do what you want and join in on whatever events happen to be going on.i personally would recommend it, but not something to play for huge amount of hours a day because most of the other reviews are correct, the single player quests you can do are extremely short, and theres not many of them, and the game gets very repetitive because its entirely based on the open world events.the only purchases i have made for the game was buying it when it first came out, the season pass, and $20 on in game currency to expand inventory slots (since i owned the game beforehand i got some extra inventory slots and retained the keycode cap as it was before it was lowered)i do also agree that they have gone overboard on currencies too, and the 2 main currencies (scrip and arkforge) are almost useless (i have almost 800k scrip and 200k aarkforge, but its meaningless when i need one of the 15 rep currencies, or one of the 4 or so newer currencies)after i initially got the game i played it significantly for maybe the first year then stopped for awhile because it was easy to burn out on, then about 6-12 months after i stopped is when i heard they went f2p, and about a year after that i actually went and tried it again, there are some things they have improved on such as mob difficulty scaling for # of players in the area.my main issues with it now is the fact there is still almost no new questing related content, and the massive amount of currencies in the game with one of them being very obvious they want you to pay for.i feel as though they have been driving players away siomewhat because it does seem a lot more quiet than i remember when i first played it.after having put 300+ hours in it and almost to EGO rating 3000, i still enjoy running around in it and just shooting up enemies, but it is unlikely i will spend any more money on it than what was mentioned above.

												Not a bad third person shooter, but I have two MAJOR complaints:1) You get mods for your gun VERY early (and I got an INSANE amount of them), but you're required to level up quite a bit before you can ever use them.  And these mods may not even be for a gun you have:  I got THREE rocket launcher mods in rapid succession before I even ran into a launcher, much less before the point I could USE the mods.  Even worse, THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU THIS IN ANY WAY UNTIL YOU GET TO THAT POINT!2) The game can drop weapons THAT YOU NEED THE DLC FOR.  When you don't have the DLC required.  It is literally saying ""Hey here's this COOL♥♥♥♥♥GUN!!!!1!1!! that we're just gonna plop in your inventory!  But hey guess what?  YOU CAN'T USE IT UNTIL YOU SHELL OUT THE CASH!""Fix the damn drop issues, and give new players a way to know ""hey, you can't do this♥♥♥♥♥♥yet"" aside from just plain removing the option.			"

												ok, let me review my first hour ingame.Starting a new character brought me into a nice intro  where u have to adjust your character between the scene's, when u are done choosing you end up crashing down onto a hostile planet.in the first minutes you get some gear and a decent tutorial wich will set you off to your journey,  you will most likely follow the main story first.after 5 a 6 Quests you gain a vehicle to drive around, wich set me to explore the game, Not this is just 15min in the game.i drive around do some side quests and helped out some people on their quest (while i still had to redo it because i haven't accepted it)SUDDENLY! i see this skull icon on my screen and i'm curious, what is this  and drive my way to the icon.It's a Boss fight, and withing my 30min of playing i already end up in an all out pve-battle resulting into some nice loot.i return to the begin base and log off.9/10 mmo.What is this game.it's a shooter MMo where the quests are running when some one starts the quest, resulting into you and maybe others are doing the same quest, this adds a nice touch i havent been able to find in other mmo's on my way back to the base camp i found a few things like pve MM and pvp MM so there's also a competitive side to this game wich makes it great for pve and pvp lovers, and it really speaks to all type of gamers.if  the game keeps up the first 60min i had, this might be better then WoW or EVE.i'm just simply blown away.PS: graphics are good, and the game is optimized.haven't had a single stutter while i play without videocard.and im playing it on high.

The story missions feel like a choir as the missions are repetitive and pretty much all the same and I found the storyline boring.The fun part is fighting hordes of giants or zombies with other online players and getting to kill things faster each time.

												Third person Action Shooter MMO RPG?Things i think the game did well* Good UI and it looks nice*Amazing weapon models*Decent Character customization *Decent story*Overall good design in my opinion*Double primary/Weapon combonations / whatever you want to call it *No locked in classes or abilitys you can respec at anytime.*No pressure to do one thing / A lot of FTP MMO RPGs like to pressure you into progressing one way either by questing for weeks or doing dugeons for weeks, This game lets you loose and just gives you a main story to progress along with all the world events, side quests, Co-op Qeues etc...Things i noticed the game does poorly.* Vehicles and physics / if you run into anything you just stop there is no bounce and the starting vehicle turns like a boat.*AI is really dumb and ive had some enemies with guns try to roll and teleport.*Simple passive perk tree with 4 active skills and the rest proc off things like kills, elevation, active sheilds, broken sheilds, crouching, etc...* Simple gameplay it is very much a run and gun take cover when you need to third person shooter more so than anything.

												This is a lot of fun. Combine the random loot drops of a dungeon crawler, a dozen weapon types, all with random stats and effects bestowed upon them, and the RPG shootyness of Borderlands, and you've got Defiance. Well that's just the tip of it.Vehicles, character progression, skills that you can change out on the fly, highly respnsive controls along with large scale 'dynamic' events and pvp make this a fun gaming excursion. Currently it is selling for 10$ This is a shooter that is very much worth 10$.What makes it a little more exciting is the tie-in with the TV show which is also pretty good in its own right.Recommended.

												I am not going to give an exhaustive review of Defiance as I think there are enough of those out there.  However, I will say Defiance is one of those games you either love or hate.  With that being said, the near 70% rating could be interpreted as most who try it, love it.  For me personally, I am having a blast playing the game, and I am glad for having given it the chance to so thoroughly entertain me.			"

												It's been a fun enough shooter - I've much more than gotten my money's worth and still go back to work on the story line when I can. Arkfalls are fun when there is a crowd around. Many of the missions are frustratingly tough, though, when solo - it helps to have a friend along many times for the story line arc.			"

												I didn't want to buy another MMO because I am a WoW fan, yes I know what most people will say, but to be honest I can see this game stealing me away. I enjoy this game as much as the series. Plan on buying Gunslinger when I have the cash and watching Season 1 From the begining again because of this game. Kodos to the game designers truely a desirerable play for me, though glitchy in places and it could offer more in the sense of not having to get most things with in the Store.			"

												Review after playing to level ~600.Upside: an MMO that's actually fun. This is what Borderlands would be if Borderlands was Guild Wars 2. Your ""mount"" is a rocket boosted ATV.Downside: It's brown and apocalyptic, which is to say it's butt ♥♥♥♥ing ugly. Also, I played Firefall before this, so going from having a jetpack to not having a jetpack just feels wrong.			"

												TL;DR: Enemies glitch horribly: they teleport everywhere and flail like they're at a bad rave when they get hit.I like the concept, I really do. On paper, this MMOTPS sounds great, but the glaring issues in combat really hold me back. Granted, I have barely scratched the surface with this game in regards to it's content, but my first impressions are mostly positive. The environment looks nice, good weapon variety so far, voice acting isn't too shabby, story seems interesting, and the skill tree is functional with a couple interesting passives included. But...It's pretty hard to enjoy any shooting game when the enemies randomly teleport all over the place. There have been regular occurrences where I have tried to snipe enemies from a large distance away, only to have my target decide that he doesn't feel like walking and suddenly teleport into my face. No, this is not a game mechanic of any sort. It appears as if the monster is a friend of mine with a really bad internet connection, and I'm seeing him rubber-band all over the place. It's like the monsters are lagging horribly. Even when they aren't teleporting, the animations when they get hit are so glitchy that it's sometimes impossible to predict where their hitbox will be after you hit them. Getting headshots is a nightmare, since their head is choppily flailing all over the place like they're at a bad rave.If the enemies did not teleport and dance horribly when they get shot, then maybe I could recommend this game. The combat is actually quite fun; there are a few different types of enemies that more or less act the same, but are still fun to kill. There is a type of alien (Hellbug Warrior) that has a weak spot on his rear end that crits when you shoot it, similar to a headshot on a human. The movement is good, and the skills are fun to use. It's just hard to enjoy the game when you're constantly frustrated by magical teleporting enemies.			"

												Use to be an avid supporter of this game. It was the CORE game for my gaming community, but the developers pretty much ruined the game. It's just at typical free to play cash grab now. Had such high hopes for the game and the show, but the blatant lies and the bait and switch advertisements were too much. Do not waste any money on this game. While it says I've only played an hour, I beta tested this game, purchased it day 1 when it wasn't on steam.			"

												I'd give it 5.5/10.Game feels rewarding and long lasting. 200 hours in and I still get to level up pretty often and increase my gun power.Travel is more fun than most mmo's.Skill grid is a bit too easy to unlock. The story missions feel like a choir as the missions are repetitive and pretty much all the same and I found the storyline boring.The fun part is fighting hordes of giants or zombies with other online players and getting to kill things faster each time.

												The gameplay is addictive, the fact that you can partecipate to events and stuff since the start of the game instead of the usual boring mmorpg's levelling its great. Really good features like being able to play side by side with players with much more rating than you or being able to teleport to friends to join the action..Duels are the best i've ever seen in an mmorpg, plus the freedom you have is incredible.I've never spent a euro and i still top every leaderboards on my main account, dont believe to all those crykiddos blaming everything just cause they suck. Pvp and pve are both fun and challenging, only ""bad"" thing is that its a bit grindy, other than that great game, hadnt have so much fun in a while.			"

Theres also so many other side quests to tackle which makes this game even more interesting but by far the best part about the game is you only need one character because you can master all the EGO classes. You don't need 15 different characters, unless that's your sort of thing! But that's when the game gets expensive! 5/5.			"

												I honestly like this game. If fetch qeust supprise you or you're not into them then honestly no MMORPG is going to be your bag. It's very easy to pick up and play with players that are way beyond your level which is one of it's biggest pros but so overlooked. I haven't had any issues on finding people to play with. It has quite a bit of DLC to buy to make the game even more enjoyable but what's great about it is they'll go on sale for up to and over 50% off from time to time. You can even link your accounts on your console and have your same character and loadout for cross type play. That alone is pretty unheard of in any other MMO I know about. Worst that's going to happen is you're going to delete a game off your HDD that you got for free anyhows. Give it a go!			"

												I must say this game has some rough edges but i'm still enjoying the experince of the game, the pros you have all types of  weapon you can upgrade, costumes a plenty although some do look the same.The bad! Laggy servers  with high rate of disconnecting,some mission get olds quick, drop rate on gears, to even to get anything remotely decent you have to rely on lockboxes which  sometimes they don't help at all.  The map are barren nothing to see there.Driving mechanics are not all that great but it beats walking lol. My opinion on all of this is just that my opinion. My rate on this game a solid 6.9 would be a  7 but just to much to really dislike about the game. but i still enjoy palying all the same . Good day to you all.			"

												This game has the absolute WORST UI I've ever seen -- EVER.  You won't be able to see chat unless you stop doing whatever you're doing and hit ENTER -- good luck trying to communicate with people in the heat of battle.  Supposed to have a voice chat system built in, but neither my husband nor I were ever able to get it to work. You'll probably have better luck using Ventrilo or Teamspeak.  Gameplay is incredibly repetitive.  Do a mission.  Turn it in.  Go do an arkfall.  Now go do a siege.  Do another mission.  Rinse.  Repeat.  And since there are only about 3 or 4 mob models in the entire game, it gets very old very fast.  Seriously.  You shoot the same stuff from level 1 to level 1000+.  There are 4 player archetypes to choose from, but they ALL do the same thing.  The only way tgo really be viable is to pack as much DPS as possible.  There is NO support for alternative playstyles.  My advise?  Don't bother.  Go play Warframe it's so much more fun and has way more variety.			"

												200+ hours and stll loving it! Don't listen to the bad reviews (if there are any) Plays like a good FPS with plenty of action and damn near endless story line missions. Like Skyrim some of the side missions are better than the story line missions. Season 1 story line takes approx. 65-75 hours (depending if you have help) and there are still hundreds of hours of side quests left to do. Ark Fall scenereo's will consume your every waking game minute as you will find youself stopping what your are doing and joining 50-100 other players to take down a HUGE unique boss and it's minions for loot.Literally 100's of guns and the ability to have up to 5 mod slots per gun for basically unlimited customization! And YES your mods DO show up on your weapon for others to see :)~I highly recommend this game...especially considering there is no monthly fee's at all. Just buy the game for it's ~$10 price and game on! Friends; be sure too hit me up in game-- Lvl 600 and raring to go! And for all else...I'll see you in the pvp zones!			"

												I highly recommend this game.  This game can be picked up and played for short or long periods.  Matchmatching makes it's easy to find quick teams for instances both Co-op and Player vs Player.  The open world map allows for free movement, taking on quests when you feel you want to, and for teaming on the fly.  Players can move in and out of quest zones while having the benefit of other players moving in and out of these zones as well, all the time helping each other without having to go out of their way to do so.  Events happen on the world map regularly which draw players to those events creating quick and frequent teaming which only requires the players be in the same area working towards the same goal.  Customizations of weapons is not only visual but intuitive and allows for the players to ultimately decide how they want to play.After playing this game in the Demo (F2P) for almost 50 hours, it was without question that this game is worth the money.

You can not, repeat, CAN NOT play end game without spending real money.Play the game for a few hours, days if you wish. It's still good at start but fastly becomes boring, repetitive and soon you will realize that you Have to buy ingame currencies and more from real money.			"

												A first person shooter RPG that goes a little flat after you get about 20-30 hours into it.  Defiance nominally is linked with the TV series by the same name.The gameplay's strongest elements are working together for regular in game events involving shooting up landed ""arcfalls"". There is only moderate character customization and most of the game involves picking up a large assortment of dropped weapons then selling most of them for a small amount of credits.  These credits can be used to purchase... guns maybye.  The economy isn't particularly compelling, honestly.If you enjoy the elements of flipping through dozens of gun drops to find the stats you want, like in Badlands but want more of a sense of working with groups to take down enemies, this might be up your alley.  If you want a solid PvP shooter MMO or solid character driven RPG experiance, you will probably want to look elsewhere.  If you just like shooting stuff, it is a good enough game.It is important to note that the X-box, PS3, and computer versions of the game all have their own servers and cannot interact.  I purchased the X-box version of the game previously and cannot access my X-box characters for the computer even though I have the same user ID.			"

												I really enjoy the gameplay of defiance. It has all of the great things I enjoy about an MMO while bringing a lot of TPS(Third Person Shooter)  qualities into the mix. It seems to be mostly based on your skill not exactly your level or EGO rating as it is called in Defiance, which is something that I had never experienced in an MMO before I play Defiance. I have been noticing many similarities to the hit 2K and Gearbox game series Borderlands. Which I personaly have enjoyed playing. Though if you dislike Borderlands don't disregard this game, it shares some minor similarities that have almost nothing to do with actual gameplay. Ultimatly I recomend this game to anyone considering it especially for it's price.			"

												IGN confuses the crap out of me. I feel like they dont review games based on how fun they are anymore (or maybe never have idk) but on how showy the game is. Defiance is not super polished, but it is very very fun. I have played through the story quests 3 times now, and still enjoy playing the game. sprinting around blasting npc enemies in the face, collecting new and exotic weapons, and driving across the teraformed terrain is not hard, but it is a great way to pass the time. And for those who want difficulty you can join up in pvp matches that are far from easy (depending who you play against of course) and try out your new guns against others. I would give this an 8 at least.			"

												Played many MMOs and this is the first 3rd person shooter type.  It is different in the traditional sense of ""leveling"". Even a new person can be just as good as a veteran with practise.  The equipment and gear is all ""stat"" dependent. Meaning that traditional colors of gear do not mean anything but the stats they have.  You only have to create ""one"" character  cause the game lets you eventually have 5 different load outs on one toon.  I will say this though, it gets very repetative and after playing through the storyline you find yourself just trying to advance you own personal skills and seek those orange legendary weapons that have just one extra stat then the purple epics.  All in all, it is a change from the norm and very easy to learn.			"

Well that's just the tip of it.Vehicles, character progression, skills that you can change out on the fly, highly respnsive controls along with large scale 'dynamic' events and pvp make this a fun gaming excursion. Currently it is selling for 10$ This is a shooter that is very much worth 10$.What makes it a little more exciting is the tie-in with the TV show which is also pretty good in its own right.Recommended.

												First starting I didn't think much of the game but I still gave it a chance and I am so happy I did. AI is unforgiving especially during the arkfall events (which I think occur way too often) 1 mistake can leave on the ground screaming for help as player after player runs past you until your death timer hits 0 and respawn at your last checkpoint which can be 100 meters or 1.5km away but it's ok cause you beat everybody else by 120k points and end up getting some really good items from it. The loot system has some flaws but it is amazing plenty of weapon types to choose from, no weapon is designated to any class so if you have it in your inventory you can use it. from fully automatic pistols to some weird thing that shoots bug eggs at enemies which hatch and begin eating their face even some special ""heavy"" weapons which you'll find on some missions decimating everything you shoot at. You can also customize the weapons giving many different scopes, barrels, stocks and magazines which not only effect gameplay but also make your weapon look different adding a different scope will change the scope when using it. A lot of detail added that I thought would of been skipped over. There's no armor in the game instead what protects you is your shield and your ability to avoid being shot. They do have...Well costumes basically that you can buy from the shop most you get by completing missions and entering special codes. PvP(Multiplayer really) is fun but lacking team death match pitting you against other players around your skill level shadow war which is sort of like king of the hill and co-op missions each has some sub-missions which give you faction points needed to special weapons from certain vendors would've been nice to see capture the flag deathmatch(free for all), capture or destroy the base.Kill the vip etc.. There are a few probelms with the game as with any new game esp an mmo but nothing so major that it would make it unplayable.			"

												Defiance is an interesting mixed bag of an MMO. It is an instanced based one time cost game, like Guild Wars. So there's no fee, although there are some very light micro transactions. The neat thing is its actually a very fun third person shooter, which is just plain fun to play. There are also vehicles which help you traverse the landscape in addution to fast travel points. Basically there are no classes, and there is no real point of starting additional characters, other than asthetics. The skill system is a web of 4 Powers surrounded by various perks which give mild benefits. You can only have one Power active at a time. The world is relatively large, but not massive. Of course the game has the tie in with the TV show, which I find mediocre at best. There are temporary episodic missions that tie into characters from the show (but not Defiance itself), otherwise the standard game does not tie in at all, it just takes place in the same world. The strangest thing about the whole game, is that you never venture to Defiance at all, which is in St. Louis, the entire game takes place around what was San Francisco, no where even close. Why the game is called Defiance at all, really only makes sense from a marketing perspective.It is a good deal of fun, Even just offroading through the world and running over scavengers is a good time.  Generally each mission tends to decend into a you vs the waves of the horde scenario. Which is fun, albeit not a lot of depth there. The story is very forgettable, and you're about as attached to the characters as that saltine on the floor over there.			"

												After playing for about 10 hours on the game, I realized that there is nothing too special about it. The gameplay mimics generic MMOs other than the fact that, unlike The Secret World, you have full control of your gun. As in, it is basically a Third Person Shooter.I'm not sure I'm going to pick it back up again, maybe if I find some people to play with, but it is rather linear. Rather than a killing grind, you engage in a questing grind.The only difference this game has to other MMOs is that it has a TV show on SciFi. They state that the TV show and game will affect each other, but in reality the show and the game has a preset storyline that connects together. Parts of the show you would have had to play the game to understand but there is really no connection other than that. The game and show are not dynamically connected.For people who enjoy Third-Person Shooters as well as MMOs, I would suggest this game for you. Otherwise, there are many more MMOs that can be played.			"

												This game has all the makings of an incredible game.  The plot is good, the graphics are good, and how the game was put together was good.  There are a few flaws, such as the lack of different mobs to fight and the lack of different equipment types (in my opinion), but the positives of this game FAR outweigh the negatives.  I can easily say that I will spend at least 500+ hours playing this game.There is a veritable pantheon of things for you to do in the game, which always keeps you busy, and you are constantly updating your gear as you find better gear.  The gear rarity could be a little improved, as it is right now, you'll probably spend 20-30 hours playing the game before you get your first Orange-rated weapon/grenade/shield, but still, this game is a must get!Putting a little real-life money into the game also goes pretty far.  For $30, I got 30 more inventory slots, several lockboxes (boxes with assorted loot inside), and a cool outift for my character to wear.  If you have the money to put into the game, you'll be surprised at how far it will go :)One last point, this game is best played with a friend or three :)			"

												This game was quite fun to explore and go through.  Although very repetitious the coop nature of it all made it quite fun.  I did get my money's worth.  It was nice to have an accurate FPS online.  Although the events tended to be extremely boring and repetitive.  I would recommend playing it for sure.			"

												One of the best and well made games I played. Pleases both the PvP and PvE cravings, and stays fresh for a nice long time. Some quests might seem repeatable and just recycled, especially the side missions, but the story-line swipes that little flaw right under the rug. Has a nice steady pace with the growing of your character, so it barely seams to easy or to hard. Highly recommended for those who enjoy 3rd person shooters; not to wide explore-able areas; for both co-op and solo-players.			"

												--------------------- 55 H O U R S   P L A Y E D-----------------------I like this game becouse it's evolving with the serial ""Defiance"" and that's good.There are a bit more bugs than I excepted : - like falling off the map and more more thers but the game it's pretty good and i hope that the developers will solve the bugs.The story line...I don't really know what to say about it....boring.All the NPCs will never but never help you.Only the turrets in some mission but rarely.There are a TON of waves of mobs and that makes the game boring.And it's repetitive.I like the Arkfalls and the daily events and rewards.I like that you get A LOT OF GUNS from them and keycodes and xp.The events are grate and from them you can learn to play in team.The community is nice and NOBODY,EVER will blame you for a kill.Everybody gets xp.The shooting part is good.The bad part is that you need to waste a lot of time farming to get a good gun.But if you don't want to farm you could just do the main mission and buy mods to upgrade your gun.I like that.I feel like it's a copy of Borderlands with a lot of waves of mobs and a lot of cool bosses.The monsters from main missions are not too OP so you can do the missions easy.The graphics are pretty good and there a lot of cool looking particles.There are some visual and graphical bugs,of course cuz Defiance but i hope that in the future it will be better with no bugs.I hate SHADOW WARS.There are a lot of guys with OP guns.You should fight against people with your EGO LVL not with guys with 5900 ego.                               ----------------C O M I N G   S O O N--------------------			"

Not to mention the contrast gives me a headache, the quests are lack lustr and the game is riddled with bugs. I think trion should take a long, hard look at defiance and never. never ever make the same mistake.			"

Posted: September 11, 2016
												This game reminds me of when I was in grade school. When I was in 3rd-4th grade I made all A's in my classes. The classes weren't that hard and everyone thought that I was this super smart genius child. As I got older, my grades began to drop as the classes got harder. ""What's wrong with you?"" ""You're so smart! You should be doing so much better than this!"" I had built up a reputation of being so smart that when I got to something that challenged me, everyone assumed that I wasnt trying to do well. I feel that Defiance suffers from a similar problem.There's your tldrDefiance suffers from the same problem that other Trion Worlds games suffers from. Much like ArcheAge, another F2P MMO released by Trion, I really, really like this game, but i just can't bring myself to say that this is a game that everyone should play. Obviously, I have some serious love/hate issues with Defiance. To better illustrate this, let me point out some pros and cons.+Excellent gunplay - I seriously feel that the gunplay in Defiance is one of the most solid gunplay     experiences I've played with in other MMO shooter games. Obviously this is an open world game, so dont compare this to COD, but considering all the effort that was put elsewhere, The combat in Defiance is an excellent experience.+BALANCE - I feel that creating a balanced game in an MMO setting is arguably one of the hardest things a developer can do, and as with the aformentioned ArcheAge, no matter what happens, there will always be one specific class that can outperform the other classes (ie. Archers in ArcheAge). However, what Defiance did, and i feel that more devs should do this, was that all abilities are available to be unlocked, regardless of any specifications put into your character. This is through the EGO system (basically exp). As your EGO rises, you can purchase new perks and abilities, and eventually unlock all abilities available to everyone, however you can only use 1 ability at a time.+Great Storytelling - For those of you who maybe didnt play Defiance when it first launched, Defiance was actually a tie-in to a televison show on SyFy by the same name. The concept was pretty cool (in my opinion at least). As events unfolded in the show, events in the game would occur, and vice versa. so obviously, the writers of Defiance (the show) wanted to deliver an experience that would be engaging to the players of Defiance (the game). As such, the entire story of Defiance (the game) was developed in close conjunction with the writers of the show, and well, they arent professional writers if they were bad. Also, the show that the game originally launched with has since stopped airing, or has gone so far under the radar that I can no longer find it on any current tv network and I think that's kinda funny.-Pay-to-Play(?) - So I actually bought Defiance when there was still a $10 price tag on it and honestly I kinda regret doing that. Since I did that the game has gone F2P and has seen a resurgence in player activity, BUT Trion still needs to generate revenue somehow. Trion has released several DLC packs for Defiance as tie-ins for events that happened in the aforementioned televison show, such as the Castithan Charge pack which allows players to play as the Castithan race. Normally this wouldn't really be a problem if it weren't for the Gunslinger Trials and the 7th Legion packs. This problem does extend to the other packs, but I think that the Gunslinger trials and 7th legions packs are the worst. The problem is that, like in other MMO's you can recieve weapon loot from fallen enemies, BUT you can also recieve weapons from the DLC packs. However, YOU CANNOT USE THESE WEAPONS UNLESS YOU PAY FOR THEM. This is a huge problem if you love a great loot system like I do, because you can hoard all these weapons that are considerably better than the weapons you currently have, but if you dont pay actual real-world money, you cant use these weapons. I've seriously wanted to buy the packs just to get access to those weapons, but I refuse to spend more money on an F2P game to get access to weapons that I can get in the base game-Lack of direction - IDK if this is the right way to phrase this, but despite all the effort put into the story, I dont really care about it. I like to play a game that challenges me, and the best way i usually think of to find a challenge is to move on to the next area with tougher enemies. Apparently you shouldnt do this, because it can ruin some of the story, but like I said, I appreciate the extensive work put into the story, but I just dont find it super interesting.So, to summarize the points that I made, I really do think that Defiance is a fun game, but it suffers from a problem that Trion has had yet to fix in this game or in many of their other games. However, this game is F2P now, so take my advise with a grain of salt. Play this gameForm your own opinionIf you really like it, give in to Trion's iron grip on your wallet and buy the Season Pass for some extra fun. Overall I'd give this game a 6/10I really want to like this game, but there's just so much in the way of this game being great.			"

												I played this game when it first came out, tried the show, didn't get hooked on either.I returned to it a few months ago, and it felt much better than I had remembered it. It just feels like a hugely refreshing departure from other MMOs I've played (LOTRO, STO, WOW, Guild Wars 2, DCUO, TSW, SWTOR).  Here's where it stands apart: 1. Real player agency, in terms of skill, vs. the rule-based mechanics of most MMOs.  You can always get slightly better with your aiming and tactics, as in any FPS, and the game rewards you for it.  It just feels better waiting for you to reload while running for cover than waiting for your skills to refresh while you stand there.2. One of the better told stories in an MMO.  The writing, staging, and VO work of the character interactions make storytelling in LOTRO, STO and GW2 look like puppet shows.  The only MMO that holds a candle to it is TSW.  I might say SWTOR too if their stories weren't so badly written and full of cookie-cutter animations. 3. Generous business model.  The only money I've had to put into this is for inventory.  I've never felt like I was being held back in terms of capabilties, as long as I took time to understand the upgrade systems.  Sure, there are a few things you'll miss out on, but none of it is gameplay content, and none of it is required to enjoy the game.4. Best vehicles ever.  Seriously, after playing this, it's SO hard to go back to LOTRO's horses, SWTOR's pokey ""speeders"", or anything else.  Defiance is so confident in giving the players speed, it feels like they solved some technical problem that no other MMO has figured out.The only downside I can think of is that after 2 hours or so in any given session, the sameness of gameplay and enemies creeps in. It's true what they say.  But I quit and come back in a day or two, and I'm having a blast all over again.			"

												Well let me start by saying... don't go into this game expecting it to be flawless they only got 3/5 things right... but looking past 2/5 the game succeeds were it counts for about 1/2 of the audience. Good:Combat: Awesome well done feels smooth with no lack of the word headshot! its like mass effect 3 combat system combound with borderlands 2.gun crafting: Enjoyable and gets you excited for what your gun may become next and how you can modify it to your playstyle.global events: lots of content for you to just mindlessly grind on. including Many Rift like ones with invasions and raids. though alot of the random ones you will just drive by.bad:Story: do not expect a story or lore that issnt hidden. massive waste of time.questing: all quests are the exact same (kill, interact with an object, turn in) if you find one quest out of this formula give it a golden star sticker! despite those last two concidering i only spent 5 dollars on this game and sunk 50+ hours into it... the game does still have a sucessful outlook but will still have fallen short. worth the money for an enjoyable ride with many diffrent ways to go about approaching a situation. the epicness of the modding system is the main reason why combat is fun... did you spec in damage reducting with distance while standing still and do you focus your mods on percisely headshotting your foes from a distance.or do you charge with shotguns and blades playing it risky? do you focus on supressing your foes with fire and large box mags?and there is were my 50+ hours went... machineguns!!!point is its worth 5 bucks... we spend more on minecraft for no story and all gameplay.

												This game is hands down my favorite MMORPG in ages!! Its like they put Borderlands and Guild wars 2 into a blender and poured it out into a wonderful smoothie of a masterpiece! if you also like Fallen Earth this is a good game to upgrade to.			"

												(You should at least try it out for 1-2hrs after the tutorial area before forming your opinion)Its one of the only satisfying MMO's I've been able to find since City Of Heroes.More fun then I thought it would be, tons of content, vehicles, wide range of weapons, powers, and custom clothing. I enjoy it more then the shoot outs in mass effect.			"

												Defiance is fun for casual gamers. There is a lot of content (quests, mini-events, Coop/PvP instances), but not that much end-game content (PvP is still fun for when you've done all quests).Gameplay, story, and coop are very decent, but might seem too simple/easy for hardcore gamers.The concept of adding content as the TV show progress was interesting, but asside from the first few months, new content is rather rare. And that's what disapoint me much: they sell the game and have a In-Game Store, but have less new content than many free-to-play MMO.Maybe Season 2 will change that, but I don't plan to purchase any more DLC.

												Not a bad mindless bit of violence. Quite forgiving to the noob player while still allowing a lot of freedom (the tutorial mission is very short and doesn't even go into how to shoot or crouch which was kinda weird). Basically just got on my quad bike and rode around for a few hours shooting mutants. Actually kinda satisfying...			"

												Defiance: a mix of bullets, rockets, grenades, ATVs, cars, buggies and Hellbugs.I've heard alot of people say it sucks, and, admittedly, it has some shortcomings. However, I find Defiance is not for everybody, as many are too used to fantasy MMOs, or the more realism-focused Call of Duty series.Overall, I like Defiance. The weapons are customizable, the vehicles are plenty, and road rage is ALWAYS a valid option in the field. I would say one of the things it needs is a menu showing the built-up bonuses one accrues from using weapons and vehicles consistently (like the Reload, Recoil, and Fire Rate bonuses on weapons).

												Like the second mission my friend and I had to go all the way to the other end of the map which took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever then when I got there the mission glitched for me and I couldn't complete it and ended up just jumping up over the wall only to find that the next mission took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to complete and was already like half through so I ragequit.  Meanwhile my friend went through it all and completed it and got a gun he needed DLC to use.I never even found out how to mod my guns with all the mods I spent all my money on.			"
