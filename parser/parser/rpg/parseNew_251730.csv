												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a game that truly deserves the ‘2’ behind the title. It’s bigger and better than Grimrock 1 in every regard while staying true to the  feel and gameplay concept of its predecessor.Not surprisingly Grimrock 2 is still a dungeon crawler in the spirit of games like Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder. You move your party of four characters through the gameworld using a grid based movement system,  solve puzzles and kill monsters in real-time combat along the way.So what did change since Grimrock 1? Quite a lot. Instead of a single, linear dungeon you now have a semi-open world with beautiful outdoor locations and lots of different dungeons to explore. And you can explore them in almost any order, so if you get stuck on a puzzle you don’t have to check out a walkthrough guide to proceed, instead you can go somewhere else and come back later with new ideas or hints in your backpack. One other advantage of it is the games' increased replayability – in Grimrock 1 you maybe missed a few secret areas while fighting your way through the dungeon, in Grimrock 2 you can finish the game without ever seeing a good part of the gameworld.Combat is much more challenging now, enemies move and react faster. Their AI was improved as well so many of the cheap tactics that you could use in Grimrock 1 don’t work anymore.  Single, slow monsters can still be defeated quite easily using the ‘strafe and run’ tactic, but there are more than enough challenging fights with multiple and/or fast enemies.The UI and some of the gameplay mechanics were overhauled as well. The skill system is more versatile and makes more sense now, alchemy is more useful as there is a larger variety of more powerful and interesting potions available, there are new weapon types like firearms and many other detail changes.And of course there is much more content – the game is easily twice as long as the first game, there are more different dungeon types, beautifully crafted outdoor locations,  more different weapons, more different enemies, more puzzles, more everything.If you are interested at all in the genre this is a must-buy. It doesn’t get any better than this…until Legend of Grimrock 3 comes out.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a perfect sequel! Stands beautifully on it's own, and expands on all the greatness of the first. Best of all, instead of exploring a single dark multi-level dungeon, now you get a whole island to explore! Each area filled with it's own dungeons, and each dungeon filled with challenging puzzles and secrets. I dare say that there is almost a Skyrim level of content here, as far as exploration and secrets go. And they've even fixed the some of the silly issues/exploits that sometimes made the first game too easy. Once in a rare while I even got the feeling that the game was trolling me a little, in a fun way tho.For those that don't know, Legend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawler, in the style of those old 90s D&D PC games like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder or Ultima Underworld; Except with beautiful modern graphics, and all the benefits of modern game-play mechanics (there's even a day/night cycle on the island). Movement is sorta grid-based like those old games, but movement and combat happen in real time, not paused-turn-based. This creates an interesting hybrid of old school movement-rules, mixed with real-time stat-based cool-down-turn combat. If an enemy is too strong to face head-on, you can kite them around and try to dodge their attacks, but you also have to stop long enough to land your own attacks. You level your character's stats and skills just like any other stat-leveling RPG, and thankfully Grimrock's stat-system is easy to understand, and works exactly how you expect. Just like the first Grimrock, stat management is satisfying and fun, if that's your thing.Legend of Grimrock 2 does quite a few things better than 1. Not only are the locations, puzzles, and monsters more varied.. They've also GREATLY improved the monsters' AI, to the point where it's DOWN RIGHT SCARY how intelligent they can be. They did this to make monsters more challenging, because in the first game once you learned how to kite around one monster, you could pretty much do the exact same thing to every other monster in the game, to the point where stats would become less important because you could just manually dodge around everything.LoG2 ""solves"" that problem, by making the AI more clever, varied, and unpredictable. Try to kite around the wrong monster, and he might see it coming and have a counter attack ready for you, or they might ambush you with a special ability you've never seen before, or sometimes even just start running away, so you have to chase to get your experience points. Now it's a perfect balance of needing to have good character-stats, a good strategy, and needing to know/learn each monster's behaviors. Kiting around monsters is still an important aspect to combat, but it's no longer an easy-win strategy, by any means.There's also a few non-standard enemies, who's AI seems to be on a whole separate level from the rest.. That's where it starts to get freaky.. I wont spoil anything, but the way these things behave sometimes, at least in comparison to the other monsters, you'll swear they're really alive!Grimrock 1 took place entirely inside a multi-level dungeon. It was huge, and each few levels had their own theme for the walls, and sometimes their own set of monsters. It was great at the time, and enough to keep you exploring, but if LoG2 only offered us that again, I think it would have gotten old/dull fast. Luckily LoG2 gives us waay more to explore, the whole island of Nex! With outside locations as well as underground ones, forests, beaches, swamps, even the occasional castle and underwater area, and I'm not even listing them all. Oh, and the outdoor areas, while allowing you more freedom to explore and things to look at, still have a great dungeon-layout feel. The locations and visuals never get dull.Bottom line, Legend of Grimrock 2 is a great game, that deserves way more recognition. It's every bit as good as a big-budget mainstream title, and is WELL worth your money! It will keep you solving puzzles, fighting monsters, and exploring for at least 20 hours, more if you're hunting secrets, and it manages to stay fun and addictive the whole time. And like Grimrock 1, The puzzles and riddles, while challenging and sometimes quite elaborate, give a great sense of accomplishment when solved, and reward the player with cool loot or new areas.If you like this type of game or the general genre, certainly give this one a shot, it wont disappoint. If you're new to the genre, both LoG games are a great place to start. ;)And if you liked the first one, what the heck are you waiting for?!			"

												Basic review for the first one:Review of first oneWhat I liked:  OMG it's outside this time, and it's got day, night cycle  New spells, classes, enemy variety  Discovery in this game is still fun  The puzzles are still good ( had to resort to a guide for more than the first game)What You Need to Know:  New enemy tactics and kinds of enemies to fight (AOE attacks, grabs and better counters to kiting)  There is no voice acting, cutscenes or anything to get in the way of pure gaming.  A freaking rope!! (so no more damaging your group by jumping off cliffs to get secrets)  Not much weapon variety  Lighting is so freaking goodCompared to the first game:  Combat tactics and variety is improved  Less puzzles are easy to figure out on your own ( less logical ones, more WTF do I do one)  Final boss is not as fun as the first one. I think because the map is too open. I didn't even die once fighting him  Added way more classes and one new raceMy Score:APaid: $12Completed in: 31 hoursGames similar:   Dungeons of Dredmor  StarCrawlers (Early Access)  The Quest  Divinity Original Sin  The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians "

												This is how you do a sequel.Writing a brief review of Legend of Grimrock 2 is the easiest thing in the world: it's just like Legend of Grimrock, except much bigger, more complex and better. Fixing all of the first game's minor woes (like the skill system, now completely reworked to be much more flexible and less exacting), it brilliantly survived the transformation from a straight dungeon crawler into a more open-world type of design, going for broader rather than deeper dungeons in a rich (and sometimes genuinely surprising) variety of environments while still keeping everything tight and focused: exploring an island where everything is related to everything else, hidden paths tie it all together and nothing is quite accidental.With the addition of multi-level maps to really amp up the complexity of puzzles and more varied enemy types to spice up the fighting, Legend of Grimrock 2 is more than just a worthy successor to the brilliant first game; it's an expansion on everything the first game promised and delivered. A huge, beautiful, clever and fantastically polished RPG experience and easily one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 100%. Any gamer would be a fool not to play this.It's a non-linear version of Legend of Grimrock with a mix of indoor and outdoor environments to explore, with countless improvements. + Huge island to explore. It's non-linear so you can venture whereever you want and get to end game. I beat the game in about 50 hours, but some people have beaten it in 20 or so hours. I did a lot of backtracking+ Much refined character development and skill point system+ Combat is greatly improved, You can't cheese battles like you could in LoG.+ More rewarding puzzles.  Some of them are tough, but if you get stuck you can just skip it and go elsewhere. You usually figure out puzzles in your sleep anyway.+ Amazing soundtrack+ Gorgeous graphics+ More varieties of enemies+ It's like Dungeon Master 2!!- Can't think of anything bad about this game.			"

 Best Dungeon Crawl Ever Almost Human has surpassed not only the original but every grid-based dungeon crawler I've encountered. My friends would lament the passing of the grid-based dungeon crawls and fondly remember ""Dungeon Master"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""Wizardry"", ""The Bards Tale"".  Few will review this game and not re-count how amazing those games were to those who remember them. I think this game doesn’t just build upon the classics it surpasses their accomplishments. It’s the finest grid dungeon crawler ever made.I loved the original Grimrock, having myself given up on the style years ago, it was like meeting an old friend from high-school. It was stylish and fresh, but like many a first outing, you spent your entire time delving to the deepest level of the dungeon only to find the game itself lacked depth. The fighting tactics were simple “square-dancing” and the magic system was a little sparse. It was an adventure but from a gameplay standpoint it lived in the shadow of former classics. It was wonderfully atmospheric and playfully told but not as grandiose or sprawling as the later Bard's Tales or Eye of the Beholder sequels.This game does away with the limitations of scope imposed by the original and improves upon the gameplay fundamentals of what made this game great in the first place. The fighting, monster design, artwork and music have all been significantly improved upon.  It's significantly more open and the artwork on display during outdoor sequences is beautifully rendered.  Music and sound design sets the tone appropriately and is wonderfully epic in tense moments. In a lesser game the grandiose pretentions would seem bombastic but the effort you have to put into defeating the game makes it feel like your genuinely overcoming huge obstacles.Character generation is more interesting but still simple enough to avoid being paralyzed by the tyranny of choice.  Puzzles and secrets are everywhere. You'll start tripping over hints and clues as soon as the game hits its stride. Many puzzles are straightforward once you understand what is being asked of you but Grimrock is coy about showing you the way. Normally this would be a recipe for some very impenetrable and time-consuming exercise in guessing what the developer intended for you to do;  In Grimrock the puzzles reward observation and careful guesswork but not baseless guessing. After the simple fundamental tutorial puzzles are concluded, Grimrock avoids puzzle designs I’d seen in past games including the original. There is no laborious map-breaking teleporter maze puzzle. It seems grid based dungeons  ALWAYS have a teleporter maze puzzle and I’ve seen many that are needlessly miserable. Grimrock II consistently finds new ways of creating puzzles with switches and pressure plates with less reuse of puzzles veterans will have seen many times before.Fighting is more fluid generally and many fights are more memorable and unexpected.  You still have to abuse the grid system to succeed in fights but it's made less easy by how many encounters are staged. Enemy types behave very differently and many need specialized tactics to defeat efficiently. The introduction is still gentle, the middle is tense, and the end-game is full of surprises. Combat was rarely tedious except for backtracking which except for those trying to wring every secret from the game isn't too excesive. It’s an amazing game. I’m looking forward to the next installment already but for right now I’m happy to have experienced a great game.			"

Is it Adventure Worthy?Legend of Grimrock 2 is an old school grid-based dungeon crawling role playing game wherein players take control of a party of four prisoners that survive a shipwreck and wash up on the mysterious Isle of Nex. They soon find out, however, that they are not alone and to make it off the island alive they have to overcome the challenges devised by the ominous mastermind of the island.After playing around 10 hours (and counting) of Legend of Grimrock 2 I can tell you without the shadow of a doubt that the game has managed to take everything that I loved from the first Legend of Grimrock and somehow make it better. Almost Human Games have given us extra flexibility and variety when creating and setting up our party with new races, classes, abilities and perks, an expansive and open world to explore and survive in with a full day and night cycle, new multi-tiered zones ranging from tropical shorelines to rat-infested mines, lush jungles, to creepy graveyards, overgrown ruins to long forgotten tombs, ancient temples to poisonous swamps and then the freedom to move between them all at will and with ease. The game's engine handles the great outdoors wonderfully, too, and it all looks much better than I thought possible for a game of this type. There are now more secrets, puzzles, riddles and items than ever before and then, most importantly, the same great, addictive and thoroughly challenging old school style of gameplay and combat. Progression through the main plot of the game is done in a non-linear fashion that rewards players that take their time, explore and immerse themselves fully.Grimrock 2 also features a built-in Dungeon Editor that seems a lot of fun. I've only briefly tested it but in the 15 minutes I spent using it I was able to create an actual dungeon I could walk around in. I plan on sinking some time into making my own content for the game once I've completed it. Well, Is it?All of that said and after playing an unhealthy amount of the game over the past couple of days I can say with much surity that Legend of Grimrock 2 is well worth your time and definitely worthy of a grand adventure! This game will appeal to long-time fans of the series, and now almost extinct genre, and newcomers alike. Although, it must be said, both of the aforementioned groups will still find themselves struggling with some of the enemies, challenges, puzzles and riddles presented to them during their time on the Isle of Nex.Check my likes and dislikes below!Legend of Grimrock 2 was developed and published by Almost Human Games and is the sequel to 2012's Legend of Grimrock. If you don't own and haven't played the original yet I recommend buying the Legend of Grimrock Bundle and playing the first game before the second, it is also a great experience and will let help you hit the ground running in Legend of Grimrock 2.Likes / DislikesHere's my quick(ish) list of Grimrock 2 likes and dislikes. I didn't include everything in here, but hey, should still be enough to get you informed.Likes: New Party Creation System - Grimrock 1 had four races, three classes and only a handful of abilities to choose from. Legend of Grimrock 2 has a total of five races, eight classes and a large number of abilities, traits and more. You get to create a much more varied and fun-to-play party. Freedom - After a brief introduction area you are thrown into a incredibly (for this type of game) large open world to explore at your own pace. This game is as open world and free as a first person dungeon crawler and grid based game can be and it works great. Is one particularly challenging puzzle or fight getting you down? No problem! Just leave it for later and try something else in the mean time. You get to go where you want, do what you want, fight what you want and loot what you want when you want.  The Great Outdoors - While playing through the first Legend of Grimrock I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like, and look like, if we could actually exit the dungeon and see the great outdoors... Wish granted! As I said above in Legend of Grimrock 2 we get to explore tropical shorelines, lush jungles, creepy graveyards, overgrown ruins, , ancient temples, poisonous swamps, long forgotten tombs, dungeons and mines, the beds of rivers with actual water in them (yes, underwater exploration is now a thing... see below.) and much more. More Depth - The level design in Legend of Grimrock 2 has been improved upon greatly and levels can now be multi-tiered both indoors and outdoors. Why is this important? It all just looks that much better and feels that much more expansive when exploring. Makes for great, and confusing, puzzles! Day / Night Cycle - You thought walking around a dungeon or mine was scary in the dark? Try a cemetary, or a poisonous swamp or even the bed of a river you just accidentally fell into... Night time in Legend of Grimrock 2 is great and terrifying all at the same time.  Secrets - There's always something more to find out there, trust me. With the game now being as open world as it is there are just so many more opportunities for hidden caches of treasure or secret areas than ever before and it truly is satisfying uncovering all the no doubt long-lost secrets.  The Challenge - Legend of Grimrock 2 is not easy. Even on the easiest difficulty setting the game can be brutal at times and I personally think it is for the better. Whether you're being teleported into a room full of face-eating zombies or whether like five swarms of killer wasps are spawning on top of you... It is always an exhilirating and ultimately rewarding experience to try escape with your party, and sanity, in tact.  A Better Map - In a game with as many secrets, hidden areas, puzzles and riddles as this it really, really helps to be able to put your thoughts down somewhere before losing them and the updated map is really great for that. The new visual style of it and the fact that you can have the all of the sprawling open world visible in one place is also kinda great.  The Sound - The Legend of Grimrock 2 sound and soundtrack is just absolutely brilliant. I honestly don't understand how they do it. I recommend playing the game with a headset turned up nice and loud. Also, the main theme.... Chills! Every time I listen to it.... CHILLS! The Dungeon Editor / Custom Dungeons - SO GOOD! Even a map-making newbie like myself can actually throw something relatively decent together in no time at all and then, conveniently, share it on the Steam Workshop!Dislikes:The Island Master - He's a real jerk. Play the game, you'll understand.Water - Wait, what, you're scared of water? HAHA! No, really, trust me on this one I'm not even joking around. The water on the Isle of Nex is the bane of anyone playing this game's existence. Unfortunately, however, as adventurers it is our sworn duty to explore everywhere... Even under the water... the dark, murky water... I'll continue to update the likes and dislike section as I play through the game and learn more about it. Thanks for reading and rating, I hope you all have as much fun as I am playing Legend of Grimrock 2!HAPPY THAT! :D			"

												I really wish there was a Neutral or Mixed option for whether or not to recommend a game here on Steam so while I might have ""not recommended it"" my stance on it is actually mixed.You can read the good stuff about LoG2 from other reviewers, I just want to vent what I personally disliked about the game.Open worldThe atmosphere of loneliness, isolation and claustrophobia from the first game is pretty much gone. The feeling of you being in an alienating machine which lives all around you, trying to kill you is gone. There is just something terrifying about the prospect of running out of food deep underground in a dungeon you can't get out of. About having to continuously push forward deeper down into a world unknown to you in the vague prospect of being allowed out. Because of the open world and outside environment the atmosphere is completely lost. It doesn't help that the world feels like a themepark either or that the square design looks awful when it comes to how trees, plants rocks and especially water is designed to act as barriers. The locations like graveyard, crystal caves and the swamp don't feel natural at all. Out of nowhere you leave the regular forest area and BOOM! Now you're in a swamp and the area looks completely different. It comes across as cartoonish. There is no feeling of loneliness because there's stuff all around you. There is no feeling of isolation or claustrophobia because you can at any point just leave a dungeon. (except for a few select instances when you have to battla a boss or solve a puzzle)Finally, the idea of allowing players to choose where to go might sound good on paper but in practice it makes the game overwhelming at times (in a bad way). You might get something that is crucial to use later on at a puzzle to get to a power gem which is vital to completing the game but because the game doesn't tell you that you might deem it irrelavent because you've combed the area you found it in and you decided you want to have more space in your inventory for stuff that is actually useful. So you throw it out and then later on you come across that puzzle and would you look at that? You can't solve it. Because the piece that would have helped made sense of this puzzle is somewhere in a dungeon but you can't remember where.Don't get me wrong. This^ doesn't happen all the time, there is only a select few moments where things like this can happen, but it made me very uncomfortable to go 'anywhere' because I was afraid I wouldn't be doing the puzzles and♥♥♥♥♥♥in the right order.Puzzle DesignSo the puzzles... In the first game, a puzzle was pretty straightforward when it was presented to you. You're in a small'ish room where all you need to solve the puzzle are at for the most part. In the sequel, the puzzles are a mess. Sometimes you can't solve a puzzle you stumble onto until way later when you've solved other puzzles. Or you might come across a puzzle where you have to have X to finish it, a crucial plot-important puzzle that is. So what if you don't have X? What if you didn't pick it up? What if you've used all of X up? Then there are puzzles where you need to comb the entire ♥♥♥♥ing area for a button or something that is connected to it but because the game gives you no hints you tediously check every damn wall for that damn button.See that's the thing. In the first game, secret buttons for the most part where for bonus-rooms of loot. In the second game there are times where they are crucial to your advancement in the plot and you end up feeling obligated to check every damn wall you can in order to find a button and that tediousness adds up after a while until I reached the point where every time I entered a dungeon where I had to comb walls my enjoyment dropped.Broken FeetSo, we can break limbs in this one. For the most part it is a nice addition to the game, except the feet. See, if you break your feet (which you will do a lot because of having to go down fall doors and pits) your characters max weight drops until you heal the character with a potion. So what do you think will happen when you accidentally (or have to jump down because that is the way to advance the game) go down a hole and end up having to face enemies? That's right, you're stuck because on of your characters broke their feet and they are now overencumbered and you ran out of potions for the character because of all the other times you had to heal his/her ♥♥♥♥ing feet because of those ♥♥♥♥ing trapdoors. Best craft yet another potion to heal their feet!Crate/Sack ScreenAll right, so remember how in the first game when you open a sack or crate then it opens to the side of your inventory screen so that you can have a full view of what you're carrying, what you got equipped and what is in the additional space of the crate/sack? Remember that neat little design that allowed you full view of all of your character? Yeah. The crate/sack screen now opens 'over' you equipment screen.Puzzle DifficultyThe game becomes too damn nonsensical at a certain point. It is not that the difficulty of the puzzles increase, it is that you don't get any hint as to what you are supposed to do a lot of the time when it comes to puzzles and without a stepping stone you're pretty much forced to look up a tip or how to do the entire puzzle because it just doesn't make any damn sense to you. You will come across puzzles that, unless you are the developers, you won't have any idea how to do them. It's like a friend of yours telling you an inside joke the two of you never had and then she laughs, sees you aren't laughing and then remembers that it was an inside joke she had with another friend. Now if you were to think, and I mean 'really' think about what she said and think about what her friends are and what they were doing and think back on stories they've told then maybe you'd eventually piece together what the inside joke was about. Question is, is the joke still funny? It isn't for me. I sat at one of those tedious♥♥♥♥♥puzzles, refusing to look it up and was damn determined to figure it out myself and when I finally did it wasn't an ""Aha!"" moment, it was ""...So that is how it works huh? Fun... I can finally ♥♥♥♥ing move on..."" Had I been given a teensy little tip at each of those convoluted puzzles then maybe it would have been more fun because you'd at least have a freaking stepping stone, but without them you'll resort to looking it up online. There was only 2 times I had this problem in the first game, but in this one you'll start getting them more and more frequently once you reach the later stages of the game.Now, with those things said, the world is still fun. The combat (while clumsy) is still fun. Most of the puzzles are fun. There is more variety in locations (even if they come across as cartoonishly designed sometimes). There are more ways to build characters.  And in general it's just fun up until a certain point in the game. So, I do recommend the game, I just want you to know some of the issues I encountered in the game and prepare yourself in case you encounter them as well.			"

												Grimrock 2 requires that you think outside of the box from the get-go, because the game is constantly building upon everything it teaches you. There's no handholding, and I don't mean that in the ""so hardcore it craps 8 shades of bits"", but in the ""you're in this situation, deal with it"".You won't always have the tools to deal with the challenges. Sometimes you'll have to remember that one spot in the game world where there's something you can do or deal with. Sometimes a puzzle solution might not be apparent or you might not even have the in-game knowledge to solve it. It's a game that requires your attention, that frequently puts you in a ""Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me?"" situation, but that's ultimately rewarding when you do figure out what was going on.The puzzles themselves are probably the best part of the game and are quite self-aware. They are laid out so that the play with what previous puzzles have taught you, which means sometimes they iterate on an approach, or break a misconception you may have had, but never do they feel like they are repeating themselves.Compared to Grimrock 1, the skills are more streamlined, the classes more interesting and the openess and scope of the game makes the first game seem almost like a demo. If you like RPGs, puzzle-solving and exploration, Grimrock 2 will deliver nicely on every front.			"

												So far this is a HUGE improvement and expansion on the original, it's more open-ended, you spend as much time out on the surface as you do in dungeons, there's a night and day cycle, more secrets, more loot, more everything! It's a challenging game but you can always chicken out and check the solutions to puzzles on the internet if you can't brain your way through it. If combat is too hard for you, just set the difficulty to Easy. Great fun game, fantastic atmosphere and sense of mastery!			"

												Very fun, charismatic, and immersive roleplaying game. In Legend of Grimrock 2 you are able to customise your own party of up to 4 heroes as you please, being able to choose race, class, traits, and skills. You move on a (beautiful and diverse) grid-floor world, fighting opponents in real time combat and solving numerous puzzles as you go. If you enjoy the genre, give this charming game a try. You will not regret it! 5/5			"

												I had an absolute and total blast revisiting the world of Grimrock... this game is monumental compared to the previous game... It is so much bigger and so much more complex, with a much more open world. There are some great new enemies that really challenge how you fight.. and some new puzzles that are interesting and challenging.If you enjoyed the first Grimrock game, then you absolutely must play this, and if you're a fan of the old grid based dungeon crawlers and haven't played Grimrock yet, then you really should.. Both games have been really good, but this is far and away a worthy sequel.			"

												This is how a true sequel should be made!It's larger (amazingly large, actually!), more complex (with levels over levels, multi-level environments with ladders and submerged areas and a large outdoor ""overworld"" area) and more beautiful that the already large, complex, and visually pretty Legend of Grimrock. The multitude of puzzles is intriguing and makes you feel smart when you solve them, and the fights with the new, improved AI is much more tense and challenging. Many enemies in LoG1 could be kited and ""danced"" around, turning the fights into a real cheesefest- but in LoG2, that cave troll you used to dance around will now patiently wait for you to make a wrong move, deliberately turning so that you have difficulty approaching. The wargs will jump around you with great agility, not giving you any time to try and flank them yourself. The little blue fishmen guys will nimbly dodge your attacks and attack-jump toward you. The giant frogs will snatch your weapons from your hands, leaving you severely weakened until you manage to defeat them and get your items back. Every enemy type requires careful thinking and different tactics to defeat, and the challenge feels great!As was the case with the first game, in Grimrock 2 there are also loads of secrets, rewarding a perceptive dungeon explorer with great loot. There are new classes (the farmer being the most amusing for sure), a new PC race, loads of new items and weapons (firearms, too!!!), new monsters (and some nasty traps and surprises!), and huge new levels.Do yourself a favor and go play this amazing gem of a game.

												I loved the first Legend of Grimrock, it successfully updated the old Dungeon Master first-person dungeon crawler. It was one of my favourite games of 2012. If it had flaws, it was the lack of variety in combat and environment.Legend of Grimrock 2 fixes all those flaws, and is immediately a much better game for it. The only thing it loses is its gradual ""descent"" into the depths of the dungeon. Here the world is laid out across a much wider area, although there is both depth and height to most dungeons now. The outdoor areas are the most noticeable change when you first start, and they add much needed life to the game. Some of the sights you'll encounter are impressive, not something I was expecting from a grid-based crawler, but the game can be often beautiful. Indoors the engine now deals with height within the same dungeon level, so ladders lead up and down onto platforms, and coupled with quite a few different mechanics leads to a lot more variety in the kind of puzzles that are possible. I didn't find the puzzles to be quite as challenging as Grimrock 1, some of which relied heavily on very tight timing, and in the sequel clues tend to be spread across the map rather than being just around the next corner. A lot of hints are very opaque at first, but gradual dawning realisation will occur much later in the game as you start to piece it together. Personally I really enjoyed this, and being able to make notes on the map is pretty much essential to keep track of them.Combat is a vast improvement as well. There's much less reliance on dancing around enemies to stay out of harm's way, facing-off is far more feasible this time (on normal difficulty at least!) due to better character balance, progression, and smarter use of character traits. Of course, there are always exceptions, and the developers are clearly having fun keeping the player on their toes with new enemy types. This is not a turn-based game, but it should be manageable.It took me a little over 40 hours to beat the game, although I've been quite thorough. I know others who did it in half that time. Even after beating the game, there's one major secret that I've yet to conquer, a way of ending the story more satisfactorily. I'm sure it will keep me busy a while longer. This is easily a contender for my favourite game of 2014.			"

												10/10 What a Sequel Should Always Be! (Expand the Review for a summary)Pros - Mod Support- Level Editor- Secret Chests and Rooms- ""Untold"" Story- Great Soundtrack- Guns GUNS GUNS!- Outside Environments- Multiple Difficulty Options- Very Good Character Customization- Nicely Laid Out Puzzles- VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUECons - Some Puzzles, though nicely laid out, lack thought or ""Obvious"" completion paths- Atrocious Anti-AliasingJust wow. It is not very often that a sequel to a game that I thought was ""meh"" comes around blows me way the ♥♥♥♥ away. This is one of them. I have been having an absolute blast playing this game, closet comparison I think I can make for Grimrock is Wizardry (mainly 8.)  One of the things that I really liked about the first Grimrock game was the replay value and Level Editor that was added, and my god did Grimrock 2 deliver in those areas too! The level editor is fleshed out in a pretty serious manner, mods have already been developed for the game. The way the story is told, outside of the opening cutscene is pretty much through things you discover for yourself, letters in the world, things you see, the closest comparison I can make is to Dark Souls where the lore is indirectly fed to you, I like the setup, and it adds to the mystery of the Island. One of the new things they added was outside areas, which was one of the best editions this game could have made, for one, it allows for some serious modding potential, (Eye of the Beholder anyone?), the other thing is it just expands more on the world itself allowing you to be a bit more immersed. Another thing that was added was a Day and Night Cycle, it is also very well done and definetly adds to the atmosphere in a few areas (The Cemetery.) Next, I would like to give a big shout out to the guns. There are guns in this game! They added Guns! I really shouldn't have to go on any farther on that subject, although mechanically speaking they can be weak, they jam, and bullets are hard to come by. Its a matter of choice though, some people seem to really like them. Lastly on game mechanics themselves I would like to talk about the Puzzles. I found most of the puzzles to be intuitive and fun but there were a few that just stuck out because they were so basic or because they were so complex. The example the comes to mind at the moment is the Gate in the Cemetary, I had no clue what to do and eventually gave up and looked it up. I would have never had a single clue if I had not done that, although there was probably a note or something somewhere. One more thing, the Anti-Aliasing in this game is terrible, SweetFX can fix it, and I am sure if you have a 780ti, 970/980, or a 290x you could downsample to make it much better, but that is something I notice, and I am sure many others do too.Bottom line though, this game is bonkers, I was stoked about it when I got it and I am still having fun with it. Great game, maybe even my favorite game of the year.			"

												After playing and finishing more than twenty games this year, I can confidently say Grimrock 2 is my game of the year. This game takes everything Grimrock 1 did right and made it so much better. The world is vast, but not confusing. The new classes were fun and added something Grimrock 1 never offered. The story be it still slim, had me more interested than other games with hours of dialog. The most fun I've had playing a single player games in years, highly recommend to everyone.			"

												Probably one of the most significant dungeon RPGs in years. As good as GR1 was in a throwback to the good-ol-days, GR2 takes the next step, improves on nearly every aspect, and provides a much deeper, thoughtful, and dynamic world.The amount of character variation is incredible; between the combination of race/class/and ultimately how you decide to build each person.  There's no ""right"" or required group, and it seems as if a variety of class/build combinations would be successful and more imporatantly, fun. The combat system is strategic and challenging; combining just the right amount of pacing, real-time action, and strategic positioning. Weapons have depth with special abilities, often making equipping a difficult choice of round-to-round stats vs the benefits of the special attack. Characters have enough room to create any of the iconic traditional roles, or any combination between. The puzzels are integrated into the terrain and narrative so well that they seem to just melt into the environment, in a very Myst-style fashion. Their locations and solutions are often overlapping with other adjacent (or non-adjacent) areas in that you can recieve clues to puzzels you have yet to encounter and encounter puzzels you have no solutions for; the name of the game is flexibility and patience. The game rarely asks you to be instaneous and in that you should appriciate the same from the game. Not everything is to be solved on the spot.Overall, a powerful RPG/adventure game that really gets its all right within the system its defined for itself. Often times I find myself questioning whatever game I'm playing could've done better, with GR2, I am only ever amazing about all the things it gets right. Difficult enough to be a challenge but not so much it gets frustrating. Just a really special game. "

												A semi-action RPG in the vein of the old Dungeon Master games, Legend of Grimrock 2 improves quite a bit on the original's already strong performance. With secrets abound, hidden alcoves, and a mysterious story with more depth than it appears to have, Grimrock 2 keeps much of what was good about the first game of the series.However, Grimrock 2 improves the game in several ways. First of all, the game takes place in the over and underworld of the Isle of Nex, a land with varied terrain and many foes. The overworld segments are interesting, holding shortcuts to dungeons, their own secrets, buried treasure, and several puzzles. The overworlds also have respawning foes and food supplies, allowing the beleaguered adventurer to get their resources back and grind if truly necessary. The main goal of the game centers around collecting various items from the world, and thanks to the overworld is very freeform-- besides a fairly linear intro area, you are free to go wherever you please. However, some areas are gated by their difficulty, so progression still exists.Dungeons are entertaining as always, with a mix of combat-heavy areas, boss battles (another new feature, and one that's quite well-executed), exploration challenges, and difficult puzzles. Traps and ambushes are still common, as with Grimrock 1, but they felt less frustrating, perhaps because there was typically at least one place to run to if things got difficult.Graphically, the options are good enough to make the game very pretty, or ugly enough to run on computers without high-tier GPUs. On middling settings, the game ran very smoothly on a Surface Pro 3 in every case, and the game ran smoothly in less intense areas when on higher settings on the same device.As far as negatives, there were a couple things that I noticed. The food system makes a return from Grimrock 1, and while it remains as unintrusive as always, it's definitely nothing more than a way to put weight in the party's packs. While there were one or two times where I took breaks from dungeoneering to secure more food, it was never a huge concern because of the overworld. As long as you're progressing at a good pace through the game, the food mechanics only show up when you forget to do the inventory dance every half-hour of gameplay or so.Also somewhat disappointing was the spell system, which felt like it had some wasted potential. While there was one unique spell per spell tree, some elements are outright better than others, and spells range from uncreative (a multi-rune ranged bolt and single-rune damage spell of every element, as well as element-resistance shields for each element) to somewhat interesting but already done (the utility spells in Air and Water trees), with one notable exception: the Force Field spell, which creates a block on a tile of choice that no projectiles or foes can enter, attack from, or exit. I would have appreciated the following:-A utility spell for Earth (Air and Water have one, and Fire's is replaced with a unique damaging spell)-An Underwater breathing/Underwater action spell (Typically, underwater action is impossible, and time underwater is limited)-A transmutation spell, to make junk more useful-The arrow enchanting spells from Grimrock 1, or a similar sort of spell-Some sort of knockback or pushback spell (maybe make that the Earth utility, with damage?)-A ""Detect Secrets"" spell, but perhaps with a high cost or skill requirement and very short duration. Something to highlight secret buttons, basically, even if it just used a sound indicator to show if one was close.-Something unique to the Wizard class so that it isn't hilariously useless-More unique, varied spells that I didn't think ofThe casting system was improved from Grimrock 1 in terms of useability, as it's now much faster to cast well, but the lack of spells really was disappointing.Third, due to the freeform progression, it's possible to barely scrape by in a difficult area and then return to an easy one, kicking yourself for not going there first. Your mileage may vary on this one-- it's pretty fun to just blast through areas, after all. Also, inventory management can become cumbersome-- in the late game especially. However, as everything is in real time, this could be considered part of the challenge.Finally, some of the required puzzles felt somewhat esoteric. However, I've never been good at those sorts of things, and many would consider brain-bending puzzles to be a pro, so take this with a grain of salt.Overall worth the purchase. And I'm not even including the custom dungeons, which have full scripting and great potential! Seriously consider buying this game.Of course, caveat: This game is very casual-unfriendly. If you don't find at least some of the secrets, you're gonna be in trouble. Also, those with poor eyesight won't appreciate small, difficult-to-find secret buttons.			"

												Genre - 3D tile based RPG (Fantasy)I am an 80s child and have fond memories of Dungeon Master, Ishar, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore. Then it all went very quiet for a long while, but along came Legend of Grimrock and it was ace! It went quiet again then it came back! It is a true sequel adding new environments, game mechanics, puzzles and monsters. You move around a tile a time, need to eat, solve puzzles, find loot and slay monsters. The graphics are the best I have seen for this genre and is a fair challenge. A well balanced game for old farts and those who are willing to try a more retro style game. Ten times better than WoW, although you can't chat up Female Trolls played by men in this...			"

												I'm pretty close to finishing this game and the only thing that's kept me from writing a review is the fact I didn't want to stop playing.  It's managed to take a game (Grimrock 1) that was a playable as the fantastic 1987 Dungeon Master, then produce a sequel that was more than twice the size and even better than the original.  It's an absolutely beautiful game that draws you in and keeps giving you more and more secrets to find (typically unlocking elements of cool sets of armour or awesome weapons).  The puzzles can be pretty challenging and I've had to google solutions before (generally followed by an ""oh dammit!"" moment when I realise the solution was right in front of me (okay, there are a couple of purposefully obtuese ones too, but I'll forgive it those).I've even had a moment that reminded me of Serious Sam 1 when I entered a particular area with a lot of sand (it's a secret area, but you'll know it when you see it).  It was a real ""Holy Crap!"" moment and I actually laughed out loud.Grimrock 2 is a game that makes me what to play for hours, but for each hour that goes by, I'm thinking ""Now I'm an hour closer to finishing it :(""Awesome game!

												I didn't think Legend of Grimrock could get any better, but I was wrong. LoG2 is brilliant. It is beautiful, it is challenging, and sometimes it is downright frustrating. But in a good way. This game makes you think. A lot. So if you dont like puzzles and logical games, then this is not the game for you. It also has its share of combat as well. The different skills/spells/etc really make for diverse gameplay. And lets not forget about the minor ""jumpscares"". Ok, they really arent jump scares, but when you go to look in a chest to find out that its a mimic and it jumps up at you, or when you pick up an item and out of nowhere you get teleported to a dark dungeon surrounded by undead.... yea it keeps you on your toes. Good stuff indeed.			"

												Grimrock II took what the first game did and expanded upon it. Instead of just focusing on one giant dungeon, there are many outside areas to explore, that have their own dungeons connected to them. After you finish the initial area, you have the freedom to pick just about any area to go through at your own pace.It also adds quite a few new elements, such as multi-leveled areas, dangerous water you can't really fight in and drown fast, ladders, chests, and digging once you get a shovel. Quite a lot of new enemies are introduced, nearly every enemy is new, only some old ones return.There's a new skill concerning firearms, alchemy got streamlined as you no longer need bottles to make potions, and spellcasting also got more simplified. Skills like Light Weapons & Heavy Weapons no longer have a random chance to perform a special move, however, many weapons have a new charge function to perform a special ability, as long as your skill is high enough to use it. Skills in general got a nice overhaul for the most part. I'm kind of sad they removed the Hand-to-Hand/Unarmed skill, guess it was too overpowered. Any class has access to any skill, meaning even a melee warrior could use fire magic with a wand if you so desired. There is new classes as well as some changes to old ones, specifically alchemists are super useful now, not needing bottles, and ingredients in their inventory even duplicate after so many steps, as long as you have at least one of that ingredient.Also there are bosses, quite a few of them, something the first game didn't have, except for the final boss.The ultimate goal is to collect 16 Power Gems found in exterior areas, as well as dungeons to craft Elemental Essences at 4 shrines found throughout the land, each requiring 4 gems to craft, to unlock the final dungeon, solve it, beat the crap out of whatever is waiting for you at the end, and escape the island you shipwrecked on.Optionally, there are 4 extra power gems you can use at the 5th hidden shrine and craft the 5th optional essence to access the real final boss, and the true ending.This game is definitely more open ended and longer than the first, and a bit harder, since the game throws quite a lot at you at times. It's a damn good sequel. This is how you do sequels.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is one of those games that improves upon the prequel in (almost!) every way, and I can't do anything but whole-heartedly recommend it -- Even for people who haven't played the first. As it stands right now, there are several problems, but I'll address what I liked about the game first.The combat is just as fun as the first game, though now with arguably more strategy involved as most enemies are keen to your side-stepping ways and will have methods to counter them. Most enemies can now be countered by simply walking backward, as they lack lunging attacks save for a few smarter enemies, but at least that involves knowing the area and not simply moving into a 4x4 grid and keeping combat in that small, controlled area. Some enemies can still be conquered with that strategy, but they are few and far between.The puzzles are less obtuse in MOST cases, as well, which was a problem that I had with Grimrock 1 for sure. Most hints will make sense if you consider them for long enough, and very seldom will you find a dungeon without some kind of hint... Even if it's just a one-word sign stating the 'name' of the puzzle. Thanks to the new open-world nature of Grimrock 2, you will also have time to consider a puzzle that you might be stuck on while exploring an area you haven't yet cleared! Gone are the days of walking around a singular puzzle room because it blocks your progress forward, scratching your head in frustration and eventually just googling the answer.Speaking of the open world, that is a big step forward from Grimrock 1 and definitely one in the right direction. You'll have a choice of anywhere from two to four places to explore at once, meaning your progress isn't locked in a specific direction and you're not always just 'heading down' in a dungeon. There are dungeons, of course, but they're smaller in size than Grimrock 1's mystical mountain fortress. They're not always contained, however -- You might find the solution to a puzzle in one area within a completely different area, for instance, or at least a hint to its completion. That's well-done, most of the time!I had to use google for a total of four out of what must have been over fifty or sixty puzzles, and as soon as I looked it up (except for exactly two things), I was left smacking my forehead and going 'why didn't I think of that?'. The other two were simply things that weren't stated very well, or clearly enough, and both unfortunately blocked progress into significant parts of the game. Still, though! That hardly ruined my experience.Now, for the bad... My complaints are few, but they are important. First of all, several aspects of combat could use a re-work. Firearms, a new method of combat, are woefully underpowered for a simple reason: They can jam as well as miss, while other ranged weapons can only miss, and their damage is a fixed value with all Firearm weaponry while both Throwing and Missile weapons scale with Strength and Dexterity respectively. If you run an Alchemist and know the formulas for the permanent stat increasing formulas, you'll be looking at a Minotaur adding 50 damage to his Thrown Weapons or a Lizardman adding 40 damage to his Missile Weapons by endgame, compared to anyone adding... 0 damage to their Firearms. Add in the fact that Missile and Throwing weapons can be re-collected after combat where Firearms ammo is decidedly scarce and cannot... Well. They're basically useless.Additionally, enemy difficulty is up from the first game in a way that I don't technically agree with. On top of enemies having honestly absurd amounts of health in comparison, making some fights with non-boss enemies feel like a slog (I'm looking at you, crabs), there is a certain enemy that literally cannot be damaged by anything except one Water spell or a singular weapon that you find in a later area of the game... Usually after you've found and ran your face into that enemy and gone 'wtf?'. The enemy is infrequent and doesn't hurt very much even on Hard difficulty, but it can box you into a corner and then you're basically left to swing at it for 0 until you die and reload. I can't agree with that kind of design philosophy. Needing to invest 2 skill points into a certain magic tree or rush to the Cemetery to find the item to damage them with seems like lazy design, to me.Despite its flaws, I would call this game nearly perfect -- If I had to rate it on a scale, definitely in the 8.5/10 - 9/10 range. I recommend it at any price.			"

												I think LoG 2 is an outstanding game, and there is nothing else quite like it (and here I mean a dungeon crawling game made modern). There have been a few attempts, but none come near the quality that this game has.The game's world is huge and very varied. In every direction you turn there is new adventure, secrets, puzzles, things to explore. In that sense it actually reminds of Skyrim in its scope, although fundamentally different in style. Grimrock's world is really immersive. I especially loved the dark ambient soundtracks for each location (which are in same fashion as i.e. Stalker games), which set the mood. The visuals are fantastic and convincing, you really feel that you are deep underground in a deadly dungeon filled with secrets, traps, and places buried by time and dust. Gameplay is great. The story is mysterious and fun. Combat is varied enough, and the puzzles are all fantasticly made. All of them are logical and can be figured out by careful attention to detail and hints. Some are easy, some are difficult, and a few are very difficult, but very fun to solve. Best part: no bugs and no broken puzzles. This game has what I greatly miss in modern games: that feeling of excitement when you finally solve a level and unlock another one, and can't wait to see what's inside.For me this is the game of the year. I would suggest it to players who like mystery, adventure, immersive worlds, puzzle solving, and exploration, but I think it is so oustanding in all aspects that I simply think that everyone should try it.

												Bigger isn't always better. But in Legend of Grimrock 2, it's better most of the time.They've kept what made Legend of Grimrock great, rectified some of its failings and generally expanded much on variety and content. The latter brings a failing new to Grimrock. Some of the puzzles and their clues span the game world and can require quite a bit of backtracking if you missed some clue along the way, or didn't bother writing it down.But these incidents are few and far between compared to all the goodness this game has to offer. New dangerous-looking enemies make it harder to dance around the less-than-up-to-it AI of the first game. I won't spoil it for you, but some enemies were just genious. The new environments, including outdoor ones, are varied and beautiful. New puzzle elements bring spice to the old formula, allowing you to feel different kinds of clever upon solving them. (Or different kinds of stupid!)Class and skill systems have been revised, with additional classes and a new race - the ratlings.In short, if you liked the first one, you're gonna love this one.9/10			"

												This game is what Chaos Strikes back was to original Dungeon Master. Bigger, tougher and in every possible way meaner. Beginning of the game is easy and very mellow and pleasant in every way (you start on a beach) but towards the end the puzzles and some enemies just become so nasty it's incredible. And those certain bosses. Just wow. Nevertheless i consider this game a bit better than the first one but only because it expands on things - game mechanics have not changed much except for weapons sets which allows you to quickly change weapons which is a big thing. As for the world itself the large open areas and large variety in puzzles is good. Unfortunately there also comes the only real negative of the game: puzzles that refer to real world things. Really hard to solve those if you are trying to think in game lore.  Oh and do remember to write things down. The map allows you to mark things down very well and it is a must to use it. Some puzzles are just so obscure. 9/10.			"

												AAA developers take note, this is how a sequel is done. A game that expands content and gameplay without sacrificing pacing. Puzzles that don't insult your intelligence and require genuine effort to think and solve. A greater variety of challenging monsters (and bosses!) that require tact and quick thinking to combat, especially when the player is outnumbered. But most of all, a game that accomodates both fast and slow paced playstyles, rewarding and punishing good and bad decisions organically through gameplay.I've played so called 'open world' games that contradictorily felt more claustrophobic and empty than this game. The fact that this game manages to feel seamless and immersive game, despite the grid based style? That alone makes this game deserve more praise than I could ever give it.			"

												Took everything good about the first game in the series and expanded in every direction.  The open world concept and non-linear progression add to the replayability.  The character creation alone can give you a solid 3-4 playthroughs that are completely different depending on your class set up.  Love this game, and (not so) patiently awaiting the 3rd installment.			"

												A lot of fun and even does things a bit better then the first game. If you like Legend of Grimrock you'll like this one too. If you haven't played a dungeon crawler before you should give it a try. If you know dungeon crawlers as old boring games you should check that one out. There is skill and speed involved here. You can outsmart enemies because they don't move every time you move a tile. They have different movepatterns and do move on an individual base. Nothing is tied to you moving a tile.			"

												My old review sucked, and only 1 person found it helpful.First off, Play Legend of Grimrock 1 first. I strongly recommend doing this, as it will help you get into the right mindset for this game.I also recommend some Might and Magic games, X is my favourite but many people will tell you it's not the best. Now, this game, the one I'm supposedly writing a review for...... Right, Well, Let's get started. Compared to the first game, this one has a lot more customization for your party, and a much much MUCH larger world. Many more puzzles and chests are potentially evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. (Mimics anyone?)If it was just more Grimrock, then I'd be happy, because more Grimrock is good, but this is more Grimrock and updated content to be better! My old review hated this game, I will point out that for the first few hours I was really bad at it and didn't give it much of a chance, that is why I think you should try the first one and similar games first. Sorry, I've rambled a bit, my ability to write reviews is questionable. But you should definitely try this game and if not this one, others that are similar. I might clean this review up some day, it's kinda messy. But eh, we will see.			"

												An amazing tile based dungeon crawler which, unlike the first game, has expansive outdoor sections. The visuals and art direction of this game mold an extremely impressive aesthetic appeal, taking advantage of current generation technology and bringing new life into the classic tile based RPG genre. The difficulty Legend of Grimrock presents is just right, not consisting of too much gauntlet difficulty while not being too easy. Legend of Grimrock 2 also features and impressive soundtrack and the audio is of high quality. The level design is non-linear and effective, making a fascinating world of many paths to explore.As a massive fan of games like Stonekeep and Wizardry, this game delivers an enjoyable experience for hardcore tile based-RPG players while being accessible to new players of the genre at the same time. Being a game of such nature it requires an in-depth party creation, stats, items, spells and good level design to keep interesting, of which Grimrock 2 delivers superbly.This is a gift to players who are nostalgic of the 90's era RPGs who want something of the same except current, and to new players who are willing to invest some time into a different kind of RPG experience. Legend of Grimrock 2 is a revival done right and gives me hope of the future of indie games, this is trully an extremely high quality product with a lot of love and care put into making it. AAA games these days are getting shallower and more boring by the release so really nice to see a rare gem like this pop up every once in a while.			"

 Legend of Grimrock II  slides into a confident first place lead for best games I played in 2015. It is atmospheric, fun, and challenging - providing enough modern influence to keep me interested while also staying true to staples of the dungeon crawl genre of old.  Narrative The story is simple enough: you control four prisoners who have shipwrecked on a mysterious island called Grimrock. Here, you must wield powerful weapons and utilize ancient tools in order to progress through the island.  Throughout your journey you are haunted by strange, cryptic letters left by an even stranger magician who openly taunts you to challenge him in his massive castle once you become strong enough.  Gameplay At first, since I was unfamiliar to the concepts of the genre, I found the combat strange, confusing and even awkward. But I quickly adapted and the gamplay became second nature soon enough. The heart of the game, however, is the puzzles. They are oftentimes relatively complex logical puzzles, a few of which border the lines of non-sequitor, but for the most part are very satisfying to complete. The dungeons are a blast to explore and there are enough modern tweaks to the system that elimate most uncessary hardships (fast-travel, saving without needing save points). If you want an added challenge, you can choose to disable all in game maps which forces you to draw your own on paper. Sensory It was clear that my computer was not up to snuff to run this game to its full potential. However, I enjoyed even the minimalist graphical settings and felt completely absorbed into the dark, gritty world. In fact, I found it more and more difficult to play as I progressed in the game due to the feeling of paranoia and solipsism. The deeper dungeons left me exhausted from stress. From a technical point of view, the sound effects are fantastic: swords swing with a satisfying crunch when you score hits, and monsters are terrifyingly ferocious. The musical score is subdued and only provides a backdrop, which is perfectly appropriate for this game (the title menu music is amazing, by the way). Conlusion If you are looking for a rpg with a focus on extraordinary gameplay, this would be a fantastic journey for you. The story is open-ended enough for the player to fill in the lines , which I think allows the focus to stay on the gameplay. You will be bewildered, frustrated and ultimately extremely satisfied should you brave the mysterious island of Grimrock...			"

												The open world makes this a huge improvement over the first game. surpassed not only the original but every grid-based dungeon crawler I've encountered. My friends would lament the passing of the grid-based dungeon crawls and fondly remember ""Dungeon Master"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""Wizardry"", ""The Bards Tale"".

												This game is equal parts frustrating and ridiculously fun.  Make no mistake, this is a puzzle game first.  Yes, there is fighting and an RPG element to it, but the puzzles are how you get through the game.  Some of the puzzles are as easy as stepping on a pressure plate, others are as complex as hitting levers in a specific order even though the trap doors open and close below you as you are moving.  So believe me when I tell you that you will have to step away occasionally out of sheer frustration.  The developers do indeed give you clues as to how to complete most of the puzzles, but they are vague and definitely subject to interpretation.  That said, when you figure out a particularly difficult puzzle, it will be one of the more rewarding experiences in your gaming life. Another aspect of this is the secrets in the game.  Some of them are just hidden buttons in walls that open up secret passages to treasure.  Others are teleport patterns that lead to artifacts.  If you are like me, you love discovery, so you will spend WAY more time than is necessary checking the walls for buttons and trying different patterns on pressure plates just in case.  In short, this game is awesome!			"

												Wow the first one was good but grimrock 2 is freaking amazing. Better level design, better graphics, great puzzles, good party/charcter building.The only thing is I wish they had more spells, other than that just an amazing game. I played through 2 times back to back. Cant wait for more, good job. If you liked the first one you will love the 2nd. If you where on the wall about the first you will most likely enjoy this one. If you didnt like the non-turn based fighting of the first one you most likely will feel the same about the second however it would be ashame to miss this one. Overall one of the best games I have played in a long time.			"

Legend of Grimrock 2 is delightful blend of RPG, exploration and puzzle elements and is recommended for fans of old school dungeon crawlers and fans of RPGs and puzzle games in general.

												I'll start this review with saying, that I loved the first LOG and once I completed it, I went straight to google and queried ""games like LOG"" and ""LOG 2 release date"", knowing full well, there wasn’t a chance it was being developed yet,  but just hoping it was, as the experience was fantastic.  Well I got my wish!  At current I have around 14hrs into the 2nd installment and have not been disappointed.  If you are reading these reviews to get an idea of gameplay, I can say the grid based movement system can be odd or awkward at first, if you have never experienced it but you really feel like you’re playing an old school dungeon crawler or a tile based board game and sink right into it after a handful of minutes.  Don’t get this confused with turn based or real time pause type games like wasteland 2 or dragon age.  This is real time with you being limited in movement to linear paths only. You move as you would with any other game using w a s and d in a linear fashion on an invisible grid.  You can rotate within a grid square using q and r or rotate by dragging and pulling your mouse.  You are also able to look around with the mouse within your FOV up, down and side to side.  You are probably wondering why even utilize this and not just use free roam?  The grid based system has a direct influence on combat, as you can only engage an enemy that is in a tile(s) directly in front of you - ranged weapon, firearms or magic can be cast/fired beyond 1 square. You cannot move diagonally.  This makes combat difficult and tricky when multiple enemies are engaged with you.  Back yourself into a corner and hope you have enough health potions to duke it out before your entire party gets wiped out.  This is a good spot to describe the party system.  It’s a four party group stacked 2 x 2.  The front two, typically are your tanks, damage dealer type heroes with the back being your spell casters and ranged weapon guys.  This is pretty standard but important to understand how that works within the grid system.  When facing directly in front of an enemy, the front two take the brunt of the damage while allowing your back row to cast and fire.  Let an enemy flank your party and the back row now becomes the focus of the full force of an attack.  This can be very troublesome as they typically don’t have the protection or armor the front row has.  Attacking can be confusing for a new player as you don’t actually click on the enemy to attack, like you would in a standard first person hacker.  As long as the party is facing the block with an enemy in it, you simply click the item/weapon in your hand to perform the attack (in party box lower right hand corner).  To cast a spell you first need to find the scroll, have the required skills/traits to cast it and finally to use, right click the hand and select the correct glyphs to perform the spell.  You have to memorize these and perform them every time you cast a spell.  There is no hot key for spells.  Spells with multiple glyphs need to be drawn, by holding and dragging the mouse across the designated glyphs.  This stumped me for a while as I was simply clicking them which are fine for single glyph spells but useless for more complex spells.The world is full of secret chests and loot so keep an eye out for button like stones on walls.  In fact whenever I go through a new area I always look left and right at every wall surface to find hidden wall buttons.  Get used to doing this. Getting through the game will be considerably harder if you are not finding the secret items.  All secret chests need lock picks to open!  You find these in the world so search every last block.  This is not like path of exile or another action RPG where they dump items on you.  These lock picks are few and far between, in some cases you will have to make a decision which chest you want to open.  In these circumstances I simply save it and test each one out for its contents (CONTENTS ARE NOT RANDOM) when you decide which chest has the most useful loot go to it, loot it and save it.  Another great aspect of the secret chests is that some are buried around the world, so you may be given a treasure map and tasked with digging up areas looking for it.So now to my favorite part of this game - the puzzles!  This game has the best combination of RPG elements and adventure game puzzles.  If you like complicated puzzles that you would often find in classic point and click adventure games, you will love these.  They really make you stop and think, all while testing your sanity.  They can be downright frustrating for some and near impossible for others, who don’t have the constitution or mental makeup for them.  All, however, are very logical when the solution presents itself, from either trial and error, or simply when you fold and look it up online.  Solving some of these will make you feel like a genius! And your efforts will be rewarded with a shimmering melody and a rare item or clue. Without giving away any spoilers I would like to touch on the story and level layouts.  Each unique area you access consist of outdoor open environments, coupled with a labyrinth of dungeons beneath.  This differs significantly from the original where you were confined to the claustrophobic dark of the tunnels.  This offers a nice respite from the stress of dungeon crawling IMHO.  Its always a breath of fresh air, literally, when you make it out to the bright summer sun after spending hours, laboring in the rat infested deep.  You are able to back track to previous levels in case you want to open a locked chest or forgot to do something important.  I cant speak for the entire game, but at least to where i am, 14hrs in, i was able to go as far back to the opening beach. There is a running theme through the levels/areas, in regards to story quest items.  You are not simply leveling and grinding for the sake of leveling.  You collect story unique items which will most likely be used in some synergistic fashion at the climactic ending.  I am no where near this but seeing how the levels have progressed thus far, it would be a logical deduction. There are many game options at the start of a new game all of which allow you to scale the difficulty.  Easy Normal and hard are the difficulty levels.  In my opinion Normal can be difficult for new players or if your party is not balanced correctly so choose wisely.  You also have the option of disabling the map function which forces you to draw your own maps on grid paper which is lots of fun tbh.  It forces you to slow down and take note of things around you, as opposed to running through the dungeon in which case you can become quickly disoriented and lost.  You will never really become lost but they are useful when running from an enemy(s) so you can keep your orientation so not to back yourself into a corner which as explained earlier can be game ending.  Another option is to allow quick save anywhere in the game (f5).  This in my opinion is too easy to spam so I choose the option to save at save crystals which are sparingly spread across the levels.  One final option is to only be allowed 1 save per crystal.  This is extreme and to be used with caution.  You can do a lot before you come across another save crystal so dying before you reach it can be disastrous and for some a game ender all together.I can't recommend this game any higher.  Pick it up and you will have hours upon hours of fun.  I am sitting at work writing this review because I can’t wait to get home to play it!			"

												Legend of Grimrock II is a meatier, more involved version of the first title from Almost Human Studios, and it succeeds at offering a customizable, nostalgia-laden quest through a number of interesting dungeons with swarms of enemies and puzzles. Like the first title, it attempts to bring a fresh perspective to old PC dungeon crawler franchises like Wizardry, The Bard’s Tale, and Might & Magic. It has more content, a somewhat open world environment to explore, and more interesting weapons and encounters.Character customization and creation is one of the best things in Grimrock II, offering players meaningful, interesting race choices and perks. Your mission is to compose the ultimate team in four party member slots. Bulky minotaurs make excellent front line tanks, while agile ratmen make good backline options with double daggers or projectile weapons. You have opportunities to come up with cool combos after your first playthrough, like four melee builds (using skills to be able to hit from the backline) or four casters.After you’ve rolled up your party of intrepid adventurers, you’re placed on a beach to discover how things work. The beach and introductory island serve as a tutorial, offering up a selection of weapons, consumables, and spells alongside helpful hints as to how the game works – a formula that remains constant during the lengthy playthrough. You start learning how to flip teleporter switches, find keys, and fight your first boss monster. It all feels pretty sleek and polished, but the best games in the core dungeon crawler genre break up the inevitable tedium inherent to the formula by throwing new things at the player.Despite new environments and minor changes to enemies over the course of the game, what you’re doing in that first zone is what you’re doing for the full game. Repetition is not uncommon in dungeon crawlers, but the fact that you feel the tedium soaking in does damage to the otherwise enjoyable systems in place. By the tenth time you encounter a similar weight/teleport puzzle, you’re wishing there was some way to skip it and get back into battle instead of reading accompanying signposts and notes, trying each button multiple times before things click. Although the enemies have a pretty solid variety, you’re moving from cube to cube either completely dominating or being completely slaughtered most of the time as you execute your swings, spells, and slings.Your characters can learn weapon skills allowing them to use special abilities in combat, from swinging heavy axes to throwing a melee dagger, and this is all backed up with careful spell selection and party positioning and placement. Characters in your back row are difficult to hit from the front but vulnerable to blows from the back and side, so finding the right spot to turtle can be essential. Fights with giant, lumbering enemies could involve repeated backpedaling while hurling stones, arrows, and anything else on hand to avoid a physical encounter. Combat is crisp and clean, and serves to highlight the game’s strength as a classic crawler. The fact that you’re constantly managing your strike and spell cooldowns during combat makes things more action-oriented in a format that traditionally adheres to rigid turn-based tactics.Although there are some open-world elements to enjoy, things progress in a fairly linear way. You’re able to backtrack and explore from a central hub to farm for materials, food, and experience, so even if your team is far from a cookie-cutter template you should be able to eventually push through whatever challenge lies before you.Legend of Grimrock II serves as a fun followup to the original game, and an improvement. I’d love to see a third game that expands a bit more on the powerful core combat and character customization, and relies a bit less on repetitive puzzle solving that’s interesting at first but an absolute slog as you churn through the chapters. I’d recommend this wholeheartedly to fans of dungeon crawling, but it could be a frustrating choice for non-enthusiasts.			"

												This first-person dungeon crawler manages to look beautiful while incorporating the best features of an ancient genre. An absolute must-play for old school gamers who are fond of complex puzzles and some high-quality RPG action. The inventory system is surprisingly user-friendly (without being simple), and the open-world grid is definitely an improvement on the level-based model of the previous installment. Last but not least, the game enjoys competent writing which makes for some very effective storytelling. All in all, one of the best games in recent years, as far as I'm concerned.			"

												I love this game and even did a second play-through earlier this year on hard difficulty. It is such a great game. I think it improves on the first game in almost every way although I'm undecided on whether the open world in the second game is better than the more linear dungeon crawl of the first. Ultimately, they are both really enjoyable games. The areas in Legend of Grimrock II are wonderfully crafted, the exploration is fun, the atmosphere is fantastic, the combat is challenging and the puzzles are great. Can't recommend it enough. I intend to come back to this game at some point to try out some of the awesome looking mods on the Steam workshop.I also really need to play through the first game again at some point as I enjoyed that one so much too. If you don't already own the first game, I suggest picking up the Legend of Grimrock bundle. This is an amazing series and I look forward to Almost Human Games announcing Legend of Grimrock III! "

												This game is a tile-based puzzle-RPG with lots of puzzles and quite some fighting. Graphics are very nice actually for todays standards, sound is ok. If you played the first LoG and liked it, you will love this one, it's improved in every way. If not, it may be worth your time if you like this kind of gameplay. You will be exploring multiple areas over and under the surface, while fending off monsters and trying to solve puzzles for treasures and story items. The puzzles are quite challenging at times, especially for optional rewards. I must admit, I had to consult the community a few times, but it is entirely possible to solve everything by yourself if you put your mind and some time to it. Some puzzle hints are quite cryptic, but with some thought and trial/error everything can be solved. The fighting is fun, you have multiple classes to choose from and nicely designed equipment that makes you want to have them all! There is a new race as well, so you could create an obese Rat farmer who gains experience by eating food and extra boni from cheese slices (lol), or an insectoid alchemist who fires giant cannonballs and grows mushrooms in her pockets (disgusting). Besides melee and ranged fighting, you have magic based on a rune system. But if you dont like that extra micromanagment, just make a party of 4 Berserkers and smash everything to a pulp. You can even change the character portraits with your own custom pictures, so visually you can have your dream party of Pokémon or whatever you fancy.I got almost 40 h of gameplay out of this 20€ purchase, so it was well worth the money. I am actually more content with LoG2 than I was with Shadow of Mordor. It is a lot of fun and I recommend it to every RPG/Puzzle fan. For me personally, this is game of the year so far.			"

Product received for free
												I've finally completed it after playing 2 years off and on. My expectation was that it would be like the first Grimrock, but pushed too far for the engine to support the larger ambitions. My skepticism was wrong and it turned out to be better in every way. The world, combat, items, skills, puzzles, and everything else have all been reworked to perfection. The switch from linear to more open world turned out great and fits perfectly with the adventure style.My favorite thing about the game is the puzzles. Some are self-contained and about observation or logic. But others are long-form riddles where you might find a hint in a secret area and then come across the thing it was hinting at hours later. Some you might never solve, but optional puzzles often just give access to better loot.Combat is still a dance on the grid, but this game has more enemies that use the grid in interesting ways. For example there's a frog that hand hops into the air and then lands on a random space nearby. The non-dungeon environments feel strange at first, but eventually add some nice variety. There's a dozen distinct areas (forest, swamp, desert, graveyard, beach, etc.) and most have some unique enemies.The story is extremely thin and comes in the form of notes you find scattered around the island. There's no NPCs or dialog. It becomes an epic quest, but it's really about exploring every inch and finding all the gems to unlock the final temple. Along the way you might even find the best pants. Great game!			"

												So far this game is outstanding. Not only in gameplay terms but technical as well. The environments is stunning, especially for the file size. Great material work, great lighting, the combat is clean and I personally have had no issues with it so far. The variety of enemies keeps the game fresh, and the sense of freedom is satisfying.Theres a story told with no voice acting which is no easy feat and the world feels alive. The sound design is stunning, the ambient sounds really set the tone and phsically make you feel on edge. It's not only fun it's challenging. The puzzles are actually hard to figure out and some of the enemies will break your party in a way you've never seen before. As a Junior at University studying Game Design this game is a breath of fresh air, completely different to anything I've played in the last few years and that's a hard club to get into. Seriously if you are thinking of getting this, just do it. It's cheap for what you're getting and it's fun. I bought this on a whim and I do not regret it. Which isn't something I can say about a lot of games in my steam library.			"

												First impression after 3 hours played: A delightfully refreshing island exploration game.solving puzzles,battling monsters and minions on a beautifully scenic mysterious island.with your 3(odd)companions.searching for lost secrets of times long forgotten.and digging for buried treasure,while trying to keep your characters stats increasing with the pace of the story.good to see this game style is back!                                                                   9.9/10 for whats it is. (i would have given this game a 10/10,but the controls took me an hour or 2 to get the hang of.once you got that down.its all good!!).           "

												This game is a complete masterpiece. Almost 10/10.From the moment you start, alone, on an island, having to escape a crate, this game has a wonderful environment, pacing, and mix of monster-slashing and puzzles.On the surface, Grimrock appears to be an old-school isometric dungeon game. And it is that, but it's so much more; it has modern graphics, a modern character class and potion crafting system. The game contains an amazing nod to past games, but is in fact entirely new.The only drawbacks to Grimrock are that it's too hard. I accidentally chose ""normal"" mode, which for me was more like ""insane"" mode, and there was no way to downgrade the difficulty.Still, I stuck with it, and admittedly used walkthroughs and cheated a bit at the end.100% worth it.

												Even only after 5 hours to the game I can say that this is fantastic!Terrain looks amazing, puzzles are challenging but logical, combat is pretty much the same as in the first one (wasn't much to improve there), but now there are more weapon choices and overall more class customization. Not to forget sounds! Sounds are wonderful! Did I already say that terrain looks amazing?I highly recommend to buy this game, if you liked the first one, and even if you haven't played the first one, no worries! For stories are not related.Recommended!			"

												Here's a game that is going to take you back to a time in gaming where we used grid paper to map dungeons and solve puzzles.It's also a time where puzzle games for some reason had combat and also crazy difficult boss fights.I really enjoyed the Legend of Grimrock 2, but I feel although it is faithful to the old guard of Dungeon Master and Eye of Beholder... it falls prey to some of the same mistakes those games fell too.Take for example your party. I believe the game is 'beatable' with fewer than four party members, but I see little reason to do so other than a personal challenge. Your characters can learn all sorts of traits and abilities, but the game becomes so difficult right at the end; you better have built that party extremely well.Some of the disciplines seem totatlly unbalanced. I can't see anyone playing a game where they do not have someone with 5 in Alchemy because potions and bombs can be really important. Light weapons and firearms do not seem very good... everyone should basically have max heavy weapons, and 2 in accuracy in order to hit from the back row if necessary.That being said... that ability to customise is there... and I very much appreicated it. The game also comes with a powerful toolbox for building your own ""Grimrock"". This is excellent, and I am sure people can get many hours out of solving eachothers puzzles and dungeons.To progress in the game, you have to find these shiny gems... unfortunately although it would have been brilliant to have more gems on the island than you need to beat the game... you in fact have to get ""every"" gem on the island... this can be very very frusterating if you missed a couple.Overall, I really enjoyed Legend of Grimrock 2 and would recommend playing it if you can get it on sale or really like a mix between DND, Myst, and Dungeon Master; but it comes with the warning that it does still have all the flaws of those inspirations.

												I rarely, RARELY, ever say the following:The sequel was even better than the original.I can't put my finger on just one thing that makes it so much better, but I really enjoyed the entire experience.  If you like dungeon crawlers on a grid, like (and I'm going back to the 80's here) Bard's Tale, Wizardry, Dragon Wars (Amiga 500), Heroes of Might & Magic Series, etc, you should try this game.The one adjustment to get used to is combat is in real-time, so it is not turn-based like many games in this genre.  You'll need to get good at moving your party to a dead-end to prevent being attacked on multiple sides or become quick with the WASD keys to keep moving so you don't get hit much.Going back to why I think this game is better than the original Legend of Grimrock: I like that this game had environments that took place on the surface.  You explore forests, deserts, even underwater at times.  This was a fun change from the first game where you are underground traveling floor to floor deeper into your prison/dungeon.  It also means you will frequently revisit areas and as time goes by some of the monsters will respawn giving you an opportunity to pickup some extra xp and food.  This helps make food an easier resource to obtain unlike the first game where I was stressing about running out more frequently.Inventory management was easier for a loot hoarder like me because there is an area called the Hub which you can revisit.  There are no creatures there, just a small chamber where you can drop off the extra things you may wish to save for later.I hope there is eventually a Legend of Grimrock 3 as I really enjoy the series and look forward to whatever else the developer may come up with to keep the series fresh and entertaining.

												Legends of Grimrock 2. Is deffinitly a great upgrade to an already geat game. The first was good, the second is better. more non linear paths make things a little more confusing to geet around. The graphics and new textures are amazing and the world borders seam nothing like invisable walls or poor barriers, and makes you feel more trapped on the isle of Nex All in all everything in consideration Grimrock 2 is by far the best tile based RPG I have ever played.

												Fantastic game that harkens back to the good old days of Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore. Legend of Grimrock 2 is less focused on story than either of those games, instead going for a high amount of puzzling and exploration. Some may criticize Grimrock for needlessly using grid-based movement, but those people misunderstand the genre. Grid-based movement is the entire foundation of this kind of game, and it would have been an entirely different genre without it. Here's hoping that we see more games like this in the future, perhaps with more story. I would recommend this game without hesitation.			"

												Wow... This game. I honestly got this game from a bundle and didn't think I would ever even end up playing it, but man am I glad I did.Things I liked:Tons of little mysteries that it always made you want to find the solutions to.The graphics are actually really prettyThe combat, once you got used to it is actually pretty in depth and in areas a very fun challenge. (I played through on Normal)It has so much replay-ability with new characters, different paths to take, and ever more secrets to find!Things I didn't like as much:In some dungeons I was so worried I might miss a secret, I would scan every wall available (In some areas, there were many walls). The early quick level ups and the impossible late game level system. I felt like I leveled quickly early on, but later in the game, I felt like it was impossible to get any more levels on my charactersIn Short:I enjoyed this game immensely and would recommend to people who enjoy puzzles and character development.

												A much larger and mostly better version of the original game this sequel is a welcome return to the world of Grimrock. As the setting of the game is in the mythical island of Nex you as a player arent limited to delving in the dark, mossy dungeons of its precedessor but can instead explore and experience the great outdoors with such groundbreaking features as day and night cycle, diving underwater(no skuba included, at least so far) and fighting against the plant life in all of its ferocious forms (long live the industrial revolution).After 14 hours of gameplay i havent run into any bugs or other bad experiences that would negatively impact the game and my biggest gripe so far might be that some of the puzzles arent immediately solvable after finding them. Combat is much better, albeit in the same style as the original, as the monsters arent so easily danced around anymore and you often find yourself forced to use your enviroment as a tactical tool to manage the encounters. And as both spellcasting and the skill system have received some tuning your characters arent forced to specialize into a single role anymore. Now it seems like you can have that greataxe-wielding insectoid berserker who likes to wear heavy armor while slinging fireballs around.Overall its a good game so get it if you enjoy this kind of thing, and if not hey, why not try it.

												If you like dungeon crawl type games, this is must play (the first game too).Great experience, interesting puzzles and exploration, challenging monsters. The only thing I didn't like is the HARD end battle (there is also optional another hard battle, but I'm talking about the one you can't miss). It is much harder than rest of the game, so be prepared.I'd recommend the game of course. Looking forward to LoG 3!			"

Posted: October 16, 2014
												A very worthy sequel! I have sunk quite a few hours into it so far, but not completed it, so these are my impressions. I am assuming you are familiar with the original Grimrock's game mechanics.Shipwrecked and shackled, your four prisoner party washes up in a locked cage on the beach of a mysterious island. After you break free and fight and puzzle your way through the initial enclosed area the game sprawls out before you. Unlike the original game which was linear, you can pretty much go where you want. But tread carefully, as some sections are a lot more difficult than others depending on your skills, equipment and spell knowledge. The world of Grimrock 2 is tightly designed with little wasted space and there is always something close by to be slaughtering, solving or salvaging. There is something about it that is reminiscent of the Zelda games.The default party has a decent mix of skills, with two melee damage dealers, a wizard, and a ranged firearm user. Yes, Grimrock 2 has boomsticks. Skills are not exclusive to any class now, and can be customized as you see fit. So if you want to add some fire magic to your barbarian Minotaur, you can do that, though clearly their casting efficacy is not going to be up to a pure wizard/battlemage's build, and generalizing your skills could lead to a weak party. There are numerous additions to classes over the last game, including an interesting looking ""farmer"" class that levels up by eating rather than killing.Somehow I managed to play through the last Grimrock with the automap disabled, but in Grimrock 2 the area is so much larger and more open that it would be difficult to explore properly without making notes. The automap feature fills in detail as you navigate the world and allows annotation with multiple symbols that can be set as markers for those locked chests, doors and unsolved puzzles you need to return to. It is very easy to pan and zoom around the map.The atmosphere is spot on whether you are navigating the woodland by day, listening to the birdsong, or moving in the marshes with everything shrouded in a thick green fog, toadstools silhouetted in the distance. I was surprised to see that there is a day night cycle and enjoyed emerging from a dank dungeon into a glorious sanguine dusk. If you find adventuring by night too inconvenient you can sleep through it, though you will burn through your food stocks quicker doing this.Combat has been refined with enemies needing different tactics to beat effectively. Some will require more thought than just circle strafing and hitting, with them capable of setting counter-attacks if you try this or plain leaping over you and attacking from a different side. Magic casting has been polished with you dragging a gesture over the symbols rather than selecting them individually. This makes casting a little slicker and more fun to use. Melee has been improved with the addition of a power attack. If the weapons skill requirements are met, the power attack can be used and unleashed at the expense of a large hit to your energy pool.Grimrock 2 is a joy to play. It is fun to explore the game world, solve puzzles, and slaughter monsters, gradually becoming more and more powerful. The game is a clear recommend to anyone that enjoyed the first game in the series and the old dungeon crawler classics. Perhaps the grid-based movement is a little antiquated for some, an acquired taste, but it is a taste you should strive to acquire.			"

Product received for free
												I got Legend of Grimrock 2 as a gift around two years ago, played it until I killed the Viper Roots, put it down, and didn't touch it for another two years.After resolving to pick it up again and not set it down until I was finished, I can say that LoGII does everything from LoGI, and more.While LoGI was entirely set in the claustrophobic confines of Grimrock, a giant dungeon built in the mountains, LoGII takes place on the Isle of Nex, with over 10 unique environments, 5 bosses, and more of the fun rune-based magic, hunting for rare items, and secrets that made LoGI so great. The level design and puzzles are on point, reminescent of classic dungeon crawlers like Dungeon Master. Many old enemies return from LoGI, with a few new ones to mix up the joyful shuffle-foot slice and cast combat routine of the original.My only real complaint about Grimrock II is the difficulty: either I don't recall how difficult LoGI was, or this game is on steroids. Enemies deal insane amounts of damage and are bulky as hell, making combat difficult if you get pinned between two enemies or a wall. Nostalgic enemies as well, while great, seem to be added in as sort of a fanservice thing (the Herder's Den comes to mind as such, as well as the Crowverns that only appear in one area.)Despite that, Legends of Grimrock II is more of the same greatness that made LoGI so fun, now with added plot outside of ""escape the Dungeon."" Would heartily reccomend, if you're a fan of the original or looking for a good Dungeon Crawler.Just remember to plan your characters properly, or else you'll be in for a bad time.			"

												Ok, This game is one of the best 20€ ever spent. I'd write summary at the start for tl;dr guys. If you like dungeon crawler you have to play this game. If you like Legend of Grimrock 1 you have to buy this game. If you like whatever what is like might & magic  or any RPG and you don't mind it's a grid system rpg you're gonna love it. If you are a Hardcore dungeon crawling player, you'll see big potential in this game and maybe you'll notice some small cons but they're not important for the whole game. 9/10Pros:- It's like expansion of LoG1 in everything- Beautiful scenery- Great combat system- Perfectly balanced combat system (on nomral - every combas wasn't too much hard neither too much easy)- Gameplay time- Workshop so you can play the community maps- Hardcore Challenges (Single use crystal, iron man, old school player - no map, or all of these)- Graphics (same as the LoG1 BUT it doesn't mean the design is same)- Level Design is really good- Ending(s) (in my opinion atleast)- Treeskill with traits (I like the idea how they did that)- Day/Night cycleOk enough of pros. It's just a great game now some negativesCons: (it's gonna be details)- I'd say ppl with firearms will be a littlebit pi**ed because sometimes they'll run of ammo. But when it will happen you have already prepared second type of attacts instead of firearms (throwing,missile or light weapons).- Just a few usable spells ""fireburst,fireball,meteorfall,light and some protection spells"" but the others are almost useless or they dont have higher level of them. So if someone starts max earth magic he's gonna have a hard time.- There are only sh*tty maps in workshop for now (sorry guys but you spent just a few hours for making your whole map/mod, that's ridiculous and you can't finish a good map in that time). But it's only question of time. The game is still pretty new.- I don't know if there's something like afterstory (I mean after second ending) there could be something like last huge dungeon for crawling through it'd be amazing (I feel there's nothing like that)Ok It takes me so long to write some cons. Why it's not 10/10 is just these things (especially the 'spells' part). As I said it's improving of LoG1 in everything. Everything what they can improve they did. Actaully I wonder if they think about LoG3. I have some suggestion for another sequel - like Cities, some NPCs quests (whole quest system ofc), dynamic weather. More sceneries It'd be great aswell. But anyway LoG2 is one of the best Dungeon Crawling RPG what you can buy right now!			"

												I really want to recommend this game, but it's hard to bring myself to do that when I am looking for other games to play before I have even finished this one.I played the first game and I LOVED it. I couldn't wait for the second one to come out. Now that I have finally managed to get around to playing it (I have tons of games and sometimes I don't get around to it) the second doesn't live up to the first. The first game was fairly linear. You go through a level of the dungeon, find everything and move on. Sometimes you come across a puzzle, usually very satisfying with a little bit of chin stroking, and feel a sense of accomplisment when you were done.In the second game however, when you come across a puzzle or an area that you can't seem to pass, you have to ask yourself, ""Am I missing something? Something that I am just not seeing? Or do I have another objective on the other side of the damned game map that I have to finish first?"" Annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't get me wrong, the puzzles are smartly made, but if I have to travel to the ends of the Earth and back just to get an item to pass this puzzle, I would like a clue that tells me as much. That's a major problem with this game, it doesn't tell you if you are stuck because the puzzle is either that hard, or you are missing an item, switch, or button. I have found myself skipping large areas because I thought I had to come back later, then I got stuck in another area, ran around the map for HOURS trying to figure out what to do next, then I finally came back to the original area only to find out I missed a God forsaken button....♥♥♥♥! I have a wife and 4 kids, I don't have hours to stick my thumb up my butt looking for buttons. Oh, and these puzzles aren't for finding secrets, they are to advance the main part of the game. It would be different if they were just side areas. That would vastly increase the replayability. You know how to beat the game, you just want to play it again to see what else there is or whatever reason you would replay a game for.Anyway, I can't recommend it unless you have too much time on your hands and you either don't mind wasting it, don't mind googling the solutions, or you have lot's of thumbs and butts to put them in.

												Gives you a retrogasm. A truly awesome game which does everything right. You gonna have a blast if you are a) an ancient gamer from the 80s/90s or interested in retro gaming because dad has this weird grin when he talks about Lands of Lore. God, how i have missed this kind of RPG. Its like the designers opened a bag of fun filled with a well thought game design, puzzles that actually make you think instead of looking on your mini map where your goal is already marked and a combat system that dares to kill your party if you dont shape up and think how to get rid of a nasty monster.Everyone who loved Eye of the beholder or Dungeon Master should buy this. Support what they created here. This is made for gamers, not for share holders.			"

												GrimRock2 is great fun with appropriately punishing difficulty level. Anyone remembering fondly of dungeon master/eye of the beholder or some such old school dungeon crawler should give this game a try. Game mechanics are easy to learn yet difficult to master. There are some strategy elements to the real time battles which keep encounters fresh. The puzzles in this game are mostly logical and fun to solve. There are some puzzles that don't make sense(to me) and it's either try all possible options or do some googling.Only real negative is the games plot which is quite much rubbish. Not that plot matters that much as exploring the game world is fun enough in itself.There are unique ways to develop the characters in this game. It's possible to have fairly different gaming experience by trying out different party compositions. This is good as even if you intend to play this game only once to the conclusion you can play it your way.Oh, and the sugar at the bottom is the game includes dungeon creator. You can make your own worlds or try out some experiences made by the fans of this game. The fun will never end.			"

												Fantastic game but often brutal in it's application of traps.  Not just a nostalgic look back to games like Dungeon Keeper and Eye of the Beholder but a significant evolution of the genre.  Enemies are not always limited to moving exactly one square at a time and may often surpise you when first encountered.  The puzzles range from straight forward to perhaps a bit too obtuse but with all the resources of the internet you wont be stuck any longer than you want to be.			"

												I love and hate this game. It improved everything compared to the first game, which I love, but also made the bad things even worse.TL;DR: 8/10. Recommend it to patient people, has minor flaws which can be annoying. Could easily be 9/10 without those.The Good:- very good level design, kinda like dark souls. Different regions with different themes connected to each other from different paths with shortcuts and secrets everywhere. Also you can choose where to go first and where later. This also creates a dynamic difficulty level because you can do the easy regions first or harder region and stomp the easy region afterwards which is a nice thing in my opinion especially for speedrunners.- I like that there is no music except in bossfights. It helps the atmossphere alot. In most games music is just overused.- great enemy variety visually as well as mechanicly. Almost every enemy has a unqiue element to it, for example one can attack everywhere, one can jump sidewards, one can charge you and stuff like that.- a lot of exploration which gets rewarded and is satisfying- good puzzles- clear objective what to do despite being so open- great graphics and good performance- huge value and replayabilty. Integrated dungeon creator and workshop support!The Bad:- some weird puzzles where I NEVER EVER would have find out how to do it. In LoG 1 every puzzle (I coudlnt figure out all of them) made sense even when I looked how to solve it it made sense afterwards but in LoG 2 there are 3-5 puzzles which are stupid even if 1 of them is simple.- overpowered status effects. Enemys can randomly give you status effect which are WAY too strong and annoying as hell. Also if you accidently fall off a small ledge 2-3 party members can break their legs randomly and your party is slowed and everyone gets overloaded and stuff. Also status effects dont go away except poison, but that takes very long to go away and in early game it will kill you if you have full health- weird balance of loot. I found so many Heavy Weapons which were all very good, but I found very few light weapons. I used 2 swords which you find very early and my character kept using that until almost the end. For my Mage I only found 2 staffs and 1 orb or something which were useful. For my firearms guy I found like 2-3 guns but there were almost identical in terms of dps and the canon I couldnt use because it was waay too heavy. If I had skilled my 2 front guys with Heavy weapons this game would be alot easier.- Castle Nex was kinda unspectacular even the boss fight at the end. In LoG 1 the last boss was very surprising for me and also had a nice way to kill him. But the last boss fight in LoG 2 was still good.- the game had no real magical moments like in LoG 1. I dont remember exactly what they were but I remember there were moments in LoG 1 which were just very awesome, small moments, but good ones. Also LoG 1 had Toorum, the Island guy in LoG 2 is very boring and like a wannabe Gman.			"

												Love this game!Pros:- The story (for what there is) was pretty mysterious and intruiging, i found myself looking forward to every letter, trying to decipher who (or what) the ""Master of the island"" was.- The graphics are beautiful, and really don't need incredible hardware to function at high settings (i originally played this at max settings with a gt530!)- Each kill is super satisfying, even killing the little creeps felt really good.- The difficuly was on point, I played on hard and it wasn't too hard, but wasn't too easy. The difficulty may be dependant on how many secrets you find.  For those of you who like being roughly fondled by video games, there is ironman, no-map, or ""farmer"" modes for you. This game really does have a difficulty for pretty much anyone.- There are a TON of secrets in this game, you're bound to accidentally stumble upon some, even if you  don't look for them. They typically contain the best gear and really good survivability tools. Hoewever if you DO put in the effort to look for secrets, it's a fantatic feeling when it finally clicks, it feels just as good as a well constructed puzzle game for some of the secrets in this game.- Environments are Interesting and varied, I was always looking forward to the next ""biome"" to explore. This game is far superior to this first, and i mainly give the credit to the enviroments.enemies are decently varied and i nearly always found completely new enemies for each area, some are just retextures, but there is enough there to satisfy.Cons:- some traps are REALLY unforgiving... I'm talking just step into a room, the door closes and out come literally 10 enemies... in a 4X4 room. learn to save early, save often, as there is no autosaving (with the exception of activationg a life crystal) plenty of people have quit because they are cradled by modern autosaving, this game doesn't have it!- as far as I know there is no respecing, so don't screw it up!- spells are taught through scrolls, which are pretty much always found in secrets... unless you want to trial and error the spell system all day. This makes playing mages difficult and slow, sometimes impossible based on how many useful scrolls you find. Unless you're using a walkthrough, try not to spec your mages around what you WANT, spec them around what you GET.- you'll probably be doing a lot of wandering and backtracking if you miss an area or item by accident, sometimes the direction can be unclear or somewhat hidden (main ""story"" areas and items will NEVER be part of a secret just sometimes really out of the way)- a couple of the main puzzles required to progress are a little janky, after brute forcing a couple of them i looked it up just to realise I was holding the answer, but that might be because i'm an idiot. (the gravyard puzzle, I still don't understand how i did it the first time)- As previously mentioned, the secrets contain amazing loot. If you don't get enough secrets, the game may become a gangrape. However I didn't have this problem, and most of the secrets i found were by accident.- Most of the story is told through the environment and through little snippits from letters and stones. The story isn't hidden on the dark souls level, but it's not super direct either. I personally like it this way, but I can see a lot of people preffering the ""story book"" type games.- Hate throwing potions at ♥♥♥♥ing broken feet DAMN IT!Conclusion/ TL:DR:Overall, the complaints I have are small and didn't really impede my enjoyment, however I can see them possibly causing problems for others. I thoroughly enjoyed myself all the way through and was always excited to uncover more secrets and get more sweet, sweet loot. Do yourself a favour and pick this up. And remember, save early, save often.9/10Grimrock 3 please?			"

												A huge, epic adventure that fans of first-person dungeon crawlers will devour. Designed with nostalgia in mind, but also sleek and shiny with modern graphics and great sound design. Better than the first game in every way, and worth it if you're even remotely interested in this kind of game. Play the first game before this one to help you ease into the mechanics and appreciate the improvements. The challenge level is steep but fair, and difficult enemies can be taken down through tactics and manuvering rather than brute force. There are tons of secrets to find and an overall sense of mystery and wonder in every dungeon and area. Atmosphere is thick and the sound really makes the world feel alive, and threats ahead can be anticipated with keen ears. Overall the presentation makes for a immersive experience coupled with solid gameplay and combat.The puzzles are mostly logical and can be figured out with a little thought and experimentation, though a few are so unclear that guesswork is almost neccessary. I'll fully admit I had to consult a guide for a few spots, and while some solutions made me feel stupid, a few just made me go ""really?"". It's much more satisfying to work through the puzzles yourself, but some of the nastier ones can get frustrating enough to encourage cheating. A few minor balance issues made me rethink my initial party and start over after a while, but I'm terrible for that in any game like this. Almost any party combination can work, but some weapons are simply found more often and in better quality than others. Consulting a guide or a friend before setting out with your party can help a lot, especially since a few of the classes don't necessarily work the way you might expect them to. Being out in a bright, open world makes the grid-based movement seem a bit strange, where it mostly made sense in the confined halls of the first game. It's not just there for nostalgia though - the movement system and the logic that governs it is central to the combat and puzzle-solving systems and removing it would have required a complete overhaul in design. The game wouldn't work otherwise. The more open-ended design makes for a lot more exploration, but it can be overwhelming. Puzzles that need keys or information from elsewhere to solve don't always indicate that clearly, and if you leave the game for too long and come back to it, you'll likely be hopelessly lost. The progression path isn't clear, but that could be said to just be part of the game's philosophy. Here's an island full of monsters and traps and secrets, good luck. Nostalgic, polished, immersive, and challenging enough to deter some players, this is almost everything you could possibly want in a dungeon crawl and one of the only modern examples of the genre. Worth the purchase, and then some. "

												If you haven't played the first game, stop looking at this page and go play that first. It's a great dungeon crawler and will help you enjoy this game so much more. Grimrock 2 is a major improvement over the already enjoyable first game. Compared to the first game, you will now see:An open world island with different dungeons, rather than one single linear dungeon. You will revisit most areas nowA serious overhaul on the atmosphere to make it feel like there isn't even a grid systemTextures that look like they're 4k resolutionHarder puzzles and riddles, making it very possible that you will not find all of the secrets on your first runChests instead of randomly placed stashesMuch more monsters, including new mini-bossesMuch more items (Firearms as a new weapon type)Magic works like swype keyboards now, making it faster to castWeapons now can be charged to use their special abilities, rather than having you randomly do the effect.A new race that can fit almost any role5 new classes, one of which is completely unique and makes the game somewhat harderNew difficulty settings, like only saving at crystals and one-use crystalsVery smooth optimization and the game only requires 1 gigabyteMore hours of gameplay. My first run took about 38 hours on hard with ironman turned onMore workshop possibilities with the updated development kitI seriously can't think of any downgrades from Grimrock 1 to 2, other than the removal of set effects on some of the early armors like leather. I would have also liked the ability to change voices for characters to fit your own custom portraits and the ability to create your own classes and races, but the large amount of races and classes is fair. This game is beyond worth $24.			"

												Hi there, this review is special designed for people who like LG 1 and aren't quite sure to buy it.I played LG1 with much pleasure and was so hyped when they announced LG2. I thought even if LG2 would be the same like LG1, it would be (imo) a great game. But what they have done is such an amazing polished game. Here my favorites improvements:1. New Skillsystem which is imo much better than LG1, because you have more freedom and could try some different ways of leveling.2. The new class: Alchemie. I love this one. To have with him much more herbs aka potions is such a great thing.3. New monsters, and more than one bossfight (first in the first 2 hours of the game, second will be the final boss...maybe there are even more ^^)3. No more empty flasks (maybe some others don't like this decision but i like it)4. Spells, you don't have to take all the scrolls with you or use other sides in the internet. Learn the spell and Tada on the Traits Rooster you can always read them.5. Overall the new way to cast spells --> really great game design. They beware the feeling of LG1 but this way it is much more like it used to be :)6. New Tooltips on weapons, special the description which attribute will improve the damage7. Outdoor, Indoor, Day and Night Cycle --> Overall much more variety in dungeon design (ladders!!)8. And i don't know why but i have the feeling that the fights (so far 7h in the game) are much more different between two monster arts. I use much more movement or all ways of making damage as in LG1.9. New Map + and the new signs to make notes --> Great idea. Obverall the map is so much better.10. Digging. This way there are a new way to find secrets.I'm not done yet but if you like LG1 --> B U Y - T H I S - G A M EYou played dungeon master? --> B U Y - T H I S - G A M EYou like dungeon crawler --> B U Y - T H I S - G A M EYou like difficult games --> B U Y - T H I S - G A M E and turn on a few options to make it real hard :)You don't like difficult games --> B U Y - T H I S - G A M E and turn off a few options or play in normal/easy "

												Better than the original Grimrock in pretty much every way. As long as you enjoy this kind of old-school RPG, you can't really go wrong with Grimrock 2. On the other hand, between the challenging puzzles and the overall diffuculty this game is certainly not for everyone. I played through the game on normal.The good:- Nice varied locations- While still not perfect, the RPG mechanics are a big improvement over Grimrock 1- Lots of puzzles and secretsThe bad:- Some of the enemies force you to rethink your tactics, but overall the combat is still fairly clunky and heavily based on kiting. This was certainly the weakest part of the game for me- Loot distribution felt off, there were huge caps in the game where there were no upgrades for certain weapon typesThe ugly:- Many of the puzzles are very obtuse, this is the one area where the game is probably even worse than the original			"

												OK...i Just finished Grimrock 2 -- around 30 hours to complete. Yes it was frustrating, but i think all in all, it was a great game well worth the cash i paid for it. A little heavy on the puzzle side -- some made me wanna punch my LCD. Monsters don't really regenerate so you can play a whole game without the stats to finish it. Combat system pretty old-scool...but functional. The boss battles do require tactics. I almost quit a few times thinking the game was broken or fights just too unfair, but changed tactics, saved a few times mid battle and got through it. It's strange to think how thourough I was going through the game looking for secrets that I only found about 50% of the secrets. I just don't see where the clues were that led to the other 50% of the secrets...Maybe the designer did that for replayability? My friend tells me there are some good MOD dungeons out there for this game. To be honest, I think I'm done and ready to move on to the next game.			"

Awesome game easily got my moneys worth. I'd give it a 7/10 I'd like to give it a higher score but one thing i really didn't like about this game is some of the puzzles were far far too obscure. Ideally if you can't figure out something you want to be able to look up the answer and go ""ah /facepalm i should have stuck at it and figured it out"" in many cases many after giving up and looking up the solution i found myself thinking ""thank god i didn't try solve that"" from a game play point of view when that happens too much that has a real negative effect that makes you start to think far to early on ""maybe this is one of these puzzles i should just not even bother try hard solving"".Totally looking forward to a sequel, i hope they refine some of its shortcomings.

The style of gameplay might be a niche, but it brought back memories of playing games from many years ago.Many of the puzzles I found I could work out and made sense, though there were a couple of doozies that made me seek solutions through Google. For the most part, I think the puzzles were well thought out and functioned well within the game space.I'll certainly be looking forward to my next playthrough, although I hope I'll be playing LoG3 before too long.

												It has been a while since i played any game with such enjoyment. Bright example that you don't need $500 million budget to make a great game. It's something like first person view RPG metroidvania. Great level design, it's really interesting and addictive to explore the island. The puzzles are really challenging. For the price - must have game.There are some downsides, like hidden button wall scanning, backtracking to crystals, bogus riddles (rock, paper, scissors, who knew...). But it's nothing compared to game's bright sides.			"

												So now I've played through Legend of Grimrock 2! After I already like the first part (my review here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/alQamar/recommended/207170/ )The second one superseeded my expectations and I really hope that the devs will make a third one, even more shiny and polished as this one. I have to say that this game was a lot of fun and the puzzles are really really challenging, some were even too absurd to be figured out without the understanding of hints or things you even may have forgotten over time in the game. Youtube was especially ""RPGDivision"" was a great help here. He helped me many times when I already gave up solving the puzzle my own. Given I spent nearly 70 hours on normal difficulty you can imagine what kind of a work it was, to solve them.This game has still drawbacks and I have to start with them first:-> Earth magic is near to useless, spells are weak and it takes much skillpoints to get them, on top of that many monsters are resistent to poision or at least not as often vulnerable as to fire or other magic schools.-> the music is much better as in the first part, and often I even had goosebumps and felt fear. But even though every level has an own ""soundtrack"" it becomes repetitive. It would be a great addition if the music would be tense or dynamic regarding the situation.-> The final fight against the Island master is horrific. I've slain the dragon quite easy but then all the new diversity brought into the game how you can skill characters is rendered useless if you want to defeat the Island Master. It is all about HP, DMG and best elemental resistance at the end. It is a must to have strong built party, with certain equipment and spells etc to stand this last fight. It find it very very sad that this final boss is actually so hard to be defeated, if you have not chosen an ""ideal"" party. During the game you can compensate any lacks but speed or exploiting monsters, but this boss will tear you apart if you are not properly equipped and skilled, so the diversity is simply not useful at the end.-> All Ingridients, except blooddrop cap (healing) and crystal flower (skillpoints) are very plenty so on normal difficulty I was too savy using them.On the positive account I see:-> a great well thought story-> very very challenging puzzles-> very good diversity in graphics, character building (with limitations) and monsters-> much better music-> great levels and landscape and lovely details-> an intro and end scenes makes more rich, what you missed in Grimrock 1. -> it is good that there are enough keys to unlock quite all gold caches and chests, but you need to be careful to find them all-> because of the higher environmental and graphical diversity ""secrets"" are much more hard to find as in Grimrock 1-> Workshop (Modding) supportI hope for Grimrock 3 very much and Grimrock 2, because of the few but major lacks deserves a 8/10 and a ""definitely worth a buy"" tag!Please like the review if you enjoyed the game as did and when you think this review is essential. Thank you very much! "

												This is too much of a good thing.The Grimrock games are grid-based first-person RPGs, with roots in classic table-top D&D.  Build 4 characters from a number of stats & specialties, start with no gear & explore an entire island of traps, monsters, dungeons & puzzles.The game, though fun, quite often feels overwhelming.  The open-ended exploration (until you're stopped or stumped by a puzzle or locked door) often leaves me at a loss as to where I'm supposed to go.The much more linear structure of the 1st Grimrock (moving progressively downward in one dungeon) was a lot more manegeable.The game is a lot of fun, but its greatest challenge isn't the combat, it's the tedium of re-treading the same steps over & over again.

												Grimrock 1 but bettererer. Instead of going down the same drab stanky hole theres an (more or less) lush overworld connecting multiple (differently themed) dungeons (stanky holes still to be had), so theres actual freeroaming exploration.Core gameplay remains the same, Might and Magic style grid based movement blob party. Pick up loots and solve puzzles. Combat still isnt that engaging unfortunately, guys at the front trade blows (if youre not dodging around), back row casts spells with an Arx Fatalis ""draw your spell"" magic system or shoots bows and guns - in some variation. Myst with Combat, the refined formula. Solid good fun, recommended.			"

												This game is so unique!  It is a dungeon crawler, but the entire game is a puzzle.  There are many instances where a puzzle may stump you and maybe an hour later or so it will click and you will beat it.  I have never felt more satisfied in playing a game other than the Pokemon series (lol) when a challenging puzzle is completed.  The puzzles are HARD.  Even with a guide sometimes it can be difficult to solve.  I almost recommend having a build that you would like to try by researching about it first and a walkthrough on hand just in case.  Other than that, this game will have you captivated from beginning to end.  9/10   After you complete the game it is very fun to walk around and find all of the secrets for achievements, although I have not done this for more than 2 hours so far.  I look forward to playing a new playthrough with a different party here very soon.    For party composition guides to begin playing this game make sure to google search ""party compositions steam guide grimrock 2.""  I hope this review helps somebody :)			"

												Look - I'm no newcomer to old-school dungeon crawlers. I have played and finished Dungeon Master 1 & 2, Eye of Beholder trilogy, Realms of Arkania trilogy, Lands of Lore, Wizardry 7... and of course Grimrock 1. Some of them were pretty challenging, especially W7 and DM2. Yet it was nothing compared to this game.The combat is not the biggest issue. It's quite hard and I have to admit I suck at real-time micromanaging everything - attacks, potions and spells while running around avoiding enemies and traps. But at least you can restart on easier difficulty.The biggest problem is the design of the puzzles. Especially in the second half the game starts to throw puzzle after puzzle at you, each more and more complex and cryptic. With extremely vague clues, sometimes with no hints at all.I don't think I've ever needed a walkthrough while playing Grimrock 1 but here I had to check it constantly. I mean, in the final area I wasn't able to solve a single puzzle! And after looking up the solutions I was pretty sure I would have never figured that out.EDIT: The first rule of good puzzle games is that they have to provide sufficient number of clues. So that I don't have to rely on guessing and brute force.This was also great - to access one of the maps you need to use a specific weapon located in a completely different map on the other side of the game. But the weapon is not marked as a quest item, it's just a standard staff. And because it sucks, I did the only logical thing - I threw it away somewhere. Imagine my surprise ten hours later when I discovered the staff is required to progress. I actually had to spawn it using a developer console to be able to continue.This could have been a great game like the first one. Instead it turned to be such frustrating experience I actually had to force myself to finish it.			"

Posted: December 18, 2015
												Let me just tell you first, Legend of Grimrock 1 was a game I really enjoyed, simply because it was fun and not too complicated. It didn`t cater to challenge the titans of the genre and I never expected it to, so I had a blast. I counted on Legend of Grimrock 2 to be of the same caliber, maybe a bit longer, maybe a bit more fancy looking. I counted wrong.  Shortly into my first game (on normal difficulty) there was this plant-boss. It could not be just danced around mindlessly. I certainly couldn`t just tank it with my four-human party. Already on the first level I had to learn to play this game not as the next easy-money follow-up, but as a new game. I was really caught off guard, but I still had no idea what was waiting up ahead. Next, I went through a phase of irritation as the game was wrong. Certainly you have been challenged as well, but when were you actually proven to be the one wrong? I wasn`t wrong, of course, at least not for a long time. Then I realized I was. The irritating game gas fun. A lot of fun. Now, for a breakdown of the goods and the bads of this game. Let`s do the bads first. BAD: How do I put this gently? The game has (almost) no story. There. Put. Not gently. There are no NPCs to interact with and the story, told through a few scrolls and wall-writings, is thin, very thin. Then there are the new mechanic of injury to bodyparts. Now this is one unnecessary annoyance added to the game that really is nothing other than a new condition (poison, disease, etc), that can hit any of your party members almost anytime throughout the game. Oh, there are plenty of ways to avoid it and cure it but FOCL, THIS is not fun, nor does it add to the experience. (Okay, I can see it have an impact on ironman and the number of potions available, but at least for me, this is a direct drawback.) The game is surprisingly hard even on normal mode. For me, this was overcomeable. However, if you do have a lot of trouble with the Viper-Roots, and the things beyond, there is no shame in starting over on Easy. You should ENJOY the game, not SUFFER through. The game is extremely puzzle oriented. Even on the main…uh…”story”. (I know what I said about story above, thank you!) Yep, puzzles are heavily a part of the main “story”-line. So much so that you may end up stuck on puzzles, unable to progress the game. As a former AD&D DM I do not quite like this approach. Puzzles (mostly) are for side-quests and bonus objectives, not for progressing the game. At the very least, answers or hints should be present for completing the main “story” line puzzles.  GOOD: The graphics are great. The outdoors are great. The underwaters are great. The beaches and forests are great and so on. Music and sound effects are also very good. Nice balance and composition. Take Medusa (or is it Gorgon) as an example. The scream that accompanies her petrifying attack is frightening enough to create a chill (thrill, even) without having the real Medusa in the living-room also cry out…. (I`m gonna be in a lotta trouble for this if she ever creates a Steam account….) The game is actually quite non-linear. And it works pretty well. It may be limited a bit by your play style, but really, this is a feature that is rather impressive in this genre of games.The game has a fantastic old-time grid-based game atmosphere. In LoG 1 you were meant to dodge and dance around your enemy to be able to overcome them. A great way to evolve the mechanics from the old-time grid-based games where this was often an exploit. In Log 2, the monsters have evolved to counter (partly) this strategy forcing YOU to evolve also. This also probably means LoG 2 isn`t the best starting point for newcomers to grid-based RPGs. I above claimed the puzzle-heavyness of this game to be a bad thing. I still mean that within the boundries set above. But after having consolidated myself with the fact that this game IS puzzle-heavy and that puzzles ARE a part of the main “story”-line, I learned to appreciate them. The designers of the puzzles of Legend of Grimrock 2 are geniuses. The depths of some of the puzzles are amazing. I mean, it`s one thing to appreciate the puzzle itself, but if you look at the process it must have been to PLAN these puzzles, your jaw should drop. If it doesn`t, well, if you can`t see it, just open your mouth and sit still until drool comes out and know that this is the right thing to do. There are some epic battles in this game, ones that really make you feel you`ve accomplished something when you overcome them. There are also some (nice? Hehe, lol) surprises that may or may not be avoided, depending on how well you explore. The game most certainly has a replayable value. I`ve done three runs (132 hours) so far and I may do another one, on easy, to breeze through. I love the game and there are some race/class combinations I still want to try. CONCLUSION: Is it the best game I`ve played? Is it the best grid-based RPG I`ve played? No and no. But the competition isn`t really fair. I`m a long-time fan of the Might & Magic series and I really doubt that any game will ever topple Might & Magic III - The Isle of Terra from my throne. The Might & Magic series has a long-running story that (imho) is really good. These are complicated games in vast worlds. So any one (or two) new games (in an old genre) can hardly ever compete with that for me. (NOTE that Might & Magix X is not included in my praise. I do not currently recommend that game.) However, Legend of Grimrock has at the very least made me make the comparison. Had LoG had the same depth of story, it would have had the last element (pun intended) to challenge the best grid-based RPGs of old. It will still go down in history as one of the obelisks of the genre. In my humble opinion, it is an 7/10, compared to ALL the grid-based games I`ve played (this includes the MMs, the Eye of the Beholder series, Lands of Lore, Ultima Underworld, Elder Scrolls, etc). Lack of story is the main reason it does not quite reach the top, but the annoyance of bodypart injuries also pull down a bit. All in all puzzle-design is so good it actually gives a plus to the game, even though I think there are too many puzzles in the main storyline. Non-linearity, nostalgia, atmosphere and replayability are also all good factors. The skill system is a bit simple and could certainly be improved, but it works and does not lower the quality of the game. I wholeheartedly recommend this game (and LoG 1). It`s a lot of game for the money. It is truly well designed. If you take it for what it is, you will have many hours of fun gameplay to look forward to. "

												The Legend of Grimrock 2 is the sequel to an award-winning hit series, and it just keeps getting better and better.  This series is the new king of dungeon crawlers with hours and hours of content to traverse through.  Similar to its predecessor, the story of LoG 2 is a bit on the lacking side, but is every bit made up for by the gameplay, character design, and intensive replay value.  By controlling a party of up to four, choosing from multiple races and classes, you can pick and choose the level of balance (or imbalance) you can have with your team members.  Between having a Human Battlemage, or a Ratling Alchemist, a Minotar Barbarian, or possibly an Insectoid Farmer (yes, farmer) if you like the trolling side, you can set up your party how you wish.A single playthrough of this game will easily take beyond 25 hours of gameplay, and that is if you are cruising through not looking for secrets and treasures.  There are puzzles galore, and many are extremely DIFFICULT puzzles that will challenge the most intellectual minds.  Most of these puzzles you will have never seen in any other video game, and some especially new in style to the LoG series.Beyond the extensive puzzle-solving, quick reflexes and a little bit of finger dexterity is needed in this game to survive, especially if you enjoy playing on all of the hardest difficulty settings the game offers you at the start like I have.  LoG 2 offers three difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard), Ironman mode, which allows saving only at health crystals, and Single-use Health Crystals mode, where you are only able to use the crystals once.  On top of all that, they brought back Old-School Mode back, which takes away your trusty map, leaving you in the dust with nothing but your compass (if you find one) and pencils and graph paper.The layout of the game is fantastic, as it starts you on the shore of a beach, and the environment takes you into swamps, dens, lairs, catacombs, pyramids, jungles, etc...there is a wide array of refreshing map tiles that will keep you entertained, if not perhaps somewhat confused and lost.  Keep your eyes open, though, and look for levers, hidden buttons and switches, and traps everywhere.This game can be very taxing on the mind and body, but does wonders for the soul.  If you like dungeon crawlers, this is the BEST in the genre, and is worth the money.I rate this game a 9.6 out of 10.			"

												A couple of years ago I could compare Legend of Grimrock to Eye of the Beholder, only with more customization and gorgeous visuals.Today I can easily compare Legend of Grimrock 2 to Eye of the Beholder 2: The Legend of Darkmoon. The comparison stands, and guys from Almost Human truly deliver a masterpiece which would make its predecessors proud.It's almost like it is nineties again, when my party members explored the vast temple of Darkmoon. Only it's 2014, and I'm totally immersed in the atmosphere of the island of Nex and its lush vistas and deep dungeons.Truly, worth every penny and then some more.Not going to list pros and cons, little things don't matter in this grand adventure.

												Legend of Grimrock was a great game. They took an old genre and recreated it just about flawlessly. With Grimrock II they went and pushed that genre to a whole new place. If you're not into the dungeon crawling, cryptic puzzle solving kind of thing then this game won't change your mind. It is hard, it requires you to think and to pay attention. However if you are into that kind of thing then this is the absolute best it gets.Game play is fantastic. The visuals are diverse and interesting. Great sound design. If you're reading this because you are on the fence then here is the answer: if you like GR1 then buy this game. If you think you might be interested in the genre then buy this game. If you're a fan of RPGs buy this game. If you want a challenge buy this game. This is on par with all of my favorite RPGs of all time.			"

After finishing I just wanted to start again and keep on playing. Can't remember the last time I wanted to do that with a game.The gameplay works smoothly and I never encountered any bugs. Some of the puzzles can be pretty hard, but with some out of the box thinking and careful scanning of walls and looking around they can all be solved.Buy this game, you won't regret it!			"

Product received for free
												This game brought me back to my early years playing games like Wizardry VII and Might and Magic World of Xeen.  But this is an evolution of those games.  It uses a real-time combat system that takes a bit of getting used to.  It actually is pretty fun and does require a certain skill to master.The atmosphere is great in this game.  And I really liked how this improved on the first game by providing a much bigger world to explore.  It also was somewhat non-linear.  It gave you a bit of freedom to explore the zones in any order.  I actually missed an entire zone but still finished the game.I highly recommend this game if you like the classic crpgs.  But be prepared for the real-time combat system.  It can be a bit challenging - especially fighting the various bosses.			"

												Absolutely a worthy follow-up to the amazing reboot of the old style dungeon crawler that was Grimrock I. A few new elements, some new functions with alchemy and optional use of guns. They've made it work both in dungeons and outside which is really cool. The square-walking fighting system has been enhanced a bit so that it isn't just enough to sidestep and hit over and over anymore. Some monsters will jump behind you, some will hit to the side if you sidestep them to their sword-arm side. Little things like that. Still, the main objective remains the same: don't ever get surrounded.Only negative point at all is that a few of the puzzles sometimes seem a bit too far out, so to speak. And they can be a bit annoying more than clever but it's very rare. Usually, you can work the solution out from clues and all together the balance between too difficult and difficult enough is accurately struck.The game ending seems to lead to the next game in the series and so it can feel a bit unfinished, perhaps. The final boss fight comes a bit out of nowhere, it feels, but it's actually a good boss fight. It's tough, sure, but it's not just about learning all the mechanics from replaying it 100 times, it's actually just about fighting well. So all in all, a very nice game. Into RPG? Buy it, simple as that.			"

												A great successor to an already classic RPG legend, bigger and better in almost every regard, 9/10!Less linear this time, but with all you love: hard monster battles, tough riddles and puzzles (now with treasure chests to dig out using clues you find), many out-door areas, and many secrets and secret buttons to find. The music in the game menu makes you feel like a hero, and once you solve most of the clever puzzles, you will feel satisfied!What I did not like was a particular riddle, which seemed like an optional puzzle, but turned out to contain an item which would open a dungeon as big as 1/5th of the whole game! This is an aboslute no-go! Also, I still think, like for part1, that a few more exp-levels (e.g. 20 instead of the ca. 14) would make it better and more rewarding... like its now, you need to limit yourself greatly in what you can skill and what not. And for some puzzles, a few more hints would have been nice.In summary, the new primus of classical RPGs, highly recommended!			"

												Confession: When I play a computer rpg I expect to have to take notes and solve puzzles. Any game lacking this feels like it is holding my hand. Grimrock 2 is a boon to older gamers wanting some nostalgia and a challenge. The budget went up from the first game and now the player can enjoy outdoor environments, expanded level editor, a lovely cinematic intro, and more.This is a massive improvement on the already great first game.

												Very fun and involving. I would say this is a great improvement and addition to the first game. The combat improvements are especially nice (The spells are much easier to cast). Something I really enjoy about these games (Grim I and II) is the unconventional puzzle solving mechanics, which really test your problem solving skills. Curiousity and dedication are highly rewarded, which makes you feel awesome when you solve a really hard puzzle all on your own! Good game that keeps you interested. I will say that the free roaming aspect makes the game a little tough because you have to choose based on no prior knowledge to the map in the main quest. It does make it more interesting than a linear game, but it also makes it tough to make decisions. Very good game, I would rate it 8/10 (which is very high for me!).			"

												I've put nearly 42 hours into this game over the course of under a week. Grimrock 1 was a really good modernization of the dungeon crawler that I didn't realize I had been missing. Grimrock 2 is possibly the best game I've played this year, which is drawing to a close at the time of writing.The game is gorgeous. A lot of fans of the first were put off by the game being even partly outdoors, but there are a lot of touches that disguise the grid-based nature of the game, like uneven sands and the like. I never looked at the game and thought 'Now this here doesn't look good.'Gameplay is much improved from the first. Gone are the days of circle-strafing around every enemy and cheesing the game. Most enemies function in unique ways and require different tactics to approach... I mean, some of them can be circle-strafed, but it's not a reliable tactic for all of them this time, which I appreciate. But I digress, the biggest improvement comes from game feel in a lot of regards. A major boon that you didn't even know you wanted is that each party member has dual weapon slots ala Diablo 2, so you can switch between gear on the fly without having to pull up a menu every time. Additionally, character selection has variety now. Gone are the 3 classes to go with your 4 party members, as there are a whopping 8 classes to choose from, ranging from nearly essential to wonderfully bizarre. Variety is the spice of life and, honestly, Grimrock 1 was sorely lacking in this regard.tl;dr Grimrock 1 was good, Grimrock 2 is one of the better games I've ever played. Now if you'll excuse me I have a second campaign to start.			"

												If I could play this game until the end I would like it even better, but as it is I've had tremendous fun playing it. It's easily the best game I've played in a long time.Right from the beginning the game piques your curiosity, you're constantly wondering what might be around the next corner. There's little hand holding, you have to figure things out for yourself which makes the game so much more suspenseful and immersive. There's puzzles and secrets and cryptic messages, trapdoors, hidden buttons, treasures and ominous sounds everywhere. Creepy creatures and annoying and hilarious ones.The riddles and puzzles are just challenging enough to make you feel really clever when you solve them. The mazes seem to expand forever. The game is gloriously long!A warning: if combat is not your strong point, play the game on ""easy"". Trust me, even then it won't be particularly easy. Especially not the boss fights near the end.There are safety nets all over: save gems, quicksave, resurrection potions and such. You will not easily get stuck, as long if you persevere.			"

												Finally, a videogame sequel that actually improves upon an already good game rather than just charging gamers for a glitch filled half-thought-out copycat of the last installment!! The puzzles are interesting but not unsolvable, the creature are fun to fight. And the game is challenging enough to keep it entertaining and includes several new added outdoor environments and day/night lighting effects that look great for an Indie Developer. The Grimrock series does it right and revived the old-school dungeon crawl series with more modern finesse and graphics. Don’t expect to have to put hundreds of hours into this one, but in my opinion Legend of Grimrock II is one of the few sequel games on the market right now that delivers what’s promised. Well worth the money compared to most others! Can't wait for number 3!!!			"

If you enjoyed the NWSE step-based movement, real time combat, dungeons, and graphics of LoG1 you should enjoy LoG2 just as well because it is largely more of the same.I thought LoG1 was excellent and was happy get another 90 hours of LoG goodness playing through Lo♥♥♥♥ couple of times with some different party combinations including the new Farmer class.9/10			"

But don't worry, all the puzzles and secret switches are still there to keep you staring at walls for hours.Some details:Updated graphics and environments. This game is super pretty. Come out of the dungeon and adventure outdoors in deep forests, shoreline caves, and other beautifully detailed areas.Weapon and weapon skills redesigned. Weapon skills are now Light, Heavy, Missile, Thrown, and Firearms, so melee characters are less restricted by skill choice. Weapons now have special attacks built into them, which must be activated and use energy.More flexible character creation, with eight classes and five races. Skills are no longer tied to class, so any class can learn any skills. Racial bonuses redesigned to be less obviously fit for particular classes.  Classes and races grant bonuses that can be built upon with skill and trait choices.Smarter enemies for tougher, more engaging combat. No more easily dancing around enemies, as most enemies have the ability to attack to their side while turning to face you. In general enemies are quicker to attack and more often have special moves.			"

												Im writing this because this series doesnt get anywhere near enough recognition. I bought bouth games on a whim during a sale, because I like old school PC stuff, love RPG's, and remember seeing Notch (yes creator of Minecraft Notch) rave about these on twitter, and saw a video done by LGR.Now I can be slow with old school RPG's, I tend to lose interest after a couple days and it takes several spaced out sessions for me to get around to completing them, while I player other games in between. Not these, I was hooked, I had to find the secrets, I had to get farther, I had to finish these games.The title music for both games were some of my favorite tracks, ever. I went into Legend of Grimrock 2 wondering if they could even compete with the first games title track, and they matched, if not surpassed it.The controls are tight, the biggest problem with classic PC games is getting used to the incredibly dated controls from a  era where jump being ""J"" made sense, and if you were to watch a video Grimrock looks like its a clunky mess like those classics, but its not the case, the controls are perfectly conducive to the intended gameplay.If you enjoy RPG's at all, then do not hesitate and buy both of these games, they are worth any price and you will not be disapointed. This series deserves to be regarded as some of the best games of all time, with other greats, but instead it seems they fly just beneath the radar for far too many.			"

												They say more of a good thing is still a good thing.  I can attest to that, it's true.  Legend of Grimrock was basically an Eye of the Beholder clone, even down to its puzzles and annoying spiders, i.e. a dungeon that started out rather bland and simple, but got progressively more difficult and challenging, as well as varied, as you descended towards the boss fight.  Eye of the Beholder II had expanded on that formula by allowing you to experience a greater variety of locations, monsters and puzzles.  Legend of Grimrock does the same - it's basically the same game with a large and expansive outdoor hub, multiple dungeons and buildings to explore, the ability to have multiple floors in a single level, a broader selection of monsters and even more mind bending puzzles.  There are changes to the game as well: a new race and some new classes have been added, the leveling system has been tweaked to be less all or nothing, skill branches are less deep, weapons and armor have been categorized into broad proficiencies, alchemy has been added and magic has been reworked.  But ultimately, it's the same game, just bigger and better.   Get it.  It's great.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played in my life, the game is not focused in combat or cinematographic scenes, but in the puzzles and combat, there aren't NPCs or guides to teach how to play or solve the puzzles, they are not hard, they just need you to think outside the box, and many of them are mind blowing. The graphics are very good, but not heavy and can easily run in cheap PCs. The combat is solid and strategic, you can't just smash a button, but they are also not hard, the enemies have weakness and it's up to you find them.In the game you will find many notes with hints for puzzles or hidden secrets, keep them in bag because you might need them in the future. You will find yourself thinking about the game while not playing, reminded me the old days when you spent time thinking about that one secret of Zelda.Pros:- The best puzzles I've ever solved.- Very intelligent secrets.- Ideal difficulty.- Balanced and strategic combat.- Good graphics.- Not linear.Cons:- There isn't much of story.- No NPCs to dialogue with.- You can get stuck very often because you threw a item away.It's a fantastic experience, following a guide or not. Definitely worth the time and price.			"

Legend of Grimrock 2 takes only the strong and healthy roots from the RPG-past and nourishes them to grow into something utterly fun and motivating. A clever modernization that swings the once bumpy genre into todays comfort zone, a challenging difficulty and a huge world map with a crazy amount of details not only make Grimrock 2 a much better game than it´s predecessor, it´s also one of the best RPG-experiences you´ll have this year.

												Modern version of a classic tile-based dungeon crawl. Lots of puzzles, fights, tricks and traps. Reasonably challenging even on normal settings, assuming you don't go running to the internets for strats and spoilers at the drop of a hat. The combat mechanics themselves are a little on the weak side, and the story and setting are a little on the contrived side, but over I enjoyed it immensely.			"

												I may update this review after completing the game, but after 12 hours into it, I feel that my review can do justice to it's greatness.- The puzzles are challenging- The battles are challeging, but like the puzzles, are won by using your brain, not by rushing into the enemy.- The game is long (took me 10h to beat the 2nd boss).- The visuals are great, especially outdoors.- The outdoor dungeons and hubs really add more immersion in conparison to the first game.- The classes feel balanced and every level on a skill makes a difference.- It's good to LOOK CAREFULLY EACH WALL YOU PASS BY, and this may be an annoyance to some people, but I found that rewarding, because of the great number of secrets (and traps too).No doubt, my GOTY so far. Not kidding.			"

												Anything positive that I had to say about the first game has been outdone by Grimrock 2.  I'm currently 14 hours in, and I'm having a blast.  If you've never played the first, you owe it to yourself to do so if you are a classic RPG fan.  I don't even mean RPGs with this style of grid-based movement, I mean RPGs like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate.  I never got into the oldschool games like Eye of the Beholder because they were too abusive, and I didn't have the patience back then.  Grimrock respects you and lets you have some breathers after those tough and costly battles.  Grimrock also handles its hunger system well, because you will never die from starvation, you just lose you ability to self heal.  My only real nit-pick right now is that the puzzles have been a bit on the easy side.  Grimrock 1 had some of the best puzzles I've seen in a game, where they made you feel smart for figuring out the vague hints they gave you (like the Checkered Room).  Grimrock 2 just hasn't had those kind of puzzles yet.  Maybe I need to get in further, but even if I never get what I'm looking for, I don't mind.  I'm already planning my party for my second playthrough.			"

												If you've played Legend of Grimrock and you enjoyed that, this game is more of the same. I had that figured out from around a quarter into the game and it didn't exactly fail to meet my expectations. There's not enough innovation really, that I can say this is a successful sequel and not just full priced DLC, and many of the things that were wrong with the first game are still wrong with this one. But it was a good formula to begin with and I didn't exactly get tired of it, I finished the game. I got the secret ending. So I guess I like it. Sooo... Yeah. Thumbs up. Sure.			"

												Better in every way than the first game and especially in combat, this is a must get for any Dungeon Crawler fan. The only things that lets this game down is when it makes assumptions about party composition (you do need someone good at ranged/magic for one particular puzzle, so all fighter or rogue parties that use melee weapons are not a great idea even though the character creation would let you build them) and the final boss fight, which is not as bad as what the first game provided in this area. This is definitely one of the best dungeon crawlers and I would highly recommend it.			"

												In many ways it’s even better than the first. There’s a big Dark Souls inspiration to its intricate world, filled with secrets and understated lore. Many games of this genre, most particularly Dungeon Master 2, didn’t make the smoothest transition to an open world/overland structure. In this game it works extremely well.The level design is fantastic, and so it the general feel of the game. The only aspect in this game which might be slight inferior to its prequel is the puzzles. They don’t feel as focused, and sometimes they’re a bit aimless and in a couple of occasions I was forced to check an walkthrough, which was something that never happened in the first game. "

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is an absolute upgrade from the original. More fun puzzles, more fun combat, more fun classes, more fun everything and more interesting areas to explore, too.  The only things you can complain about are the parts they DIDN'T change, the game still suffers from some poor balance choices in places, including some that carried over from the original(Earth Magic is STILL absolutely useless).On the other hand, I'd feel somewhat less annoyed at starting over in LoG2 due to a poor party than I would in LoG1, because the game feels like less of an outright struggle to get through. Not that there aren't still challenges, but all of the challenges are FUN this time around.There are also only respawning monsters in the overworld areas, which makes the game, frankly put, a whole lot less annoying.

												I was a fan of the first game. This sequel is much the same, with a lot of clever puzzles, hidden secrets, and a grid based movement and combat system. Unfortunately, while the island setting is far more vibrant and interesting than a volcano dungeon, it is also has its drawbacks. The map is sprawling and sandboxy, and your goal is to wander around to find generic gems, this has led to a tragic loss of direction and progression and so it never feels like you are moving forward.Overall a good game, but just keep in mind that it is really just a puzzle game. If you loved the first game, you'll also like this one.			"

												To make it short: did you like Grimrock 1? Then do not think further, Grimrock 2 is 1000% way better, buy it and enjoy.For those who do not know Grimrock: oldschool orthogonal RPG, traditional dungeon crawling, puzzles and enigmas, all with beautiful graphics. Imagine Skyrim without the free movements or the open world or the missions or the dialogues or... well OK don't, it doesn't sound so great said like that... both games are different but great!Do you remember Lands of Lore, Eye of the Beholder and such oldies? Well compared to Grimrock 1 who stayed very classic and a bit too repetitive (only one dungeon), Grimrock 2 is now much closer to Lands of Lore than ever. The world is huge, the items and dungeons too, the puzzles are still very hard and the difficulty sometimes crazy... so I am really looking forward to the third one, with I hope villages, dialogues, shops and more...I spent more than 70 hours in the game, and I have not found every secret or object. That's how long and huge it is.This is a really really great game that I DO recommend!			"

												Well...LG2 is better than LG1 in many ways (better combat, classes, races, traps etc.), it is truly a worthy predecesor of the first one. I really recommended to buy it, if you liked the first one or any old school dungeon crawler that it doesn't rely heavy on action or arcade rpg. It seems that we are going the same way like LG1 - the main story is beeing transformed in a tutorial, compared with those custom fan made stories you see on nexus or workshop; now that's a good thing and better than a ""new game plus"" option. However, there are some stupid developer choices that we could had gone without :1. NO MORE UNARMED COMBAT - c'mon that was great in LG1 2. Many classes but not so many combat styles level up perks - no light weapon + shield, no heavy weapon + lw/dagger/throwing weapon ( yet you carry and parry easy with a tower shield table for 4 type), no 2 daggers sneaky assassin combat (in the end when you max out dual and play with 2 swords and I felt like a diablo 3 dual wielding barbarian); these kid of styles  don't benefit from anything.3. No elemental dmg  added by your mage on arrows - to be honest I was expecting your mage ( depending on his class of magic) to arcane boost any type of weapons ( not just arrows like in LG1) and recharge fire swords etc.4. Not so convincing magic - I barely kill something with a shower of 6 fireballs ( the most powerful spell in the game, that eats my mana pool like no tomorrow), feels like an AK-47 with gum balls instead of bullets.5. Main story doesn't have enough elemental foes, booring diversity6. Battlemage feels clunky, since we don't have a ""remember my last spell"" hand slot, using magic and a weapon in the same time is too complicated, where combat LG2 easy is harder that combat LG1 hard 7. Not everybody has the patience for clueless easter item hunt ( praise the walkthrough)So 8-9 out of 10 for this one			"

												It may sound counter-intuitive and contradictory by its nature, but this is a square-based open world game. Of course it is not “Skyrim”-like open world, but you actually can go wherever you like, do there whatever you want, and you do not need 100% completion to see the end titles. Of course, the game is still square-based, you can’t expect to be able to put basket on someone’s head, actually there are no NPCs at all, it is still a dungeon crawler. And of course completing 100% percent of the game gives you more immersion into the world and story.What I personally really like is limitations the mechanics make you work around, tactics you should learn and skills you acquire (to never need them again naturally!). What I disliked is the no problem of throwing away an item you’re going to need later without knowing it and without an easy way to find it later. Role playing system of the game is massively reworked in comparison to the first instalment, so one may need a couple of test runs to decide which party to go with. The world looks astonishing. And yes, secrets in the game are mostly very satisfying, though some can be really difficult to get. That is actually the main reason to play it.			"

												This is the only modern game I know of that managed to capture the essence of classic old school RPG's like Black Crypt or Dungeon Master that I loved playing so much as a kid! And it improved upon it significantly!The gameplay, immersion and atmosphere are all great, even though movement is square-based and limited to 90-degree angles (which can be off-putting to kids used to today's cinematic animation and take-you-by-the-hand gameplay, hence the few negative reviews). The game on normal actually is rather difficult, but nothing you can't overcome if you develop your party reasonably and explore the world carefully making full use of the automap. You just need to skim through some guides first to make informed decisions on how to create a party and allocate skill points.			"

Disclaimer: this review is full of sarcasm and irony. Just as always.Score out of 10:Graphics: 9.2, again pretty good graphics for such genre. Designer and artists did their job - game is pleasant to watch.Game engine: 9.9, engine is one of the best in genre so far. Almost bug free. Modding tools / Workshop integration are included. Not ten for small details that require polish. Especially in sense of controls - it is real-time action game, but you are restricted to discrete movement steps. Long story short - you cannot cancel your move order after button press. Thats not the end, but you should play to know how not-so-obvious sometimes game is.Game mechanics: 9.0, its not ten, because game itself is just an example of what you can do with the engine, and if you are not Modder you will never learn whole potential. I can call LoG2 campaign (Story mod) without Skirmish\Free roam\Challenges stuff from Devs. And guess what? There just so much (not used)pottential to be exploited (Workshop items FTW) that I cannot grade it with shiny Ten. Engine allows far more fun things than was used in main campaign. Different ammo type for same weapons, spells, potions and so on, game content is not full. And it is not 9.5 just because the only game type (story mod) is not balanced enough. Just open Guides section and check any party creation guide to learn how silly are humanZ (race) and wizZardZ (class), and how small is the number of optimal strategies. 9.1 score not achieved because game has no option on start (like Ironman and Old-School map) that champion dies when his starvation counter reaches the end.Game addiction: 10.0, finally ten! Perfect. Started to play immediately on Hard - was punished for that (heavily), but didn't give up. Thats a sort of addiction! Seriously, this game is so awesome that I lost decent part of my sleep-time.Gameplay: 9.1, again, almost perfect. It could be next-to-AWESOME if the Game used its potential on full scale. And to be a really AWESOME LoG2 needs some more mechanics. I understand, that quests and NPC are not the LoG way, but somehow game misses non-combat and non-puzzle elements. Something you may want to do in between. This may be a rival parties of NPC adventurers, for example. First making through the hard puzzle-filled maze, and then later standing somewhere on higher ground and watching NPC dying to the monsters. Or even pulling a lever to trigger some trap on them. So much fun could be added if you can see the world through the eye of oppenent. TOTAL: 9.5 First of all, buy this game. Secondly, well, you can play it if you feel like this.I'm pretty happy that old-forgotten genre is back. M&MX and LoG are definetely most well known titles here, but I saw many other early access or upcoming or even already released First-person RPGs. I just wish for Wizardry 8 modern remake. And Meridian 59. May be for latter more, but steam is full of free-mmo's so there is no selling point for now.Legend of Grimrock 2 is perfect example of how sequel should look like. It is also a perfect successor to the genre itself. It is punishing but nevertheless entertaining experience.Best regards,Hypnotoad the Lizardmen farmer with Canon. "

												The sequel to the critically acclaimed Legend of Grimrock brings back the old formula of grid-based dungeoneering with a party of four. This time around you are on an island and the game's levels are split between the overworld and subterranean areas filled with a variety of monsters and treasure. There are also night-day cycles which will effect your visibility and also certain puzzles. Most of the storyline revolves around you finding power gems and you will need to get every single one if you want to get the secret ending which means A LOT of exploring. The new classes add a little flair to the game but most are weaker than the ones used in Grimrock 1 (especially the farmer which is a joke class at best). I didn't care for the injury system which mostly serves as a means to force the player to either backtrack to a save crystal or waste healing potions as some of the injuries can make a character completely useless or cripple the party's speed. Also a couple of the puzzles were downright cryptic with hints like ""over and over and under"" when it really meant ""go in a circular loop around one part of the bridge, then the other part, then back and forth."" Were people really supposed to be able to figure this out on their own? (besides through trial and error?). Also the optional secret boss was a huge unexpected difficulty spike although I manged to figure out a way to cheese him. Other than that, Grimrock 2 is a pretty solid sequel and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first game.			"

												In the past few years, I’ve tried several party-based RPGs which were developed by Indie companies and marketed as “old-school”. Unfortunately, these games were held back by clunky/unintuitive interfaces and skill systems, or did not run smoothly despite decent computer specs. Legend of Grimrock 2, on the other hand, is old-school nostalgia done RIGHT. Easily my most-loved game of 2014 (unless something crazy happens in December), Legend of Grimrock 2 is one of the most immersive, challenging and rewarding games I have played.Gameplay feels very crisp and intuitive. It’s an amazing feeling, to tentatively stick your head out from behind a dark corner, wondering whether that giant Rat-man dressed as a pirate is going to one-shot your squishy party members with his enormous hand cannon. It’s an amazing feeling, to finally put together a bunch of vague clues scribbled on parchment paper, locating a hidden treasure chest containing epic phat loots – and distributing this loot amongst my fully customized party of 4, each with their own distinct fighting styles and weapon/magic inclinations.There’s a good balance between combat, puzzle solving and exploration in Legend of Grimrock 2, and for me most of the puzzles were difficult, but that’s what made playing this game feel so rewarding. I often found myself saying “I’ll just explore one more area before I quit!” – and that didn’t work out too well. The developers did a fantastic job with level and sound design -- exploring the Laboratory for the first time actually made me very frightened. It’s a game that totally gets you in the zone and allows your imagination to run wild, and I appreciate that.My thoughts comparing Legend of Grimrock 1 & 2: The first game was a fun, linear dungeon crawler with a rather repetitive environment. Legend of Grimrock 2 is a much larger epic adventure across many different (but always beautiful) environments, both indoors and outdoors. The combat in both games aren’t the strongest selling point – in fact, it feels rather cheesy to constantly “run in circles” around monsters on hard difficulty (as facing them directly would be too dangerous). That said, both games are very high quality in terms of puzzles, atmosphere and exploration, but if you’re on a gaming budget and can only purchase one game at the moment, you may want to play Legend of Grimrock 1 if you prefer a more linear, focused adventure. There was quite a bit of ""wandering-around-lost"" downtime for me in Legend of Grimrock 2 compared to Legend of Grimrock 1, but it didn’t bother me that much. However, I can understand that if you have limited time to play, you may be looking for an adventuring experience that feels more cohesive – in that case, buy the first game.I’m pretty close to completing Legend of Grimrock 2 and I’m a little sad. I’ll stress again what I said at the beginning -- Legend of Grimrock 2 is old-school nostalgia done RIGHT.			"

												The legend of Grimrock had given a second life to the first person tile-based dungeon crawlers. The legend of Grimrock II has done it again for me. The game already feels ""bigger"" as you explore, not just a dungeon like in the previous one, but the island of Nex, which is filled with a multitude of dungeons.If you liked the first game, you will definetely love this one! I clearly recommand this game, which puts even more place to the ""exploration"" part with outside areas, and more dungeons, as well as a lot of secrets to find.In term of content, the game already puts the bar higher than its predecessor, giving old items from grimrock, but also a lot of brand new items, which would probably remind of old school games from the 80's-90's, like notably a wodden staff, or also a sling. There are brand new monsters, as well as some from the previous game (According to the website, 44 monsters with 12 from the previous game), and the game feels fresh due to this.Also, the biggest change in the game is its beauty, as you travel outside, you get to see some marvelous areas, which is better than the 3 area types we see in mount grimrock.In term of gameplay and difficulty, the game proposes 7 classes and 5 races (1 being new), which is more than its predecessor. The skill system is different though, proposing less perk levels (5 for each) but only 1 skill point per level. Also there is now a ""local damage"" system, which can prevent you from using a weapon slot, or make you slower, prevent your health or energy to come back up, ect, ect... And most notably for the adventurers who want the hardest challenges, they can set life crystals to be usable only once, and/ or to be the only way to save the game.In any case, I would say this game simply blows, and, being much more complete than its predecessor, should have an even longer life thanks to the dungeon editor, and the creativity of the community.

												If you liked the first one, you'll probably like the second one. It's got all the good stuff (beautiful environments, great atmosphere, sound effects and music) Lots of items, very hard choices about upgrading your characters stats and equipment. Everything is a trade-off and that's good.It is much bigger and at times I felt lost. It is not a straight drill to the bottom of a dungeon campaign. There are multiple outdoor environments and you are almost free to roam anywhere. I did have to turn to a forum for guidance a few times.I hope to see this become a trilogy! If they keep building on this engine  and add NPCs, shops and quests, we might get someone to finally remake Ultima Underworld as a mod. Good job guys! "

												I love this game.  I love it very much.  Not everyone will love it, but it's not the sort of game that cares about those folks.  It's a reasonably challenging game with some of the most respectable riddles of any RPG I've ever played.  The combat is great, definitely more polished over the first game and strikes a nice balance between rewarding strategy, improvisation, and speed.  The world is nicely fleshed out with lots of attention to detail.  The designs are not extravagent or particularly novel, but they're not meant to be.  This is a classic fantasy game in many respects.But the core of why I love Legend of Grimrock is really how much it respects the intelligence of the player.  It expects you to use your brain, and it rewards you for paying attention.  It has some flaws with minor mechanics - but nothing that will plague your game experience.  As a whole, it's just a satisfying 20 hours.			"

												Did you play dungeon crawlers on your windows 98 on them sick♥♥♥♥♥floppy disks?! Guess what ♥♥♥♥♥es! It's got an upgrade.Serious note: the game is great same as the 1st. The monsters are great and even better with the 2nd. The puzzles are aggravating same as the 1st. (I'm not a smart guy so the later puzzles were a pain). I combat is still the same but then again how can you switch up a tile base game.All together this game is great. You don't need to play the 1st one to know whats going on because it 2 different stories. (Unless you want your 4 characters to be the most unfortunate people on the planet) the game is solid (so far) I have yet to encounter and bugs, errors, or glitches. If you want your money's worth of entertainment this series will give it to you.			"

												I enjoyed both Grimrock 1 and 2.  Some people find Grimrock 2 a bit too open world, but I didn't really think it was that much more open than 1.  Sure, there are a few areas that you can do in different orders, but it's still not really an open world game.I do think that the dungeon style of Grimrock 1 is a bit more in line with these types of games, but I didn't really think that the few outside areas in 2 took away from that.  If I had a complaint it's probably that the game could have used a touch more balance.  What I mean by that is some areas felt much more challenging than others.  But, really, it's not a major issue.  If you like old school Eye of the Beholder style RPGs, or enjoy puzzle types games (because that has a very strong puzzle element) with RPG/levelling mechanics, then I recommend giving this game a try.

												Abosolutely wonderful game. Challenging, puzzles galore, exploration, regret, and a final fight i am not going to forget. A wonderful simplistic system of old school brought into a massive location with loads of enemies and tons of items to play with. This game really is the closest to perfect with its graphics, gameplay, simplistic story, and quite honesty easily replayable. At my steady pace it took 50 hours and i enjoyed every bit of it.The only real sour taste was 1 or 2 puzzles that made little to no sense even with the answers present.			"

												TLDR: Quality tile based movement dungeon crawler in the vein of the classic Dungeon Master. Focus heavily on puzzles solving, finding secret passage and real time combat. You might not lke it if you are looking for an elaborate story or rich character development. Recommended.This is a true inheritor of the classic Dungeon Master. The game probablyoffers  the widest range of puzzles, and traps in the genre, they will challenge your mind and sometimes your dexterity as well.The other charateristic feature, is 3D tiled real time combat. Although you move in ""step, tile by tile, and you only have a 90°-120° view, this is a real 3D engine. monsters don't stop while you think or search your inventory, it's all in real time, and you'd better make quick decisions. Monsters behaviors are more elaborate than usual, and even late in the game combats are challenging, and you'll never feel OP.On the other hand character development is pretty basic, you'll be around level 15 by game's end and you merely assign 1 skill point each level. You manage a party of 4 adventurers, but options are nothing close to Baldur or Wizardry.There is a plot, your group ran ageound on a lost island and looks for a way to escape. But the game is not about storytelling or fulilling side quests or anything like that. Just about progressing on the main line, although the levels are accesible in various order.The game is not exactly hardcore, but still on many occasion it is rather hard.Production is good, and in this speicifc genre this is a very good game.

												I haven't finished the game yet, amazing improvment since the first one. I got bored in the first one cause everything is the same. in this one, you got an insane amounth of variaty and i'm taking some of these puzzle as a DM of DND, it's a really great game, challenging, yet far from impossible. some of the enemy require you to reposition yourself multiple time. The worst part of the game are the crabs, cause for some reason they are stronger then any kind of elemental. (that might be because of my composotion made out of mage and peasan, but still, if he get one hit on my character they get oblitarate.If you are a DM or want to be one, this game got a♥♥♥♥♥♥tones of good puzzle. It's showing you how to create you're own as well, because you don't want the puzzle to be to hard or too ez. I hope a third opus come out in the next 2 years, because I would buy it. I would be expecting some kind of city that hire you to explore multiple donjon. like underwater donjon or sky donjon and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that.			"

												What a fantastic sequel! The fans could not have asked for more. The graphics, the various levels and environments, the music, the atmosphere, the UI, underwater adventures, etc. -- everything is brilliant.Only downside: even at normal difficulty, some levels/oppenents are just crazy difficult to master. I never made as much use of the console in LoG1 in order to spawn items that would assist my group like I did in LoG2 -- be it to buff my team with potions, get them better armor early on or to level their skills and attributes up so they would stand a chance. This can really spoil the fun, but after dozens of reloads it can become a necessity, unless you want to punch a hole into the wall from sheer frustration. ;)			"

												This game is really good. BUT, one thing you should definitely keep in mind is the late game is incredibly puzzle heavy. So much so to the point that you almost forget you're playing an adventure RPG game. The biggest problem with this though is that the puzzles are extremely cryptic. I'm talking Castlevania 2 levels of cryptic.That being said I feel that everything else has been improved upon from the first game. The open world is breathtaking and a lot of fun to explore. Tons of options for class customization and a lot of different weapons.tl;dr - Really good game, but it suffers from a lot of extremely cryptic puzzles late game.			"

												This is a great old-school RPG.  The combat is similar to Eye of the Beholder with some extra systems such as secondary attacks for weapons which you unlock with skill points.  You will die A LOT, as you can't just tank damage like other RPG's (unless you have a specific build maybe).  If you just stand there the enemies will completely decimate you--like, in the first five minutes of the game.  That's just part of the game though. I've gotten through one of the dungeons, and it is pretty large and well-designed.  I used a guide because I'm not good at puzzles, and there are a lot of secrets with nice loot that I would miss.  There's not a lot of narrative--just pure gameplay mostly (which I like).  I haven't beat the game yet, but so far it is very solid.			"

You play in a first person perspective so you get to see the environment upclose. It has some great looking areas and some dull but that is almost every game now because lets be honest we have almost seen it all before. The dangerous creatures that you face as you travel through have a decent design to them and feel like they belong in the game which i like. There are also several different types that you will encounter which keeps the combat fresh as they all can do something different.Your movement is grid based so you move forward, back and left to right as you would in most games except you only take one step which moves you 1 square so to speak. At first it seemed strange to me but after a bit of playing i got used to it and it worked well with how the map is designed. Combat is pretty easy to grasp except for the mage which can take some memorization of different rune combinations so that you can cast your assortment of spells. It has some decent boss battles with some unique mechanics and overall felt nice. There are a few puzzles in here that i enjoyed and added to the overall experience of the game.It offers different modes that you can play that change the dynamics of the game like the pen and paper mode which takes away the digital map and only lets you plot with pen and paper which i thought was neat.

												This game is really well made and entertaining. It has fun combat, interesting puzzles and fun mechanics. On top of that, it gives a lot of customization options. You can create your own levels with a very easy to use editor but if you are able to do some scripting and/or create new 3d models and objects you can alter the game contents even more than that (sometimes the original content could be somewhat limited depending on the look you want to give to your environment).You can also use any picture you want to create your character: you can play with characters from other games, your friends, your favorite movie stars, your childhood toys, your toaster, your dog, the almighty Azathoth, anybody or anything and it is very fun.There are a few things I did not like too... The main plot is somewhat disappointing and trivial and reminds me of a very famous tv show I really hate, the normal ending imho is a lot better than the secret one both in how it looks and in its meaning (I really dislike the main plot lol). Also in my opinion it is not good for a game that long and with such a big map to have ""almost"" none NPC to interact with. The main quest gives you goals that feel repetitive after a while, despite the actual gameplay and environments being varied, interesting and entertaining. And the island master mocking the player somewhat ruined the fantasy setting a bit... sometimes it sounded like a modern day criminal or sociopath rather than an exotic fantasy character to me...Overall it is a great game that delivers high quality entertainment and many possibilities to easily create your own environment to play with (or play custom levels created from others), even if there are a few things I would have appreciated more if done differently			"

												I thought that after playing Legend of Grimrock 1 i would never play anything that good for the rest of my life. I was wrong. Legend of Grimrock 2 is without a doubt the best game ever! Interesting, challenging, rewarding, and fun. All the things you can collect have a meaning, all the doors, levers and buttons lead to something new and exciting. Don't ever throw anything away, 'cause you are gonna need it at some point. Hunger is a serious thing, as is gaining experience and choosing your skill points wisely. Legend of Grimrock 2 has a lot of nice outside space to wander around, but they haven't forgotten good old dungeons. I loved every single minute playing this game, and i always wanted more. At work i thought about Grimrock, at the gym i thought about Grimrock. I even dreamt about it, as crazy as that sounds. I just felt i could never get enough of new enemies, secrets and puzzles!Today, as i finished this game after 55 hours of playing and  leave this epic sequal behind me, i am so proud to be Finnish.

												One of my many experiences with this game:I've spent the last hour in deep dark mine full of giant 2 meters wide venomous spiders. I'm barely alive and have finally found a safe corner where I can rest. I can still hear the spiders everywhere around me and I'm scared that one might jump around the corner any second. Still I take this opportunity to sort my inventory abit.While I'm focused on my inventory i glance forward and infront of me is A GIANT SPIDER!!!I got spooked so hard that I almost fell out of chair. Then I look at it again and realize that it's just a tiny spider walking calmly in front of me and it couldn't hurt me. This game is just perfect. It is in every way a better than the first one. Its atmosphere is strong, the puzzles are hard but solvable, the enemies are scary because it's so hard to die fighting them and the island itself is beautiful.			"

												~ Legend of Grimrock 2 Review ~8/10 PositiveGraphics: 8/10The graphics are above average for a dungeon crawler. Magic effects are pleasing. Nothing over the top, but certainly nothing to complain about.Puzzles: 8/10The puzzles can be challenging at times, especially when enemies are near and you  need to think fast or die. I did end up looking at a game guide online in order to solve 1 or 2 of the puzzles.Battles: 8/10Some of the enemies required some clever tactics to beat and were actually quite a challenge. I felt a little scared at times as my dimly lit torch gave me a surprising glimps of a dark and terrifying foe in front of me.Conclusion: If you like dungeon crawlers, then this game is great for you. But if you are a little less geeky then me and you want to PvP in a first person shooter all night, then the slow progression and movement limitations will eat you alive.			"

You can create your own levels with a very easy to use editor but if you are able to do some scripting and/or create new 3d models and objects you can alter the game contents even more than that (sometimes the original content could be somewhat limited depending on the look you want to give to your environment).You can also use any picture you want to create your character: you can play with characters from other games, your friends, your favorite movie stars, your childhood toys, your toaster, your dog, the almighty Azathoth, anybody or anything and it is very fun.There are a few things I did not like too... The main plot is somewhat disappointing and trivial and reminds me of a very famous tv show I really hate, the normal ending imho is a lot better than the secret one both in how it looks and in its meaning (I really dislike the main plot lol). Also in my opinion it is not good for a game that long and with such a big map to have ""almost"" none NPC to interact with. The main quest gives you goals that feel repetitive after a while, despite the actual gameplay and environments being varied, interesting and entertaining. And the island master mocking the player somewhat ruined the fantasy setting a bit... sometimes it sounded like a modern day criminal or sociopath rather than an exotic fantasy character to me...Overall it is a great game that delivers high quality entertainment and many possibilities to easily create your own environment to play with (or play custom levels created from others), even if there are a few things I would have appreciated more if done differently			"

												~ Legend of Grimrock 2 Review ~8/10 PositiveGraphics: 8/10The graphics are above average for a dungeon crawler. Magic effects are pleasing. Nothing over the top, but certainly nothing to complain about.Puzzles: 8/10The puzzles can be challenging at times, especially when enemies are near and you  need to think fast or die. I did end up looking at a game guide online in order to solve 1 or 2 of the puzzles.Battles: 8/10Some of the enemies required some clever tactics to beat and were actually quite a challenge. I felt a little scared at times as my dimly lit torch gave me a surprising glimps of a dark and terrifying foe in front of me.Conclusion: If you like dungeon crawlers, then this game is great for you. But if you are a little less geeky then me and you want to PvP in a first person shooter all night, then the slow progression and movement limitations will eat you alive.			"

												I thought that after playing Legend of Grimrock 1 i would never play anything that good for the rest of my life. I was wrong. Legend of Grimrock 2 is without a doubt the best game ever! Interesting, challenging, rewarding, and fun. All the things you can collect have a meaning, all the doors, levers and buttons lead to something new and exciting. Don't ever throw anything away, 'cause you are gonna need it at some point. Hunger is a serious thing, as is gaining experience and choosing your skill points wisely. Legend of Grimrock 2 has a lot of nice outside space to wander around, but they haven't forgotten good old dungeons. I loved every single minute playing this game, and i always wanted more. At work i thought about Grimrock, at the gym i thought about Grimrock. I even dreamt about it, as crazy as that sounds. I just felt i could never get enough of new enemies, secrets and puzzles!Today, as i finished this game after 55 hours of playing and  leave this epic sequal behind me, i am so proud to be Finnish. Thank you, Almost Human. Loved this!			"

												One of my many experiences with this game:I've spent the last hour in deep dark mine full of giant 2 meters wide venomous spiders. I'm barely alive and have finally found a safe corner where I can rest. I can still hear the spiders everywhere around me and I'm scared that one might jump around the corner any second. Still I take this opportunity to sort my inventory abit.While I'm focused on my inventory i glance forward and infront of me is A GIANT SPIDER!!!I got spooked so hard that I almost fell out of chair. Then I look at it again and realize that it's just a tiny spider walking calmly in front of me and it couldn't hurt me. This game is just perfect. It is in every way a better than the first one. Its atmosphere is strong, the puzzles are hard but solvable, the enemies are scary because it's so hard to die fighting them and the island itself is beautiful.			"

												This is a great RPG dungeon crawler which I highly recommend. The feel of it is great and old, but in a good way, like if you need a key, you have to walk into a dungeon with traps to go find which I love. Killed the first boss with almost no health and then wandered into a forest, went into a dungeon, and fell down a hole which injured my feet. 11/10.			"

												This is the best kind of sequel. It takes what the original Grimrock did- filling the niche that classic first person grid-based dungeon crawling RPGs dug out- and improving almost every aspect of it, while giving it an original spin on the structure of the world and its story. It's full of secrets, surprises, and challenge in a world that's a blast to explore with a fine-toothed comb.There's a lot to this game from the very beginning. Creating an effective party of four members, whose choice of race, class, attributes, traits, and skills for each can deeply affect your experience per playthrough. And it's all quite well-balanced, as damage output depends a lot more on equipment you find, and your ability to use them, more than base stats. The party creation opens a ton of avenues for unique challenges. You could for example try having less than four party members or having a team of farmers (who can only gain experience from eating food.)One of the most obvious changes from Grimrock 1 is the world's structure. While in the first game it was a massive downward slog through floors of an endless dark, gray dungeon, the game takes place in an overworld ""dungeon"" with several variously sized traditional dungeons scattered around. The seven distinct environments of the world provide a much-needed and somewhat literal breath of fresh air, especially when coming above ground after traversing through one of the larger dungeons. At the start, you travel linearly between the first three areas, giving you time to establish an effective party through the simpler challenges. In the third area is where the game's structure really shines, letting you choose between four potential paths. The road ahead to your eventual goal needs to be unlocked by finding gems through exploration, combat, and puzzle solving throughout the world, which make for good gauges of progress as you make your path. Even if you skip over a few, you shouldn't face much backtracking thanks to the tight level design and the teleportation hub.There is a distinct 'Treasure Island' feel to the setting. Your party beings the adventure shipwrecked on an Island, there's a shovel to unbury treasure (and graves, naturally), as well as the addition of firearms, which have distinct advantages and disadvantages to the usual throwing weapons. Your exploration of the world and eye for secrets will not go unrewarded, even if sometimes the 'reward' is a miniboss, another new addition to Grimrock. One of the things I love about both Grimrock games is that you're never instantly killed. Falling down a pit will never kill you, however whatever is IN that pit just might. Regardless it's almost always worth taking the plunge to potentially find items than to play it safe for the sake of your party's ankles. There are ways that YOU can instantly kill enemies by falling on top of one or telefragging them, but I have not seen if they can do the same to you.As for the enemies themselves, there is a fair bit of variety, including flying leech-squid things, rat pirates, and a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥of a leprechaun. Even the more generic themed enemies typically have unique movement and attack AI. Your success against these enemies require a lot of thinking ahead. You typically can't risk full-frontal assault if you want to keep your health. The combat is mostly movement-based, meaning you have to essentially dance around your enemies. In the original Grimrock, this would typically lead to what fans came to call ""square-dancing,"" where you and your opponent would be locked in a 2x2 square as you move laterally, turn, hit the enemy as it takes your place, and just as they turn to face you, repeat. This problem rarely occurs in Grimrock 2, as the enemy AI typically isn't willing to move ahead to give you a free hit, and often have certain tricks to confound you (ie. quickly cartwheeling to your flank, leaping into the air to land in a nearby space, lightning-fast sideswipe attacks). This makes the combat generally full of suspense, necessitating precise footwork and planning as to not get yourself cornered or caught between multiple enemies, often whose tactics complement one another to your disadvantage, particularily in the boss battles. The enemies, after they die, only respawn after a certain amount of time and progress. Sometimes they may even become tougher versions or new kinds altogether. I don't know how exactly it is designed, but it seems to scale well with your party's power, always providing a decent challenge.As far as story goes, there's nothing too groundbreaking, but what is there is handled well. Other than the intro, your experience through the game is never interrupted by cutscenes, and everything is told through notes and lore that typically leads more into puzzles than just for its own sake, which is something to be appreciated. There's just the right amount, from the notes directly from ""The Island Master"" that give you plenty of reason to want to go fight him (if you needed more than all the traps and♥♥♥♥♥♥he left around), to the rest that adds flavor while at the same time interacting with gameplay.If you're interested in a challenging, fun, and fair RPG with a fair level of depth, with a balanced blend of old and new, this is a phenomenally good choice. With great replayability from the base campaign alone, the dungeon editor and workshop support should give you plenty of extra mileage from this game.			"

												This is much improved from the orginal, but if you haven't played the orignal you should pick that up too!The huge enhancement with this one is the dynamic areas, which you really see in compariing the great level building from LOG1 and LOG2. The areas are more dynamic with wall textures, multiple heights, swimming, falling, dieing, etc.The area does have a mix of dungeons (like the first) but also open areas. They have also included new puzzle complexities and variations, including moveing blocks that activate, more switch variations, boss areas, and the fun pit fall like secrets in the mine (which I think is the coolest dungeon area in this game).The end game also has some twists and turns. Yes, there is ""less"" story toward the end, but I think the dungeon/island master realizes he is in trouble and you are winning so he hides out in the castle. In the beginning it seems as if he is just screwing with you but as you progress you hear less and less from him (this makes sense to me).If you like old school Dungeon Hack, you should get this now.

												Legend of Grimrock was a remake of the old Dungeon Master series of video games, where four of the unluckiest people on whatever fantasy world you care to name slugged it out in a first-person viewpoint through a never-ending dungeon solving puzzles, killing monsters, and reloading saved games a lot. Grimrock is a fantastic revival, updating the format with a new-school look and filling the dungeons with enough monsters to cover every possible phobia that human beings have. Creepy spiders? Got them. Horrible zombie monsters? Got those too. Starving to death in a dungeon because the puzzle for a solution eludes you? That's you. It turns out you are the monster who ate all the cakes and now have no more cakes. Way to go, Chompy McFoodie.Legend of Grimrock II is largely the same thing, but massively improved and even more difficult than the first game. I get the feeling the developers didn't have a good direction to take the Grimrock series, so they went the BIGGER AND BETTERER route. This is not a bad thing at all - the first Grimrock left me vaguely unsatisfied after I reached the bottom, because I realized all we were doing was running around narrow corridors in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mountain. Well, Grimrock II is for picky-picky pants who thought along the same lines, because this time you get to GO OUTSIDE AND GET KILLED BY HORRIBLE MONSTERS. Seriously - the game has you start out fighting for your life on the beach with scraps and rocks, and every fight feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ do-or-die frantic clawing at each others' throats. The game is able to keep this crazy amount of tension going with each and every new area - fights become intense and terrifying with every new monster because it has this little quirk or trick up its sleeve that it's going to use to ♥♥♥♥ your party over and kill you dead.It works out a lot of the quirks from the first game's puzzles - mostly. The puzzles are difficult, but not too brain bending - they don't quite reach the Portal sweet spot, but they come close and solving them made me feel like a champion. There's still a couple that require moon logic and sent me towards a walkthrough guide. The plot is a bunch of accented nothing. The first game's story had a bunch of information on the world, but not a whole bunch as to why the King sent four poor suckers into a mountain cave to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. The second game doesn't have much more than that. It has lots of beautiful details about the world that the game exists in, but there's not much else to it other than ""Gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ off of this crazy death island full of crazy death monsters, gotta go!""I can't really say much more about this game other than it's a bigger and better sequel and you don't need to play the first game to understand it. I will say that whenever people talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about beating hard bosses in Dark Souls or Bloodborne, I'll talk about the time I got jumped by cobras and crazy undead Medusa archers just to get a longsword that I didn't even end up wanting to keep.

												- Great, divergent type of puzzles, not too hard, but decent amount of thinking.- Nice graph, nice envirolment, sound is ok (would be great some more music while playing).- Great depth, nice complexity, greap map, character design, easy to understand but still not too simple character stats.- No tutorial, just some hints in the beggining (i like it).- Real time combat is good enough (5/10), but turn based would be better (now, it's kiting only, if you are cornered, you are dead, if you can kite, then you win, simple is that). Buy it if it is on sale or with a bundle (not worth 22 euro/usd) if you are interestid with this kind of a game. You will have fun.			"

												Wow, I don't even know where to begin with this game. The original game was already really good, especially for an indie title. The sequel though simply blows it's predecessor out of the water with all the additions. The core game is basically the same as the original, but levels now have many more options to them. Water, ladders and multi-story areas combined with a new non-linear level design philosophy created a beautiful game. More environments, more monsters, more puzzles, everything that people loved about the original Grimrock is there and moreso. That includes difficulty too; but thanks to the newfound openness you can simply go somewhere else if something is too difficult. I can happily say I only got really stuck two times in a thirty hour long game with breaks between areas. It's really amazing how they've changed so little and yet made the game so much better. If you're a fan of puzzle games or dungeon crawlers you're really missing out if you don't check out Legend of Grimrock's sequel.			"

												Come on, this game as 92% positive review and you are still wonder if you'll like the game? Well, let's see what I can say about this game then.The Good:1) Extras. Game theme music and game manual provided is a nice touch as an add-on.2) Good Music3) Good Graphics4) Good RPG elements. Leveling up and character builds are interesting, diverse and well implemented.5) Good Controls. Real time combats where inventory and maps doesn't pause anything. Controls are hard and you can tell its intentionally made that way. This makes the game feels more real. 6) Good Enemy AI: Dodge/Chase-down intelligently based on player's action. This makes sometimes even a weak enemy alittle problemetic to deal with. Moves intelligently. Will standstill or take detour just to corner player making enemies quite deadly at 3 or more in numbers. Strategy seems well written since players need to take damage in order to get out of being surrounded, sometimes its even impossible to get out and player will have to brace themsevles.7) Story is more rich as they have added abit more lore in.8) Good riddles and puzzles and traps as usual.9) Good value for $$$.The Bad:1) Low replay value. The game is great and epic but replay value is even lower now that there's not even a Toorum mode a.k.a. one imba character for player to replay the whole game with new strategy or in a new light. I feel tired just by the thought of having to play the whole epic adventure once more just to try out a new team build.1b) A solution might be for newgame+ or allowing changing class and skillpoint distribution once game has been completed. Just to make trying out different stuff much less daunting.2) Uneven use of enemies.. I find the diversity of enemies great and I have mentioned how wonderful their AI is. However, I find myself fighting undeads most of the time.... I mean.. Come on, there's 2 entire regions here undead is the primary enemy. I feel like I want to fight other types of enemies more often and less undead.. At least double the encounter for all other types of enemies and at least half encounters for undead.There you go. That's what I'll like to say about the game. All in all great game. I'm a stingy motherfker and I personally wouldn't buy the game at full price but I can't honestly say its not worth it. The game is definitely worth every dollar spent even if bought at full price.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 adds a ton of new things into the mix without taking away the classic dungeon-crawling feel that it had originally.A much more open-world with varied levels and challenges (and brilliant visuals) makes the experience just feel much more exciting. Puzzles, clues and cryptic messages are scattered all around in both the main progression and secrets and side-areas, certainly providing a difficult but satisfying challenge which results in a great sense of achievement when you finally figure something out. The sound effects are pretty immersive (and creepy, at times), and the title music in particular always gets me psyched when I load it up.Incredible sequel to an already great game. Give it a try!

												Beautiful environments, great atmosphere, intricate puzzles and solid RPG battle mechanics and character-customization. I loved the first game, and this game is everything you could wish for in a sequel: More of the same, brilliant ideas, but different enough to feel fresh and new. For me, the best things about the game is that it respects the player and paces itself perfectly. It's never repetitive and each challenge you tackle feels new and different.Even when you're done with the game, you can go through it again with a new party and look for secrets you might have missed. One thing I've noticed in my now second playthrough is that I'm probably progressing 3x-4x faster than before, meaning knowledge is more powerful than any kind of weapon or equipment you find in the game, which I think is a testament to great design.If you haven't played this kind of game before, I would actually recommend the first game over this one, simply because it's more linear and easier to get into. When you're done with that, you WILL be wanting more, and then you come back for this one :)I ran into some game-crashing bugs the first week, but they have since been fixed. There are still some performance issues in certain areas, but nothing major. Highly recommended.			"

												Probably one of the best dungeon crawlers I played (and I played quite a few, including Dungeon Master, EoB series, Wizardry series, Stonekeep etc.). The graphics is incredibly beautiful, the sound is very atmospheric, and the game is FUN. A must-have for every fan of the genre. Drawbacks? Very few - the party still consists of only four characters (six as in EoB would be nice), and there are no shortcuts for the primary attacks (instead of F1-F6 keys as in EoB, the weapons must be clicked with RMB). Otherwise, it is perfect IMHO.			"

												Wow, this game is amazing.. If you ever played the old Dungeon Master game, or the last LOG game you'll love this. The creators of this game lifted the bar by making the game outdoor as well as indoor. There seems to be more variety of monsters, great puzzles like the first game, and the same style of combat. There are hidden surprises, treasures, and a large map to boot. Definitely worth the $$.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is the successor to popular and successful game, where you adventure down in the dungeons in old retro style. Where as the first game was very linearly, LOG2 is trying to break the game up in a more open roamly world, where you can move above ground and underneath in several independent dungeons. This is also it's biggest weakness, as you get easily stuck at lock or magic forcefield, which requires a certain component you need to find.Even as an experienced adventure player, I had to give up close to the end due to lack of guidelines and almost impossible puzzles to solve. I only needed to find one component to open the grand gate into the castle, but after several hours of search, I could never find the area I was missing, sadly.			"

												A ""look-up-the-puzzle-solution-on-the-internet"" simulator, at its finest.  This is an RPG with almost zero ""role-playing,"" as there is not a single character throughout the game with which your party will interact with in any way, other than to kill.  No dialogue.  No choices.  No plot.  No NPCs.  Nothing.  Just enemies and puzzles.  And those puzzles?  Almost impossible to solve.  Many have no clues at all, so you must flip levers and press buttons and step on plates and walk through teleporters randomly, hoping you get lucky and ""solve"" the puzzle.  Other puzzles have clues half-way across the game world that you may or may not ever find.  I'm no stranger to puzzle-solving in RPGs, but I had to look up the answer to almost all of the puzzles in this game.  Half the game involves walking sideways along walls looking for switches...like a giant ""hidden object"" game.  And the charcters classes?  Make sure you look up the ""correct' way to build a party, because the ""wrong"" choices are devestating (i.e. your characters will not be able to survive later in the game).  Summary:  This is not an RPG--it is a puzzle game, and the puzzles are awful.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 has definately made vast improvements over its predecessor. There are more classes, skills and a new race.Character creation has alot more portraits and more easy to understand skill pathway which much more ease of use.The level design is gorgeous, and is a complete change from the repeating corridors and shows a more unique and carefully designed environment, particularly in the very start of the game.The graphics are very visually appealing and well polished, dynamic day/night system makes areas look different and appealing in both dark and light, at night the game makes me fearful for what could be lurking around.Combat is much more fluid and fun with enemies that have different attacks than the next, keeping you always on your toes to figure out what the next enemy can do. The creatures all look uniquely designed and look amazing. There's even boss fights, absent in the previous game.New mechanics implemented to encourage exploration and discovery, with secrets hidden around the world as well as digging around to find treasure.Currently overall, this is LoG, but with alot more improvements both aesthetically and mechanically. Thanks devs for not letting me down with a great sequel!Finished the game on both endings, needless to say the game ends well and feels good from start to finish.			"

												With Legend of Grimrock II, Almost Human shows how sequels are supposed to be made. There's more of everything and almost everything's better.New outdoor areas, while basically being just dungeons with different tilesets, add a breath of fresh air to the dungeoncrawling. There's couple of rather annoying puzzles, but the dozens of others are brilliant and just as mindtwisting than in the first game. What's better this time is that even if you get stuck on a puzzle, you are free to go elsewhere as there's a lot more freedom to explore the island than there was on first Grimrock's mountain dungeon.Character creation and advancement also has a lot more freedom. More classes, one more race, numerous skills that every class can learn. Nothing stops your fighter learning magic as long as he has a staff to can cast spells from. You can even create a plate-wearing and sword-wielding frontline battlemage.Combat is more challenging and while it still encourages dancing around the opponent in the grid-based movement system, now some foes react surprisingly and have a lot more tricks up their sleeves. Okay, the undead are still stupid.New Grimrock is an oldschool, niche game, but it's so well made that it's worth a look even if the genre doesn't interest you. And if it does, why are you reading this? Go play!			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a sequel to the well received Legend of Grimrock. It is a game for people who like to use logic and have it somewhat easy solving riddles and puzzles, a degree of patience is really a necessity. Some of the riddles are really devilish and will test your mettle to its limit but the satisfaction of solving it - priceless!The Almost Human crew took a lesson from all the critique as well as pleas made regarding their 1st title and made a really grand improvement. The game world feels much more open and the day-night cycle is just an icing on the cake, the variety of oponents is much greater as are their tactics (AI) and speed. Items as well have been improved both in terms of variety and usefulness. Not only that, the world is huge and varied, nearly each ""section"" has its own personal flavor and feel, you don't ever feel that every dungeon is the same. Your very first playthrough, assuming one figures the puzzles oneself, will provide well over the stated 20hrs of play time. Uncovering all the secrets this game has to offer will extend the expierince even farther, trust me I did them all.Due to the non-linearality, various modes, difficulties and some really interesting, possible party compositions it does offer viable reasons for a second or even 3rd playthrough.Graphically this game looks really, really gorgeus and beautiful. Some of the landscapes will put you in awe. Sadly I noticed 2 annoyences:due to screen tearing I played with v-sync on and sometimes, for no real reason the fps dropped from 60 to 30 rarely to 20. Alt+tabing was temporarily fixing the issue.on some occassions the virtually no anti-aliasing really hurts. For people not playing in 1080p this might be even more hurtful issue.I do hope those might get worked on in future!Overall, a very worthy heir to LoG1 who took everything from its predecessor and made it even better, bigger, taller, deeper, grander! Personally, this is the Game of the year for me, if I were to buy it again I most certainly would!			"

												Like its predecessor, Legend of Grimrock 2 is a tribute to the grid-based dungeon crawlers of yore. Unlike LoG1, however, which was very straight-forward (or straight down, I should say), LoG2 goes for a more open exploration approach. This both works and doesn't work.It works in giving you the impression that there's always something you've yet to discover elsewhere - hidden treasure, the way to access the next dungeon, the solution to that one puzzle you just can't figure out. It is frustrating, however, when you're not sure whether you already have the means to complete a puzzle in the area you're in or whether the clues you possess apply to a puzzle in an entirely different area. You also can't tell which puzzles are necessary to progress in the game.The puzzles are mostly very well designed and more varied than in LoG1, partly thanks to the expansion of puzzle mechanics - for instance, a ""level"" can now have multiple levels (floors) within it. Towards the end, there are a few puzzles that seem a bit obscure. The gameplay has been polished from Grimrock 1. The enemy design is now better suited to the apparent effectiveness of the side-stepping strategy that could be used to dominate almost any enemy in LoG1 - movement during combat is no longer breaking the game, instead, it is necessary to survive. The skill and spell systems have been reworked. There's much more variety in environments and when exploring the outdoors, the graphics are honestly quite pleasant to the eye.The lack of hand-holding has its pros and cons. The feeling of accomplishment after completing a difficult puzzle is uncomparable, but when the difficulty of the puzzles is combined with the open exploration aspect, there is a high possiblity of frustration in not knowing where to go. Still, Grimrock 2 is a great improvement over its predecessor and a worthy contender for being the best dungeon crawler of all time.			"

												Far and away better than the already really quite good original, what you have in Grimrock 2 is an excellent dungeon crawler style rpg - the focus being on combat and puzzle solving in a grid-based, first person fashion.The combat is improved over the original, but it's still slightly wonky. While the AI is better, you'll still spend most of your fighting time exploiting its behaviour since a straight up fight will almost always end badly.Where Grimrock 2 really shines, however, is in the exploration and puzzle solving. Gone is the multi-level, single dungeon, where you now have something almost reminiscent of legend of zelda; a roughly open world, where your progression is primarily driven by your ability to explore and solve puzzles.And those puzzles, you say? Some of the best I've seen in games. While many are challenging, none have inexplicable leaps in logic, and every future puzzle is building on what you've learned previously. Clues are not as obscenely cryptic as in la mulana, but give just enough information for your mind to leap at the solution. There hasn't been a point in the game so far where I've been stuck with no-where to go, and yet many of the puzzles have me feeling like a genius on their solution. The balance of difficulty of the puzzles is meticulous.Buy this game. It's real good.			"

												Classic RPG elements and beautiful environments blended with satisfying puzzle solving.Although I never played the first Legend of Grimrock, it did not stop me from getting this gem of a game. Luckily no knowledge of the predecessor is required to enjoy this game. It does help if you know the core concept though, as the game never holds your hand apart from at the very start. The semi-turnbased classic RPG elements are not for everyone, as it does require strategic thinking while in combat, especially later in the game. The game often does not show any mercy in unexpected tough situations. It challenged me and kept me immersed at all time, which I greatly enjoyed. An aspect that I personally had great fun with is the puzzles. These puzzles are hardly ever straightforward and really make you think. Look around for clues. Any secrets? What does this text mean? And when you finally find the solution, you feel like a master of puzzlesolving. There are some things that bother me. Some monsters seem just too strong in comparison to other in the same area. It catches you off guard, making you think you can take on the area while you definitely cannot. Also I think accuracy is always quite a bothersome thing for me. My characters keep missing their attacks, making me frustrated at times of danger. This is a common mechanic in classic RPGs so I just have to get used to it I suppose. And finally, although I love the concept of tilebased movement, it did take me a while to fully grasp it and gave me some issues along the way. In the end, mostly small subjective complaints.Finally, I absolutely love the level editor. As a level designer, I greatly enjoy this feature and it definitely was one of the selling points for me.I recommend this game to all hardcore players who enjoy a beautiful and expansive classic RPG.

 An overview for those unfamiliar with the ""Dungeon Master"" genre Shipwrecked!  Your band of four mysterious prisoners just washed up on a mysterious island, run by a mysterious master.  Fight enemies both mysterious and non-mysterious, and find mysterious items from mysterious chests by solving mysterious puzzles.If you've never played a game similar to this in the past, you're going to feel a bit confused, and perhaps turned off at first.  Although the game is concidered first-person, think of it like this - you are a floating camera, right in front of four party members.  That's right, you control all four.  Even more jarring for many will be the grid-based movement and combat.  The levels certainly don't appear much like grids, mut you move from grid-space to grid-space without any leeway.  No diagonal moves - only forward, back, and 90-degree turns.  This is one of my only complaints - it's restricive,  seemingly an un-neccisary ""old school"" feature, and sometimes makes me a little dizzy if I start making too many turns.  Controls are mostly menu based, requiring you to click on the weapon of a party member to attack and actually have non-weapon items (like alchemy equipment or warhorns) if you want to use them.  The games has a very nice map system which creates a classic grid-paper like map (nothing is labled for you, if you want to make note of something the game gives you the tools to do so)You would expect, concidering the grid system, that combat would be turn based.  Nope.  You'd better get used to the system quickly, because strafing and dodging opponent attacks are often vital tactics for survival.  This game is quite challenging at times, and I often find that I feel under-leveled for the area I'm in, even when I'm actually not.Character progression is handeled quite well - you never feel completely satisfied with your characters, which is how it should be.  Skills only have 5 levels, but you only get one point per level, and there is something like 20 skills.  Character classes actually feel different from one another and many have very unique benefits / systems.  Alchemists actually grow more herbs once they're in their inventory.  Magic users are treated to a magic system that involves combining different elemental runes to create spells.The environments are absolutely beautiful - this is possibly the nicest looking game I own, in my opinion.  But I'm a sucker for AA, so opinions may vary.  Everything is essentially open world.  The best comparison would probably be metroid, if only because most areas are blocked off by locked doors, the keys to which can only be found elsewhere.  That elsewhere is probably blocked off by some puzzles.  The puzzles are a nice level of difficulty, vague enough to leave you scratching your head, untill you figure them out, at which point you facepalm.And did I mention - you can make and download custom dungeons, some of which are campaign lenth?  It's a wonderful feature that adds huge amounts of value if you want to keep playing after you've finished the original campaign.  -Important Note-In the Windows version, custom dungeons are held in Documents\Almost Human\Legend of Grimrock 2\Dungeons.  Dungeons downloaded from the Steam Workshop are immediately brought there, but there are others on the Nexus which are too large to be allowed on the Workshop.  Place those dungeons in the aforementioned file as well.  Took me forever to figure that out.			"

												A magnificent game.Hardly ever did I feel as challenged by a video game, both mentally and physically. Having played and loved the first title of the franchise, I was positively thrilled to learn about the sequel.For those who know the first game:Even though LoG1 was a great game, I always felt that staying inside all the time did not fulfill all of Grimrock's potential. I was amazed to see that LoG2 changed this impressively. The developers took some great steps forward with the sequel. Here's what's new: handsome graphics great soundtrack diversified outdoor locations!!! improved character creation process mystifying story 3D (layers of different altitude in one map) tremendously improved AI behaviour additional monsters,  new items, innovative spells, challenging puzzles tons of wealth: buried treasure, locked chests, golden caches, etc, gigantic 34 levels to explore! non-linear exploration - finally you have to ask yourself ""Where to next?""Only small downside I experienced: Backtracking in order to search for something left out or testing a theory to a puzzle was sometimes hindered by hoardes of monsters guarding ares, which were already cleared out. This makes grinding possible to an extent, but was occasionally also quite time-consuming. Also, in my opinion the main story itself provides limited ""replayability"" since it's just not nearly as satisfying anymore if you already know where all the secrets are. I hope that the level-editor will result in some great fan-made additional content!Difficulty LevelThe game provides plenty of possibilities for the player to choose their own challenge. Five races, eight classes and 16 skills are paired with the need to form a specialized party of up to four characters. Three different difficulty settings govern the speed and thrill of the very dynamic combat system. As an Old-School RPG veteran I chose to play at the highest difficulty and preferred to draw my own maps instead of enabling the game's automap feature. Additional options exist to raise the challenge even higher. I was very happy to experience a higher difficulty setting not only in terms of more incoming damage and less output, but rather mainly in an increase of the combat's pace. I also didn't get stuck in an unfair combat situation, although different situations did often require to adapt one's strategy, which I highly appreciate in a game.Some puzzles were really challenging, having me ask my partner and roommates for advice and inspiration. I'm proud that I never used help from a guide or an internet discussion; with a reasonable amount of creativity it is possible to solve all of the riddles. Hardly any of the harder puzzles is story-relevant, so there's also the option of moving on and returning later to loot that particular room of booty.AtmosphereI mainly played in a candlelit room on a wall flat screen wearing headphones. I was often able to locate secret passages by the sounds of monsters behind walls. I could always tell from the direction of the sound in which corridor that blasted zombie was currently looking for me. On more than one occasion I heard myself scream in surprise or even fear when suddenly I realized some monster sneaked up on me! I highly recommend playing this game with an adept surround sound system! ConclusionIf you love hack'n'slay games, online raiding parties, bragging about your new epic item in front of your friends and skipping story and text in favor of action, this game is NOT for you!If you are an arachnophobiac, musophobiac, herpetophobiac, necrophobiac, nyctophobiac, hylophobiac, eremophobiac, ophidiophobiac or potamophobiac, this game is DEFINITELY not for you!If you like games emphasizing social interaction, telling a detailed, pre-cut and pre-chewed story or featuring a lot of spoken dialogue, you might consider asking yourself if you can do without any of this. If not, don't play it, you'll just be disappointed.To anybody else: By all means, give it a try! Chances are even if-unlike me-you don't find your next favourite video game, you will be having a great time on the beautiful Isle of Nex!			"

												A great continuation of the first game.Many people will be turned off by the real-time combat and the ""grid dancing"" that goes along with it, but Legend of Grimrock 2 (and it's predecessor) are great dungeon crawl games that deserve praise.My main qualm with this game comes stems from the actual nature of the game itself, but it could just be my ineptitude and lack of experience with puzzle games. Many of the puzzles were very obtuse, and I had to resort to a walkthrough several times to find solutions. Lots of ""well these abstract insturctions you may or may not have found on a note 3 zones over explain how to do it!"" scenarios. There were a few times where I couldn't figure out where to go, and the combination of these issues almost made me lose heart and stop playing the game.All that aside, the game is still great. The level design is good and the classes/skills are interesting. I (mostly) enjoyed my time with it, and it's a great game for someone who likes hunting secrets for finding hidden surprises.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game... BUT, do not feel bad if you have to look something up, or can't figure out where to go next. Have fun!			"

												After playing it for a bit I realized how much like Zelda this is, and that's a good thing.The general overworld, underground, overworld, underground feel and the collection of the essences makes it feel quite a bit like Ocarina of Time, except mixed with Legend of Grimrock!The graphics are good compared to the original. The downside from a graphical standpoint is that some of the outdoor locations look stupid in a grid format.They improved upon the combat of the original. All of the enemies are more intelligent and some even attack immediately after being in range. That helps fix the ""circling"" battle type of the original.The story is nothing special, just like the first game. Except this time you have more than trying to get to the bottom of a giant mountain. The story makes you play fetch, AKA retrieve a bunch of crystals from each area. This made it feel even more like the child part Ocarina of time.Generally if you liked LoG, Zelda, or RPGs, you may like this game, but is is worth a try for most people.			"

												I was up until 1am the night I finished this game. An RPG that tests your thought beyond just number crunching, it has some of the most satisfying puzzles I've ever seen in a video game. There are minor problems that you may need to consult a guide for, but overall it's an immensely satisfying experience from beginning to end. Easily one of my favourite games of 2014 and quite possibly all time.			"

												The sequel to the hit First-Person Dungeon-Crawl RPG, The Legend of Grimrock II improves on the previous game in so many ways! The gameplay, the music, the graphics, the dungeon layouts! Everything! So, let’s go into one of my trademark reviews and see just how much was improved!Gameplay: If you’ve played the first Legend of Grimrock, then the gameplay is going to feel extremely familiar. It’s the same as in the first game, but with a few minor tweaks that make playing the game so much more enjoyable. Firstly, you’ll notice that instead of being in a dungeon throughout the entire game like you were in the first game, in LoG 2 you spend most of your time outside with only needing to go into the dungeons (you read that right, in this game, there’s not just one dungeon, but a whole bunch of them!) whenever you need to solve some puzzles. The monster AI has been improved and multiple heights in dungeons were added, which kind of takes power away from the whole attack, sidestep/back away from enemies that worked throughout much of the previous game, although still doable to some degree. There’s more weapons and armor and skills and spells to learn, and new classes were added, as was a new race, meaning you have even more customization than you did in the previous game with your party generation. I also like how there are pools of water in the game and you can dive in and explore as if you were still on land but just slower moving. As I said, Almost Human has improved the Grimrock experience in many ways!Graphics: While the graphics look the same, they’re still really friggin’ beautiful! You have the same graphics engine that was used in the original Legend of Grimrock, but with more enviroments, more monsters, more weapons and armor, and more other stuff but I haven’t exactly beaten the game yet so I can’t tell you about all of the new graphics in the game.Music: The only music that I really know for a fact was new was the Grimrock II Title Theme, in addition to the new ambient sounds for forests, but that’s all I know of that changed.Story: I saved the best for last this time! In Legend of Grimrock II, as with the first Legend of Grimrock, your party is a group of prisoners who are accused of some unknown crime and are being transported somewhere (where, I don’t know, I don’t think the game exactly tells you) but during your “trip”, a storm brews and casts the ship your on into the Island of Nex (the game’s setting) and you have to find out why the Island Master has summoned you here so that you can leave. The story is a much better one than the one found in Legend of Grimrock I and, without spoiling the story too much, there’s a twist ending in the game! Even the old-school Dungeon Crawler RPGs that I’ve played couldn’t pull that off! Mind you, I’ve only truly played and beaten the Eye of the Beholder Trilogy (if you can call it that) and they didn’t have any twist endings. Overall, this is a game that shows just what a game company, no matter how large or how small, can do, especially when they’re this dedicated to improving their games’ experiences and I should hope that, should Legend of Grimrock III ever come to light (and I’m really hoping it does), then may Almost Human improve upon this game’s strengths, and make an even better one. Really, this is the classic story of a game company that could’ve used the Legend of Grimrock I Dungeon Editor to make another dungeon similar to what was in the first game, but they didn’t, they took it a step further than that and completely re-tooled their old Dungeon Editor and make a similar, yet very different, Legend of Grimrock game. Hopefully, other game devs will follow in Almost Human’s footsteps.			"

												Much better than the first.  Good improvements to spell casting, but even better improvements with the overall layout itself.If an area is too frustrating to either fight through or figure out, you can just go to another.  The main map is basically the castle you want to get into in the middle of everything else.  You'll always come back to that junction one way or another.  In Grimlock 1, it was linear and disallowed that sort of thing.Great additions, like a persistent enemy that you can eventually outsmart.Only real negative for me was that it felt like a demand in terms of what kind of team I'd have to build.   I had to bring 2 of one type just to win the fights with any sort of chance.  It wasn't immediately obvious, but once I figured it out the game didn't give me all that much trouble, but anything other than that was too challenging to survive.  For me at least.The only other bummer was that 2 solutions in the game completely stumped me due to me not knowing a feature.  I just didn't know you could do it.  So I did ""cheat"" for those 2 instances by looking them up.I was unable to complete Grimlock 1, but I was able to win Grimlock 2 (though I bypassed an entire region due to not being able to figure out how to access it).Enemies can spawn again, which allows for some grinding.Overall it was very true to the old genre and added some exciting features.

												I was skeptical about the transition to an outdoor environment in this game, but they've done an amazing job of it. The environments are beautiful and immersive, and I honestly can't come up with any significant complaints more than halfway through the game. It's very challenging at times, but not in a way that makes me want to quit instead of trying again and pressing forward. Well worth the full price, and a steal on sale. If you haven't played the first one yet, get the bundle and do that too!			"

Its got tons of puzzles (serious thinking required)and good time consumption for your money at a reasonable price.  I also enjoy that the game has i decent difficulty setting as it should never feel as if things are easy....by the way for those that haven't played LOG its got a very interesting combat system where you have to click on weapons/spells to activate them with cooldowns while being in a realtime system from a first person perspective...also you aren't ment to go head to head with enemies as you will most surely die you need to practice heavily maneuvering while attacking almost as if combat is a puzzle as well.  There is enough in LOG and LOG2 that you can actually skip some puzzle areas and still beat the game making well for several playthroughs and not being bored!!!			"

												This is a decent game, but slower.  The first game's limitations make it a better game than this one.   The postives are it is good looking and the modern UI improvements are a welcome addition.

 An overview for those unfamiliar with the ""Dungeon Master"" genre Shipwrecked!  Your band of four mysterious prisoners just washed up on a mysterious island, run by a mysterious master.  Fight enemies both mysterious and non-mysterious, and find mysterious items from mysterious chests by solving mysterious puzzles.If you've never played a game similar to this in the past, you're going to feel a bit confused, and perhaps turned off at first.  Although the game is concidered first-person, think of it like this - you are a floating camera, right in front of four party members.  That's right, you control all four.  Even more jarring for many will be the grid-based movement and combat.  The levels certainly don't appear much like grids, mut you move from grid-space to grid-space without any leeway.  No diagonal moves - only forward, back, and 90-degree turns.  This is one of my only complaints - it's restricive,  seemingly an un-neccisary ""old school"" feature, and sometimes makes me a little dizzy if I start making too many turns.  Controls are mostly menu based, requiring you to click on the weapon of a party member to attack and actually have non-weapon items (like alchemy equipment or warhorns) if you want to use them.  The games has a very nice map system which creates a classic grid-paper like map (nothing is labled for you, if you want to make note of something the game gives you the tools to do so)You would expect, concidering the grid system, that combat would be turn based.  Nope.  You'd better get used to the system quickly, because strafing and dodging opponent attacks are often vital tactics for survival.  This game is quite challenging at times, and I often find that I feel under-leveled for the area I'm in, even when I'm actually not.Character progression is handeled quite well - you never feel completely satisfied with your characters, which is how it should be.  Skills only have 5 levels, but you only get one point per level, and there is something like 20 skills.  Character classes actually feel different from one another and many have very unique benefits / systems.  Alchemists actually grow more herbs once they're in their inventory.  Magic users are treated to a magic system that involves combining different elemental runes to create spells.The environments are absolutely beautiful - this is possibly the nicest looking game I own, in my opinion.  But I'm a sucker for AA, so opinions may vary.  Everything is essentially open world.  The best comparison would probably be metroid, if only because most areas are blocked off by locked doors, the keys to which can only be found elsewhere.  That elsewhere is probably blocked off by some puzzles.  The puzzles are a nice level of difficulty, vague enough to leave you scratching your head, untill you figure them out, at which point you facepalm.And did I mention - you can make and download custom dungeons, some of which are campaign lenth?  It's a wonderful feature that adds huge amounts of value if you want to keep playing after you've finished the original campaign.  -Important Note-In the Windows version, custom dungeons are held in Documents\Almost Human\Legend of Grimrock 2\Dungeons.  Dungeons downloaded from the Steam Workshop are immediately brought there, but there are others on the Nexus which are too large to be allowed on the Workshop.  Place those dungeons in the aforementioned file as well.  Took me forever to figure that out.			"

												I've played 12 hours at a friend, and so far we've had a blast! Hard puzzles, mobs that range from funny to scary and a Wilson orb!You can really see that there has been a lot more put into this than the first one, and it's absolutely amazing!Buy it, and play it if you like the old school RPG's!I certainly plan to make a few good dungeons in this!

												So far I'm enjoying it quite a bit, it's been really interesting exploring above ground, although there are still obviously dungeon sections as well.  It would have been nice to see an improvement on casting for mages, but aside from that Grimrock 2 is really living up to expectations so far! :)

												I have always loved the Might & Magic series, the whole idea of creating your own party of 4 and adventuring to unknown lands is not only exciting but so much fun. Well, when i saw Legend of Grimrock, i gave it a try, loved it. Got legend of Grimrock 2 thinking it couldnt get any better than the 1st. Boy was I wrong! This game revived the dungeon crawler genre and held nothing back. After about 30 hours of stressful inventory managemnt and mind boggling puzzles and riddles, I did it. I absolutely love this game and would recommend to any fantasy dungeon crawler fans out there. Legend of Grimrock 3 here we come! I hope.			"

												A significant improvement over the first, LOG2 still retains it's almost brutal difficulty curve while progressing through the old-school dungeon crawler environment. If your key driver in an RPG game such as Skyrim is in its graphics, then you will be sorely let down by the presentation of LOG2. That's far from saying the game isn't pretty - but its more functional in appearance than blowing you away with graphical awe.Where LOG2 scores very highly is in both character progression and feeling forever in fear of every creature that comes your way. Your original band of four ship-wrecked prisoners are woefully under-skilled and lack any form of equipment. In fact, you literally start with nothing other than a washed up branch nearby to begin with.There are the usual race-to-class pros and cons. Amongst my group, I created a minotaur barbarian with high strength and attack. A female knight who has attained the ability as the groups' main potion maker sits alongside - protecting my much weaker reptilian rogue and my insectoid wizard at the rear. However, they all have their own unique roles to play in the group - and this is one of LOG2's big strong points. Skyrim's multi-skilled/multi-talented lead role is definitely not seen here. Your heavy hitters dish out damage and also attempt to absorb it - while the brain-boxes lie in second file and do their work from a safe distance.LOG2 is a massively cerebral game. You can stand still for minutes at a time without concern of being attacked. It rewards lateral thinkers - those that think slightly out of the box and who attempt to intelligently work through a puzzle, rather than bash and kill their way through it.Some puzzles are easy - while some are extremely tough to work out. But LOG2 provides a highly rewarding and enjoyable quest as you push on ahead. At the time of writing, I was approximately 8 hours into it - and I'll definitely be seeing this game through to the end.For all those who want more of a thinking player's RPG - you certainly can't go wrong with this.9/10			"

												Excellent sequal to a game. LoG2 expands on everything providing classes, more skills, more unique creatures to fight, better AI, different fighting strategies, more puzzles, everything. It really is a HUGE improvement over its predecessor.There were many points where I felt like I was playing a D&D crawler / Myst / Riven hybrid.Excellent game. Would definitely recommend it. If you even kind of enjoyed LoG, you will thoroughly enjoy this.			"

												Dungeon crawling in the style of Eye of the Beholder at its modern finest.  A fantastic sequel to the first legend of Grimrock.  Almost everything from the original returns, and almost everything has been improved upon.  The developers have spared no effort to improve upon the foundation set in the first game.  Let's start with building a party.  There is significantly more depth this time around.  This new game has 8 classes up from the original 3, 5 races up from the original 4.  But it doesn't end there.  Tool tips provide more information.  Classes no longer lock you to a set of 6 specific skills.  Rather, there are 16 total skills that you are able to choose between to customize your character how you see fit.  You want a frontline knight who also can cast a poison bolt here or there?  Done.  The number of options also leads to a large number of interesting choices.  Sure, an insectoid has great mental stats making for a natural wizard.  But they can also get superior armor, making them easily able to play the tankiest of tanks.All these options will warm the hearts of anyone that loves to get deep into the numbers.  While I find building a party great fun, don't worry if that is not your cup of tea.  The game provides a default party that you can use, and it doesn't take a lot of work to make a barbarian that focuses in strength, damage, and more strength.  As an aside, the character portraits have gotten a major and much needed overhaul.  Your party will look much better than last time around, guaranteed.Once you have a party you are dumped on an island.  Filled with common pirate tropes the designers do a good job of pulling you in, with a steady stream of monsters, loot and puzzles that all gradually increase in strength.  The monsters are a major improvement over Grimrock 1.  There is a greater variety right out of the gate.  In addition this game has added memorable boss encounters, something the first game in the series lacked.  The environments too are more varied, adding above ground areas to the strictly dungeoneering of the first game.  And the maps are much larger.There are new options and attention to detail everywhere.  There are now day and night cycles.  You can dig for treasure.  Combat now includes firearms and dual wielding.  New kinds of puzzles.  Larger variety of weapons and improved weapon descriptions.  Tons of new loot.  You will need all of your new toys to succeed, because like the first one combat can be tough for the unprepared.Top to bottom this game is an improvement over the original.  This is a modern take on classic dungeon crawling that is very satisfying for fans of the genre.10/10			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game. I am a big fan of Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land and Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls, but I just could not get into this game after playing for 10 hours. The combination of real-time combat and movement/ facing in a dungeon crawler in which you control the entire party and have to click on their individual abilities to use each and every one of them just struck me as really akward and clunky. Maybe I just prefer my first-person dungeon crawlers to have turn-based combat instead. I regret that it cost me $20 to learn that.			"

												A superb game - improves upon the first game with brilliance and grace.In particular: - the RPG elements are smooth and highly flexible, allowing you to create quite diverse and powerful characters according to your playstyle. There are a wide variety of items available, with many interesting choices.- the puzzles are wonderfully satisfying and logical, and there is nothing better than that moment where you work out a puzzle you have spent ages on; even if you have those 'ohhhh why didn't  i think of that sooner' moments when you realise how logical it actually was. Some puzzles are really difficult (well at least to me), and one or two I have had to seek help on - there is no shame on occasion! :)Make sure you bear in mind that the game is grid based (in terms of how your party and enemies move around) in true old school fashion - I find this to be a positive feature, but others may not. For some reason one or two people have bought it without checking the nature of the game - all power to the grid! :)The game is far more 'open world' than the first game, allowing for exploration a little more than you might expect. You may find yourself going back and forth the same places a few times over some distance potentially. This is not necessarily a negative depending on how you see it, but I've seen it presented as such so I thought to mention it. Regardless, while it is sometimes irritating to go back and forth it is a very minor thing - the game rewards you for exploration and patience.If you like puzzles, RPG's and don't mind dying a fair few times as you learn (in a satisfying way) then this game is for you.Enjoy!!Oh, and beware the crabs!! ;P No seriously, beware! haha			"

												As a fan of the first LoG, I may be predisposed to enjoying this game. It takes me back to my childhood playing Ultima Underworld on my Uncle's computer when I would visit. So many hours spent enjoying that game in my younger years, and now so many hours spent enjoying this game in my adult life. The game is a fantastic ""old-school"" rpg dungeon-crawler. A spirtual successor to those Ultima games (and obviously the successor to the first LoG). I have about 50 hours played under my belt and am only on my second play through. The game is lengthy if you are interested in fully exploring the game. Searching walls for secrets, finding special gear, collecting achievements. The combat is great, and although relatively simple in some ways, some different enemy mechanics force you to switch up combat styles often. There are several different player classes and roles to choose from, so you can format your raiding party to your desire. There are an endless amount of combinations available considering the multitude of skills, races, and talents. I have heard some negative feedback concerning the replay value of this game, though I am not personally seeing that. I have completed the game once, and have now begun my second play through with a different group composition, and although I know where many of the zones/paths/secrets are, the game feels fresh playing with a different group. I have not even begun to look at the user created content yet, though I will be getting to that. All in all, if you are a fan of dungeon crawling RPGs, then you will not be disappointed with this game. At an incredibly fair price for the play value (as I said, 50 hours in now, and I paid ~$13 for it) this game has an large amount of RPG elements to enjoy. This is a MUST PLAY, and at the current price, don't even both waiting for a sale, just grab it now and get crawling.			"

												A true Grimrock II! I only scratched on the surface upto now, walked in the first levels, entered the first 2 dungeons, discovered stuff. So far i can say: It's beautiful, especially the dungeons - if i imagine a dungeon, thats it^^ grafics are really pretty, the cast shadows etc. The riddles are there, collecting stuff, finding secrets, searching walls for secret buttons. And even a first bossfight i got there. All stuff from the first part u will find here and even prettier. And on the other hand, many new stuff. Especially the outdoor-area, were u start and what u can see in the trailer. Can't wait for more.Till now, the riddles were very easy, but im still at the very beginning of the game - they are kind of tutorial-riddles, showing the non-grimrock player, how the monster is going. <> For all excited after watching the trailer: Buy it, im pretty sure, u will enjoy it - there are a good number of settings u can set at the beginning of the game to suit it ur experience or noobishness^^<> For all grimrock-Fans out there: Serious? Ur reading reviews here? Buy and enjoy the game, dude! ASAP! =)			"

												I really loved Grimrock 1 because it was a successful and nostalgic return to my beloved Dungeon Master. But Grimrock 1 wasn't perfect : it was short, the riddles were inconsistent sometimes, and overrall the game was too easy.Grimrock 2 is a huge step forward... an evolution so major it feels like a totally different game. The maps are huge and beautiful. The riddles and enigma are very well done and fun to solve, none is too difficult and they all make perfect sense. The monsters all have different behaviours, making them unique. The skill system is quite good, and all classes have their unique gameplay (I use a knight, a barbarian, an alchemist and a warmage).You are free to go anywhere, don't worry if the monsters are too hard to kill at first, just return in easier areas and explore, there are many hidden spots to discover. I'm almost at the end and everytime I enter a new zone, the ambiance changes in a very successful way.A lots of love has been put in Grimrock 2, if you like Dungeon Crawlers, it's a must have!			"

												You know those games that come out and feel good, feel right, and play right, but they juuuuuuuuuuuuuust don't have the scope, polish, or the design in a few facets quite right to really work, but so damn enjoyable and honest and true in their aim that you like the game and wish the devs the best on the next adventure? That was Grimrock 1.And you know that NEXT game, that takes the scope, polish, and design critiques and sends that sequel thru the roof with some of the best-thought out gaming you've experienced and an all-time classic? THAT'S Grimrock 2.They did so much so right in this game.A grander scale with a whole island full of smaller dungeons to explore. More puzzles. More secrets. More variety. More ambience. More choice. More monsters. More loot. More boss fights. More MORE.It's a much more stabler adventure, with fewer bugs and those were squashed within two weeks of launch. And on top of that, Almost Human fixed the skill system with a PROPERLY simpler one. No more meaningless maxed Spellcraft bonus; everything having 5 tiers and everyone having access to every school makes for some crazy min-maxing and ""sure, why not?"" class ideas like Fighters who have high INT and spam magical special weapon attacks to complement 1's single example of dual tomahawkin' Mino Rogues. It's fun!			"

												I grew up with the original Wizardry, which had two colors (black and white), and the UI was basically up+down arrow to select attack options or selling at town. You could move in four directions only, and every 'cell' was a simple box outline with white being the wall edges. I loved it.Legend of Grimrock 2 uses the same four directional movement, but in a modern crafted world. The first game was confined to a giant dungeon, but this one spreads out over multiple themed areas, and many dungeons. Enemy movement and combat has been improved also. Solving puzzles is as important to gameplay as actual battle in LoG2, and what sets it apart. It is satisfying to figure a puzzle out, and often rewarding with good gear. Almost like a Myst game with a combat side; or if you are an older gamer like me, bliss.			"

												New content. Much game. So pretty. Much wow. The expanded content, works well. The large scope of the island. Is intimidating. But the plentiful amount of food, shifts much of the mood of barely suspended dread, into a more casual, explore and adventure game. If you didn't play the first, I'd still very much recommend it. In fact, I'd go so far, right now, after 7.5 hours, as to say that it's a better game. More coherent, and more atmospheric.I don't mind the square layout of the environment, and a few of the areas are incredibly claustrophobic, simply from atmosphere. You can still make simple mistakes that get you killed. And sometimes pushing a button in the middle of a dungeon or area, can dramatically shift the mood right back to horror. I think the best way to enjoy this game is to play something like 5-15 hours, on normal or easy, just to get a feel for the new challenges. Then, restart, and choose at least one of the ""2nd Wave"" like options. These options, if memory serves, affect the regeneration crystals, and quick saving. Definitely helps to shift the mood back to the lost / isolated / tragic ambiance of the first game.			"

												More equipment, more monsters, cool new spells, several new character classes, a new character race, improved skill sets, double hand slots, and more, and more, and more!  And It's still grid-based!  More freedom to explore means better chance of leveling up and getting better gear before you even go into the major dungeons!  More flexibility in play style allows for self-challenges for improved re-playability.  There will be challenging puzzles, but that's what the game is all about!  There is no reason not to get Grimrock 2!  (Especially if you already have played the first game!)			"

												Getting lost in this huge and varied world is so great. Even in the age of Witcher 3, this game shows that grid-based movement can still be fun. I have a hard time explaining why but here are some possible factors:- Enemies feel more menacing because you can't circle-strafe them, play with aggro range or exploit pathfinding bugs against them like in most free movement rpgs/fpss. So the dungeon feels more claustrophobic and menacing... I definitely don't feel that in Skyrim dungeons.- Mapping out the dungeon square by square and paying close attention to your environment for secret buttons and switches feels great, and it's not the typical modern RPG experience. A free movement game can hardly hide a button somewhere on a wall and expect you to find it, here with the constrained views it works.- The grid system allows for some very smart puzzles, I have to admit I sometimes give up and consult a walkthrough, but I enjoy their presence nonetheless!And you get to control (read: juggle) 4 characters, so four times the RPG goodness!All in all, you'll like it if you liked old-school RPGs like Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder and Lands of Lore: Throne of Chaos. But if you haven't played those games you should try it anyways! You might very well find that grid-based movement is a bit like pixel art: originally born of technical limitations, it can still bring a unique and interesting twist to a game.			"

												Pros: It improves almost everything about the first one in everyway. More enemy variety, more puzzles to solve, and many different levels to explore. The game is much longer than the first with more secrets, puzzles, and epic weapons to find.There are more classes and races to choose from and the skill system has been improved. It is much simpler for the player to see the effects of each skill point.Dungeon crawling is satisfying with clever, if not frustrating at times, puzzles along with plenty of combat.  Cons: Unlike the first one, the Grimrock 2 is more non-linear. Progress at times can be hard to gauge because of all the different levels to tackle, as well as some puzzles requiring hints from multiple levels.Mimics have a tendency to scare the daylights out of you.In short: If you enjoyed the first one, then you will very much enjoy the second one. Some may find the non-linear nature annoying yet others will in turn love it. You do not need to have played the first one to enjoy the second one, both games have self contained stories.			"

I slightly preferred the skill system from the first game, but that's the only (very minor) gripe I have.  The addition of a semi-open world with outdoor areas really make a HUGE difference.

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is like an unleased and improved version of Legend of Grimrock. Everything is better! The sounds, eviorments,graphics! Game play mechanics, leveling system, party creation system. The puzzles and challening but fun and amazing. The game is no longer confined to a single dungeon which you complete floor by floor. Instead you choose your path as you explore the world. Sure it's a lot like Zelda or other games where you do need to do things in somewhat the correct order but you can squence break or do things your own way at times. Legend of Grimrock was an amazing game. Legend of Grimrock 2 is just so much better. I am not done yet! It's a longer game. But I would say I am at least 50% done. I still suggest you play Legend of Grimrock 1 first! You will need the game play experience from the first game to properly beat this more challening adventure with impoved enemy A.I and more difficult enemies & bosses.			"

												I loved the original Legend of Grimrock, so as soon as I heard about the second one, I got excited. After a refresh on the gameplay and design of the original, I bought this and gave it a shot.Over 47 hours later of playing this game, I'm not disappointed. While combat is exploity, and it is hard to truly immerse yourself in a world of blocky movement, the design is gorgeous and exploration is fun.The customization of characters in the beginning of the game alone showed vast improvement from the original. There are more races to choose from, and more classes than characters allowed. It causes one to really think about how they want their party to look.Skills as well were improved, giving everyone access to all skills, and reducing the original 50 levels per skill to a simple 5, with check points so you might not even need all five points there.The puzzles themselves were challenging a lot of the time, to the point where I got frustrated and had to look up answers (I take no shame in looking them up, they were straining). But when it made those difficult puzzles that I solved by myself all the more rewarding.Highly suggested game, especially if you've already played and liked the original.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2. Having played Eye of the beholder in the 80's and not withstanding the advances in graphics and gameplay this was a welcome change. The sense of achievment when you figure out a puzzle and get that bit further into the game is great. Plenty of action, which once you come to grips with  the mechanics of the fight are fine. The graphics and just the pure addiction to the game will keep you occupied for many hours to come...Recomend this game to those who just fancy a pure dungeon adventure... enjoy.			"

												LoG2 is a Tile Based, First Person, Dungeon Crawling, Puzzler (with combat.) I put the combat in parenthesis because while it is a prominent aspect of the game throughout, it is clearly not the focus of the game, which is the puzzle solving. The puzzles themselves get harder as the game progresses. If this is your first exposure to this type of game, it's likely that you'll find it relatively difficult as the puzzles do ramp up in difficulty rather quickly. Being a sequel I imagine that the devs are expecting that the majority of their players will have played the first LoG game in which the puzzles are generally easier and ramp up slower.So now that I've covered what the game is, let's get into some nitty gritty.The gameplay itself builds off of the first one, taking the core of the game and maintaining what it was, while making some distinct improvements based off player feedback from the first game. Monster AI has been improved so that monsters will try to counter squared dancing tactics (these are still effective, but sometimes need to be modified a bit based on what you are fighting). Monsters will also sometimes try to lure you to where they can hit you or even just wait you out instead of charging to their certain demise when you're hiding around a corner waiting to ambush them.Each monster has it's own unique mechanics for how it moves and fights, requiring the player to learn the best ways to fight each one. Some monsters will leap behind the player, or steal your stuff right out of your hands, while others will actively dodge your attacks by jumping back a tile, etc. This is a distinct improvement from the first game where monsters were mostly the same, just moving from tile to tile to attack you as directly as they could and only flanking you by accident, now when they flank you it's on purpose. There are also several boss fights in this game unlike the first game that really only had 1 boss at the end of the game. Each of the boss fights feels like a puzzle in and of itself because of having to figure out how best to approach the fight. Not going to go into any more detail than that on them though as I don't want to give away any spoilers.The dungeon crawling experience has been enhanced as well with the introduction of the great outdoors, with a full day and night cycle, with some things happening based on the time of day or night. The first game was entirely indoors, on top of that it was highly claustrophobic with narrow halls and low ceilings. Lo♥♥♥♥nswers that by giving you multiple tiers of vertical movement on the same level and the openness of being able to be outside and see through the space between trees. About the multiple tiers, this adds an entirely new dimension to the game because this opens up the possibility for bridges that you can go over and under, pits you can drop down into and climb back out of, and ledges you can get up onto, all without changing to another map just because you went higher or lower than 'ground level' for the map you are on.The original races were kept along with the addition of a new race, the ratlings. They also added classes, but with characters being centered around their skills, the classes are fairly fluid, offering advantages in the skills that the class would be good at but not really penalizing you if you decided to let say a barbarian learn to be a mage, or if you wanted a wizard to be able to wear heavy armor and stand on your front line. This opens up the party options and makes it so that there really is no 'bad' party composition. While some parties might be easier to play than others, any party can be made to work. This makes random party generation an interesting optional mechanic that you can take advantage of to give the game a bit more replayability.The skills have also been refined since LoG1 so that each point in a skill is significant, making you noticeably better with that skill each time you add a point. Plus at certain points in skill development you gain additional perks, such as dual wielding light weapons, so that when you swing one light weapon it doesn't put both on cooldown, just the one you swung.The story itself is 'hidden' within the game. You start off knowing nothing more than that you are shipwrecked and washed up on a beach. The story itself is delivered to you with that in mind, where you find notes written by the master of the island to you as his only real way of communicating with you, and you also find notes and other things left behind by others who were here before you, leaving the mystery of what fate befell them. The game's story stands by itself, without needing you to have played the first game, but players that have played the first one may notice small links back to it hidden on the island implying a deeper connection between the island and Grimrock than one might naturally suspect. That being said, while there is a story present, it is clearly not the focus of the game, which is the dungeon crawling itself and most of your experience is motivated by simply needing to survive on the island.The game has a lot of secrets hidden throughout, most of which are found by discovering ways to access optional areas of the game. These hidden areas often contain powerful items that will have a significant impact on the game, but at the same time, none are absolutely necessary to progress through the game, they only make it a little easier to do so. Everything you absolutely have to have to progress through the basic game and get to an ending is offered in plain sight without the need for discovering secrets. I definitely don't recommend not looking for the secrets though as they will help immensely.And finally, when you are done with the core game, or just want to pound your head against something different for a while, there is a dungeon editor included with the game so that players can make and publish their own content using the features included with the game and some ability to add in entirely new stuff. (I wont be going into detail on the features and capabilities of the editor in this review though as I have yet to play around with it).Final verdict:A worthy successor to the first Grimrock game that kept what made it great and enhanced what needed to be enhanced. A very good example of what the old school, tile based, dungeon crawlers are, and well worth the play if you enjoy the genre. Obviously not good for you if you aren't a fan of this type of game which spent about a decade in hibernation before the first Grimrock awoke the sleeping dragon... or cube as the case may be.			"

												Legend of Grimrock II is so much better than one. The night/ day cycle, plus the beautiful diversity of the outside areas makes the game more interesting than just the bare walls of LoG. The extra classes and updates to the skill system give so much more replayability, and make it more enjoyable. Boss battles are introduced, plus updated AI, adding a bit more challenge to combat (even on easy). I have so far had 40+ hours, and can't think of anything that is worse in LoG II than in LoG.			"

												Another awesome title from Almost Human, which expands on the Grimrock legend.Now with outdoor environments, this release takes dungeon crawling out of the dungeon.The game is brilliant, if not a little too short for my taste. It has all of the classic aspects from the first game in the series and refines them even more.The real gem of this release is the Dungeon Editor where you can create your own maps and share them via the Workshop with other players. It is very easy to use and is extremely intuitive. I am currently working on my first dungeon and hope to release it soon.			"

												Excellent, exceeds the first game in every way imaginable.-The open world aspect of the game combined with the separate yet sizeable dungeons truly brings out what was somewhat crippling in Grimrock 1 which was the claustrophobic nature of the game.-The narrative is smoothly done without having too much information thrown at you at once.-The learning curve is steep, especially for beginners to the dungeon crawler/puzzle genre, but veterans and owners of the original Grimrock will be well at home with this game.-With the open world feature included in Grimrock 2 comes a huge overhaul in scenery and variety, whereas the first was restricted to repetitive textures.-More variety in classes and combat allowed for a more enjoyable experience as the game is tailored to your preference.-More secrets for you to search up on Google for. :^)- Also, you like music? Good. :^) The soundtrack complements the game in ways I can't possibly describe. My trouser vine was salty the entire playthrough.420/69			"

I can't even tell you how much I've enjoyed this game thus far.  The puzzles are well thought out, clever, and devious.  The balance is superb.  The graphics are immersive, creative and just a pleasure to look at (especially the mimic!).  You have taken an age-old genre and improved it in ways I didn't think possible, while still keeping the spirit of those CRPGs 100% intact.  Well done, I honestly just can't say enough good things about it.  I'm 20 hours in and the 20th hour was just as pleasurable as the first.""			"

												I was very excited for the first Grimrock, and remember playing it the day it came out with glee. It challenged me, intrigued me, and was thoroughly enjoyable...This game is not the same experience. I was not challenged like I was in the first, nor intrigued or found it enjoyable like the first. It went WAY BEYOND what I expected to feel and was FAR more challenging than the first, and thoroughly intriguing and and enjoyable by comparison to the first. This game makes the first Grimrock seem like a demo. Thats the best way to put it. Everything is streamlined, trimmed, made perfect. It is tough, but rewarding for when you succeed. It is filled to the brim with puzzles and challenges, treasures and secrets, magic and mystery. From breaking out of your cell in the first few seconds of the game to the climactic epic last battle, this game does not dissapoint even once. If you are perceptive, clever, and determined, then you will LOVE this game.			"

												I didn't play the first game, but I got this after watching a few Lets-Plays. First off, the graphics are AMAZING. The water is very realistic, the beaches are great, the forests are very atmospheric, and the dungeons have great atmosphere also. I've been playing on normal, and it's challenging while not being ridiculous, but also not too easy; I'll probably play through a second time on Hard with different races / classes. There are TONS of secrets! Some obvious, some you'll find completely on accident. I'm struggling to stop myself from looking things up but I have gotten completely stuck a couple times, but the game is still relatively new so trying to find answers to puzzles is a bit of a challenge, but it just makes you try to figure it out yourself more.I haven't checked out any workshop content seeing as the game is less than a week old, but I could see this being like Skyrim for me where I put 100+ hours into the game.

												Haven't gotten in too much gametime but beat the first game, and to say LoG2 is an improvement would be an understatement. The more open-world style of the game combined with the new and ever-changing outdoor environments breathe new life into the retro style the game capitalizes on.For the 2 hours I've played so far, I'd say if it's what you're into, go for it. Maybe not worth $20, but nonetheless a great game. IMPORTANT: For potential buyers, this RPG is NOTHING like Skyrim, Gothic, or any other popular third or first-person RPG's on the market. This game is grid-based (your character moves on an invisible grid), there are MANY puzzles and the combat is not simply point-and-click. It's still a great game, but appeals to a slightly different audience.			"

												Much like the first Legend of Grimrock, but on some serious steroids: as any good sequel should aspire to be. This modern dungeon crawler is an elegant mix of puzzles, combat, exploration, and an rpg system that makes each moment a rewarding challenge to overcome. You will die, you will be stumped enough to take a break for a day, but when you conquer each challenge, you'll feel like a ninja or a genius respectively (in some cases, both). That is the true magic of this game.If you're interest is so much as piqued, I highly recommend that you get this game. The campaign is really a piece of art. WIth all the mods that will come out in the upcoming months, you're sure to get your money's worth in time at minimum.			"

I really enjoyed Legend of Grimrock, even though I didnt know it was all contained ""inside"" of a tower. I had first imagined it being like skyrim, and didn't even know about the grid system. The puzzles were great and I had a very good time playing it. I have been playing Legend of Grimrock 2 for several hours now and it is truely awesome. It is everything the original was and much much more. GET THIS GAME!!! BUT before you do. realize that this game works on a grid system, and there are no player models!			"

												The best game I've played this year.  I loved this type of game when I was a teenager.I loved the last one too.  They have improved on almost everything - I'm still not keen on the magic system which seems underpowered and I'm rubbish at remebering the patterns so I only use 3 or 4 spells.  Another dual wielding character would probably be better but I always want ""my"" character to be a mage.Rambling  a bit now - This game is like a modern day version of Eye of the Beholder or Dungeon Master.  With the garphics on maximum and on my 4k screen it is treuly beutiful as well - much better than console ports look.If you aren't good with puzzles this might not be the game for you as they make up the majority of the game with a few fights to give your brain a rest in between.  Not quite finished it yet but once I do I'm going to go back and play the first one again.  I was playing Alien: Isoltaion before this but i've not even considered playing it over the last couple of weeks now I have this.  It isn't anywhere near as good.Everyone should buy it so they get cracking on the third one as soon as possible.  Or some DLC - I'm not normally a fan of extras but I want more!			"

												This game is excellent.  Hours worth of clever puzzles and exploring in the main quest as well as endless amounts of hours working with the dungeon editor. This game is unlike anything else and is definitely one of my best purchases on steam. Out of the 78 games I currently own this is definitely one of the best. 5/5			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a fantastic RPG. Elegantly designed, extremely challenging and built in an old school style with a modern game design lens. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic RPG.			"

												Much like the first Legend of Grimrock, but on some serious steroids: as any good sequel should aspire to be. This modern dungeon crawler is an elegant mix of puzzles, combat, exploration, and an rpg system that makes each moment a rewarding challenge to overcome. You will die, you will be stumped enough to take a break for a day, but when you conquer each challenge, you'll feel like a ninja or a genius respectively (in some cases, both). That is the true magic of this game.If you're interest is so much as piqued, I highly recommend that you get this game. The campaign is really a piece of art. WIth all the mods that will come out in the upcoming months, you're sure to get your money's worth in time at minimum.			"

												I missed out on the dungeon crawlers of old, even though I was playing computer games when they were popular. I heard about legend of Grimrock 1 while watching a youtube play-through of Betrayal at Krondor, which my older sister played when I was young. I really enjoyed Legend of Grimrock, even though I didnt know it was all contained ""inside"" of a tower. I had first imagined it being like skyrim, and didn't even know about the grid system. The puzzles were great and I had a very good time playing it. I have been playing Legend of Grimrock 2 for several hours now and it is truely awesome. It is everything the original was and much much more. GET THIS GAME!!! BUT before you do. realize that this game works on a grid system, and there are no player models!			"

												This game is very much worth the $20+ its costs. Its a throw back to the old tile based games of the 90s. Combat is great and challenging.The puzzles are unique and some, i found, quite hard. I\f you have played the 1st LoG then you will be fimailar with the movement and combat. But thats where it ends. Classes are new and there is a new race. skills are new and fun to spec into. If you like a new spin of and old play style please buy. It is very much worth your time and money.			"

												I was very excited for the first Grimrock, and remember playing it the day it came out with glee. It challenged me, intrigued me, and was thoroughly enjoyable...This game is not the same experience. I was not challenged like I was in the first, nor intrigued or found it enjoyable like the first. It went WAY BEYOND what I expected to feel and was FAR more challenging than the first, and thoroughly intriguing and and enjoyable by comparison to the first. This game makes the first Grimrock seem like a demo. Thats the best way to put it. Everything is streamlined, trimmed, made perfect. It is tough, but rewarding for when you succeed. It is filled to the brim with puzzles and challenges, treasures and secrets, magic and mystery. From breaking out of your cell in the first few seconds of the game to the climactic epic last battle, this game does not dissapoint even once. If you are perceptive, clever, and determined, then you will LOVE this game.			"

												I didn't play the first game, but I got this after watching a few Lets-Plays. First off, the graphics are AMAZING. The water is very realistic, the beaches are great, the forests are very atmospheric, and the dungeons have great atmosphere also. I've been playing on normal, and it's challenging while not being ridiculous, but also not too easy; I'll probably play through a second time on Hard with different races / classes. There are TONS of secrets! Some obvious, some you'll find completely on accident. I'm struggling to stop myself from looking things up but I have gotten completely stuck a couple times, but the game is still relatively new so trying to find answers to puzzles is a bit of a challenge, but it just makes you try to figure it out yourself more.I haven't checked out any workshop content seeing as the game is less than a week old, but I could see this being like Skyrim for me where I put 100+ hours into the game.

												I am not one usually into ""classic"" PC RPGs as I was primarily a console user during those years, but the production quality and modern presentation of both Grimrock 1 and Grimrock 2 meshes the classic concept with moderning gaming quite well im my opinion. Aside from some CPU-related performance issues in some of the forest areas, the game holds up exceptionally well in terms of graphics-performance. What I enjoyed most was the actual difficulty of the game on higher settings, which is quite rare these days regardless of what platform you use.Basically, if you played the first game, this game is superior in just about every way--graphics, character creation & customization, difficulty, puzzles, story, and scale of the game. Other than that, it is just plain enjoyable to people who appreciate quality RPG games--the ""indie"" label to me is completely misrepresentivie of the quality and production values of this game. If you have not played the first one, buy it. Now.			"

												I'm still at the beginning of the game (5h played so far), but the overall impression is great.Good graphic, good sound and, mostly, great gameplay. If you were fan of Dungeon Master and the Eye Of The Beholder saga (and many more, of course), this is probably what you have dreamt in the past 15 years, and now it's true. Explorations, fighting, enigmas and tons of secrets are there.Player evolution is good, but I have to wait a bit more to see how it is in latter sages of the game. Thumbs up! "

												This is my first review on Steam ever. I had to post about this absolutely fantastic game. It improves on the original by leaps and bounds. The outdoor environments alone make it a must-play, doubly-so if you enjoyed the first Legend of Grimrock. The additional races, classes, traits, new ""skill"" system, weapons, BOSSES, and level of customization depth make this game incredible for anyone who enjoys single player RPGs. I purchased it yesterday and I'm already 10 hours in. What a great game. Don't wait for it to go on sale; it is THAT good. Or better yet, support this developer so they keep making amazing games like this one. This is by far the best game I've played all year.10/10.			"

												More equipment, more monsters, cool new spells, several new character classes, a new character race, improved skill sets, double hand slots, and more, and more, and more!  And It's still grid-based!  More freedom to explore means better chance of leveling up and getting better gear before you even go into the major dungeons!  More flexibility in play style allows for self-challenges for improved re-playability.  There will be challenging puzzles, but that's what the game is all about!  There is no reason not to get Grimrock 2!  (Especially if you already have played the first game!)			"

												This is the very first game that I've pre-ordered and when I did that, I was pretty sure that it was going to worth it.I couldn't be more right.This game, like Legend of Grimrock 1, is an old-school dungeon crawler in which you create a party with four characters and...well crawl through dungeons :) But this time, the game is built on a HUGE area which covers both above and under ground areas. I'll be comparing this with LoG 1 but you'll get the idea even though you haven't played the first game.1-) I loved how day and night cycle of the world. First game takes place in an underground dungeon so the player has no idea whether it's day or night time. 2-) There are more classes and a whole new skill system. I don't know whether you'll like the new system or not but I think it's simple and elegant with 5 skill levels and milestones that provides you with additional abilities (for example; you get dual wield (yes we have dual wield option now) ability at 3rd level of light weapon skill.3-) In my opinion the game is way harder than the first one, but in a nice challenging way. Also the puzzles seem to be more sophisticated and somehow makes you feel like a genius when you solve them.I think these are the main differences of LoG 2. If you liked playing the first game or interested in old-school RPGs than this game is an awesome pick for you.Note: The date of this review is 16.10.2014 and the game is out for a day now. I'm saying this because there are some technical optimization problems with the current state of the game (like it has low frames at some areas) but I think this issue will be fixed with updates at a later date. Check this if you are reading this at a future time.			"

This series has caught the old school feel  and hope maybe some day a mod or this company will do some remakes if you know what I mean..  This is a solid good game and worth the price, sick home from school or just a rainy day this game is for you...  I'm really starting to love this series			"

												Beautiful looking game. Anti Aliasing not supported currently for some reason. FXAA Injector apparently works however I've not tried it. Kinda disappointed about that considering how excellent the PC options generally are. Borderless window mode supported. Puzzles are good and the atmosphere is excellent. Really reminds me of those choose your own adventure books I read as a kid. Can't comment on the story yet but the game follows LOG1 where there are no cut scenes except at the beginning and end. You can find letters and details in the world which provide lore which is great. If you want to immerse yourself in a dungeon within a mysterious island I recommend this game.			"

												This game is an old-school dungeon crawler that improves on everything over Grimrock 1 such as new classes, race, skills and some balance changes. Currently I'm testing 4-man fists only which was pretty overpowered in the first game and I definetly noticed a difference in the beginning. We'll see can it carry me to the end in normal difficulty. Did you like the first game? You'll definetly love this. Also if you don't like the original pictures of each race, you can import your own and have fun with the group.			"

												all in all this is a great game. if you liked the first legend of grimrock you're gona love this one as well. it has good atmosphere, looks gorgious as ♥♥♥♥, just take screenshots of things you're looking at and get yourself some totally radical wallpapers. it also has some great improvments in the battles your going to have. weapons have specials and there are more of them in general alongside with some interesting things such as guns and slings. the puzzles are good and there are some quite cool secrets around the place.the AI is better. no longer can you square dance your way through everything. sure it will still work but nowhere near as well as it did. or at least for me it didn't.the map is also a lot more open world compared to the first game. while in the first there were levels that you went through and onwards this game tends to branch out. the only thing I can say it gets wrong in my opinion is that in the first when you go down levels you feel as if you are progressing through a giant dungeon while this game is much more spread out so the levels may feel a lot smaller. nevertheless great game, its like skyrim with guns ~10/10			"

												This is the very first game that I've pre-ordered and when I did that, I was pretty sure that it was going to worth it.I couldn't be more right.This game, like Legend of Grimrock 1, is an old-school dungeon crawler in which you create a party with four characters and...well crawl through dungeons :) But this time, the game is built on a HUGE area which covers both above and under ground areas. I'll be comparing this with LoG 1 but you'll get the idea even though you haven't played the first game.1-) I loved how day and night cycle of the world. First game takes place in an underground dungeon so the player has no idea whether it's day or night time. 2-) There are more classes and a whole new skill system. I don't know whether you'll like the new system or not but I think it's simple and elegant with 5 skill levels and milestones that provides you with additional abilities (for example; you get dual wield (yes we have dual wield option now) ability at 3rd level of light weapon skill.3-) In my opinion the game is way harder than the first one, but in a nice challenging way. Also the puzzles seem to be more sophisticated and somehow makes you feel like a genius when you solve them.I think these are the main differences of LoG 2. If you liked playing the first game or interested in old-school RPGs than this game is an awesome pick for you.Note: The date of this review is 16.10.2014 and the game is out for a day now. I'm saying this because there are some technical optimization problems with the current state of the game (like it has low frames at some areas) but I think this issue will be fixed with updates at a later date. Check this if you are reading this at a future time.			"

												If you are looking for a RPG Dungeon crawl game, then this game is NOT it.This is a puzzle game.  Sure you fight monsters and explore a bit, but really, most of what you are doing is solving puzzles.I personally mearly tolerate puzzels. I do not really care for them.  In the first grimrock title there were the occasional puzzle, but in this game, its the main course.  It is not unusual to spend a bunch of time figure out how to get past some locked door, only to finally do so and go just a few more feet and find YET ANOTHER locked door with YET ANOTHER puzzel.  Then you open that passage and guess what?  Just arond the corner is another♥♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzel.Now if you really like puzzels, consider this an endorsement for this game.  If not, then stay away.			"

												This game disappointed me. The first LoG is fantastic. The big difference between the two is that while in LoG you almost always could progress to the next level, and the really crazy puzzles were for secret stuff; in LoGII the crazy puzzles are in the way all the time. Progressing in this game required me looking up in the internet all the time. I never once had to look anything up on LoG to finish it. To find all the secrets yeah, but I didn't *have to*.  Additionally LoGII gives the impression that you could complete the 'open world' levels in any order but this isn't entirely true. Some have to be completed in order becasue the solution to puzzles are at the end of one section. However, to know this you have to look it up on the internet. I recoomend LoG the first one, but this one, is just a very very crappy sequel. All the effort seems to have gone to making the graphics look good (which my mac can barely handle at the lowest settings), while gameplay didn't improve. If you play it don't use firearms (they're weak) don't use your golden keys willy nilly and get the snake charmer's rope to go down holes.			"

												The ""modern execution"" of this ""oldschool"" game modernizes all the wrong things.  The combat is real-time but movement is still grid-locked and the perspective still first-person, so you will be wasting precious seconds spinning in place to get turned the right way while your enemies get free hits in; ruining any sense of ""action"" or ""realism"" that real-time combat should normally create.It's the spell interface that really ruins the experience, though.  Picking out the correct order of nondescript runes that cast a spell might be (at best) a cute mechanic in a better game than this one, but when you're forced to do it in the middle of (already kludgey) real-time combat for every spell you will ever cast, it feels much more like you're fighting the game than the actual monsters.It's a horrible mix of combat elements on par with the likes of Final Fantasy XIII.  Except that game was at least playable.			"

												Maybe just a personal preference, but I did not enjoy my time in the game.  Could be true that you can never really go back, but the lack of modern RPG features is kind of a downer.  It does not help that the game is punishing to early mistakes, even on easy mode.  Expect a lot of internet research to fill out the missing information from the game, and the manual.  Even at a sub-$10 price, I have not found the game to be worth the time or the money.  Your mileage may vary, of course.			"

												Man, I'm really trying to like it, and I'm going to keep trying, but I just can't bring myself to enjoy this.The combat is similar to LoG 1, but enemies are much tougher. Not in a difficult way, but in a tedious way. It takes way too many hits to kill even the most basic of enemies and it gets boring after a few hours.The above-ground island portion isn't really that great. I think they were going for an open world kind feel, but it doesn't work. I only find myself having fun when I go underground to the dungeons, but those parts don't last nearly as long as I'd like. The Puzzles aren't great. They're either too simple, have a stupid solution involving searching the walls for a hidden button, or require an item you don't have yet. Or maybe you missed it all the way back, you have no way of knowing.There's no real sense of doom like in Grimrock 1. Then, I had no idea how far down I was or what was next. Now I just find a puzzle, see if I can solve it, and if I can't I look for a dungeon. They try to replicate the mysterious story of Grimrock 1 by adding the Island Master, but it's not as interesting or thrilling. ""Ooh some dude brought you to his spooky island with monsters and traps, scary..."" Reminds me of the first live action Scooby Doo movie.Like I said, I'm going to keep trying because I loved Grimrock 1 so much, but I'm having a lot of trouble enjoying this one and I can't give it a positive review.

												Brutally difficult, and not in a good way.I played through the game on 'Normal' - heaven help anyone who chooses a higher difficulty level. The start feels relatively gentle, and adventuring around the island is fun for the first couple of zones, but before very long the difficulty ramps up to a frustrating degree. You're encouraged to sidetrack to other areas if the one you're in is beyond your current level, but there's very little indication what would be suitable (and at multiple points I was finding that there wasn't anywhere that was a suitable level for me to go).The game seems to be designed for frustration. Dealing with multiple enemies at once is a near impossibility; the only way to deal with most of them is to kite them away and dance around them in an open area, and in many cases if you find yourself surrounded it's almost guaranteed to mean having to reload. And that's before we get to enemies like the mosquitoes (which appear in large groups, have high evasion to melee attacks, and melt your health if they surround you... which they will), fire elementals (which appear after certain quest triggers, charge at you before you have time to react and two-shot three members of your party... and again, always come in groups), and the petrification mechanic  (kind of like an instant death, only with this one you can't even revive with potions). I like where it went with some of the puzzles, but the way everything gels together it was quite a frustrating experience overall. I'd be hard-pressed to recommend it on, to be honest.			"

												First impressions: if you like the first Legend of Grimrock, you'll most likely like this sequel as well. It adds in the one, big element I wanted for the first game and that is the outdoor setting. You still got your dungeons and caverns, but now you can also move outside as well, in the same manner of course.The controls are pretty much the same, but at the same time the game feels much smoother. Also the monsters seem to have a bit more AI, as they can do the good ol' square dance as well.			"

												After 5 hours of gameplay I can attest that it's a solid sequel to Grimrock. It's biggerer and betterer in many ways, which also makes it less novel and quaint, but so it is with sequels. There's outside locations in addition to the traditional dungeons. The forests look nice, but do not conform to the grid based movement system as well as the dungeons. You can walk underwater and drown. The skill system has been revised, which seems like a good idea. The world is more wide and vibrant compared to the first game, but the best bits are the dungeons which feel just like Grimrock 1 with the combat and puzzles.P.S. there are more character classes; one of them is Farmer.If you liked the first game, you'll probably like Grimcock 2.

												Legend of Grimrock 2 achieves what it was supposed to be: A great old school dungeon crawl. Is it perfect? Not quite. Is it great? Oh yes!!! The graphics are amazing for a game of this genre, the ambiance of each level is unique and LoG2 has the greatest looking monsters I have ever seen in a Dungeon Crawl. As much as the first Legend of Grimrock was a great game LoG2 pushes the bar even higher. (They did a really great thing by adding boss battles)Be warned, if you are a stupid person or have slow keyboard reflexes stay away from this game. The puzzles can be quite a challenge in the later game and (on normal and hard difficulties) the monsters are quite hard to beat. This is not an easy game, kind of like the Dark Souls of Dungeon Crawls. I definitely enjoyed every minute playing this game and would heartily recommend it to anyone considering trying it out.9/10			"

												Absolutely brilliant! Nice graphics replete with moving trees and greenary, clouds and day/night cycles weather(well fog effects, no rain like DM II though) in the outdoor sections, even water with reflections and clear enough to see into (and although you can explore underwater and activate switches etc (you can even catch fish) however you cannot fight, but beware because there are creatures that can hurt you and you also need to have a way out to catch your breath when needed). Add to that the atmospherics and eerie sounds you have a very immersive environment to play in. The level designs are complex and challenging (open world with the player choosing what to tackle next, and puzzles that require lateral thinking) and the depth of gameplay will have you fully engaged. To cover it all would take alot of space, so to keep it short I will just say it's a ""must have"" for any fan of the RPG dungeon crawl-party/resource management genre!			"

												Grimrock gives you the same feeling as Myst. They both give you a wonderful journey of discovery into a weird but internally consistent world with great puzzles. Overall, it's a wonderful, wonderful experience.I have my gripes, though. The game is delightfully hard, as in challenging, but also stupidly hard. There are a lot of blind ""I lose"" buttons that are going to kill playes the first time, every time. You'll also die a lot because there aren't any hotkeys nor any pause button and you have to click really fast through inventory menus. The game math is opaque, counter-intuitive and unbalanced. Did you know that wizards are worse at being wizards than the hybrid wizard/figther class? Did you know that weapon damage becomes irrelevant to how much damage you deal in the second half of the game? Did you know that firearms are useless? Etc. Etc. Maybe the game can be balanced through patches.Overall, a really great game with some really big frustrations. Maybe the smart choice is to wait until 2015 or 2016 for it to be patched up.			"

												Legend of Grimrock II offers a compelling experience between exploration, a minimalist but endearing story and pretty decent graphics. This sequel manages to cross its own style with a Myst-like experience, where you end up on an island and have to figure everything out. The freedom of movement within the island is quite enjoyable : will you keep trying this dungeon with tough enemies but greater rewards or will you come back to it once you've leveled up a bit ?The leveling, fighting and magic systems are okay but show their limits around the two thirds of the game. Once you've discovered most of the good stuff and figured out most spells, the game becomes really repetitive. The fact that the fights tend to pile up in the end made me wish the game was shorter, just so I'd be done with it. Apart from this end game tediousness, the clever riddles and the rich exploration are enough to justify playing it.			"

												Hugely expanded sequel to the previous version. It is much harder in places and you will be tempted to look up spoilers. There are many challenges which feel ""too hard"". True - there are some that are easier than others, and I would chastise the design in giving too few clues.As an example, you don't learn the ""light"" spell for your caster until a couple of hours into the game.The previous version was a fairly linear challenge. The rule of LoG2 is if you die trying (a few times), run away.Then, get more skill points, find a better sword and return to the challenge.			"

												A superb sequel that surpasses the scope of the original game in every way. LoG 2 is a refreshing breath of fresh air in a market full of games with lengthy tutorials and hand-holding, as it requires you to figure things out for yourself, to experiment and rewards you richly for doing so - both psychologically and in-game with secrets and treasures. Old school awesome.			"

												Intro: For me, Legend of Grimrock 2 came out of nowhere. I didn't ever expect a sequel to the first game, but when I saw it I picked it up based on how good the first game was. If you are new to Grimrock or new to Dungeon crawling games I recomend playing the first Game. The original game is slower and teaches you the basics much better than its faster cousin.Gameplay: Much like the first game, you have the same style of dragging and dropping for inventory management. Clicking on characters weapons to attack and drawing patterns in the runes to cast spells. Navigating the menus can be clunky if your in a pinch, but if you use the numbered hot keys you shouldn't have a problem. Puzzles: Puzzles are a big part of Dungeon crawling games. The puzzles in Grimrock 2 are weaker than the first game. Most of the time with puzzles you won't even know there is anything to solve. The game progresses along until you hit a brick wall and are stuck. And unless you did a super specific thing the game didn't elaborate on you will be stuck. The puzzles are challenging don't get me wrong, but when you don't receive enough information to know there is a puzzle to solve, it's frustrating.Open World(Not really but we will call it that): Unlike The first Grimrock, the second opens the player up to a bunch of areas really fast. Much like Dark Souls, going to areas you are not prepared for will get you killed. The ""open world"" gives the player a sence of exploring foreign lands and although the back tracking sucks, it makes the player learn the island and get familar with it as their home.Random thoughts: This game is exactly as it looks: Challenging, fun, and thought provoking. Prepare your internet browsers, because some of these puzzles are random af. Involving time of day, standing in certain spots for periods of time or digging multiple times. Conclusion: All in all its a good buy for a fan of the  genre or franchise. If your new to these kinds of games, wait for a sale and pick up the first game. Who knows there could be a christmas bundle.			"

												Dungeon Crawler game. A TON of puzzles. I had no trouble with most of the puzzles but some of them were pretty rough or obtuse. I found myself playing this game for many hours and enjoying it. At least the first 10 hours(23 hours to beat). You will probably end up using a guide if you get stuck. I had skipped many areas thinking I had to return later but when I returned I had just to solve a puzzle that actually did not require returning later. It is cool in the open worldish aspects it has. *8/10*			"

												This game is pretty frickin good. The controls are kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥tbh, but if you like oldschool dungeon crawlers, this is the game for you.Pros:-Grid based-NOT turn-based (ie, time matters so you can't just sit in a spot thinking of what to do for 8 hours); realtime gameplay-Solid classes-Good combat, rewards player skill-Fairly challenging puzzles, if also ridiculously obscure-YOUR PROJECTILES DON'T DISAPPEAR AFTER A SINGLE USE (minus Firearms, but you get a ton of ammo anyway)Cons:-Clunky UI/Item menu-Clunky combat, until you get used to it-Not turn based; could be a con if you like that sort of thing-Clunky controls for maneuveringOverall:9/10, really solid game. The UI/Control problems take the 1 point off, but once you get used to it it's not TOO bad.Item menus suck regardless though, especially since the game doesn't pause while you're in them.			"

												Let me start off by saying I may complain a bit in this review but I still recommend this game.  Also these are just my opinions of the game, I am sure there are many people who will say ""well I did not experience these problems blah blah blah""  what I am saying is don't be butthurt by my opinion this is just what I have experience and felt for myself.Cons- Some puzzles are highly frustrating or very cryptic while I enjoy difficult puzzles some are extremely hard to decifer which can lead to frustration in people new to this type of game.Some classes seem good but in reality they are not take the knight his dodge increase with shields is broken or at least it looks broken to me (will be patched if it is im sure)Was not impressed with the alchemist guns there never seemed to be enough ammo and the guns were scarce. Potion making was awesome though.Exploration was very fun in the beginning but later on it got very frustrating (for me).Spells seemed weak IMO at times they would hit hard but most of the time even if the monster was weak to it they seemed over all weaker from the last game.Characters seem to miss allot even if you get accuracy up until you get into the upper levels of accuracy.Monsters can hit you over and over and over at times while you wait to recharge your characters attacks.Near the end the boss fights just throw enemies at you which is not very fun they could have done something different with the boss fights to make them more interesting.Puzzles get a little tedious after awhile because they are mostly just redos from previous puzzles with little differences.Underwater battles are irritating especially if you don't have a trident or spear.Not a whole lot of enemy variation.I felt there were not a whole lot of weapon variations either but this may be nitpicking.No voice acting from the master of the island (I feel a mysterious voice talking on his notes and maybe a random sentence when sleeping or something would have been awesome).I know that most of the story is figured out with stone heads and notes from the island master but I feel at times besides looking for a way off the island you really didn't know why you were exploring the areas looking for power gems.Armor sets do not have set bonuses so finding them all is good but doesn't make much of a difference.ProsI like the night and day cycle especially for some of the puzzles.weapon special attacks were pretty good.graphics looked good.(not that this really should count for scoring a game.)Level design was great in most areas and it kept it fresh to have different level designs.Most puzzles were fun to solve.Map in this game is extremely helpful so is the compass and watch.The armor sets looks cool even if they didn't get set bonuses.Each enemy had unique attacks (don't drop the ethereal dagger)Sound effects were done very well.Potions made are very useful.For the price lots of hours of gameplay especially with workshop dungeons and such.Good unique character races with good pros and cons to using them.While I enjoyed this game I also got much more frustrated with this one, way more than I did with the first one which is very very awesome (mine is owned from Good old Games and not in my steam account). By the time I got to the end of this game I was ready for it to be over, maybe I should have taken a break from it but it was interesting enough that I wanted to finish it.  I will be taking a long break from it and then downloading allot of workshop dungeons when they become available and I feel like playing some more.Graphics 7/10Sound  8/10Combat 5/10Gameplay 7/10Story 4/10Replayability 9/10Final score 6.6 or 7 rounded up definately worth getting.

												So Ive had this game for some time, and Ive playe dit, then stopped, played it again, stopped,, and yet again. I ask myself why I keep stopping my play through every time I delete this, and the same answer comes up. Its tedious and boring. Grimrock one was a favorite of all of my games. Very classical style of gaming. In grimrock two its all about moving around attacking then repositioning. Not a big deal if you have room to work with. The problem isnt the combat.The problem with this game that Ive found is that you NEED to use guides for a good portion of the puzzles. ""But why? Shouldnt you be able to figure them out on your own? Thats the point of a Puzzle game."" I would think to myself. Yes, it would be, if a good portion of these puzzles actually had tangable and relivant clues to solving them. A majority of them are reduntant. Per example: The Glyph Room. You all too often will see a stone face shooting a projectile. And all too often will see stone plates on the floor. You get no hint. Just the room name. How would you even know that you are supposed to draw out the spell on the floor that is being cast from the shooting wall-head? You wouldnt. You get no hints about it, and no relivant clue anyplace. Another example ""The Silent one has a friend. Head east into the sun."" Alright...which takes you directly into a tree one step later from that point once you find the Silent Statue head that says ... That paired withthe fact most dungeons, unlike Grimrock 1, have only one way through them in addition to needing to find some obscurecrack in the wall to open a secret door make this game nearly unplayable without looking for clues and spoilers online. I didnt enjoy this half as much as Grimrock 1. It just wasnt that good. The story isnt even there if you are looking for one. You were prisoners on a ship...some magic magnet pulled your ship ashore. You begin the game. All you know is some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥running the place is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that likes to leave you notes about how hes a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats your story. Nothing else to it.Cant say I recommend this game over Grimrock 1. The puzzles alone are annoying and only make sense to the creator of them, rather than the player. The maps are♥♥♥♥♥♥ and mostly a cluster♥♥♥♥ of come back later, the games plot lacks, one way dungeons, and enemies with far too many HP even with skilled adventurers and powerful weapons. Play Necrodancer, youll be playing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥here just with less reward.			"

												Overall it is a nice effort, I wish I could give a neutral score, but in its current form I feel like I do not recommend this, except if you are a diehard fan of the genre. I know there are not much good crawler games nowadays, but... well... meh. Wait for a discount in my opinion. Or even, some roguelikes (or even lites, blasphemy!) might suit you better. Pros-- open world, nice visuals-- many options in equipment-- good puzzles, although I felt some of them are designed to be time sinks+ steam workshop supportMixed-- lack of tutorial/guide - I like this, but it is not for everyone-- have to get all of your ammo back - makes you ammo concious :)Cons-- equipment doesnt feel to make a difference, inventory management lacking... especially with crates and sacks-- tedious combat (kiting style), if you are cornered with two enemies, it might be just over -> armor is a kind of decoration; dps is the thing-- magic feels lacking tbh-- much much limb wounds. really?

												I didn't like the first one, but figured I would give it a chance; see if they improved any of the things I didn't like. They did not. If anything, it's worse than Grimrock I. It is as if the entire game was designed to use time, rather than to create an enjoyable experience. Inventory management is clunky, magic system is counterintuitive, the puzzles are time-sinks, and combat is backwards. Most everything you do in the game requires WAY too many clicks, especially the combat, which forces the player to circle-strafe enemies while only moving in a grid and only turning 90 degrees. Like if I wanted to design a combat system that was as terrible and time-wastingly frustrating as possible, I would probably have not done this badly.Also the story - what of it I got to before I quite - is trite and dumbish.If you want a positive out of me: It's a very pretty game.All this to say: If you loved the first one, you'll love this one, if you hated the first one, you'll hate this one even more. It's even more Grimrocky.			"

												If you liked Legend of Grimrock, or hell, any dungeon crawler, you'll love Legend of Grimrock 2. It's a straight upgrade over the first in every way imaginable; better environments, most monster variety, way more classes (inlcuding the farmer! Who levels up by...eating food?!?), and better systems generally over the first. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game!			"

The game does a better job at storytelling through experiencing the world around you.The map is connected (also on your map) and feels a lot bigger. New race options are not that special, but overall this is a real good improvement over part 1. :)			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 builds on its predessor and brings more puzzle solving, loot finding and monster battling.It brings new and more open level design, with free roaming outdoor areas, into more narrow dungoens.  With many new features that gives new and interesting puzzles, secrets and traps.The skilltree have been given an overhaul for the better. Where swords, axes, daggers and maces each had their own skill line, we now get light weapons and heavy weapons. In LoG I once got an awesome axe, but I wasn't using axes, so I got very sad... But no more! Now you can create a party that can use all the awesome loot you're going to find!If you liked the first Legend of Grimrock, then you're gonna like this one too. If you don't know what LoG is, then check out the original.			"

												I am going to start this review of by saying one simple sentence before i get into the Nitty Gritty of why you should buy this game!""This game is my personal GOTY for 2014 and every minute is a imerrsive blast of fun that i don't want to stop""Now onto the review!Firstly I will talk about the points i think make this game EXTREMELY good.- Gameplay- Immersion- Visuals- Sounds- Unique-nessThis game in it's gameplay does something that other games simply cannot capture, from the open worlds of skyrim all the way to one of my personal favourite RPG's (Fallout). What it does is something i don't FEEL in games anymore, it captures feelsing i didn't think a game could make and then encourages me to play the game with the freedom of my own mind.What i mean by this is the game immerses you completely in it's world, It never feels like you are playing a game but you are a crew of prisoners, fighting your way through a beautiful and luxurious island. Every atmosphere feels unique to the game and immerses you in the adventure, you REALLY FEEL like you are on an adventure, not PLAYING an adventure in a GAME. Like i said, i've loved and played many RPG's buy this is one of the few games that have captures a pure, undying sense of ADVENTURE from within me.The gameplay is also something i love, the world feels seamless and connected which helps to support and ecourage you to explore and look for secrets. It's like small open-worlds, this way you can explore a lot and look for every secret - without overbearing amounts of land to cover. It's a game where doing puzzles, finding secrets feels extremely rewarding each time.The combat in this game is what i believe to hit-or-miss, either you will enjoy it or... You will not. It's using an older generation of RPG as inspiration, Q and E to turn, then WASD to move around on a grid. Combat is real time, with a turn based aspect. Meaning you and the enemy attack eachother based on spell and weapon cooldowns. I believe the charm of the game (being the older style RPG) is either hit-or-miss, i myself love it though and it adds a unique charm that no other games capture!My next point is the class and race system, it's executed so well i needn't say much other than you get a good amount of race and classes to build a squad that suits you, everythign plays completely differently than other classes. Later skill building further increases variation to a point where you can do what you want, and play how you want (and if you understand the farmer class, i assume you are a god at this game.)Lastly the sound and visuals, they both work well together with the immersion to create a world that looks realistic enough to tottaly engross you, but still fantasy enough to really give off that old RPG feel. The games graphics are not taxing (but then my computer can handle anything) but still manage to blow me away even more than most recent releases ( *cough* Shadows of mordor *cough* )Overall this game is absolutely a brilliant game, developing it's strengths from the first game and making something near perfect. I have little to no weak points about this game so far and even if i did, i wouldn't bother putting them here simply because they would be as miniscule as; Only skill points and not stat points, or i am bad at puzzles and my brain hurts.Basically you want this game, it's superb, it's fun, it's beautiful and it does one thing i deem most important.It's unique.

												Legend of Grimrock II Is a realistic fourth person shooter, third person magicka simulator, second person stabbing simulator, and first person tank simulator. It also has a unique sandbox mod where you get to flap your arms about like a 6-month old baby who♥♥♥♥♥♥his diaper again while pretending to be creative. But in all realness, you play as four ♥♥♥♥ing people super-glued to eachother, if one decides to jump off a cliff, ""hey, the rest of us didn't have other plans for today!"" The first boss you fight looks like it happens really early in the game, but in fact you first have to run around looking at every crevice EXCEPT the arena to actually end up fighting the boss, solving puzzles you feel proud of to have discovered without the help of the wiki, only to realize that it was the only way to progress through the game.After the first boss there are hilariously square pools of water that you can dive into, making this game a diving and jumping-into-square-holes simulator. If you manage to jump into a hole that has no water in it and is too deep, your party's team will brek their feet and YOU CAN'T MOVE ANYMORE. Making this a ""wait for a huge♥♥♥♥♥frog to jump down and lick your pubes off because you stepped on your big toe."" simulatorI believe a new era of Diving Simulators are upon us, comrades! Go forth! And ffs will you learn how to hit that guy square in the head? Thats the 4th miss in a row you♥♥♥♥♥♥11/10  ~IGN  ""It's alright"" "

												I am not a huge fan of this one like I was the first. I picked the game up, without ever knowing anything about it, and I absolutely loved it, the idea of trying to escape from a dungeon on the top of a mountain, but I also loved the gameplay, and the compact feel of the game. The second one is nothing like that, and if you didn't care too much about the interior of the first game, then this would be a great buy for you, but I cannot recommend this game because I am not a fan of the settings.

Its a fantastic rpg all around. If you dont have this game and like dungeon crawlers then get it.			"

												Alright here is a review of GrimRock 2. Ive played what maybe 4 hours or so and ive found it exciting, fun and etc etc. Its a good game and makes you go, ""oh god is that a skeleton knight? yeah yeah it is"" as it lies in a heap of bones and dust before you and you feel great. But then you come across Some areas like the bog, now if you play it you know what i mean the two most annoying enemies that just reproduce constantly and just like making you there play thing like to wander like theres no tommorow, the frogs and mosquittos but ill get to that later. Now after being lost for about an hour i was studying my map (DO NOT TURN ON THE OLD SCHOOL MAPPING YOU WILL QUIT AFTE AN HOUR) i finally found where to go and this non linear world i thought i was in just shrunk to a stone corridor with a big red arrow telling you where to go. After discovering that dissapointment i entered the Swamps Duengeon (Hogs Burrow or something)  i got destroyed by the boss in there by all the poision but i was able to bust out with my solo knight and was limping to the nearest blue crystal as if i had to actually carry my three dead compainions until i ran into one of the most janky♥♥♥♥♥annoying enemies the mossquitto swarm. Boom i thought i was done i hadn't saved for an hour and i was going to die but i was so close i could taste that blue crystal that i insert into my compainions bodies, because its never explained how it actually works, so i tried to juke and jive this tukley through the repeating portals and thought i can do this. I can do THIS. Then i ran into the most annoying thing in the game, (no not the frog) the CONTROLS for the party which are so laggy and out of timed that turned me round ran me round and into a dead end then i knew it was over, Mosquittos can only be  killed by mages even thought there the size of rabbits with wings my knight can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥to them and just let them swarm him like there the actul size of mosquittos. I was very sad and angry as the last thing i saw was a mosquitto coming for all the blood in my single knights body with ""YOU ARE DEAD"" slowly fade in. Then i wrote this review with no biased opion.I this game is great, it is slow to start and you can get super♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥very fast but when you slay a whole room full of mummies, you just feel like you've actually acheieved something, hopefully after a couple of hours have passed i will be ready to hop straight back in and hopefully will you when you, play it.8/8			"

												Grimrock 2 is an oldest of schools game. Move around in a grid-based ""dungeon"", find items, solve puzzles, kill monsters. Pretty good if you know what you're getting into (I didn't). My problem is the complete lack of instructions and user conveniences. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to open the starting cage. I have no idea what the basic mechanics are. I found food, do I need to eat it? And where are the hotkeys for combat? Or picking things up? A more patient player might have fun but to me it's just frustrating.I'm not saying the game is bad but I didn't enjoy what little I played so I can't recommend it. "

												SPOILER PSEUDO-REVIEW: After being stuck at the ""Go in the circle and call the guardians"" spot, I had to find a walkthrough online to know what I was doing wrong. Turns out you can't even do anything there yet so it's just trolling you out. You need to go north first where there's 9 pressure tiles. After reading online, at my surprise, you obviously had to put down objects on the tiles to form the shape of an X. Why at my surprise you say? Because I did the very same thing the first time I got there but nothing happened and this is why I've been going back trying to call those guardians whatsoever and ended up searching online. Which brings me to another problem with this game, 80% of the time I just can't take items from the ground, I need to try from another angle until it work which is very annoying.  The game, despite being in the perfect setting for it, is not turn-based and doesn't even have any option to make it so. Why? It becomes a game of speed (with those limited controls) rather than a game of strategy and this might be a downer for some other people.I would suggest you give it a try before you buy. "

												I have played the game for about 6 hours and I am not convinced that it is as good as many people claim it is. I find the control scheme very annoying (needing SIX keys to walk around, and needing to right-click on weapons to use them, let alone using magic which requires numerous clicks -- and all of that in real-time). The enemies are kind-of underwhelming, just standing in front of you and hitting you -- unless you ran into enemies that are far too high-level for you, which can easily happen. There are some pretty annoying puzzles (invisible switches, items that are hidden without the game giving any indication of where you have to look, be-fast-and-move-to-the-correct-spot-or-you-die challenges, and puzzles whjch basically require you to die multiple times before you can actually get a glimpse of what you need to do to solve them). The character upgrades are too rare, and it is too easy to make a mistake in constructing your characters (I made an alchemist who uses firearms, but now I find that firearms and ammo for them are very hard to come by, while I have found fantastic bows with reusable arrows that I cannot use). Fortunately, enemies that are defeated do not return, so that's a plus. But overall, I find the fun factor not so high that I am keen to continue.What REALLY hurts the game is the complete lack of any story. Why are you doing the things that you do? Why do you walk around here? Why not just stay on the beach, build a big fire, and kill turtles for dinner until you are rescued? I don't feel that ""exploring for the sake of exploring"" is very rewarding. Ultimately, the whole story seems to come down to something like: walk around until you have collected 20 power gems, and then you can unlock the final door. Hooray!I played the first Grimrock for a while, and that game feels much better. There is an actual incentive for you to delve into the dungeon, and the atmosphere is suffocatingly claustrophobic. While in Grimrock II you are just walking through woods without rhyme or reason. The atmosphere of this game is just off.All in all, I am on the fence as far as Grimrock II is concerned. It is not that it is a bad game, it is just not as good as the first one, and I rather play something else than more Grimrock II. So I have to rate it down, partly in compensation for all the up-ratings.			"

												Same looking dungeons and a lot of padding is what keeps this game down.I expected for example a ruins dungeon would look different than an archives dungeon, ora dungeon about plant enemies would have different looks and design.Maybe find bookcases in the Archives, signs hanging in the ceiling, tomes, journals, portraits and tables or chairs, it looks the same as the ruins dungeon and has none of the things I mentioned.Maybe in a ruins dungeon you could find statues, notable landmarks or places, it looks the same as others and has none of those things.Maybe in a dungeon thats populated by plant enemies the walls could be covered by a lot of foliage, a strange underground tree could somehow be there, the same looking dungeon.A dungeon that is below a cemetery, you know where I am going with this one right?At least this one has one thing diferent some walls have alcoves with two dead bodies in them.All of them look the same, after 28 hours I can't bring myself to finish it.There is a certain puzzle that just did it for me and its dugeons too.You are require to know/figure out a certain combination before entering the cemetery and its dungeon.When you are at the entrance of the cemetery it tells you that its combination is found in another dungeon, in the archives, my problem was that I already explored that dungeon before reading that. My archives map is supposedly complete.All the dungeons before it looked the same, monotunous, you are telling me I have to go back and explored it all over again? I have to find a secret? Maybe the document that holds its combination is a journal which you can flip pages and read it, it can't just be just little note right?Sadly I did went back to archives, luckily I had an old save before leaving that dungeon, explored it, and explored it, nothing, was it a secret? I don't know, I was already bored of the ""same looking dungeon"" problem.I search the solution to the cemetery entrance in youtube and went forward, had to turn the graphics all the way down again because I get massive frame drops in outside environments SOMETIMES, so it could be a problem with the game's view distance rendering too much?The cemetery was a nice different change of pace but when I got to its two dungeons and its combination like puzzles again, well thats it.I'm bored, the crypt and the catacombs look exactly the same as all of the dungeons before them, more puzzles that just take a lot of time or just as problematic or obscure as the one I mentioned and I can't bring myself to press on.

												This is one game that I really want to like but I can't.World does not look like world more like disjointed theme park. It pretends to be slow clicky tile dungeon yet large part of combat is - dodging. You can easily mess up character builds and the combat will punish you mercilessly. I did not like many of the puzzles because they replace the ""doh!"" punch with ""pixel hunting again"" sight.Pity is this game is not bad by mistake or low funding, it is bad by sweaty design - trying too hard and forgetting it should be fun and games in the first place. Well, it is not all that bad, it is just not good fun. "

												I went into this game having played the first one and loving it. But this time around I heard the game would mostly take place outside and I was super excited. At first it was awesome just like the first game with the unique combat and nice scenery. But then you get into the game and the entire premise of the game revolves around a very simple, but long task. At first it seems fine, but 15hrs into the game and still doing the same thing it got pretty boring. Then finishing the game the ending didn’t seem to reward all of the monotonous collecting. Don’t get me wrong, the puzzles are mostly great and the scenery is amazing, but overall I finished the game and felt that it wasn’t worth it overall.			"

It was bringing old school dungeon crawling gameplay to the next generation with better graphics and ideas learned in modern times. It was a success and one of my favorite games of 2012. Fast forward three years later and I finally get the chance to play Legend of Grimrock 2. Its the expanded sequel that brought a new open world experience as well as new monsters, puzzles and challenges to face.Overall Gameplay ThoughtsEschewing its previously more directed experience in a dungeon, Legend of Grimrock 2 takes place on a very large island. The real-time first person tile-based RPG is back with a few new tricks. You now have eight character classes to choose from including magical warriors, alchemists and farmers. There’s a few new races and faces with new skill trees that you’re given far too few skill points to spend into. All of which takes place on an island named….Nex apparently. Your mission is...to...I guess survive on the island and figure out its mysteries. It's not hard to feel like the sequel was where the developers included anything and everything they could just to do it. I put in five hours before I called it a day, fair warning.Story and Atmosphere ThoughtsThe game starts out with an animated CGI cutscene that depicts your group of prisoners getting shipwrecked on an island. An opening scene that is a little jarring (and an unnecessary expense) change from LoG1’s opening scene with still images. Somehow, that cutscene conveyed even less story about why your group of survivors here and what their purpose is. It’s the first sign that the story just isn’t as good this time around. All you really get is the island’s “owner” taunting you with written notes and giant stone face statues giving you cryptic clues and hints about the island as well as what you should do to move on. Neither of which really does it for me this time. Granted, LoG1’s story was pretty light as well but there was something to it that made me want to see what was going on. Here? There’s no reason for me to explore, outside of just doing it for completion sake.It doesn't help that the atmosphere of LoG1 is gone. It’s no longer an old dungeon that has seen far too many people die in it. The soft howling wind, the scratching of enemy’s claws nearby, the sense that danger could be right around the corner, its just not here. Instead, it’s an island of themed areas. You’ve got the graveyard here, the beach there, a giant pyramid over there and a forest behind you, among other areas. When you've got the ocean waters acting as a barrier instead of a solid wall, it breaks the immersion. It's little things like this that hurt the game's experience.Combat PonderingsI said in my previous review of Legend of Grimrock 1 that the combat was balanced on a razor’s edge. If it strayed just a little from that balance, it would cease to be enjoyable. Well, the combat in LoG2 strays. I found myself in combat situations far too many times and against way too many opponents in cramped rooms. Where I would then be easily surrounded and slowly beaten to death in a war of attrition. The only changes to the combat system on your end is improvements to the magic casting system. Which, sure, the magic system is nicer to use. However, the combat system is still largely the same system as before. Circle around enemies, spam your weapons/abilities off cooldown as often as possible and hope the enemies die before your group gets done in. Oh and if you lose anyone, well, you’re going to be done in quickly.Enemies have new AIs (though I noticed that they would often get stuck with indecision) with new moves to avoid the typical strategy of the previous game. Which I would be ok with this change because it would force new strategies to be developed. But then I get quickly surrounded by enemies and killed off because I got stuck in yet another corner with three or more enemies trying to gnaw my face off. I signed up for a game about surviving with my wits and getting through tricky puzzles. I didn’t sign up for a combat spree-a-thon where I slaughter hundreds of enemies in long battles of attrition.Dying in Death TrapsThere are games that pull off death traps well, as part of the experience. You have to be careful how many times you use them, especially if you’re wanting to advance the plot along. I find the most effective ones are death traps used to teach players to be more careful and wary of their surroundings. But LoG2 doesn’t give you the clues to tell you that what you’re about to do is a bad idea. I died at least seven to ten times in five hours from pointless death traps. It’s a ton of trial-and-error gameplay that I got sick of in a real hurry.PC Settings Menu & Optimization ProblemsAll of the settings from LoG1 return and with a few new addition. Windowed, Borderless,  Fullscreen and a good selection of resolution options. V-Sync for which you’ll probably want triple buffering because the screen tearing is hideous otherwise. There’s a new Render Quality slider which substantially changes how good everything looks. Texture resolution, texture filtering, shadow quality and SSAO quality sliders with high/medium/low options. Field of view slider isn’t available but the standard field of view should be fine. Music and sound effect sliders are here with individual mute buttons. Settings wise, it has everything you’ll need.Legend of Grimrock 2 is horribly optimized. Even on the lowest graphical settings, my framerate would tank to 45 FPS just standing around in a forest/desert/beach with no visible enemies nearby. Get some fighting going and it tanks further. It isn’t consistent what will bring the framerate down. Its not even that great a looker. Sure, the underground levels, the creatures and animations look fine. But the outdoor levels? With the trees and plant life? They seem...merely adequate. It’s frustrating though as the game will lag at random times, making travel not nearly as smooth as it should be.Final ThoughtsLegend of Grimrock 1 was a title where less was more. Legend of Grimrock 2 seems to think that more is more. I don't agree. The atmosphere is gone, replaced with themed areas and more frustrating combat. Puzzles just aren’t as satisfying to solve this time around. And exploration? Exploration is hampered by the knowledge that you have to slog through respawning monsters and pointless death traps. LoG2 is a sequel that tries to be bigger and better than what it was, but loses what made the original fun for me in the first place. While I will give some kudos for the magic system improvements, the new classes that add a little bit of flavor to the gameplay and the new monsters with their different attacks, it's not enough for me. As a whole, it isn't the fun I wanted and I'm really disappointed by that.

												The game looks nice and is fairly enjoyable when you can get past the horrible movement mechanics. It is the most obnoxious way to navigate. You're basically locked to a grid for movements and can only rotate 90 degrees. If you click a few directions at once it sometimes (but not always) will make several moves which you cannot abort. The puzzles are okay, basic, and sometimes boring. I feel like there's a lot of really good stuff locked behind some cumbersome mechanics. The combat system is not very friendly. You're clicking all over the place trying to make stuff happen. Sometimes you need to drag and drop and item instead of right-clicking it. It's not always the most relaxing time. I wish I could be more positive about it. If you like the idea of old dungeon crawlers from the 90s where you were locked to a grid for movement, you might really enjoy this one. Good attempt but needs a bit of work if there is a future version.			"

												The clunky UI, movement, lack of variety, and lack of automization make this game boring. Feeding your characters and telling them when to attack with each weapon and how to cast a spell makes combat aggrivating. There could've been something to take attention from that and put it towards the combat itself. Its difficult to tell how to level characters because there's little to explain what to do and your given so few skillpoints you don't get to spread them around much and experience, and even spells are so few in number and spread out across several skills that you don't really get to have fun with them. The dungeons and puzzles can be entertaining, and there's always a thrill in lootseeking and exploration, however the combat and the character building really take away from this game. What could be an adventure feels more like a slog.			"

												Built in keeping with traditional eye of the beholder type games, this game brings modern technology in to play with improved graphics, and real time monster movement.  The four-direction, square-by-square based movement scheme makes for interesting battle tactics as you effectively walk backwards in a square, trying to turn and strike quicker than the monsters in many cases.  Unfortunately, the maps for this game are not randomly generated, nor are the monsters.  If you begin playing this game through, and decide to try another party, the second party will go through the exact same gameplay as your previous party.  This makes for zero replayability in a game which is only OK as an RPG to begin with.			"

												Real time combat really kills the game. Almost every encounter makes you strafe around an enemy, and even on normal difficulty battles are tedious and boring.In fact, playing Might & Magic X made me write this review. That game has turn-based combat (as it should be in a dungeon crawler like this) and I am really enjoying it.			"

												I liked the first one better. The open world in this just made the game feel less focused than the tight dungeon crawling experience of the first, and combat was tedious and cheap. The true final boss especially was just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I wish I could give this a ""yes"" because I really liked the first one, but overall this entire game just felt like a huge chore.			"

												I really do not enjoy this game, even if I'm tryng to...while LoG is simple and pretty straight-forward, LoG2 on the other hand feels quite chaotic, dispersive and due to the nature of the game (that keep you searching and looking for small details in every corner or wall) gets really dull and boring after you reach the middle of the game, given the amount of mini-puzzles you want to clear, chest you want to open and area you want to visit. Plus, the default party tends to suck hard even in normal mode and it's REALLY annoying to start a new game.			"

												Having beat the original Legend of Grimrock, I gave this game a good shaking but ultimately found myself bored with it. The game quickly devolves into tedium. Lacking a story and any real strategic depth in the battle (kiting and backing into a corner is pretty much all you can do), all the real fun comes from puzzles. However, these make up a relatively minor portion of the game in comparison to exploration & combat. As for exploration, at least half occurs in dark, dank dungeons where the walls are all the same.If you do find yourself playing it, I highly recommend you avoid higher levels of difficulty. They don't increase the challenge or fun so much as make everything that much more tedious.			"

												SCORE: 5/10AND OH MY GOD THE SPELL/MAGIC SYSTEM IS ATROCIOUS. That alone would make me never play the game again.It looks like a pretty good game, and it is for the most part, but I think the puzzles are worse than the first one and too irrational/nonsensical and kind of reminded me of Broken Age. Maybe I just don't like RPGs like this anymore. I'm finding it more and more that I think I will like a game based on way-in-the-past preferences that just don't hold anymore. I used to love Might and Magic but I don't like this. I used to love RTS like Warcraft and Age of Empires, but I don't like them anymore either. Hell, I think I used to like Grim Fandango, but when I replayed it, it was very poorly designed actual game around a quirky and interesting story.I think I want my RPGs to be far more Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Skyrim, Mass Effect, and Shadowrun. Not this. This was slow, boring, and tedious. I know others disagree, but such is an opinion. I'm avoiding games I thought I would like such as Legend of Grimrock and Pillars of Eternity.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a good looking, fun to play and hard to master game. It starts of like any other RPG too - you strand on an island and have to free yourself from a cage. However, the game is slightly different than all the other RPG's: You play a party of 4, while in first person. You can arrange the position of your party members to have meele characters stand in front, ranges in the back [...]  It's a nice, at least for me new and fun concept. However it also has its flaws - but i will come back to that later.The gameplay is basicly you and your party moving around on square tiles, killing monsters, finding treasures, solving puzzles and overall exploring the newly found area. I'ts not a bad thing to do and i enjoyed it! THe monsters are generic, yes, but look great nontheless. The puzzles were okay to solve but still not bad enough to be instantly revealed. Look-wise the game is fantastic. The details are awesome and it ran very smooth on my - for todays standards - okay-ish pc. However, what makes me 'Not recommend' the game is the following: After 1-2 hours of gameplay you meet your first boss. And here is where things start to get bad. Fighting the boss on tiles, with your party arranged to your needs, cooldowns on your attacks, and very limited movability is just horrible. I tried it over and over and over again to be able to beat him, but i just couldnt do it. I was never even close to finishing him off. The slow, limited combat possibilities against a Tentacle boss who can spawn, despawn and attack from anywhere is just not working out! Having such a boss as first 'hard' encounter was demoralizing and frustrating.Unless you like huge challenges like that even on normal difficulty and are a fan of the movement / combat system itself, you might want to think about skipping on this game. Please keep in mind that this is just how i experienced it and how i think about the game. It's really not bad, but i cannot recommend it to the broad majority of user out there.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 1 was a GREAT puzzle game. It had a certain amount of combat in it, but it was kept to a minimum, and generally you were rarely outnumbered. You could take your time with the combat.Legend of Grimrock 2 seems to have forgotten it's puzzle roots and provide puzzles that are far too easy to solve even for someone who is generally not that into puzzle games, and adds a HEAPLOAD of combat to the game, and also against far more dangerous enemies. Enemies are also much more numerous in this game compared to its predecessor, leading to you being surrounded and slaughtered sometimes in seconds, leading to multiple frustrating reloads in order to handle random battles that you had no chance preparing for.In fact, the random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t battles is what, in the end, caused me to give up and say good bye to Grimrock 2. I wanted a puzzle game, and was given a dungeon crawler with a subpar combat system instead. After I had finished Crystal Mines and ended up outside with 10+ rat patrols and the rat boss (which I'd already beaten) AGAIN I just had enough. There are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments where enemies will spawn out of nowhere or just give you the middle finger saying ""Oh, you solved that puzzle did you? Here, have a near impossible battle!""It's just the fact that you have no chance to prepare for these that make it overly annoying and leading to multiple deaths and reloads just to try and get that one ""perfect"" battle that you actually survive.I was NOT looking for a combat game. I do not recommend Grimrock, in spite of it's graphics, atmosphere and puzzles. It's not worth it.			"

												Let me begin by saying that some people will like this game a lot.  The artwork is gorgeous, and the combat simple fairly simply to use.  The level-up system has a lot of nice variation without confining you too much.What I don't like:1.  You can only move in one of four directions: N, E, S and W.  Man y of the games challenges, in fact, rely on that rigid tie to a square grid, but after playing games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3, I find it disconcerting.2.  Some of the challenges require speed and reflexes that are simply beyond me, and  may be beyond many players.3.  While there's some freedom in where you go, overall the game is pretty linear, with advancing often requiring having found just the right item somewhere else.4.  The greatest sin-- too many of the challenges are ""zap you're dead"" challenges.  In some cases, the only way to get their measure is to be instantly killed by them.  This may require avoidance henceforth.  In many other cases, the only way to solve them is by advancing until you're killed, but at least see enough of the details to do something else when you restart the game.  Sort of like the Tom  Cruise movie, ""Edge of Tomorrow""-- Live, Die, Repeat.  Ideally, a good puzle or challennge should be solvable by a lot of observing and thinking in advance-- i.e., without getting killed to get the necessary information.  This game has too many that are the opposite....			"

												When I first saw Legend of Grimrock footage on youtube I thought it must be a joke.  I thought for sure someone was paid off to say that this was a good game.  It just looked so ridiculous, the movement.After playing legend of Grimrock 2, I get it, I understand why this game is fun.  It is fun, sort of, but ultimately I lost interest. It's not a bad game, but I can’t recommend it when every 10 minutes feels like an hour.ProsPretty good graphics.Interesting world and monsters.Good atmosphere.ConsThese puzzles, oh my gosh, I guess if you want some really tough puzzles this game would be good.The movement system.  To me, it seems ridiculous.  The whole world is 3d rendered and all combat is in real time, so what is the purpose of not giving us a standard WASD with mouselook?I’m pretty sure this game is boring, not positive, but pretty sure.

												It's ... OK.  I'll give examples as to why i'm ot really that excited about it but sorta like it because I love that genre of game.   i enjoy older games but this isn't old really, only released a year ago, and it's pretty UN-intuitive as far as using things, fighting, etc.  Nothing really wrong, but to me it's more of a job to play than something I  can immerse myself in.  It might have been better starting out if there was a bit of a tutorial.. a real tutorial rather than a hint here and there. Not everyone played the first one :) For example, here are some situations going through this game the first time with all the mental questions I might have had.  Starting out right off the bat you are in a cage and it says ""Hint: right click on the combat panels"" or something like that. well hell all I saw were characters, hands, and nothign else. so I finally looked it up and right clicked on the guy with the glowing hands, well, said it couldn't reach it.  well nothing told me the ones on the bottom were behind and the ones on the top were in front.  I finally by accident used the first one wit hteh stick and broke out. also nothing tells you that you can drag the characters around to change their positions.  You can't rely on players to know how to do things from the first game. you can't rely on players to figure out things like moving characters around to change position.  NOTHING tells you what food really does for you.. other than seeing a bar go up if you do eat... sure doesn't help the health any... will it eventually?  what happens if you throw this rock and it flies off? what if someone dies, how do I rez them?  you don't find the answers to these questions.. at least immediately .. if at all, unless you accidentally stumble on something. This game could be old time wonderful if the devs just took a bit more time educating the players.  It's obvious they just wanted to get this thing out the door or assumed way too much by not testing t his game with virgin beta and alpha testers.  If they had this would have been something taken care of.  If you played the previous game and like it , I advise getting it.. if you didn't, then buy it with the knowledge you are going to suffer in your experience till you get it all figured out or ruin your experince by looking up a walk though.. at that point if you are doing that, what's the point in spending the money!?

												Hard mode review : don't try. Save, die and load.The monsters are harders you can bear, most time flee to avoid them, better for your nerves. Die ---> Load.Inventive dungeon labyrinths. You will die and die again in traps one cannot expect : loot a weapon, you will be teleport among 12 mummies. Die --> Load. Chest are hidden : according to forums, you cannot find some of them by yourself, cause there are no notes about them. Starving digging ?  Die --> Load. Water ?

												I want to recommend it, but I can't. Big fan of the original game but where that game was tough, this one becomes frustratingly so. The puzzles are generally fun, though not always solveable without Google, but the combat is crippling to the point that after every battle you need considerable time to get back on your feet. It's a real shame, as the the world is far more interesting than the original game and if it wasn't so frustrating, I'd still be eager to find out who or what brought me there.If you have tons of patience and don't mind feeling like every battle is a set-back, you'll love what you find. If you're keen on solving puzzles and exploring the island and feeling like you're actually making progress, then this is probably not for you.			"

												WARNING:  This is not an RPG game.  It's a puzzle game with some RPG garnish thrown in.  Unfortunately it was tagged and touted as a dungeon crawler, RPG, but beyond the character generation screen, I haven't seen much RPG about it.  Dungeon crawling?  No.  Never saw a dungeon.  The first part is all puzzles with poor clues and bad design (at least for someone who isn't a puzzle games fan) and so, I never found the dungeon.Any game that has a player googling for a walkthrough or ""help solving x"" 5 minutes into playing the game, is just poorly done.  Again, I'm not a puzzle games fan and wouldn't have bought this if it had been sold/tagged as a puzzle game.This game really reminds me of bad older games (pre internet) that you'd end up just wasting your money, arguing for a refund or coughing up for the guide book.  Again, if you're a puzzle games fan, have at it.  Otherwise stay away.Pro-Fun character generation screen with lots of variables in 4 party mix-Good, immersive graphicsCons-Puzzle game sold as an RPG1/10, would create a neat 4 man group again.			"

												Yeah I should have read more of the negative reviews of this game before buying it; I got caught up on all the positive reviews. Some one described it as, ""the scope of Skyrim"", massive, etc.. So I wasted most of a Saturday on  the game. This game is a dungeon crawl through and through. No story, no npcs- just kill stuff, solve a tedious puzzle, and repeat. I wanted to like this game; don't mind the old Might and Magic engine- but why not add even a simple story, some villages, and a couple NPCs? Not enough money, or imagination- something. Could have been a good game, right now a bad way to waste time in a bland empty world..			"

												After spending 10 hours on this game, giving myself time to figure it out, I finally give up.  It's not because I died a bunch, (actually my entire team died only once in Lost River because I fell into the water and didn't know how to get out) and not because the puzzles were too frustrating, but actually the game movement is what made me throw in the towel.  I just can't get used to it.  After playing MMOs and enjoying freedom of movement, dodging, rolling, jumping etc... it's just not fun having movement limited to left and right, forward and back.  Camera pan is odd acting because of this restriction, it 'drifts' and it drives me nuts.The good part is the graphics, really pretty, very nice, I love the environments and even though combat is very old school, I can deal with that.  I also enjoyed the puzzles.There are some other things I wasn't so keen on.  You have to click on spells, don't like that.  I'm used to hotkeying them to buttons on my mouse.  Not super impressed by the 'team' that doesn't really act like a team, just a single individual with a lot of skills.  But again, I could have dealt with that.I can't get passed the clunky limited movement.			"

												I guess if you played the first game and already know what's going on, it could be good for you.I picked it up without any familiarity to the series.  It's basically a mashup between an old-school square based dungeon crawler and a point-and-click adventure game.Things to note: there are zero visual indicators that anything is important, or that you can interact with anything.  You have 4 ""party"" members, that all occupy the same square except that their position in the party dictates whether they can or cannot interact with things.The game starts with one of the characters highlighted and basically no indication of what to do (pick up the stick).  However, if you're foolish enough to drop the stick in the hands that are highlighted (or were highlighted when I started the game) you can't actually hit the door - because you're too far away from it.  Had to watch a tutorial video to hit a door with a stick, because the mechanics of party positioning and item usage are left to you to figure out.My wizard died before I escaped the cage, because I had the audacity to click some of my buttons (that have no readout or description as to what they are or do).If you enjoyed older games where you had to click everything on the screen to find something that moves, this is one of those.  Looking around doesn't serve much purpose, since after you release the look button your return immediately to a centered view.  Trying to move where you can't will cause a motion bump - this and the terrible look system will both induce motion sickness if you suffer from it.When I was younger, I enjoyed games like this because there seemed to be a lot of ""mystery"".  As I've grown more familiar with game design, I've come to realize that this is really just a disguise for a poor, unintuitive layout that eats time via having the user search for interaction.If you want to customize your character, be prepared to play Dungeons and Dragons (TM).  Every character has a sheet with 15-20 skills, a handful of which will get just a couple of points, a few traits and other things that you can pick from.  The classes are thoroughly uninspiring.  Wizard, fighter, fighter wizard.  Don't forget the rogue!I'm sure there are plenty of interesting things to play with in the spells system and lots of things to discover, if you just click enough.

												I borrowed this game from one of my steam friends because he recommended it. Well, here goes my review.Movement: I'm not gonna lie. I hate grid systems. The movement feels very restrictive and it just kinda seems like it lurches forward rather than walking forward. Combat: If I wanted to die horribly in the starting areas of the game, I'd play Dark Souls. Seriously, the fisrt enemies you fight are giant snapping turtles and they nearly killed me, and it only got worse as i went along in the game when I started fighting enemies that were able to attack far quicker than I. Lose half a character's health in the time it takes for him to swing? Classy. Oh, and you can break limbs too. So if a tough enemy breaks your arms (meaning you cant use your weapons) you have to back off and pray that you can use a healing potion to undo the damage only for the monster to break your arms again. Would be fine for hardmode, but I was on easyfor my first run. That apparently donesn't mean much.Environment: Ok, i have to throw my hands up here the game looks pretty nice. I had to kill the graphics to make it run properly though, as my computer its up to par but thats on me. Story: It sucks. Four dudes trapped on an island for seemingly no reason. I'm sure it gets better than that but I didn't play far enough to find out. Frankly, I don't care anyway.Puzzles: ""X marks the spot."" That is the dumbest hint I have ever seen. This was the first major puzzle of the game and I had to look this one up. I thought that meant I had to find an x. Nope. This was one of thos epuzzles that not only made me feel like an idiot, but it's solution was kinda stupid.Overall, this sort of game just doesn't appeal to me. I can see why some people might like it, but i can't recommend this game in all good honesty.			"

												I cannot recommend this game. I played the hell out of Eye of the Beholder (all of them) and the other classic D&D games back in the day, and I loved them.That was a long time ago, gaming has come a long way, and I have obligations and responsibilites beyond your little game. So, when the complete lack of autosave/checkpointing causes me to lose 30 mintues of gameplay...I just walk away. Picture it: after a few days of work, I finally have a few minutes to sit down at play. I haven't been thinking about this game for those two days, I haven't had time to think about it, but now I get to play it. So, I sit down with it, spend a few minutes getting my bearings, work out a quick plan of attack, and in I go. I play for a bit, stumble around, maybe fight a few battles, find an item or two...and then die from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Monster got a lucky crit? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pressure plate launch a horde of overpowered enemies at me? Item randomly teleports me into a room full of enemies? Great, now I'm dead; last save was...where I started the session.Look, I understand the *idea* of quicksave (trust me, I lived through it's birth and subsequent abandonment), and I actually fought for it to stay when the checkpoint craze started. But now? There's no excuse for this. Just because you want to pay homage to classic games, this doesn't mean you have to abandon everything we've learned since them.You make me lose my entire play session due to unforeseen ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t while providing no checkpoint or autosave system to mitigate the lost time, I uninstall your game, regret my purchase, and am very uninclined to buy future produces from you. I've purchased both LoG 1 and 2, but don't expect me to buy anything else unless you learn from the past.And this doesn't even get into the awkward UI, bags opening over your character's paperdoll, spellcasting being a giant flipping PITA, having to annoyingly spam clicks during combat (even the classic games had an ""all attack"" button), the poor-fit outdoor environments are to a strict grid layout, ""invisible walls"" (why can't my characters just walk around that pillar?), pixel-hunting out the wazoo, and just all-around poor decisions. I wanted to love this game, then I wanted to like it, then I wanted to just power through it, now I want to forget it.			"

This games never heard of such a mssive innovation, what are keyboards good for anyway? Switch weapons in a logical helpful maner?  Place your mouse cursor over the portrait and press X to switch. But why bother pressing X? Why not just click the button to switch weapons?  I did not find this game fun. It was too tedious for me and there are more enjoyable RPGs out there.			"

												Definitely not game for everyone. Enemies are merciless right from the start and you will die many times in this game. Mostly you will have to experience everything through trial and error in order to get anywhere. Enemies have healthpool atleast 2 times bigger than you're characters have and while you are trying to fight them with weak weapons and spells they can take 1/4 health away with 1 attack. If you haven't played the first game of the series and you aren't familiar with dungeon crawlers i recommend you won't buy this game.			"

												Just as tedious as the Old School CRPG™s it's emulating. Move around on a big empty grid, exploring a world that is so generic you'd assume every art asset was straight off the shelf. One of the most frustratingly linear experiences I've had this year - go in a line, find two routes: one blocked by Gate A, and one with some monsters and Key A. Going through Gate A leads you to Gate B and a similar hunt for Key B. And so on. ""Puzzles"" in this game amount to trying to discern what in the game world is a clickable object and what is just a branch or bone on the ground. Prepare to do a lot of clicking. Especially against the monsters, who are HP sponges because the developers realize that their combat system is so laughably awkward (attack, take a step backward so you are invulnerable, wait out the monster's attack, move back, repeat) that they need a huge buffer window to allow chances for the monsters to get a few licks in too. More than anything else, the UI is what made me give up on LoG2. Click on an item on the ground and then click on the character who has to hold it. Then open the character window. Click on the item. Click on the character. Congratulations, you've equipped a branch. Want to swing that branch at an enemy? Right click on a weapon on a character's portrait to attack with that character - no direct binds for this. Spellcasting is even more clunky. Why?The reason it's all so awkward is tied back into the combat. Things actually do get legitimately challenging when several monsters are in the area, or you're in a limited space, but only because of the UI. It takes a lot of mouse movement, clicking, and well-timed strafing as you struggle to open and close inventory windows, swap healing potions from who has them to who needs to use them, click the correct weapons for your attacks, draw little spells on a grid, et cetera. I'm not being coy or cute when I say the real monster in this game is the UI.So, no, the game isn't ""too easy"", but playing it is boring and awkward and unfun and felt extremely game-y and not at all like an adventure on a strange island. I strongly recommend you play something else. What, exactly, depends on what you wanted to get out of this game.If you like grid maps and RPG combat, parties, and stats, Atlus makes a phenomenal series called Etrian Odyssey for the Nintendo DS and 3DS that is well worth your time. If you like fantasy action combat, Skyrim is the way to go. If you like exploring a mysterious world and solving puzzles, Myst or, more recently, Machinarium are fine options. Just please don't waste your time on this.			"

												I haven't played the predecessor, so this review is based on the quality of this game as an ""old-school"" RPG.The game involves a great amount of time tediously scanning walls for very small hidden buttons.  I've spent about a quarter of time in game just retracing steps scanning walls; not my idea of fun.  Finding a hidden button/lever can mean the difference between progressing through content and being stuck at a standstill.  This could have been remedied by allowing the party to comment on hidden features similar to Might and Magic X.Combat was rather clunky, especially playing a wizard.  I found missle weapons to be lackluster, and ranged combat in general was a hassle with projectile collection.  You can effectively kite mobs using melee attacks as long as you are quick enough to move to another tile before giving the mob time to attack.  Additionally, there is no way to track mob health; there are no hit point bars or visual cues.  There is no feedback regarding if a mob is resistant to certain forms of attacks; sometimes skills do 1 damage and then the same skill will do 20 damage (is it because of weak attacks or damage resistance?)  The only methods of healing are via potions and resting.  I made the assumption that one of the schools of magic would contain healing, but that was not the case.  No class healing really detracts from combat.There doesn't appear to be any form of skill reset.  Given that you start the game clueless regarding the skills, items, and spells available, it would be great to have this available in some form.Having played MIght and Magic X, I feel this is an inferior clone.  It does have some nice perks, such as unique weapon skills and interesting puzzles.  Sadly, the game is bogged down by unnecessary tedious tasks and clunky combat/skills.			"

												Make sure you know what you are getting into before buying this game. The movement system in this game is horrible. You can go left right up down and you move 1 block at a time. The combat system is clunky and annoying. The puzzles are alright but the game is unbarable to play.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I typically love RPGs having played the heck out of Oblivion, Skyrim, etc. so I was intrigued by Grimrock 2. Apparently there's no roleplaying except for equipping the four characters you command to deal with various baddies - it's just a long dungeon crawl. Now, for 20 bucks this wouldn't be a bad thing except for your movement, which is one square at a time controlled by your kb. Moving the mouse only changes your POV. If you don't have extremely nimble fingers this game is an effort in futility, especially during boss fights since movement is so restricted. It can also be hard on the normal difficulty. Your characters recharge and level up slowly, there's not much armor to speak of so I always felt at a disadvantage. Puzzles can be frustrating.			"

												Cliff notes:  Buy the game!  It is great and fun even if you didn't enjoy the first.This downvote is based purely off the nerfed skill tree's in comparison to grimrock 1The skill tree's have been removed and are now 5 skill points long (and you start with 2)---------- Having been playing for a while, definitely recommend anyone to purchase this even if you didn't find Grimrock 1.  The game is very good, it has massive improvements over the first.Pro's+Beautiful (as usual)+Open world with improved automap (More choices to mark things)+Day/night cycles+Classes+Very! fun+Xp distribution even if party member didn't get a hit in+New game modes, Ironman!!!! and single use crystals!+Digging+Crafting+Classes(a few)+New race+You can be a farmer+Body parts can be injuredCons-Skill tree nerf-Dug tiles don't always display on terrain with varying elevation-Several tooltips outdated			"

												The gameplay is clunky, tortured and obtuse along N-S-E-W lines with auto mouse centering. The trailer on the publisher's website is deceptive and misleading as to the game play style. Additionally, it is touted as a ""game with an old-school heart but a modern execution"". Other than the graphics, there is very little ""modern"" about this game.This is within the broad ~35 year genre of a ""crawler"". Much like the word ""transportation"" (or vehicle) includes many modes of travel, but if Porsche came out with their newest ""chariot"" lineup, I wouldn't expect for it to be horse drawn. This cart is drawn by a mule.Obviously, my juxtaposition of ""Dungeon Crawler"" versus ""Dungeon Stutterer"" was lost on some of prior thread flamers ... this is a ""spastic dungeon stutterer"" and not a ""dungeon crawler"" as the term has evolved.It plays more like Adventure on the Atari 2600 ... which was a great game at the time, but I am glad gaming has evolved since then. This one has in theory, but not execution.I was tremendously disappointed.  And yes. I should have known better than to judge the book by its ads, cover. out of context reviews, and video. I should have watched it on twitch or youtube. I didn't... and wasted my money.If you like it, great. Just be warned BEFORE YOU BUY that it has very limited movement, and you might do better with some dice and a scrap of cardboard, burn a stick and write your journey on a cave wall. Seriously, watch it before you buy (and not the developer's deceptive video).1.5 out of 5Namaste.			"

												If you liked the first LoG then you'll like this one. It's exactly the F**KING SAME!I enjoyed the first one well enough for its concept, but never finished it because it was just too damn clunky. But like all good game developers, they've fixed the clunky UI, game design problems and etc. for this edition... oh wait... NO, they haven't. Everything that was wrong with the first one is still wrong with this one.You spend most of your time staring at the bottom right corner of the screen. There's no time based autosave feature, there's no auto-attack, and there's no way of knowing if that giant crab will curl up and die after a couple hits or brutally♥♥♥♥♥♥your party (it's the latter) forcing you to go back to the last save... 3 hours ago, because no autosave and I forgot to quicksave. Right.If there's a story to this game it is so sparsely delivered that there's no room for any detail or sense of engagement with it. The whole game seems to serve as one big esoteric puzzle. Surely there are better ways to create a puzzle game.There was a good core idea in the first one, but instead of being expanded on, it has been gratuitously regurgitated with a slight change of colour palette. Which is a damn shame.Buy it or don't.			"

												A thoroughly enjoyable (and large!) dungeon crawler. Old-school 'Eye of the Beholder' style combat (and occasionally enemies) and brutal difficulty. It is, then, a fitting sequel to the original Legend of Grimrock. Unlike the first game, however, this features larger outdoor spaces, a wider variety of puzzles and enemies and is much longer. It is everything you might want and more. I heartily recommend this to anyone fed up of the modern RPG scene which tends to consist of nostalgic isometric games that fail to capture the depth of the games they are copying but somehow manage to capture the infuriating combat; or open world collectathons with occasional 'dialogue' choices.For those who grew up on pen and paper RPGs, this is your spiritual home.

												This is in the vein of old school dungeon adventures. Pick your four characters, modify them up and start crawling the dungeons and lands in a 'tile' based format.If you played some of the RPG of some years ago you will like this game. The puzzles in the game, mean you need to turn your brain on. Ok, you probably won't get all of them but most can be solved by some sleuthing and lateral thinking. This is half the fun.Explore, combat and try to get further through a game. Advance your characters, eat food, swap out the myriad of items without getting too bogged down in super detail.			"

												I have yet to complete the game, i've been having so much fun with the editor and making my own adventures.The tools available are great and powerful, improved greatly if you are confident with some simple or advanced scripting of your own, though you can still certainly make some very good adventures with a bit of trial and error and persistence without reading the official modding forums.Having a read of said forums will show you all the secrets of this quite impressive editor for this game.

												So incredibly good.  The first one was great, and this one adds a ton - varied enviroments, variable height in a map (including diving in rivers), day/night cycle, enemies have varied and clever movement patterns (one early on will do a little hop back when you get tricky and try to flank him - bait out the hop and let him come to you!), easier skill system, better class balance (and dex actually adds to your bow and dagger damage!), new classes (don't bother with a mage when you can tank and cast on a battlemage though), buried treasure, BOSS BATTLES?!?!

												I won’t describe the game’s mechanics here as that’s done very well elsewhere (search “Rock Paper Shotgun Grimrock 2” for some well written words on the game). But I will say if you want a game that challenges your lateral thinking as well as your reactions this is a great choice.Having just finished Grimrock 2 my reaction is one of disappointment that there's not more to play. Although there is, of course, as there’s a whole Workshop of levels to check out. I may have a go myself – I’m feeling all inspired :)But the main story mode in this is really very engaging. If you think you’re stuck during the game then try something else, a different area, perhaps. The only gripe I have is that while playing I occasionally felt some of the puzzles were a little _too_ obscure - occasionally relying on assumptions about the players that may not hold true for all or using out-of-game knowledge (or experiences) that not everyone has. But I found ways around that and others may feel that criticism unfair, I’m sure (I’ve avoiding going into details for the sake of spoiler avoidance).This games improves on the first game in so many ways. Although I would encourage you to play the original Grimrock there’s no need to do that other than it’s a gentler introduction to this style of 3D square based RPG.A highly recommended game to challenge brain as well as brawn.

One thing I absolutely hated was that lyour character's limbs break all the ***** time, but the only way to heal is through a crystal/potion.  You can literally end your game due to this, which makes resource management very tedious.This is a definite must for people who love dungeon crawlers.			"

												Great game.  I had never played the first one and got this one with the Humble Bundle Monthly subscription so I decided to give it a go.  It's pretty neat.  Granted I haven't played that long and a lot of the negative reviews are regarding the number of puzzles, but I'm very happy with it.  It's a first person game that is grid based.  I guess it's technically turn-based also, but kind of real time also.  It's a nice mix and a fun RPG. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd feel if I had paid $24 for it, but if you can grab it on sale then I'd recommend it fully.  I'll amend my review later after I've played some more.			"

												If you love to explore and solve puzzles this game is for you.  If you hate those kind of things, maybe best to stay away.  Legend of Grimrock 2 requires you to explore areas to find clues in order to solve puzzles and progress.  The areas in this game is a fair size so exploring an area does not become tedius.  Each area is quite unique and the graphics are so gorgeous that everytime I go to a new area I have to stop for a few minutes to take it in.  The battles are quick and the party development balanced.  Each time a charactor levels up you only have 1 skill point to use.  There are not many different skills so that you need to agonize over for 10 minutes on every level up, but enough so that specialization and planning ahead is important.			"

												Pros: Both combat and puzzles are challenging yet maintain a fresh feel throughout the game. Free roam. The game truly doesn't hold your hand. Hints are plentiful and usually both easy to find and understand. Level editor and custom dungeon support. Game length is around 20 hours on a first playthrough depending on how hard you search for secrets. Plenty of secrets and treasures for you to find and toy with. Many different possible playstyles and party composition. Several bonus difficulty modifiers. Also, normal doesn't feel like easy.Cons: 1v1 combat can be extremely easy once you learn the controls and monster ai. A flying enemy appears that is invulnerable to most types of damage far before most players have the ability to deal with it. Ran into a progress halting bug where a key didn't spawn. Upon reload, the key spawned. This could be a serious issue if a player is using some of the difficulty modifiers. Game design promotes certain party compositions and leaves some playstyles almost worthless. With the amount of available skills, it is disheartening seeing that you can only utilize a few per character due to the low amount of skill points received throughout. Specializing is key to effective party members from the start and there is no way to understand this without playing for several hours. If you are experienced or plan ahead, late game bosses and enemies become a bit easy as damage scaling coupled with potion usage makes for insanely strong builds.Overall, I found this game phenomenal. It steadily increases the challenge both through new variety in monsters and puzzles throughout a lengthy game in a natural way. The music is astounding and boss fights are intense. There are very few cheap traps and most puzzles can be solved quickly if you find and comprehend the hints provided. Secret doors are usually (almost always) audible from the location of the object that opens them so if you pay attention you can find them. If you get stuck, you can go to a different area for most of the game and come back later thanks to the free roam design. Enemies respawn (and get more difficult as your level increases) but it takes a considerable amount of time to the point where I've never seen them respawn in the current dungeon (note that I rarely slept throughout the game though). Progression is consistent and if you get stumped, walkthroughs will make you facepalm because the solution is usually right in front of your face. If you are looking for a challenging, enjoyable, long (compared to modern games), cheap (again compared to modern games), and gratifying game, Legend of Grimrock 2 could be the game for you.			"

												I would highly recommend this game. I think Almost Human Games have developed a fantastic dungeon crawler and deserve the money this game is priced at (when I bought it it was £17.99).I'll keep it short, listing the pro's and con's:PROs:- It's a grid-based dungeon crawler, and there isn't that many of those around. It was a good attempt at the now-very-old genre, and it works.- Good graphics, and fantastic for a dungeon crawler - especially when being used to games like Dungeon Master and EotB.- Immersive world.- Very good atmosphere in the different realms.- As expected of a grid-based dungeon crawler, some great puzzles.- 'Dungeon Master'-like crafting of potions and casting spells.- Levelling systems and skills.- Modding and dungeon creation- Small ideas like:-- Auto-picking of thrown/shot ammunition (brilliant mechanic!)-- Reach weapons-- Different adverse effects: poisoned, diseased, paralysed-- Night and day cycle-- Drowning mechanic-- DiggingCONs:- The story isn't particularly good- The castle levels are rather disappointing- Some of the clues for puzzles are very, very vague- No non-hostile NPCs, or any interaction with the world other than combat			"

												Bought this right after finishing the first one.  Improves on many aspects, but you should just get both anyways.(Play number 1 first so you like it before seeing all the improvements in 2.)LOG 2+Much bigger world.  Open world.  Not linear.+Characters and classes offer more choices.+Skills and traits are more meaningful and better designed.+Combat is more advanced.  Monsters have broader strategies.+Graphics are hugely improved.LOG 1+Atmosphere and story is somewhat better.+Game runs better on basic computer. "

												This is a fantastic game! 3D models and textures are great. Beautiful fantasy illustrations for cut scenes and characters. Music is great - serious music on par with Basil Poledouris. Puzzles are long, difficult, and rewarding. Enemies present some of the most interesting and diverse AI and combat situations. This is a substantial upgrade from the original Legend of Grimrock, and I already liked that one.			"

												Love the game!!!this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.You move  U D L R with W A S D  and you rotate with Q, E (default)  and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help.  so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter.  then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?!  oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?!  i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help.  especially the super duper secret ones.I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.

												A great, classic dungeon crawler RPG filled to the brim with secrets and strategic options of building Your party. Graphics are nice enough but nothing breathtaking, on the other hand You should have no problems running this game on a laptop or an older system. The only real complaint is the lack of replayability since the game is quite linnear. Unless You want to go through the game again and uncover all the secrets which can be somewhat tedious. Nevertheless I love Legend of Grimrock 2 and would give it a 9/10 overall. PS: Where is some DLC with another adventure!?			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a true sequal. I thought the first game was great but had many problems that left the game needing more. The main thing I love is how open the world is and how you can play the game in essentially whatever order you want, unlike the first game which was far more linear. The goal overall is to gain access to the final area, but in what order of areas to go to before that is pretty much up to you. This allowed me to work on another section or puzzle when I get stuck rather than just quitting or caving in to internet help. Speaking of internet help, you may need it. The game is very challenging and if you don't save often, you may find yourself raging...a lot. No deathes feel too cheap as eventually you'll learn to recognize everything as a potential trap, but be warned that it can be unforgiving at times. If you enjoyed the first game, then you'll enjoy it's sequal. If you didn't like the first game, this entry may have fixed what you disliked, but likely didn't. And if you haven't played the first game, I would recommend playing the sequal first and going back to the first game later on, if at all. It's a fantastic game, but it's certainly not for everyone.			"

												Finally beat the game and I must say I had a blast, better then the original in everyway. Just like the first game mechanics only better and improved, level design is not linear like the first game everythings connected and a lot of secrets off on the beaten path. Even more so now with the implement of shovels and tresure maps. All the puzzles and areas you explore make you think outside the box, some puzzles may have you walk over magical tiles that could disapear if your not careful and others have you find items that you bring back to a certain location to open areas to progress. So many things done right with this game that I must say that its one of my favorite games of 2014, true masterpiece 10/10 a must get.			"

												(Quick review) If you liked the first one, you'll love this one. It's more open but puzzles are more difficult.(Long review) Improves upon it's predecessor in every way. A more flexible leveling system, multi-floor puzzles, a slew of new items and enemies, open ended exploration, and gorgeous outdoor areas.It should be noted however:this game is hard......I mean really hard...really really really hardSo much harder than it's predecessor in fact, that unless you are a Russian puzzle solving prodigy, you will never beat this game without a walkthrough. Ever. The puzzles are that obscure sometimes.Even so, It's worth every second of gameplay, so long as you open a walkthrough when you get stumped.			"

												This is a wonderful contemporary dungeon crawler rpg that manages to retain a retro feel. I had long felt a bit disappointed that these types of games were no longer being made as we moved into the modern age of gaming. I had actually been made aware of this game before the first Grimrock, though I have since purchased the first LoG after finishing this one.The movement might feel restrictive to people who are not accustomed to the genre, however this game is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had playing a video game in years. The story is a bit barren and vague, however the gameplay itself is what makes this game great.The combat is difficult enough to keep you on your toes until end-game, and the puzzles are challenging enough to keep you engaged, requiring discipline and a sharp mind to figure out, however not so vague that your average gamer won't be able to get through the game if they really tried. If you are new to the dungeon crawler genre, then there is no time like the present! Just don't give up, and don't use any walkthroughs or online help. If you are into a more diablo-like or Skyrim-like experience, you might be a bit frustrated by this game. This isn't exactly a general audience-oriented game. It is certainly pointed at an older generation of gamers, however effectively modernized. It's challenging, it's beautiful, it's about time for these types of games to make a comeback. "

												I can't get enough of this game, and it blows me away that it's not a full-blown $50 title. When was the last time you played a game that weaved quick combat and puzzle-solving together in a way that didn't break it up into separate pieces? Where you had to -think- to solve a mystery or open a door, rather than inserting the blue key into the blue keyhole? Where you've had a genuine 'ah ha!' moment that lead to a trove of interesting secrets, literally scattered throughout the game? Satisfying titles like that are just too few and far between.The core of the game revolves around four prisoners trapped on an island following the destruction of their ship. As they begin to explore, they soon come to realize being brought to this monster-ridden island was far from an accident. True to the pen-and-paper nature from dungeon-crawlers of yesteryear, the entire game takes place on a tiled grid, and each step you make moves you from tile to tile as you venture across the island. You can develop and refine your characters to become hardened warriors, gun-wielding rogues, spell-casting wizards, and a number of other fantasy classes (and, by the way, you can import custom character portraits and have your party members be just about anyone you can think of). The combat in the game takes place over this grid that your characters are confined to, and becomes surprisingly diverse once you start to build up spells and abilities. The real core of the game, however, lies in its secrets and its puzzles. There are hundreds of them, over a stunning and surprisingly diverse map. I just can't get enough of it. Folks who really enjoyed that aspect in Morrowind and Skyrim would adore that about this game.If I had to be critical, there's not really much of a story, and for the most part no voice acting whatsoever. I suppose some people might find the grid-pattern of movement annoying, but I found it very helpful with combat. Most of the flaws are completely ignorable for me, with the exception of one or two puzzles being -incredibly- hard. Then again, solving them was also tremendously satisfying.I think most everyone (sans players who're Call of Duty addicts and multiplayer-only gamers) will find something to enjoy here. I'd recommend it even at full price --which I personally think is a steal.			"

												Wow, what a really fun game.The Legend of Grimrock games are great, though it caters to an audience with a specific taste. If you ever played the old Eye of the Beholder gameboy game or something like it, you'll appreciate this. Grimrock takes the classic dungeon crawl scheme and modernizes it. This just doesn't mean better graphics and game mechanics though--the developers of this game really thought about these and spent time putting in intricate, yet very solvable puzzles and riddle-like passive narratives into the game. Meaning, you will be challenged, but you will also feel very rewarded when you figure something out. This perfect balance along with some nice, classic RPG elements make for some great fun. Legend of Grimrock 2 is better than the first, but this is only because of the graphics upgrade and the much more diverse environments you get to explore instead of being cooped up in a tower all day! On my top games list--a must for lovers of the genre!			"

												Okay, first of all, I would like to say that this is a great game, despite some of the criticisms that I have for it. I would recommend that anyone who likes this genre get this game. I can't really imagine anything better for what it is.I'm going to focus on a comparison between this game and the first, and I would, in fact, recommend that you play the first before you play this one. It's a little bit simpler and gives you a better idea of what this game is all about.First of all, some things that this game introduces that I consider positive:--A wide array of different environments:      The original was basically limited to three environments, and they were all dark and dungeony. This game has a huge number of unique ones, all with different themes, including outdoor areas, which give the game a much brighter feel than the original.--A better skill leveling system:     In the original, there were a lot of incentives to run hard in a single direction and level up all of a single skill without touching anything else. This did take away from the excitement of leveling a bit, since almost regardless of the situation, you would be leveling ""throwing weapons"" or whatever. In this one, it's important to level up a little bit in a lot of different skills, since there are plenty of items that want you to have 1 skill point in air magic or something, and almost every skill gives you a neat perk if you level it up to a certain level. Certainly, the way it is now is much cleaner than it was before, and it's all laid out much more plainly.--Way more items:     Obviously, the second edition was going to have more things, and it does. The wide variety of items makes finding secrets and just generally progressing through the game more exciting, and also lets modded maps take a wider variety of directions.--Multi-layer map structure:     In addition to the classic multi-floor structure of the original game, maps in the sequel have access to ladders and pits, which just generally lets the designers jam more things into smaller spaces. This is another feature that should make map modding a little more interesting.--New race:     This isn't the sort of thing that makes me all that excited, but I know some people will be super into the character creation element of the game, so this is certainly a positive.--Better special attacks:     The combat system has just generally been revamped, and the most noticeable thing to me was that, rather than getting special attacks by leveling the weapon type and just doing it randomly in a fight, you trigger it actively by holding the attack button. A nice touch that make combat a little more interesting.--Better story:     The first Grimrock had a story, but it was fairly secondary to the game itself. Basicaly, you're some adventurers in a mountain trying to find your way out, and that's pretty much the gist of it. In Grimrock 2, you truly feel like there is a goal most of the time, and I'm not going to spoil it, but it certainly adds to the ambiance. And now for the things that are worse than the original:--Open(ish) world:     Don't hate me for putting this in the negative camp, but for this particular game, the world just felt far too big, and in order to do things in the ""right"" order, players sort of have to get lucky. The problem is that the various areas and dungeons across the map have varying difficulties, and the player has no way to know which are hard and which are easy, so it's fairly easy to poke your head a little bit too deep, and try to take on dungeons which are far too difficult. Another problem with this design is that the game sometimes makes reference to clues hidden in completely different areas, which means that if you encounter the puzzle first, you don't really know what to do, and if you encounter it second, sometimes you've forgotten about the hint that you might have read literally hours ago.--Inaccessible puzzles:     Everyone loves a good puzzle, and for the most part, these were really good, but, like in the last one, there were a few puzzles which you just can't expect for a reasonable human being to be able to figure out, so it's almost impossible to finish the game without cheating and looking on the internet for answers, unless you're a genius.--Really annoying new enemies:     You will notice that for most of the other new content, they were clear upsides. They make modded maps better and spice up the game with new material. It's great to have new monsters to face in your adventures, but in this game, more often than not, I felt that the added enemies were just annoying. From the mosquito swarms that are very hard to hit, to the toads that steal your weapons, to the ice guardians which just generally feel too difficult, to the xeloroids that paralyze your party members, to the medusas that petrify you until you can get to a healing crystal, to the Eyctopusses that blind you, to the Trickster, who seems intentionally annoying, to the air elementals that you can't kill, and finally, to all of the things that poison you and give you diseases. Fighting a lot of the enemies in this game just isn't very fun, and that's linked to the next point.--Injuries really suck     LoG 2 introduces us to a very frustrating combat mechanic: injuries. In battle, your adventurers will sometimes injure some part of their body, which might keep them from casting spells, stop health or energy regen, slow movement speed, or keep you from using your left or right hands. The game honestly didn't need this, and since the only way to fix it is to use healing potions, you basically need someone on hand at all times to make them. By the end of the game, this, combined with the next point, made me use probably more than 100 healing potions.--Boss battles:     Boss battles are a cool idea, but LoG is more of a puzzle dungeon crawler game than an action game, and these just made me feel like there was too much empahsis in that direction. Some of the boss battles were also quite difficult, even on the easiest difficulty, and usually required that I take several healing potions and try several times to beat. The fights should not be the challenging parts of this game in my opinion, but in retrospect, they were. These are the reason that I recommend having someone leveled up all the way in alchemy as quickly as possible, since having resurrection potions and greater healing potions on hand can tend to make the bosses more manageable.Overall, this game was great, and while I did have a lot of negative things to say about it, remember, I was just comparing it the the first, which is a tough thing to beat, and one of my favorite games of all time, so even if I might have sounded a bit harsh, I'm not saying that this game deserves any less than the 92% positive community rating that it currently boasts.

												A worthy successor to the board-like dungeon crawler known as Grimrock I. Both of them seem to hit that sweet spot between making a game look good and leaving things to your imagination. It's tough to describe, but there's just this feeling of charm to it few games have nowadays. Combining old-school gameplay with graphics on par with the Trine series does work out for this one.While the core mechanics remain the same, pretty much every aspect of the game has been expanded upon. No longer are you limited to dungeons, you actually get to explore some outside environments for once. They look daaaamn good too, especially the beach. The new campaign only starts out linear to ease you into things, but after the first two areas you end up in a hub-world from where you choose to go next. There are new puzzles that aren't limited to ""put rock on pressure plate"", new items, more monsters, more classes, etc. Speaking of items, weapons have special moves now. Also day-and-night cycle.However, I don't think this game would be the same without the editor, which alone is enough to make cool maps. It doesn't take much at all to create your own levels, the editor's fairly simple to use for a 3d game. To make it even better, you can use lua scripts and custom assets to make your dungeon even more interesting. You could create some intricate puzzles, boss fights, or even add your own tiles, objects, and enemies if you have a bit of know-how.What else can I say, I highly recommend LoG2. It's a very solid upgrade from the first game, and even though I'm not even a quarter through, this game satiates my thirst for a chill video game sesh better than Skyrim ever has. It doesn't seem to go on sale very often though.			"

It very literally feels like tabletop dnd brought into a video game. Picking traits, assigning stats, configring your party, and then you start actually playing! It is a lot of fun so far and the gameplay does not disappoint. I missed the holiday sale to get it at a discount, but bought it anyway because it seemed like it was up my alley.

												In short:Really great game. If you liked LoG1 (and other games like Dungeon Master) you'll also love this one.Pro+ Improved and more variable monster behavior than LoG1, e.g. frogs which can leap behind you, some will move sideways etc.+ Great Puzzles! Be prepared to read notes, combine those hint with the riddles of statues, map fragments and/or environment sounds.+ No bugs or similar problem for me.+ Nice maps, with different environment styles+/- Spell and combat can be very stressful :)Cons- Characterdevelopment is somehow not transparent (for me at least). Some skills are very powerful, some are useless. At least from my perspective.- I'd love to have slighty more items in game available. I really don't like it, when you have only 3 different weapons per character the whole game.			"

												I would personally give this game 10/10. I love everything about this game, The dungeon crawler aspect, the tactical thought-filled combat, the amazing secrets. The list goes on and on. One of the best things about this game is the fact that while many games will be like ""yeah you got a secret here's and achievement"" while legend of grimrock is like: you got a secret here's some loot and a note about all the secrets you didn't find while still feeling good about yourself. Overall definently recommmened.			"

												This was an excellent sequel to the first. They took a nostalgic game genre to the next level in this release. The world was vastly expanded with puzzles and clues around every corner. They balanced that nicely with combat and engaging character classes. Definitely a must play if you are a fan of the old school dungeun crawlers.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is a true sequal. I thought the first game was great but had many problems that left the game needing more. The main thing I love is how open the world is and how you can play the game in essentially whatever order you want, unlike the first game which was far more linear. The goal overall is to gain access to the final area, but in what order of areas to go to before that is pretty much up to you. This allowed me to work on another section or puzzle when I get stuck rather than just quitting or caving in to internet help. Speaking of internet help, you may need it. The game is very challenging and if you don't save often, you may find yourself raging...a lot. No deathes feel too cheap as eventually you'll learn to recognize everything as a potential trap, but be warned that it can be unforgiving at times. If you enjoyed the first game, then you'll enjoy it's sequal. If you didn't like the first game, this entry may have fixed what you disliked, but likely didn't. And if you haven't played the first game, I would recommend playing the sequal first and going back to the first game later on, if at all. It's a fantastic game, but it's certainly not for everyone.			"

												Legend of grimrock 2 is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. offering more areas to explore in a more open environment. In this game you will be exploring an island instead of heading down a tower as it was in the last game. If you like classic dungeon crawler style game's then pick this up you will enjoy it immensely. If your one that dosent like the challenge of limited controls or gets upset easily then you better find another game.

												Incredible but true, Grimrock 2 is better than the first installment on several levels. The enemies are rendered better and the overall graphics are stunning to say the least. There's not ONE PIXEL out of place! The gameplay and difficulty is perfectly calibrated in contrast to other competing titles where you have 20 unsignificant foes with no challenge whatsoever and then a boss monster that's impossible to beat. This does not happen here! Difficulty is well-balanced. In contrast to Grimrock 1, here you will switch from overground to underground, adding much to the atmosphere of the dungeons. When enter an underground map the immersion is so powerful, it's like you could feel the air chilling.			"

												Pros: Both combat and puzzles are challenging yet maintain a fresh feel throughout the game. Free roam. The game truly doesn't hold your hand. Hints are plentiful and usually both easy to find and understand. Level editor and custom dungeon support. Game length is around 20 hours on a first playthrough depending on how hard you search for secrets. Plenty of secrets and treasures for you to find and toy with. Many different possible playstyles and party composition. Several bonus difficulty modifiers. Also, normal doesn't feel like easy.Cons: 1v1 combat can be extremely easy once you learn the controls and monster ai. A flying enemy appears that is invulnerable to most types of damage far before most players have the ability to deal with it. Ran into a progress halting bug where a key didn't spawn. Upon reload, the key spawned. This could be a serious issue if a player is using some of the difficulty modifiers. Game design promotes certain party compositions and leaves some playstyles almost worthless. With the amount of available skills, it is disheartening seeing that you can only utilize a few per character due to the low amount of skill points received throughout. Specializing is key to effective party members from the start and there is no way to understand this without playing for several hours. If you are experienced or plan ahead, late game bosses and enemies become a bit easy as damage scaling coupled with potion usage makes for insanely strong builds.Overall, I found this game phenomenal. It steadily increases the challenge both through new variety in monsters and puzzles throughout a lengthy game in a natural way. The music is astounding and boss fights are intense. There are very few cheap traps and most puzzles can be solved quickly if you find and comprehend the hints provided. Secret doors are usually (almost always) audible from the location of the object that opens them so if you pay attention you can find them. If you get stuck, you can go to a different area for most of the game and come back later thanks to the free roam design. Enemies respawn (and get more difficult as your level increases) but it takes a considerable amount of time to the point where I've never seen them respawn in the current dungeon (note that I rarely slept throughout the game though). Progression is consistent and if you get stumped, walkthroughs will make you facepalm because the solution is usually right in front of your face. If you are looking for a challenging, enjoyable, long (compared to modern games), cheap (again compared to modern games), and gratifying game, Legend of Grimrock 2 could be the game for you.			"

												Finally beat the game and I must say I had a blast, better then the original in everyway. Just like the first game mechanics only better and improved, level design is not linear like the first game everythings connected and a lot of secrets off on the beaten path. Even more so now with the implement of shovels and tresure maps. All the puzzles and areas you explore make you think outside the box, some puzzles may have you walk over magical tiles that could disapear if your not careful and others have you find items that you bring back to a certain location to open areas to progress. So many things done right with this game that I must say that its one of my favorite games of 2014, true masterpiece 10/10 a must get.			"

												THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT! It is the original Grimrock BUT improved upon nearly EVERYTHING! The world is now broken up into segments of overworld and dungeon segments and a huge map to explore. A little critice i have with the overworld is that there whereas some areas and things where out of place and broke the otherwise flawless emersion, such as the desert. But these areas are few and very far apart. And otherwise the different areas blend seamlessly.They improved upon all of the enemy designs to make combat waaay more interesting. and the combat areas have become intense. They provide a good space to battle in and at the same time restrain you. The new leverage and water tiles are really cool and added a vast amount of new possibilities with map design. The new classes and the rat and lizard people where great additions.The puzzles are as expected well made with a few exceptions here and there but that is to be expected of a puzzle game. And the secrets are a blast to discover. and the addition of pirate treasures and chests where neat!this game is a must for anyone who wants more of the first Grimrock or want a puzzle game with intense moments and an emersive world this game is for you. It took me around 42 hours to complete this game so if you are short on time this game is maybe not the best buy thou. There is also a level editor for the workshop, sadly i find the workshop to be slightly lacking.			"

												Great game.  I had never played the first one and got this one with the Humble Bundle Monthly subscription so I decided to give it a go.  It's pretty neat.  Granted I haven't played that long and a lot of the negative reviews are regarding the number of puzzles, but I'm very happy with it.  It's a first person game that is grid based.  I guess it's technically turn-based also, but kind of real time also.  It's a nice mix and a fun RPG. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd feel if I had paid $24 for it, but if you can grab it on sale then I'd recommend it fully.  I'll amend my review later after I've played some more.			"

												The Island of Nex, a worthy successor to the dank Grimrock mountain....In all fairness, Legend of Grimrock 2 takes the old formula from the original and evolves it in all the right ways. The main difference in the game is that instead of the sequential level design of the first game, LGR 2 has a more horizontal layout that allows more organic exploration then simple sequential levels. This does not confine the secrets (the many, many mind bending secrets) to simply the designated ""dungeon"" sections of the island either, in addition to simple little caches and puzzles on the island surface, you can find riddles and clues that can lead you to buried treasure chests, which was a great touch and encouraged backtracking (which was not much of a pain, the island has a small hub that links the major wings together). One flaw would be the diving mechanic, some tiles are covered in water and your party cannot stay in them for long without drowning, coupled with the fact there can be underwater enemies and your attack is disabled when underwater, you can get pinned into a corner and be unable to get out, resulting in you needing to load a previous save.The combat has been polished greatly from the first, rather then gaining perks that would allow for a random chance of a special attack, the weapons themselves have special attacks noted in their discription that can be activated by holding the attack button (at the cost of some energy/mana). All the spells from LGR 1 make their return, as well as some more interesting ones, but I do believe that more spells should have been implimented. However, the requirments to cast the spells have been reduced as a result of a simpler leveling system, so your mage is no longer a ""one trick pony"".The leveling system was revamped from the original, all skills now only have 5 levels instead of 50, and you gain one point to spend per level. One thing of note is that your stats now level automatically (but can be enhanced by drinking special potions) depending on your class, which can be a bad thing if you really want full control over your characters' growth, but not everyone does so its more of a neutral point. The skills also have milestone perks and per level upgrades, similar to the original. Overall the leveling system was streamlined rather then completely changed.One mechanic that was greatly expanded was the alchemy system, which acts as the party's healing. There are more ingredients, more potions and the potion interface is similar to the spell casting interface so it can be used in combat with ease (something the first game needed badly). Your alchemist can also make bombs which act as one time spells with additional effects (freezing the enemy, setting the ground alight, etc). The greatest alchemist can even cheat death, if you find the correct recipe that is.Overall, there are more items, more enemies, more ground to cover, more dungeons to dive into and more secrets to uncover. I would give the game a 9/10, it would be a perfect 10 if not for the annoying water sections and the lack of very many new spells. A great game, if you liked the first one, get this one, if you never played the first one, consider getting this one, the stories are independent and the second one is a bit stronger gameplay wise.

												Magnificent. They kept everything that was great in Legend of Grimrock 1 and expanded on it. It feels even bigger than the original and I can't put it down. It has monsters, combat, exploration, puzzles out the wazoo, even an occational scare! I have on multiple occations shouted out loud when some brand new beast rounds a corner and I'm caught with my pants down.It creates a great sense of adventure.What LoGR2 does different than LoGR1:-a wider variety of areas (swamps, beaches, castles, forests, and [don't you worry] more dungeons! And they are BEAUTIFUL)-non-linear exploration. (or at least more than before. think, 6 paths you need to complete but you chose the order and can backtrack)-vertical multi-level elements-a simpler, faster potion crafting system-more class types-a fifth species of characterWhat 2 still has from 1:-loads of monsters (most of them new [and more variety than even before], but you see some familiar faces)-loads of loot-loads of satisfying puzzles!If you liked the first, you'll love the second. I rather don't have a single negative thing to say about the game, but I will warn that it won't be for everyone. As a racing simulator lover might not love an FPS, and this game is a sub genre all on its own. The closest comparison I would make would be to an RPG (though I personaly enjoy LoGR's combat system more than any RPG's I've played) with more puzzles, but it really is D&D the video game.			"

												If you have not had the chance to enjoy Grimrock I strongly urge you too help these developers out and purchase the game. The asking price for both 1&2 is crazy value. Not to mention the dungeon editor will allow for 3rd party creations, extending the life of Grimrock 2.The game is a masterpiece dungeon crawler, I am only 6 hours into the game. My ask of them for improvements would be to start adding voice acting to this and NPCs into the game, this will help drive the story and lore of Grimrock. When I think of one word about this game, it would be ""Quality"".  "

												I am completely taken in by this game.  I don't think I've played a puzzler like this since ocarina of time.  I'm running Insectoid Barbarian and insectoid Battlemage upfront both +15 protection. Human Rogue in back with exp boost and ratling Alchemist. Alchemist can pump out potions and bombs when tough fights are imminent. I make my first two orbs and put them in their spot. And then...I am completely lost.  I go to the cemetery and it says the directions are in the archives. I go to the archives and find a note that says to ""follow the light"" and I have a door slammed in my face by a guy that looks like death. I go outside and talk to a face and it says to go where the sunrises to meet someone other than the death guy. I go in that direction and I'm back in the cemetery > <.  I am out of puzzles to solve except this multizone trial and error dealy. Ahhh. I have to shoot the temple door with my serpent staff which my battlemage has currently equiped, says the walkthrough. Never would have thought of that. Reminds me of blowing a hole in a wall in dungeon 6 of Link's Awakening except even more vague.One thing that could make this game better is a journal that stores notes from signs read.

												[Warning: Long Review]Seeing as Grimrock 1 is my favourite dungeon crawler, I got very excited when this sequel was announced. Unfortunately, my graphics card was kinda broken, so the game kept crashing when I attempted to play it. Booo. Now though, I have finally found a graphics card and the time needed to play it. So I booted the game, put the game on old-school hard difficulty, brought out my notebook with chequered paper and crashed my ship.With that said, a party of adventurers washed up upon the Isle of Nex. They were:In the top left: ""Goat C"", the minotaur barbarian. She smashes things with the heaviest weapons available and is being kept alive by carrying the heaviest armour available. Does a lot of damage to everything, but is slow and prone to missing enemies right in front of her.In the bottom left: ""Harry"", the insectoid wizard. She casts spells that, if elemental weaknesses apply, wreck enemies dead in no time - until she runs out of mana. Unfortunately, Harry decided to put one point in each magic school to test all low-level spells, so she can't use the more powerful ones until later, which requires a LOT of skill points. If she could start over again, she would wait with assigning skill points until said powerful spells were found.In the bottom right: ""Elizabeth"", the lizardman alchemist. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ alchemist is so stronk! The whole party would have died many times over if not for Elizabeth. Apparently her backpack is magical, because inside of it potion ingredients multiply! Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that is so broken. So, Lizzy keeps the party alive and fuels Harry's destructive powers. Also she slings rocks and darts at the enemies basically dealing zero damage....and in the top right I have inserted myself into my fantasy journey: ""Brunkuhrskrunkuhr II"", son of ""Brunkuhrshkrunkuhr   I"", one of the survivours of Grimrock I. I am a ratling farmer. When I read the description for the farmer class (no xp from kills, only xp from picking locks and eating food, starts with no skills) I thought; ""damn! This is the definition of a joke class! And since it's a joke class, it'll probably be insanely powerful late-game!"" One thing I remembered from Grimrock 1 was that I never ever was in any shortage for food, ever, so I would probably reach level cap in no time!  And it seemed I was right; ""Brunkuhrskrunkuhr II"" soon leveled far beyond his companions, mastering light weapons and light armours. But then something happened while I was deep inside a dark, damp dungeon with dastardly demons delivering deadly deliveries... I ran out of food.Grimrock II is substantially more difficult than the first game. Enemies are faster, have more health, deal more damage and above all else are smarter = exploiting the square grids on which the game is based is harder. So one has to think more strategically, observe enemy patterns and weaknesses, then deliver the hurt. To exemplify: there is an insanely fast mosqito swarm you can't outrun that deals unholy amounts of damage, but it dies in one hit to the first fire spell you find. There's sentient rocks that take pathetic amounts of damage from physical attacks...unless you get a critical hit. Overall, the enemies are well-designed and challenging.Grimrock II lacks one thing from it's predecessor - cohesivness. Where in Grimrock 1 you finish everything on one floor, then move to the next, solve the puzzles there, slay the giant trolls, then move to the next floor, etc. while always being in the same, huge dungeon, here the maps are more of a patchwork of different enviroments, with some puzzles extending over several maps and the maps having several exits in all three dimensions. So while in the first game you always knew where you were heading, this game requires a lot more exploration. It's kind of like a Metroidvania game. I want to get to the big castle. To do that I require 4 keys. One is on Sleet Island. How do I get onto sleet Island? I get a hint that the answer is in the cemetery. How do I get into the cemetary? I get a hint that the answer is in the archives. How do I get in the archives? I need to cast a long-range spell to extend a bridge that isn't ice spikes, like fireball! Where do I find fireball? In the dungeon you get to by extending said bridge! FUUUUU- So while I like Grimrock II for trying a different approach, I feel that much of the wholeness of the original game goes lost. And the farmer class would be much more OP if I knew where I was going and didn't waste food by walking everywhere.While Grimrock 1 had deliberately extremely minimal graphics, with every wall looking the same, Grimrock 2 is substantially more diverse and at times beautiful. So +1 to graphics. However, it does lead to ridiculous circumstances as where I cannot cross a small patch of grass because in gameplay it's the same as a solid rock wall.The puzzles are still decent, basically more of the same. Some are bad, like the aforementioned bridge-extnding that requires you to put points into skills you don't want. Some are dull, like looking for hidden buttons on the identical walls. Some are decent, like trying to time dropping a giant spider so it stays trapped at the right spot and doesn't come out to kill you. Some are good, like attempting to decipher treasure maps and codes. ...and some are traps. Allow me to quote my notes: ""This is a trap if I've ever seen one."" ""Itsatrap! Jumpscurz"" and one that made me smirk: An alcove in the wall containing a powerful magical book placed over a closed trapdoor with a sign next to it reading: ""I dare you.""I'm writing this review inside a dark dungeon where I have repeatedly died trying to kill the same enemies in order to get the coode to the archives, where my provisions have run dry (because I ate all the food) and Harry is starving. I'm torn between continuing to push forward or to shamefully backtrack to the surface to catch some fish. As we sit in the flickering light of our single, failing torch and not even Goats stoic expression can hide her despair, when our legs be broken from jumping into pits, when my hand-dawn maps are incomplete and we hear the monsters endlessly crawling around us I gush and exclaim: ""I Love Grimrock!""Then we're off to die again.-Edit: I have now finished the game, finally. Both endings. It took a long time, since I tried to find most secrets (but failed, ♥♥♥♥ing pixel hunts) and, you know, drew my own maps. I just have to say it's a shame games this good aren't being made as often. The feeling of adventure, the atmosphere of exploration, the intense battles... 10/10 would recommend, ""like dungeon crawling meets the Myst series.""			"

The game is more exploration then the first game the varied landscape more fun.  The game varies in diffiulty though, so depending on the area, lvl of your charaters, luck and items you find, depends on your experience.  I have encountered a bug where sometimes chests and sacks randomly disappear, at first I thought it was a result of the toads so spent 20 minutes looking for my missing items in the swamp.  But this occured aain in a different area. I don't know if anyone else has encountered this but be aware this has happened to me 3 times so far.  :-/			"

More new mechanics, more unique enemies, more unique environments, more spells, more classes, more secrets, more enemy movement patterns, more of everything.

												Even better than the first one, which is saying a lot. I didn't like tile-based dungeon crawlers when I was a kid and they were popular, but there's something about the Grimrock series that is different, and transforms a relatively dull genre into something exciting and engaging.  Even if you don't typically like this type of game, give this one a try..... and don't worry if you haven't played Grimlock 1, there is absolutely nothing tying the two games together.			"

												Despite a few issues, I highly recommend this game. If you liked the first one, you will probably like the second one even more (although I can see one some people seem to think otherwise).The sequel is huge, a much bigger game than the first LG. I liked the increased variety in the sequel, and having many smaller dungeons and a large overworld map is a big improvement. However, at times due to the size of the game, it was easy to get a bit overwhelmed. I didn't put enough notes on the auto map early in the game and sometimes forgot where things were. Later I documented everything, which helped a lot.My only major beef with the game is with some of the puzzles. I play this type of game as much for the puzzles as the rpg elements. Most of the puzzles are good to excellent, but for some I had to resort to hints. For these puzzles, whenI read the solution, I knew I would never have figured out the puzzle myself and I had no idea how the player was expected to figure the puzzle out. I didn't encounter this issue in the first Legend of Grimrock.			"

												This is perfect example of how games should be made!Great story filled with challenging puzzles, deadly monsters and secrets ;)While the first game was rather linear - just descend and never go back, here one have to explore an open world. Quite often progress in some area will be blocked by too tough monsters, or by a puzzle, for which clues are hidden somewhere else on the island. However, there is a kind of fast travel system, thanks to which moving around is not a problem.The game has some features improving replayability: achievements, different game-modes, custom party creation and level editor with steam workshop integration.The only thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was existence of few puzzles that made little, to no sense and one of them was standing in the way to finish the main story-line (cemetery entrance).Still 10/10.

												Magnificent. They kept everything that was great in Legend of Grimrock 1 and expanded on it. It feels even bigger than the original and I can't put it down. It has monsters, combat, exploration, puzzles out the wazoo, even an occational scare! I have on multiple occations shouted out loud when some brand new beast rounds a corner and I'm caught with my pants down.It creates a great sense of adventure.What LoGR2 does different than LoGR1:-a wider variety of areas (swamps, beaches, castles, forests, and [don't you worry] more dungeons! And they are BEAUTIFUL)-non-linear exploration. (or at least more than before. think, 6 paths you need to complete but you chose the order and can backtrack)-vertical multi-level elements-a simpler, faster potion crafting system-more class types-a fifth species of characterWhat 2 still has from 1:-loads of monsters (most of them new [and more variety than even before], but you see some familiar faces)-loads of loot-loads of satisfying puzzles!If you liked the first, you'll love the second. I rather don't have a single negative thing to say about the game, but I will warn that it won't be for everyone. As a racing simulator lover might not love an FPS, and this game is a sub genre all on its own. The closest comparison I would make would be to an RPG (though I personaly enjoy LoGR's combat system more than any RPG's I've played) with more puzzles, but it really is D&D the video game.			"

Each level feels impactful as well and you'll find yourself calculating each skill point.The game does an especially good job of being a old school western RPG while not bogging the player down with number crunching or a tedious inventory system.

												MUCH better than the first one which was just a ripoff of Dungeon Master, an almost exact clone but missing much of the best of the original.  This one actually adds something and was fun but I forgot Grimrock lacks an autosave and it didn't mention it so I lost my first hour and half of play.  I kind of doubt I'll bother redoing that same beginning for a while since I have a ton of other games to play and while mildly entertaining the loss of progress like that is annoying.  Didn't know I could fall in water, didn't know how to get out again.  More classes, not sure if they really matter yet.  I had hoped they would bring back the Dungeon Master magic system but they still have this simple version.  The downside is the annoying lack of autosave which I'm now remembering was one of the irritations that made me not play the first one.  This one will have even more situations where you die unexpectedly.  Having to F5 constantly as you play is just ridiculous to me and disrupts the immersion.  Such a simple option to have it save every 10 minutes would probably be the difference between playing and not playing for me.The other downside is the lame puzzles.  Those are the true downside to these games.  Rather than real challenges it's puzzles that are jar you out of immersion because they make no sense.  It's puzzles for the sake of puzzles.  Is it a dungeon crawler or a puzzle game?  I like dungon crawlers, HATE puzzle games.  I can't not recommend it but I think it's not a good choice for me.  I hope someone makes one where it's about the dungeon crawling/adventuring and not random puzzles for the sake of random puzzles.			"

												Legend of grimrock 2 is definitely an improvement over its predecessor. offering more areas to explore in a more open environment. In this game you will be exploring an island instead of heading down a tower as it was in the last game. If you like classic dungeon crawler style game's then pick this up you will enjoy it immensely. If your one that dosent like the challenge of limited controls or gets upset easily then you better find another game.

												Incredible but true, Grimrock 2 is better than the first installment on several levels. The enemies are rendered better and the overall graphics are stunning to say the least. There's not ONE PIXEL out of place! The gameplay and difficulty is perfectly calibrated in contrast to other competing titles where you have 20 unsignificant foes with no challenge whatsoever and then a boss monster that's impossible to beat. This does not happen here! Difficulty is well-balanced. In contrast to Grimrock 1, here you will switch from overground to underground, adding much to the atmosphere of the dungeons. When enter an underground map the immersion is so powerful, it's like you could feel the air chilling.			"

												This was the first dungeon crawler I played with such a style of gameplay, and I must say, I'm hooked. It's clunky and awkward to handle at first, but after some time it'll feel like a good book - You'll have a hard time putting it down. Secrets, clever riddles, intense battles and traps abound - This game's a paragon of the genre, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice to pass it by, whether or not you've played this sort of game before.Here's hoping the developers add some quality DLC.

												better than the first game for sure more  classes which do impact your play style and more races with thier own triats, grimrock 2 is still as good as the first except your not underground the whole time but you get to wonder an open world, so its not TOO linear but still an awesome game the puzzles are still difficult mayb even more so and the traps and even sacrier if you loved the 1st game PLAY THE 2ND GAME theres too much in the game for me to cram into this review but trust me game is really good and the story goes as far as you put into it cuz theres a lil hidden ending if you pay attention have fun !!!

												Is this game worth picking up.Eh, kind of.I have a kind of outdated graphics and CPU so my experence wasent as good as most others...in the overworld anyway, but not in caves and dungeons thankfully.I played this game when it came out and it was cool, the new systems were pritty neat and the revamped spell system held up.  Story was ok, but i guess it dident have the same charm as the old grimrock...also the final boss in this game is kind of an a**. (And i mean the real final boss)I recommend getting this game on discount as its pritty heavy in price and its graphics style might eat at your computer, plus its abit harder than the pervious game.

Being out in the open is a nice change of pace from the previous game. Graphics are lovely. Character creation is more or less the same. Puzzles are still challenging. Overall, a great sequel. If you were a fan of the first Legend of Grimrock. I can highly recommend buying the sequel.			"

												This game really hits the spot, it brings back old-school D&D like Eye of the Beholder series to modern graphics. You have the constrained square-based movement of D&D games, along with leveling up your characters and looting ever better armor and weapons to somehow solve the various obstacles and puzzles put in your path. If you liked those type of D&D games, I can't recommend this enough! :)			"

												Pros: Both combat and puzzles are challenging yet maintain a fresh feel throughout the game. Free roam. The game truly doesn't hold your hand. Hints are plentiful and usually both easy to find and understand. Level editor and custom dungeon support. Game length is around 20 hours on a first playthrough depending on how hard you search for secrets. Plenty of secrets and treasures for you to find and toy with. Many different possible playstyles and party composition. Several bonus difficulty modifiers. Also, normal doesn't feel like easy.Cons: 1v1 combat can be extremely easy once you learn the controls and monster ai. A flying enemy appears that is invulnerable to most types of damage far before most players have the ability to deal with it. Ran into a progress halting bug where a key didn't spawn. Upon reload, the key spawned. This could be a serious issue if a player is using some of the difficulty modifiers. Game design promotes certain party compositions and leaves some playstyles almost worthless. With the amount of available skills, it is disheartening seeing that you can only utilize a few per character due to the low amount of skill points received throughout. Specializing is key to effective party members from the start and there is no way to understand this without playing for several hours. If you are experienced or plan ahead, late game bosses and enemies become a bit easy as damage scaling coupled with potion usage makes for insanely strong builds.Overall, I found this game phenomenal. It steadily increases the challenge both through new variety in monsters and puzzles throughout a lengthy game in a natural way. The music is astounding and boss fights are intense. There are very few cheap traps and most puzzles can be solved quickly if you find and comprehend the hints provided. Secret doors are usually (almost always) audible from the location of the object that opens them so if you pay attention you can find them. If you get stuck, you can go to a different area for most of the game and come back later thanks to the free roam design. Enemies respawn (and get more difficult as your level increases) but it takes a considerable amount of time to the point where I've never seen them respawn in the current dungeon (note that I rarely slept throughout the game though). Progression is consistent and if you get stumped, walkthroughs will make you facepalm because the solution is usually right in front of your face. If you are looking for a challenging, enjoyable, long (compared to modern games), cheap (again compared to modern games), and gratifying game, Legend of Grimrock 2 could be the game for you.			"

												If you love to explore and solve puzzles this game is for you.  If you hate those kind of things, maybe best to stay away.  Legend of Grimrock 2 requires you to explore areas to find clues in order to solve puzzles and progress.  The areas in this game is a fair size so exploring an area does not become tedius.  Each area is quite unique and the graphics are so gorgeous that everytime I go to a new area I have to stop for a few minutes to take it in.  The battles are quick and the party development balanced.  Each time a charactor levels up you only have 1 skill point to use.  There are not many different skills so that you need to agonize over for 10 minutes on every level up, but enough so that specialization and planning ahead is important.			"

Legend of Grimrock 2 combines the wonderful dungeon crawler from the first game, (wich I also highly recomend) but successfully adds levels outside with there own deep feel and wonder to them. The look of the game cant be more beautifully crafted than it is right now. The gameplay is unlike anyother, you have a party of up to four in an RPG elament and must travel through an island riddled with all kinds of creatures...+Very good sound and visual+Still the same Grimrock gameplay+More of everything!-Framerate dips a bit when loading/saving and above on land.10/10    Patiently waiting for sequel			"

It very literally feels like tabletop dnd brought into a video game. Picking traits, assigning stats, configring your party, and then you start actually playing! It is a lot of fun so far and the gameplay does not disappoint. I missed the holiday sale to get it at a discount, but bought it anyway because it seemed like it was up my alley. It was better than I imagined. Buy it, play it, love it!			"

												As I ventured through the dungeons of the prison in the first Legend of Grimrock, I thought that it'd be really hard to take it up a level, because the game was a true masterpiece throught the whole journey.With Legend of Grimrock 2, we get something we didn't deserve. A truly astonishing Isle of Nex, full of tricky and intriguing puzzles, variety of enemies that we will always (well, except for killing a turtle at the end of the game) fear and can't ever underestimate, masterfully crafted locations, things to find, and of course secrets - the whole magic of Grimrock, the bread and butter, and they will also make you scratch your head every while and then. It is a really awesome experience to have, and I had to take it all in two sittings, but I wouldn't mind doing it in one. The game does have replayability as well, because you can make a lot of compositions of your team and they never get boring. The little offset is that whatever you do, you are obliged to have a magician to fully finish the game, but it isn't really a problem for everyday player. If you want to truly feel the game and reveal ALL of it's secrets, you have to do it.I haven't noticed any problems. The game runs really smoothly and bugs are virtually non-existent.I recommend it 110%. Must-have for every dungeon-crawler fan.			"

The game runs really smoothly and bugs are virtually non-existent.I recommend it 110%. Must-have for every dungeon-crawler fan.			"

												A thoroughly enjoyable (and large!) dungeon crawler. Old-school 'Eye of the Beholder' style combat (and occasionally enemies) and brutal difficulty. It is, then, a fitting sequel to the original Legend of Grimrock. Unlike the first game, however, this features larger outdoor spaces, a wider variety of puzzles and enemies and is much longer. It is everything you might want and more. I heartily recommend this to anyone fed up of the modern RPG scene which tends to consist of nostalgic isometric games that fail to capture the depth of the games they are copying but somehow manage to capture the infuriating combat; or open world collectathons with occasional 'dialogue' choices.For those who grew up on pen and paper RPGs, this is your spiritual home.

												If you liked LoG, then you'll love this one. Superior from all points of view, with some elements recycled from the first game but that isn't a bad thing. Combat is the same from the first game, graphics a bit better, level design really good, more classes, spells, traits, monsters and obviously puzzles. Good price for an awesome game, totally worth buying.			"

												A really fun game.  All aspects from graphics to audio to controls etc etc are polished and top notch.  The mini map is much improved over Legend of Grimrock 1.  Not since Dungeon Master back in the late 80's have I enjoyed a dungeon crawl so much.  Buy this game, support the developers so they will make Legend of Grimrock III...  Highly recommended.			"

												""Legend of Grimrock II"" is a sequel worthy of the series, plain and simple.  It does more than its predecessor both in terms of content and replayability.  It's kind of redundant to say that ""fans of the first game will love this one"", but in this case, it's true.  As such, it's very easy to recommend to those who don't mind a moderate to hard level of difficulty.  While the sequel is about nine dollars more in terms of launch price (""Legend of Grimrock"" was $14.99 at launch, the sequel is $23.99 as of 10/16/14), I believe you'll get a lot of bang for your buck should you decide to invest.  If you're worried that you haven't played or finished the first one, you needn't...the prisoners and story-line are unrelated, so have at it!Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/legend-of-grimrock-ii/Gameplay:

The outside locations are a welcome addition, and the dungeons are still just as good as before. New enemy types, boss battles, weapons/items, mechanics, and all kinds of awesome content packed into just the first level of LoG 2 let fans know that Almost Human Games are very likely only going make better and better games!

												Grimrock 2 takes a game that I already loved and adds greatness to it in nearly every aspect. Now the whole setting is a singular map (as opposed to seperate levels), and you can travel back to old areas via a ""hub"" system. Also new are some very unique enemies, boss fights, outdoor settings, and creepy sequences where the island's antagonist pops up unexpectedly. In addition, there are now firearms, which prove to be an interesting skill to level. You can expect a foreboding and mysterious setting with many puzzles that require you to think outside the box at times. Enemies will cause you to jump in your seat when they pop up behind you, or quickly enter a room once you've solved a puzzle. They are legitimately difficult and you will have to choose your fights carefully until you get some of the better weapons in the game. If you're new to the game, or get frustrated easily, I'd recommend doing your first play through in easy mode, it prevents the enemies from being too overwhelming and allows you to concentrate on puzzles and exploration. You may be temped to run to the internet for help on the puzzles, however you should know that the greatest fulfillment, which goes hand-in-hand with the enjoyment of the game, comes from solving the puzzles yourself. Those ""a-ha moments"" are what makes Grimrock 2 stand out among its peers.Minor quibbles include a couple of puzzles which were overly cryptic, and if you are patient, being able to swivel around difficult enemies continually without taking damage due to the tile-based system. In Grimrock 3, I'd like to see enemies that can walk to the next tile and attack you from their side, that would definitely require additional strategy. Overall, easily one of my favorite games of all time, easily in my top 5, and I've been playing for quite some time. If you're on the fence, you need to try Grimrock, you won't be able to put it down!			"

												Simply put, it's a wonderful game. I was, at first, expecting to hate the ""old school"" style of play here, but it works wonderfully here. I've grown to love the sound of the finding secrets, the joy of finding a missed button, and solving a puzzle and really not being sure what it opened or where. It's easy to just play for a bit and come back and pick it up again. I could see myself playing though multiple times, maybe the next game I have 100 hrs into.			"

												One of the most amazing games of the year. I'm not even that far, the game personally spooks me, but it's simply stunning. The Gameplay, the graphics, the collecting and exploration and overall sense of dread just keeps you going. You could turn a corner and get stuck by spiders, or collect a cool looking gun and get teleported to a dungeon surrounded by undead. The game has tons of hidden secrets too. It's simply amazing. If you're ok with jump scares, this is good. And these are actually pretty spoopy. Dark hallways,spooly sounds...It can get pretty spoopy!			"

												A sequel that seems to improve from the original in every way. Pros:- Fantastic level design. Features an outside world that can lead to dungeons, and then dungeons that can connect to other dungeons. It makes the world feel interconnected and organic.- Clever puzzles. The majority of the puzzles in the game are very mind-bending while also being reasonable enough to solve on your own. - Improved Combat. The enemy AI isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn good. Enemys will often move try to pin you down, dodge, and even flee. Also, if you're a wizard-lover like me, you'll greatly appreciate the improvements to the spell system, and the skill tree system as a whole.- VARIETY. This game does a fantastic job of making the world varied enough to keep it fresh while also making it consistant enough to make the world feel connected. Just when you start getting sick of an enemy type or a weapon that you have. the game will throw in something new. Even the puzzles have a decent amount of variety to them with some being reflex-based, being observent of your surroundings, thinking outside the box, and even cracking codes!Cons (I'm gonna be honest, these are pretty nitpicky):- While the inclusion of guns is nice, I feel as though they were a bit of a missed opportunity. I came across maybe a total of 3 or 4 firearms on my 1st playthrough, and for the often pitiful damage they do they aren't worth it for the amount of times they seem to malfunction and backfire. There is a firearm that's good, but you'll hardly use it out of fear of wasting the very small amount of ammo it has. Hopefully, they'll be buffed for Grimrock 3. *crossing every finger I got*- 2 or 3 puzzles in the game felt a bit lazy or too ambiguous, but they're greatly overshadowed by the amount of good puzzles in the game.- Legend of Grimrock 3 hasn't been made yet.10/10, Even if you're not a fan of dungeon crawlers, after this game you will be, take it from me, a guy who's never played a dungeon crawler before this one.

												Legend of Grimrock 2 will surprise you no matter whether you're fresh off the back of LoG1, are experienced with this style of game from the past, or are completely new to it entirely.The game is a ridiculously huge improvement from the first -- with a rich open world with copious amounts of surprises and secrets that will have you scanning every wall for those precious buttons, cracking codes scrawled on notes by long-dead adventurers, or chasing pesky leprochaun-like tricksters across the world while grabbing armfuls of hidden goodies along the way. Heck, it may even throw the occasional jump-scare to keep you on your toes if you find yourself fully relaxed and enveloped, like I was. Nope, I wasn't expecting that thing to jump at me, or to be ambushed during a nap.Make your adventure-squad and set-sail for puzzling fun. When you need a break, take on an impressive beastiary with swords, shields and spells. A lot of the old cast have returned - as have new ones. Combat can still be cheesed like before at times, though the game will throw trump cards at you if you rely too heavily on it - and there's some pretty nasty boss-battles in store to boot.Three out of two thumbs up for this relaxing-to-frustrating rollercoaster that'll have you fist-pumping on the completion of every puzzle or after emerging victorious from hard-fought battles.Loving it!

												Magnificent. They kept everything that was great in Legend of Grimrock 1 and expanded on it. It feels even bigger than the original and I can't put it down. It has monsters, combat, exploration, puzzles out the wazoo, even an occational scare! I have on multiple occations shouted out loud when some brand new beast rounds a corner and I'm caught with my pants down.It creates a great sense of adventure.What LoGR2 does different than LoGR1:-a wider variety of areas (swamps, beaches, castles, forests, and [don't you worry] more dungeons! And they are BEAUTIFUL)-non-linear exploration. (or at least more than before. think, 6 paths you need to complete but you chose the order and can backtrack)-vertical multi-level elements-a simpler, faster potion crafting system-more class types-a fifth species of characterWhat 2 still has from 1:-loads of monsters (most of them new [and more variety than even before], but you see some familiar faces)-loads of loot-loads of satisfying puzzles!If you liked the first, you'll love the second. I rather don't have a single negative thing to say about the game, but I will warn that it won't be for everyone. As a racing simulator lover might not love an FPS, and this game is a sub genre all on its own. The closest comparison I would make would be to an RPG (though I personaly enjoy LoGR's combat system more than any RPG's I've played) with more puzzles, but it really is D&D the video game.			"

Light years better than its predecessor, the game is more immersive, takes you in outdoor places as well as the dungeons but also has underwater environments. Gameplay is similar to the first one with some extra features like single click to cast spells (very very effective). The game offers some amazingly hard modes like using the crystals only once (which is what I'm attempting at the moment hehe) and saving the game only once per crystal giving a more hardcore experience! I accidentally clicked cancel at a crystal and lost the save chance... terrible experience. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!PS: The first time I ran it I experienced some really low fps (~20).

NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?!  oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?!  i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help.  especially the super duper secret ones.I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.

												Played and finished on hard difficulty. Came away with the best feeling since playing through Dark Souls 1 for the first time. Not to say this game is similar in terms of combat, oh no far from it. But the addicting interconnected world that is begging to be explored and for you to find out all of it's secrets is all there. Because of this you actually feel how you've progressed  throughout the game, and how much stronger you've become as you breifly run past old areas. This is an itch for me that so very few games get. Every puzzle and enemy encounter left me wanting more and more until the very end. Well worth the money as you'll probably spend more than 30 hours on your first play through. On a side note I found that the Itemization in this game feels nearly perfect. You're constantly finding new gear and upgrades. So much that I would say this game defies what a lot of RPGs like to do nowadays, and that is bloat their games with armors and weapons that serve little to no purpose or ""Vendor Trash"".			"

												A very very good sequel worthy of its name. Legend of Grimrock 2 features many of the familiar mechanics seen in the first game, yet it improves upon the AI significantly, where they are less rigid in movement and are able to avoid your strikes or even counter-attack you as you move to their side, seemingly learning from your actions (a tactic commonly used in the first, where you strafe to their side and attack before strafing away). It features the grid-based movement and introduces new weapons, weapon attacks (special attacks) and a new race to boot. The puzzles are more interesting this time around and arguably the difficulty has been upped. Boss battles are exciting and there are many hidden areas for you to find, with each hidden area becoming more and more difficult to discover as its clues become more subtle. The maps have also been increased in size, where multiple paths can be taken for you to try out different puzzles, leaving you with the option to come back later if you wish. The visuals have also been improved and are quite impressive. A definite must-buy if you are a fan of the first game.			"

												It's an outstanding game for the dungeon crawler fan. Open world with dungeons and secrets spread out all over the island, customizable party, amazing visuals and sounds, etc. The music even fits very well - I was concerned about that beforehand. I thought I would be writing a 5 paragraph review on the game but I've put about 40 hours into it so far and still not sure how much left I have to go. I picked up two games on steam in the last week; The Evil Within and LOG II. TEW was a 31 Gb download and LOG II was under a gig and by far the one that has kept me attached to my rig the longest. If you're any kind of RPG fan, for $20 this game is a steal. IMO they could have charged $29.99 or $34.99 and it would have rivaled the value and playtime of any 3DS game that Nintendo poops out. Buy it already, and ration out the food you come across. It's basically Ultima Underworld 2014 edition.			"

												This game is a dungeon crawling masterpiece.  It leaves a lot open to interpretation and imagination which I like.  The general feeling is between a classic dungeon master style game and Myst.  The combat is suprisingly fast paced and interesting.  When I started the game I found it really difficult to get started.  I wasn't happy with the races and found the beggining really difficult.  Because I wasn't doing much damage at the start and didn't quite understand the gameplay I reloaded a dozen times and remade characters a bunch.  This turned me off at first but I'm glad I muddled through as it was one of the most rewarding games I've ever played.  My only other complaint was sometimes the logic on some of the puzzles didn't make sense or only had a very weird clue.  I love a mysterious puzzle but there is a thin line between logical puzzles and randomly guessing.  The guessing part gets old.  Anyways A++ game.  I'm extremely happy that a game with this old school feel has sprouted in the year 2014.-Pros - great combat (learning curve)Great envirement (absolutely perfect graphics for a crawler)Perfect sound (engaging but subtle)Great Dungeon creator kit and community (if you ever wanted to build dungeons like I did as a kid)Great puzzlesNever had a glitch, extremely refined game -Cons-Learning curveRaces aren't as flexible as I'd likePuzzles quite difficultMight turn you into a dungeon addict			"

												If you like the original Legend of Grimrock (LOG hehe), you're likely going to enjoy this just as much. The addition of outdoors areas is quite nice, but feels really weird given the gridlike nature of the game.If you've not played LOG1 before, it's an old school, grid based, party o' four RPG. Kind of a hybrid between turn-based and real-time. Pleasant graphics.			"

												This game surpasses the greatness of the first one. With tricky puzzles and many great enemies this has been a joy to play. I grew up playing games like the 'Eye of the Beholder' trilogy and to get something just as good if not better was a great surprise. The fact that Almost Human was able to capture that essence of greatness & enjoyment through a interesting story and fun gameplay I commend them. Another thing that makes this game great is the added bonus of mods from the workshop which extend that D&D style gameplay of old. Truly this has been a great experience and would recommend to anyone that is a fan of D&D style character progression and gameplay.			"

And if you want to get the true ending, you will feel like the smartest human alive.Music's pretty great too!			"

												Love the game!!!this game in particular, it is a great modern take on a classic gameplay.You move  U D L R with W A S D  and you rotate with Q, E (default)  and all you have to do is just click whatever you see on the screen that needs interacting \ killing.Only bad thing i can say about this game is, the way you have to fight\control your characters. you're primarily looking at the bottom right corner of your screen, doesn't do justice to the beautiful creatures they've made in both games.Its single player, high replayability since loads of people make their own dungeon runs as well.tons of puzzles, some \ almost half of them i wouldn't have figured out on my own without help.  so its a good mind game as well. as long as you're not being chased by death while trying to figure out a puzzle.bad thing is, if you like being a thorough, achievement hunter.  then like the first game. NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TO CHECK ALL THE WALLS. EVERY SINGLE WALL EVERYWHERE!?!  oh and you can dig the earth now with a shovel. SO YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE LAND TILE TOO!?! AHAHAHHAHA!?!  i don't think i would've had the patience, and the insight to figure out some of the puzzles, secrets etc without having help.  especially the super duper secret ones.I do not recommend it if you have not seen at least a gameplay video or two, so you'll see the old school play style this game is.

Quite often progress in some area will be blocked by too tough monsters, or by a puzzle, for which clues are hidden somewhere else on the island. However, there is a kind of fast travel system, thanks to which moving around is not a problem.The game has some features improving replayability: achievements, different game-modes, custom party creation and level editor with steam workshop integration.The only thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was existence of few puzzles that made little, to no sense and one of them was standing in the way to finish the main story-line (cemetery entrance).Still 10/10.

Then Grimrock 2 came out and I wondered if they could keep the pace of the first one. They did not....They improved on it.

Graphics are nice enough but nothing breathtaking, on the other hand You should have no problems running this game on a laptop or an older system. The only real complaint is the lack of replayability since the game is quite linnear. Unless You want to go through the game again and uncover all the secrets which can be somewhat tedious.

												The Legend of Grimrock 2 is a throwback to the time of Ultima: Underworld, but with better graphics and deliciously enjoyable puzzles and secrets.The 40+ hours I spent on this game were enjoyable, nostalgic, and satisfying in equal parts. The puzzles are not designed to be extremely difficult, PROVIDED you find the proper clues for them. Backtracking is a necessity in this game, which focuses in a more messhed approach where the entire map offers secrets in the early, middle, and late game.  In fact, there are TWO endings, which I found very interesting.Though the game allows for a playthrough with any character class, I observed that a mage/wizard/spellcaster of some kind makes the game a lot more playable and, more importantly ---> you MUST have someone with the ability to cast spells (or at least invested 1 point into Concentration, the main spell casting requirement and have a low requirement wand) if you want to find the 2nd ending.That I didn't enjoy, the fact that if I had chosen all non-casters that I wouldn't have been able to get to the 2nd end.Also, the last 3 boss fights are monumentally more survivable with long range attacks. These are not reasons to avoid the title. It is such a rewarding experience for the genre. If you love puzzles, secrets, and old school dungeon crawling remniscent of table-top maps, this is the game for you.Buy it. Play it. It is a darn satisfying game.			"

												The perfect ""dungeon crawler"" game.Nothing more to say.Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back have been a huge part of my life years ago.And LoG 2 succeeds in bringing the same feeling of discovery, mystery, adventure and perfectness of the old masters.""Bigger and loudder"" than the first LoG, that was almost perfect in his genre, but wasn't ""as perfect"" as Dungeon Master was at its time.I find that LoG 2 is as perfect as Dungeon Master was because it brings some unique things in the gameplay never seen before. So many things that i can't describe them here. Just try this game!And technically it is awesome (music, graphics, engine).Congratulations guys! 11/10			"

												A ♥♥♥♥ing amazing role playing game!! Light years better than its predecessor, the game is more immersive, takes you in outdoor places as well as the dungeons but also has underwater environments. Gameplay is similar to the first one with some extra features like single click to cast spells (very very effective). The game offers some amazingly hard modes like using the crystals only once (which is what I'm attempting at the moment hehe) and saving the game only once per crystal giving a more hardcore experience! I accidentally clicked cancel at a crystal and lost the save chance... terrible experience. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!PS: The first time I ran it I experienced some really low fps (~20). It was fixed by enabling triple buffering on the nvidia control panel. Just saying...			"

Yes, lots of different builds and races to experiment and play around with, game is huge and fun to experience for a second time, mod scene is very activeBest part – The environments are varied and a lot of fun to explore, with lots of puzzles and secrets to find in each.Worst part – Some of the puzzles are very difficult, if you're not a fan of puzzles this could put you off.

												A great, classic dungeon crawler RPG filled to the brim with secrets and strategic options of building Your party. Graphics are nice enough but nothing breathtaking, on the other hand You should have no problems running this game on a laptop or an older system. The only real complaint is the lack of replayability since the game is quite linnear. Unless You want to go through the game again and uncover all the secrets which can be somewhat tedious. Nevertheless I love Legend of Grimrock 2 and would give it a 9/10 overall. PS: Where is some DLC with another adventure!?			"

												A really solid Dungeon Crawler.  8/10.  The live combat makes it more ""action"" orientated so if you're looking for something more turn based this isn't it.  Great atmosphere and graphics, not deep on the story.  Be prepared to die a lot but in doing so you'll never really become too attached to your party.  Puzzles are good if not a little hard at times.  To find everything you'll need a guide or walkthrough.  I tried to play each area clean, without looking anything up.  When I exhausted an area I'd look it up to see what I missed.  There's some replayability here if you want to try it on a harder difficulty or with a completely different party setup.  Looking forward to more from this dev.			"

												In short: Fun, beautiful and a bit difficult old school challenge. Like it's predecessor it's a tip of the hat to the classic grid based fantasy roleplaying games back in the 90's, like Eye of the Beholder. It's a good mix of tough monsters and tricky puzzles, and there's a lot of variety in level design and theme for the different areas. Legend of Grimrock 2 adds outdoor areas, height differences (and ladders), underwater areas amongst other things, as well as new character options and both new and old familiar monsters. Some areas have quite impressive visuals that made me stop and savour it. And on top of it, it has multiple endings too. Well done, devs.A few puzzles were pretty much impossible for me to solve (or rather, realise what they wanted me to do), despite being attentive to a lot of details and finding most secrets without help. Thankfully there are a lot of online resources if you get stuck (always try a lot first yourself) but at the end of it, the puzzle part is good but there's room for improvement.Combat is mean, in the sense that you can't straight up fight anything. If you do, you're dead. Square circling or sidestepping is a must for surviving any encounter. This is just how LoG works but I think I would prefer a more straight on approach. On the good side, a lot of monsters have abilities that work against the circling, so it's still a fun challenge. The monsters are varied and fresh but if I should be building new maps with the ingame level editor I would like some of the more classical fantasy monsters as well.If you liked LoG1 or other games of the genre, it's definitely worth a buy.

												The Legend of Grimrock 2 is a throwback to the time of Ultima: Underworld, but with better graphics and deliciously enjoyable puzzles and secrets.The 40+ hours I spent on this game were enjoyable, nostalgic, and satisfying in equal parts. The puzzles are not designed to be extremely difficult, PROVIDED you find the proper clues for them. Backtracking is a necessity in this game, which focuses in a more messhed approach where the entire map offers secrets in the early, middle, and late game.  In fact, there are TWO endings, which I found very interesting.Though the game allows for a playthrough with any character class, I observed that a mage/wizard/spellcaster of some kind makes the game a lot more playable and, more importantly ---> you MUST have someone with the ability to cast spells (or at least invested 1 point into Concentration, the main spell casting requirement and have a low requirement wand) if you want to find the 2nd ending.That I didn't enjoy, the fact that if I had chosen all non-casters that I wouldn't have been able to get to the 2nd end.Also, the last 3 boss fights are monumentally more survivable with long range attacks. These are not reasons to avoid the title. It is such a rewarding experience for the genre. If you love puzzles, secrets, and old school dungeon crawling remniscent of table-top maps, this is the game for you.Buy it. Play it. It is a darn satisfying game.			"

												This is the best Dungeon Crawler game. No doubts about it. The feeling you get playing it is superb. You are really drawn into the game.The puzzles and all the little details you have to take into account are just perfect. For me that's the thing I love most.It was a long time since I last played a game that's worth spending lots of hours of your time.This game is different from all the♥♥♥♥♥♥that nowadays populates the game market (RPG and Dungeon Crawling wise).Legend of Grimrock I was great. This one is even better. Puzzles are really really nice, I love them.Maybe, my best money I have ever spent in a video game.I strongly recommend buying this game.I am looking forward to a Legend of Grimrock III. I would definitely buy it even if it was a copy of this one but a different environment and different puzzles. Do not make stupid and easy puzzles please! A mix is the key (personally I love hard ones). I just hope developers don't take out from the game the things that some people criticize about it, because that's what makes this game perfect.Bad critics of this game normally come from players that want a first person kill & loot game.What can I say more? Buy it!			"

												A worthy successor to the board-like dungeon crawler known as Grimrock I. Both of them seem to hit that sweet spot between making a game look good and leaving things to your imagination. It's tough to describe, but there's just this feeling of charm to it few games have nowadays. Combining old-school gameplay with graphics on par with the Trine series does work out for this one.While the core mechanics remain the same, pretty much every aspect of the game has been expanded upon. No longer are you limited to dungeons, you actually get to explore some outside environments for once. They look daaaamn good too, especially the beach. The new campaign only starts out linear to ease you into things, but after the first two areas you end up in a hub-world from where you choose to go next. There are new puzzles that aren't limited to ""put rock on pressure plate"", new items, more monsters, more classes, etc. Speaking of items, weapons have special moves now. Also day-and-night cycle.However, I don't think this game would be the same without the editor, which alone is enough to make cool maps. It doesn't take much at all to create your own levels, the editor's fairly simple to use for a 3d game. To make it even better, you can use lua scripts and custom assets to make your dungeon even more interesting. You could create some intricate puzzles, boss fights, or even add your own tiles, objects, and enemies if you have a bit of know-how.What else can I say, I highly recommend LoG2. It's a very solid upgrade from the first game, and even though I'm not even a quarter through, this game satiates my thirst for a chill video game sesh better than Skyrim ever has. It doesn't seem to go on sale very often though.			"

												A triumphant sequel! Looks great, sounds great and plays identical to the first but with more potential build diversity. Some of the secrets and riddles are rather devilish in nature so expect to have your mental capacity stretched as you try to work your way around some of the more obscure puzzles...or just consult a guide for some extra clues/the complete solution. Like the first game, I enjoyed the story for what it facilitated but it generally feels rather redundant in the context of what one would like from such a game.My only real negative is the skills system - I really think there needed to be more traits in each skill line. There should always be an interesting bonus at the end of each skill line to entice the player to spend more points into single lines at the expense of skill diversity. I generally found there was no difficult choices to make with skill point allocation because you rarely had to max out a skill line to achieve its most important trait. Other than that, it's a perfect sequel.			"

I grew up playing games like the 'Eye of the Beholder' trilogy and to get something just as good if not better was a great surprise. The fact that Almost Human was able to capture that essence of greatness & enjoyment through a interesting story and fun gameplay I commend them. Another thing that makes this game great is the added bonus of mods from the workshop which extend that D&D style gameplay of old. Truly this has been a great experience and would recommend to anyone that is a fan of D&D style character progression and gameplay.			"

Going through the varied areas of the island as opposed to a single dungeon with ~3 floor variations does wonders for the fun factor, and the game still does a great job balancing the difficulty of both its puzzles and combat encounters.If you enjoyed the first game, or even if you're just generally a fan of classic-style dungeon crawlers, you'll be sure to have a  great time with this one.

												Awesome game with indepdth strategy involved. Improves vastly on an already good game.One sad thing is, that you can only chose armor viably for defense and evasion doesn't do much. It was the other way around for the first game. But having a lot of choice for your offense is very nice (although - heavy weapons are superior. But even on highest difficulty all weapons are actually viable). This game is a prime example that randomized maps aren't the way to go. A thouroughly planned map with many possibilities to play through it - especially after finishing it once.			"

As much as I love dense RPGs like Pillars of Eternity or Wasteland 2, a simple dungeoncrawler is all I want at times. Kick down a door, ♥♥♥♥ things up and grab the loot. The puzzles, difficult combat, spellcasting runes and simple character creation are all great elements. Only real negative that comes to mind is an often frustrating control scheme. Highly recommended.			"

												There are very few games I can come back to and play as much as this one. It teaches you how to play, and immediately ramps the puzzles and difficulty up until you're panicking and running in circles trying not to die to a trap full of monsters. The secrets are absolutely insane and getting everything takes so long that it's worth the money.			"

												One of my all-time favorite games, along with the first. This one's better than the first in my opinion, and for what story there is, it doesn't really continue from the first at all. I'll never forget some of the moments and enemies in this game in particular, I played it for 12 hours straight each session, right up to the end. I just couldn't put it down.			"

												This RPG is undoubtedly hard, very hard. The enemies are tough (honorable mention for the elemental ones. They will become your nightmare) and some puzzles are difficult to solve and a bit frustrating at times. Nevertheless it's also a ton of fun and it will encourage you to find the best solution to deal with each monster, due to the possibilities of customization and the equipment at your disposal, which is quite remarkable.Legend of Grimrock 2 is probably not a game for everyone, but if you are looking for something challenging then give it a shot.

												You should understand me correctly. Game is/was very good to some point. But:- On some point of game I had very recent freezes (I need to force restart of pc), especialy in regions when I saw green 'mist'. I found at last one place when it freezes ALWAYS. In some it was radom (to that point of game I did not have any technical issues). But it happends mainly in mist, and after that also in water (but i used water before without problems). I dont know what changed.- I tried to register on official game forum to ask for help but i did not receive activation mail (tried 2 mails). I have information that I should contact administrator in this case. But how can I do it if to contact it also force me to login??Now I can not play and cen not ask for technical help? This game is totaly unplayable for me now...I will change my opinion if someone will help me run this game...Update: I changed into positive. Support is very bad as did not get any help. Now it looks like problem ended after i changed graphic card, but anyway it should not be on start (as i had problems only with this game). Now i need to start for very beginning. Great was great not counting this problems...			"

Like I said, get a walkthrough or plan on spending hours trying to advance the game without much success.			"

												A great, classic dungeon crawler RPG filled to the brim with secrets and strategic options of building Your party. Graphics are nice enough but nothing breathtaking, on the other hand You should have no problems running this game on a laptop or an older system. The only real complaint is the lack of replayability since the game is quite linnear. Unless You want to go through the game again and uncover all the secrets which can be somewhat tedious. Nevertheless I love Legend of Grimrock 2 and would give it a 9/10 overall. PS: Where is some DLC with another adventure!?			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine After you manage to find your way out and escape Mount Grimrock, you become shipwrecked on an island and your only objective is to find a way out and survive, will you manage?Legend of Grimrock 2 is a game developed and published by Almost Human Games and is the sequel to the first dungeon crawler game; Legend of Grimrock. Legend of Grimrock 2 puts you in control of a group of four prisoners aiming to find their way out off an island. Search for secrets, find clothes, weapons and armours and continuously upgrade the abilities of your party membersIt is a wonderful game if you are willing to immerse into it. But it requires a lot of patience and endurance because it's a very difficult game. The game allows you to set up your personal party, choosing the race and abilities of your members or you can simply start by using a pre-defined group. As an old-fashioned dungeon crawler you can only move one step at a time in one directionLegend of Grimrock 2 has great atmosphere with nice and improved graphics from the first game and addictive game with extremely good and varied puzzle design with many different and gradually stronger enemies and mysterious hints that gradually reveal the story and are very rewardingThe mazes can be maddening at times but at the same time this adds to the claustrophobic mood the game is trying to portray, however, Legend of Grimrock 2 isn't easy so be prepared to die a lotOverall, Legend of Grimrock 2 is a fun dungeon crawler to play in bursts and is a great return to the Legend of Grimrock series! RECOMMENDED :)  "

You can call them fights.No doubt this is a good game. Fine puzzles with worthy QTE.			"

The character classes, races, and leveling system are simple, but good.  Down side is that you need to gain a bunch of levels to do some of the nifty things in the game.

												What an excellent retro RPG.As a person who played the original Dungeon Master, All the Eye of the Beholder Series and many others on the Amiga back in the day this game brings back great memories.  Indeed someone developed the Dungeon Master dungeon for this game as a DLC and it was great to play. I was amazed at how much I remembered from 25 years ago!Its a turn based game on a tiled map, in the same way as the original.  That is not to its detriment though.  It beats the crap out of many new full 3D shoot-em-ups in sheer gameplay - the complexity of the puzzles and mazes and the progressively more difficult monsters which will catch you out if you don't upgrade your characters to match.   I played the original dungeon and then several more player dungeons before I hd hard enough.  If you like this Genre then this is one of the best examples ever created.			"

Puzzles ranging from the most complex code ever thought of to a mundane game of find of the button. SECRETS SECRETS SECRETS SECRETS. SECRETS. SECRETS ARE GREAT. And beyond that, most items are unique, meaning its not just another common random gen thing you found on the ground, but something far cooler. Multiple classes and workshop levels offers hours of replayability, beyond the 24 hour campaign.TL;DR if you ever thought ""wow, D&D looks kinda neat"", BUY THIS GAME RIGHT FLIPPEN NOW			"

												Amazing grid-style dungeon crawler/western style RPG. I love pretty much everything about this game and the mysterious, dangerous, puzzled filled and monster infested island that my 4 shipwrecked escaped prisoners find themselves stranded on. Modern visuals/sound/execution, with a retro style, classic heart. Some people don't seem to care for the more ""live action"" combat style, and I was a little iffy on it, at first, myself. I warmed up to it though, and I don't think a more turn based fighting system would suit the game. It might make for a difficult time at first, if you have never played a game like this before, but its well made and very well balanced, once you get the hang of it.I absolutely recommend this game, with one suggestion: look up some character builds before setting out, even if you ultimately decide to branch out and do something completely different. Understanding the strengths of each class, what perks and traits benefit the playstyle you have in mind, and knowing what to do with your points as you level is paramount to having a good time on this island. I won't say its impossible to build a hybrid character but you typically won't have any points to spare or waste, and you also probably won't have nearly as many of them (or levels) as you envision - and spreading yourself too thin is a huge mistake in this place.

												This game was so much more fun than I expected. Puzzles are mostly a joy to complete. Leveling up characters is satisfying. Learning curve was a little steep at first, but definitely worth getting through. What a cool game to explore.			"

												I always have two games ""in progress"". One slow like P&C adventures, turn based strategies or puzzle games. One fast like shooters, real time strategies and say RPGs. This definitely falls into slow category. Puzzles are abundant and you need to scan the walls. Some of them are Myst like. There are also quick time events. You can call them fights.No doubt this is a good game. Fine puzzles with worthy QTE.			"

												Legend of Grimrock 2 is similar to the first game in a lot of ways but this game is set outdoors on the Island of Nex which allowed for bigger areas. The skill system has been overhauled and way less linear as you can increase any type of skill regardless of your class, classes only provide some bonuses and such but you can progress whatever you want. They also retained the unique rune based magic grid casting system but instead of clicking on each rune you have to connect a line between runes to cast spells. Another thing this sequel retains is the amazing atmosphere and story through notes you find throughout the game. Their are 5 races which are humans, insectoids, minotaurs, lizardmen, and ratlings. you can create 4 characters for your party like the first game and they also added firearms to the game as a new weapon type and skill as well as overhauling the alchemy system by adding an alchemy skill and a plethora of ingredients and potions which are very useful as well as elemental bombs. I hope my review has convinced you to buy this amazing game but I recommend you play the first one as it is easier to learn and get players into the genre of party based dungeon crawlers of the olden days. Hopefully the Legend of Grimrock series gets more players into this type of RPG because their are a handful of these kinds of games from the 90s that are amazing such as the Might and Magic franchise or Eye of the Beholder series and much more. Thank you if you read this review and please buy Legend of Grimrock 2 as it is a sequel done right in every single way but Legend of Grimrock 1 is an amazing game as well and much better at getting players into these games.

												The second legend of grimrock game.Old school dungeon crawler with better graphic and sound, if you liked dungeon hack and the eye of the beholder serie you should like this game too. There is no random level generation in this game.There is a dungeon builder included in the game and  the dungeons created can be shared, that a big plus for some.			"

												This is a great old school dungeon crawler with modern graphics. Reminds me very much of games like ""Eye of The Beholder"" Its quite hard to start with but it is fun and rewarding, the atmosphere is good and the game plays well. I like the fact that you can only turn or sidestep which gives it a older feel but ot still looks nice. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the old school dungeon games like EOTB.			"

												A very well done RPG in the vain of old school Dungeon Crawler games. Interesting puzzles, a wide variety of maps/environments, and a large selection of enemy to fight. The game treats the player in a way that no other game in the past few years have been able to replicate, requiring you to actually think as you go along your advanture, plan ahead, and doing a bit of research. For such an old genre, it's aged surpisingly well.			"

												Loved the game, got all the achievements, and spent over 80 hours on this gem.Here's to hoping that future releases will have shops (like the good ol' Dungeon Master II), randomly generated contents (similar to Grimrock Unlimited), better spell selections (no more rushing Fire 5 / Air 3 for meteor storm on all mage characters), and character biographies while creating custom ones.I still occasionally come back to this game for some quick action and satiate the need to create custom characters.

												oh boy oh boy, as my Legend of Grimrock review made it abundantly clearhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/nuclearkangaroo/recommended/207170/LoG1 is one of my favorite indie games, and Legend of Grimrock 2 is one of my favorite games EVER period.the best way to describe this game is ""Legend of Grimrock... but BETTER"", more Legendary, more Grim, more Rocky, all the base mechanics from the 1st game remain in place so i wont waste much time explaining itthe Legend of Grimrock series is a grind based dungeon crawler RPG series in which you control a group of 4 characters, you fight monsters and solve puzzles, thats the short verion. what makes LoG2 even superior to its predessesor is content, variety and the expansion of the core mechanics, instead of exploring a single big dungeon in the game, you explore an island filled with multiple dungeons and secrets, to returning players of the series this game truthly changes things up with the addition of these open environments and the classic dungeon gameplay is still there, you only have to enter the numerous caves, temples and dungeons to experience it againthe basic combat has also been expanded, the game now has a new type of weapon, guns as well as 5 new character classes and a new race, the ratling, also the devs have made other classes besides the mage a little more fun to use (the mage remains just as fun to use dont worry), certain weapons now have special attacks that add versatility to each character and you unlock new perks and abilities as you level up your class skillspuzzles, a major feature of the last game are back and with force, this game has some very incredible puzzles, almost all of them are hard but fair, i can really count 1 or 2 puzzles AT MOST in the entire game that followed a very weird logic, for almost everything else, you just need to use yer brains, im actually very proud of the fact i didnt need to use a guide for any of the puzzles in this game, unlike the first gameenemies also received an overhaul, the main strategy of the first game, running in circles around them, is much less effective now since the enemies turn faster and many have moves that make it very hard for the player to circle strafe, and hell the game now has more than 1 boss and they are all great and challengingif theres one thing i wasnt a fan of in this game, is the new limb injury system, basically, some enemies/traps/enemy attacks have a chance of crippling your head/legs/feet/right arm/left arm, each crippled limb applies a different debuff, these can only be removed by either consuming a red potion or touching a save crystal, now this on itself is not bad, except for the fact that FALLING DOWN PITS CAN CRIPPLE YOUR LEGS AND/OR FEET, those who played the first game should be able to see the problem with this, the LoG series often hides secrets or alternate routes down pits, there are no ""bottomless pits"" in these games, every pit leads to a lower level you can explore, usually you will want to use the stairs tough, because in the first game, falling down these pits hurt you, in LoG2 however, it hurts you and CAN cripple you, this is made worse by the fact some puzzle and obstacles send you down pits if you fail them, adding to the frustration. now to be fair Lo♥♥♥♥dded a new item, the rope, which allows you to descent pits without taking any damage, still, until you manage to find a rope, your LoG1 habits might lead you to a nasty experiencei suggest anybody interested in LoG2 plays LoG1 first for two reasons:1) its a great introduction to LoG2, since the game doesnt have a particularly good tutorial, those who played LoG1 should be able to get around LoG2's mechanics more easily2) this game is such an upgrade over the first game that is almost impossible to go back once you finish LoG2, is just so much better than a game that was already greati cannot recommend Legend of Grimrock 2 enough, its my 9th favorite game of all time, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ masterpiece			"

												This has the feel of an old school dungeon crawling RPG but the graphics feel up to date. Great play for some people who like this style of games. (and no, this is nothing like skyrim in my opinion so if thats the reason you want this you might want to look elsewhere)			"

												Fnished it on hard was a great game in the old school style once you have finished it you know why they don't make games like this any more. UI makes things very clunky a potion bar would have fixed a lot of time spent going throught the inventory. Guns are rubish except for the cannon but ammo is very rare for that weapon. Overall 7/10.			"
