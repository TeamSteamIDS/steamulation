												I like Armello. I like it a lot. It looks fantastic, it's a beautifully-crafted world, it's got a great deal of variety both in aesthetic in characters. The world and its characters are fascinating; even with little character development, the animations alone are enough to convey each character's personality, and aspects like the Rot are mysterious enough to be captivating. I'd absolutely love to see this world explored further in other games or media - it's a world I want to spend more time in. However, I've put a good deal of time into the game, and while for the most part I've enjoyed myself, the game has two critical flaws that make me uncomfortable recommending it. So while this review is negative, please understand that in the context of ""it's great until you start taking it seriously.""The two major issues the game has are as follows: first, attacks are easier than defenses. When you are in battle, barring any of the rare modifiers, three sides of the six-sided dice result in an attack, one of which rolls an extra die (which can chain infinitely), while only one side will give you a defense. A defense will block one attack and no more. The issue this presents is that combat has extremely high variance; you could roll 12 dice against 6, and there's still a large chance that you will die in the process. Your opponent is far more likely to roll enough attacks to kill you, than you are to roll enough shields to ensure your life. Even when you roll 20 dice against 4, you could very easily watch a long chain of rerolls build on your opponent's board that quickly eclipses your shields and remaining health. Rather than feeling like an exciting and rare moment, it feels like the norm. The conclusion may be, therefore, to avoid combat entirely; but there are also an abundance of ranged cards that let you do large amounts of damage, and rarely requiring you even be close to the target. There is no way to ""safely"" play a game of Armello. When paired with the variety modifiers for the dice rolls, the simple fact is that surviving is far more difficult than killing......which leads into the second issue: there is basically no comeback mechanic. It is ridiculously easy to fall into a situaton where you can't progress further towards any victories or character progression because you keep dying, and you keep dying because you can't become any more powerful. This is not just a common occurence, it's basically standard: in every game aside from AI matches, one person will always end up in a situation where they literally cannot compete because they have to go for their quests, but they can't get to those quests because it becomes too easy for them to die along the way and start way back at the beginning. And even if they get to stack the odds in their favor - they get a few lucky spells that buff their attack and die and weaken their opponent - once again, the game is so high-variance that they are still very likely to get set back to square one. The problem here is not that you can be screwed over at anytime; it's that you are less likely to be screwed over when you're already in the lead. Not just on the basic premise that players who can stay on the board get more powerful and have more opportunities (rich get richer), but there are other game mechanics to support this: The Prestige Leader gets to pick one of two laws to be enacted every dawn, meaning they can always choose the card that benefits themself or threatens other players; and also, once you die, you can't play any cards to the board until you leave your spawn on your next turn. You can also only move after you've drawn cards, meaning you may will be unable to toss the cards you don't want in order to draw better ones that might actually help you win. And once a player realizes they are in that pit they cannot climb out of, there's hardly any reason to complete the game - I've never played an online game where a player hadn't tapped out by the halfway point. I wouldn't even call it a ragequit; after all, acceptance of defeat does not have to involve anger any more often than disappointment. And once one person has left, the remaining players generally follow shortly after.So, I also play a lot of Blood Bowl. I've stared the worst that RNG can offer straight in the face, and occasionally managed not to cry. But Armello is rigged in such a way that makes Blood Bowl seem almost forgiving. If Wyld rolls (the ones that reroll) were shields instead of attacks, the game would likely be significantly more fun to play, as it would encourage trying to stack the RNG in your favor; rather than always needing the best luck possible to get anything done, no matter what you do. Blood Bowl is a game of calculating risks and managing your actions to maximize your chances of success. Armello is a game of swearing because the game will leave you in positions where your only hope for victory is that everyone else starts aimlessly wandering into swamps and suiciding constantly for the remainder of the game.I still recommend the game for a few hours' worth, if you've got friends to play with. Don't play online, because you'll never finish a game with as many people as you started with. And don't stress over trying to get better at the game, because you'll eventually realize that the skill ceiling was underneath the building's foundation all along. But yeah, it's a pretty fun experience for a period of time.			"

												This game is a real treat for those looking for something unique, visually attractive, and challenging. It is very well produced blend of strategy, role playing, and board gaming. The producers have comitted great attention to detail. Every element of the game; characters, story line, events, spells, equipment, flavor text, and even poetry, create a true sense that this is a fully imagined world that you have entered.Before I go into the gameplay, a little bit on the game lore would be helpful: Armello is a kingdom of animal clans ruled by a lion (king). Unfortunately, the king has been infected by a creeping, evil disease called the ""Rot"". It has driven him mad and slowly ebbes his health. Each night the Rot grows in him, and each morning he loses health. His madness is evident in his daily decrees, that create chaos around the realm, affecting the heroes and inhabitants of the kingdom. The time then has come to depose the king and for a new hero to take the throne.Armello is a turn based 4 player board game (you can also play against AI). At the beginning of a game players choose a hero, a female or male character, that is either a bear, wolf, rabbit, or rat. Each character has unique stats (Fight/Body/Wit/Spirit), and also a unique ability. The hero's creature clan type provides a trait that provides a boon for that character as well. From there players select a ring and amulet that provide additional abilities or benefits to their hero.Players take turns drawing cards, moving their heroes about the game board, casting spells, and completing quests. Completing a quest improves hero stats, and rewards them with equipment, followers, or treasures. As heroes adventure they will encounter perils, both randomly placed, and ones placed by other players and the king. They may also attack other players and cast spells on opponents to hinder their progress or even kill them. There are King's guards and evil creatures called banes that wander about the board that will attack players and generally get in the way.The object for each player is to aquire the means to dethrone the king and become the new monarch/matriarch themself. There are 3 ways to win the game; by defeating the king in straight one on one combat, by gathering 4 spirit stones to destroy the ""Rotting"" king, or by having the most prestige points when the king finally succumbs to the Rot after 10 turns.So here's the take away for Armello:Pros:       Beautifully imagined and rendered world. From the artwork to the storyline to the general atmosphere, you know that this game was a labor of love for the very competent makers.        Unique. Armello borrows from several genres and merges them into new gaming experience that is a welcome break from the copy/paste fodder that has cluttered the online gaming selection.        Fun and addictive. Even if you don't win you'll have tons of fun tripping up your opponents and discovering new ways to use heroes, board tactics, and spells.        Replayability. The variety in characters, abilities, and win conditions make each match unique and provides tons of replayability. Achievements will unlock new rings and amulets that give players even more opportunities to expirement with heroes and win conditions.Cons:        Waiting. Armellos is a turn based game so this may turn some people off. In addition each night and morning there are non-player creatures that must move and decrees to resolve. One consolation is that you can still play spells, perils, and equip items during another players turn.         More waiting. The player base is still small and you may have to wait a while, sometimes longer than a while, to get a full group of opponents. (best bet is to invite your friends to a game)         Random. ""The best laid plans of mice and men...."". The randomness of card drawing, dice rolls in battle, decrees, and questing, can sometimes wreck your strategy. It can be frustrating since you have little control over this element of the game. But the more you play, the more you learn how to mitigate this factor and/or adust your strategy in midstride.          You can't win. Ocassionaly, at some point in an Armello match you'll realize that you can't win. Kinda like in Monopoly when you own Mediterranian and Baltic Avenues and your opponent owns everything else. It just ain't gonna happen. Sometimes as early as midgame you come to this realization. Many online players drop out at this point (the game inserts an AI player to take over when this happens). And you'll feel like your just going through the motions, hopelessly. But, you can still get some enjoyment out of messing with the leading player or even by helping another player steal the win!In closing this is a great game that's different and enjoyable. It deserves to succeed. So get it, play it, and definately tell your family, friends, neighbors, and enemies to give it a try.			"

												Beautiful game, but is meant to play online.... where it has its flaws. I have played a few matches. and so far every one of them if someone is about to lose they just disconnect and you get stuck on a waiting screen that makes you have to quit the game and are penalized for, meaning you cannot join a multiplayer game for a bit.

												I really enjoy this game. I have some cons and pros though which I'll include below.For many years I've followed this, it had a successful kickstarter which brought it to steam.It was quite popular, and I'd say still is, probably. I never have too many issues finding people to play with.PROS:---------- nice music- REALLY GOOD ART- the cards in game have art which are painted and ANIMATED!- the cards in game have bonuses, or curses which you can play on yourself, tiles, or others- NICE >> you can't harrass each other in chat, as the responses are specific to each character. (For example, my rabbit will say 'salutations' instead of just 'hello', where as another may say 'Hiya!' etc., It depends on personality of the playing character. You cannot type to talk. (Maybe a con to some, see below)- Dice are tradeable, easy to get. Just play and it throws boxes/keys at you.- Can play with friends. (also a con, see below)- 8 characters to start, tons of dice, rings to unlock (benefits), cards, and map is completely randomized- Events happen at random in the game which makes for good gameplay.But I have a few complaints, not with the game, as it's quite fun, really balanced and random.But with the community.CONS:==================================- Can't type to talk. This is fine for me for the most part, as I'm less anxious about joining a game knowing I can't be verbally trolled, but at the same time, I wish there was a 'nice dice!' button, or something, I'd really just like them to know that they have nice dice!- Why are you allowed to invite 3 players? I would say a 2v2 or inviting for a full match is okay. But when playing a 3v1, honestly I always feel pressured, a 2v2 would be okay, but a 3v1 is difficult. Whenever I've played against a 3v1, some of them will hunt you down and block you in your base, while letting one other character win the game for them, then they will often give each other reccomendations to level each other up. It's not fun. AT ALL.- Same with above, but instead of hunting you? They go afk. They'll just fill a space and not move from their clan base ( they're immune to attacks there) so theres less players to fight against for their friends and they can farm.- Bot Farming > people will join the game, go afk in the base, and just get chests when the game is finished. You can't even kick them. Some of the items are worth £2+ so it's a big problem. :(**** NOTE Reporting is easy to do. Please report these players. ****You press escape when in game and just click the bug icon on the right corner. I did it there a few times now, but I don't know if pushiments are ever taken.			"

												There is a lot I like and do recommend it;  HOWEVER, and there is a lot I don't like about this game.The good parts:just love the graphics!  Love the audio!  Love love love the concept behind the whole premise of the game!  It's genius!  Almost everything about it is just fun.  The different characters being animals and their traits. etc.   This has so much potential for expansion it isn't funny.  The whole game as it is now could be one small room in a whole castle or kingdom. and jsut a small part of the story.  (sorry in game development so get too excited about the potentials.. feature creep)  Anyway, the like part of this is so broad that it's hard to put it in a few words and I don't have time or the finger durability to write it all down.  I love the fact that it's difficult to master. ... but the game is too random card wise to get really good at it or turning situations.  I love that you can win in different ways.  like I said .. this game has so much genius in it. However, in the hopes that the dev team sees some of this I will detail a little more in the ""don't like"" side of things.  Because I want to keep playing!First of all, the games are not short most of the time, and that is good, but there is no way to save a game and come back to it later.  If you have to stop and quit due to life, you loose all progress.   I don't need a bunch of saves to cheat with. I just want to save to come back to later.  It took me almost 3 hours to play one game.  Sometimes I don't have that long to play but don't want to screw myself out of playing because I don't have 3 hours.  Online play, well doh, no need for it there but locally, that is a feature I'm frankly appauled isn't in there yet.  That is an industry standard for any tabletop or turn based game. ... in fact most all games.A couple of times I played a card, for example, one that takes one prestige from each player.  palyed the card no problem, and everyone still had all their prestige and I got 0.  There are a few cards in there that are similar that seem to be buggy in general or buggy to one character.. but it isn't consistant enough to give you a bug report with any helpful info in it to track it down. The randomness of the dice and cards are a bit too random. characters really don't get to build and use their strengths and weaknesses.. wait... Thane has no weaknesses (for example)... and always has money and prestige even if you take it all away.  Even if he has an item of some sort.  doesn't matter the game, whether he has city income or not or hasn't even gone treasure hunting, etc.  Even if he gets killed 4 times in a row with no source of income , he's always got plenty of gold and presitge. LOL!!  That kind of needs to be looked at.  Makes for a great challenge if you got the right attitude, but even if you do, after a while it gets old. I know unlocking jewelry and stuff helps you customize it a little bit but honestly, it's in areas that don't help that much in most characters... not all.. but most. What good is stealth in the city at one part of the day when it's likely they saw you go in there.. >,<  It's just an example of the many things.  Sure it might come in handy a sliver of the time but it really doesn't make you feel compelled to unlock much of anything... and there is no progression at all in any way to make you feel like you are playing more than a same scenario board game. In the game you have to stay almost completely rot free to survive or go full rot.. you can't really play the middle of the road and have much of a chance of winning anything other than prestige or by stones.I will have to say though, even with all the ""dark side"" comments, it's worth 15 dollars... but if improvements aren't made soon, honestly I wouldn't pay 10 for it even as beautiful and artful as it is.  The flaws are big gotcha's .. something as simple as a ""sorry you can't save your game and come back to it"" is HUGE!!I really hope this keeps progressing I love it and do recommend it. Edit:  It will save your progress in single player, but be aware there is no message that it will do so.			"

												After days of gathering Spirit Stones, my time had come to infiltrate the castle and cleanse the King of the Rot, at last bringing an end to the madness that had plagued Armello for so long. Twice I was thwarted, twice I lost precious time as the King fell deeper into his sickness, but on my third attempt to slip past the sinister curses, I made it beyond the palace walls. Soon we would be free!But it was not to be. The other powers of the realm, drunk with lust for the throne, would force me out, limping, bloodied, back to my home. It became clear that I would never be able to save the King before the Rot claimed his life.And so I began a swift campaign of political treachery. I schemed, I connived. I did things that whittled away at my soul. To my dismay, it was not long before a rival house entered the keep and slew our once great King. But they sacrificed their own life in the process. In the turmoil that followed, I slipped through the web of liars and conspirators to occupy the vaccuum of power left in the rivers of blood that now freckled our land.I could not save the King, nor could I save my spirit. But by the gods, I would save Armello.(Stories like this happen EVERY time I play. This game is PHENOMENAL.)			"

Early Access Review
								+ BEFORE YOU BEGIN +  Know that you will forever have 1/3 of the games cast unaccessible to you, and most dissapointingly, by far the most interesting characters of said cast. This is due to a unadvertised kickstarter which was participated in by about 3,000 people. Being part of said kickstarter got you access to the ""Bandit"" clan permenantly and exclusively. So let's just get that un-advertised thorn of dissapointment right out in the open.The Pros: -The game is fun, the gameplay is solid, and it feels like exactly what it was meant to be- that beer and chips roleplaying, dice throwing, card slinging board game you've likely played with your friends before. -The graphics are smooth and there is plenty of depth to keep gameplay engaging.It is also worth mentioning that the single player AI doesn't feel lacking like some games of these genres do, and have an amusingly nasty habit of punishing the player and other AI's mercilessly. It feels nearly complete if not acceptably so as a base boardgame in it's current state to be frank; though not all cards are incorperated in the game yet, nor are the characters. -The full game will double the (dirty steam players) roster from 4 to 8. So there are more characters to come. and assuming the community doesn't take the secret kickstarter issue too personally, likely more to come in future expansions, assuming there will be expansions.The Bad: -As a pre-release it does have its share of  bugs. Occasionally, but not often, the game will hang on an AI's turn and require you to restart the game. This can be bothersome, but it has only happened to me 3  times out of about 14 matches so...it's par for a pre-release in terms of technical difficulty.-The game does not explain in any way it seems, the ability mechanics obtained through spells and equipment yet.Example, the abilities ""Scout"" as provided by ""Mariners Lantern"" and ""Evasion"" as provided by a spell who's name I can't remember, are discussed nowhere. You can refer to a wiki...but I feel there shouldn't have to be any sort of question on this. Especially with a large tutorial-esque digital pamphlet to read to get the rules down, there should be an effects tab there to clear up any confusion at the least.- People can and do ragequit if they are losing mid game. These games mind you can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. This being said, a poor sport could waste a good chunk of your day with no sense of satisfaction to be had. It is also worth noting that there is no system in place to punish this type of poor sportsmanship, and thusly, you can keep your win/loss ratio as high as you want it to be as long as you never let yourself lose...by ragequitting.The Ugly:- Overall; I love this game and hope to see it succeed... but I will tell you this as well. Anyone who gets into this game will eventually feel a creeping frustration regarding the 1/3 of the character cast they will never have access. Especially given that they are easily the best designed and most interesting characters so far as to be seen of the lot. This is a real shame in my eyes.Being meant to be played online, the average player will likely get fed up or agitated seeing these sacred cows they will always want to play with, but ya know... NONE FOR YOU!Also, it is worth mentioning this will likely cause tension regarding the competitive gaming community as well regarding the legality of these characters in any sort of tournaments, which will likely insight endless bickering and hostilities between the filthy steam players and the obscure kickstarter community.Final Verdict:+The Grade I want to give: 9/10 - As a pre-release game it shows a great deal of polish, care, and attention to detail. The gameplay is balanced and there is enough to be done to remain engaging; including trash talking in chat mid game. I love the way it looks and feels very much and could spend many countless hours tooling around a game like this casually, however...+The Grade I have to give it: 6.5/10 - As stated above, this is a fun game that is hard to find fault with, even in its early stages, but with the ability for poor sportmanship to ruin any chance of an accurate leaderboard, and the high probability a ""Good"" player may actually just be a man child hellbent on wasting your time and robbing you of that satisfying victory you started the game seeking, I can't fully endorse the multiplayer just yet in a competitive sense.Furthermore, I personally found out about the game only after it was released in its early release phase, but by the time the steam community was made aware of it's existance, they were already damned to forever-never play 1/3 of the games cast; more regretably so, the most appealing 1/3 of the games cast.Maybe seems like a small detail to some out there, but I personally won't ever be able to fully dismiss this as a ""Tough luck"" kinda thing. Because nothing spoils a good meal like eating by a great meal, especially when you never knew it was going down accross the table from you.			"

												Armello is a skirmish boardgame-like computergame set in a relatively grim setting, featuring anthropomorphic (read: Furry, if so must!) characters. 4 players (and/or bots) are competitively trying to win the game within a set number of rounds, through one of multiple victory conditions.More specifically, the goal of the game is to either defeat or cure 'the king' from his cursed state, before the rot that has afflicted him takes his life. Players will draw random cards every day/night as chosen from 3 types of decks, be it equipment, magic or trickery in order to increase their chance of succeeding in one of the multiple victory conditions - Meanwhile questing, fighting off corrupted beings or dealing with your other opponents trying to hinder your success.The game delivers absolutely gorgeous  artwork and modeling, with every card containing animated artwork brought by a wide selection of skilled artists - I might personally be biased enjoying an anthropomorphic setting like this, but its undeniable that the designers spend a great deal of time focussing on the aeshethics of this game to grant us an immersive experience.For me personally, a total recommendation - If there would be anything I would like to see changed in the feature, it would be a slightly more attractive balance between the multiple victory conditions, as I consider some of them to be drastically harder to achieve.As for additions: This game needs more lemur!

												My overall rating for Armello: 85/100Armello brought us a board-game-like adventure-strategy  where four heroes are racing for the throne of Armello ruled by corrupted king. Strategy here is a key element, though luck factor is also important, as fights are being resolved with dice rolls, but a good player may ensure that odds will be on his or her side. Lets see this title in detail.GAMEPLAY+ Variety of heroes with unique abilities+ Hex tile design+ Day/Night cycle+ Huge replayability+ Four victory options+ Interactive turn-based system+ Cards+ Story-driven prologueo Fair multiplayer (host leave may crash the game)o Luck and random number generator- May be frustrating sometimesGameplay is cute and lovely. Heroes are moving on hex based tile, and trying to get prestige, magic, coins or even rot sometimes. With four modificable stats via quests - Fight, Body, Wits and Spirit - the amount of strategies is huge and also it adds more replayability to Armello.There are basically four victory options. Firstly we have a Prestige victory - gaining prestige for quests, killing heroes and banes. Second one is a Spirit Stone victory, after gaining four stones through quests and stone circles, the king is banished after engaging him. Kingslayer and Rot victory are very simillar, you have to kill the king, survive, when trying for Rot, your Rot has to be higher than king's.Day and night cycle also brings important aspect, as heroes have affinity to day parts and also other creatures too. During the day Guards move, during the night Banes are spawning and moving. It may be an advantage or disadvantage, heroes may also become corrupted, which changes their strategy.Good strategy may bring the odds to player side, yet still luck plays an important factor here and after several unhappy rolls players may get frustrated. It is a risk, that needs to be taken. There are six kinds of cards - Items, Spells, Trickery, that may be drawn, Treasures, Followers, acquirable from dugneons or quests, and Palace cards, which player simply has to encounter. Questing is important, as it may deny the palace perils, which are really difficult and nasty.Multiplayer is fair and it is up to the player, if they decide to team up or not, victory may belong to the best one. Also mechanics are good againts leavers or delaying players, though, when the host drops it might result to game crash.Last addition to good points is a story-driven prologue, that is not just a simple tutorial, but the beginning of story in Armello. Also easy to understand and explain game mechanics.CHARACTERS+ Traits and affinities, variety of themPlayer may choose so far from eight heroes and adjust the strategy accordingly.Rabbit clan is represented by Amber, the Far Seeker, who is excellent in dungeons seeking, thus has a higher chance of get a reward. Another member is Barnaby, the Screwloose, who collects equipment and when changing equipped items, cards are not burned.Bear Clan offers Sana, the Forest Sister, who uses Spirit instead of Fight, when dealing with corrupted creatures, and Bran, the Oakbreaker, who gains temporarily Fight after each successfully casted spell.Rat Clan has Mercurio, the Grinning Blade, who steals gold from previous settlement owners and Zosha, the Whirlwind, who is alwasy stealthed at night and may ambush other creatures.Finally, we have here the Wolf Clan. Thane, the Winter Wolf pierces burned cards with swords through enemy's defense, River, the Howling Arrow, shoots before fight, inflicting one hp injury to target.King is always corrupted, whose healthe decrease and rot increase through the game. Banes get additional rot each night, guards are dealing with them, or with heroes, who have bounty on themselves.New heroes are announced, review will be updated after release.VISUAL+ Nice art style+ Animations+ Dices+ SEASONS- Few graphic glitchesArt style is lovely and suits the nature of the game. Also combat animations with dice rolls are amazing (there are four different dice styles so far with animations), differing whether the dice explodes or not, also hit to the hero differs from a blocked attack. There were some graphic glitches, but very rare and not affecting gameplay.It si good to see, that developers still keep this game changing and alive. Newest addition is about year seasons and it is great. The war of the throne keeps going through the whole year. And nou players have that impresion.SOUNDTRACK+ Stylised+ Lisa Gerrard performance+ Changing accordingly to the atmosphereSoundtrack is very well created and composed. Songs are underlining the dark-fantasy atmosphere and course of the game. Also Lisa Gerrard participated and her voice well known from Dead Can Dance or Gladiator suits melodies and game very well. I am glad that developers released soundtrack, that may be also purchased even by non-early-access players.SUMMARYTo sum it up, Armello is well driven adventure-strategy game with dice rolls and a bit of luck, that resembles the style of board games. With a plenty of cards player may react to changing course of the game and adjust the strategy perfectly. This title alsom offers much to the people outside the genre, so for a reasonable price you may get a huge amount of fun.I have been playing this game from 0.3.5 ""Pride's Fall"" patch and game made a huge progress since.Strongly recommended.

												Thumbs skyward, ladies and gents.To clarify just what Armello is--it is definitely a boardgame come to life in digital format. The card-drawing, the dice-rolling, the playing field all remind you of those cutting-edge games at the hobby store that nobody's ever heard of. The mechanics of the game are dreadfully simple, so you don't need Coordination Level: Dark Souls to play. If that's OK with you, then play on.I'd also say that this is first and foremost a multiplayer game. Single player had me for about 10 hours, but there's no campaign or complex progression or anything that will drive you to play solo all year. The AI can seem a little tricky at first, but it eventually becomes fairly predictable. At some point, you're gonna wanna branch out and go into the multiplayer queue.The game's simplicity allows even a sub-par connection to keep you hooked up, which means matchmaking can reach farther afield and keeps moving even though the game doesn't have a mega-roster of players. I live in central US, and queue times are about 30sec-2min. On rare occasions when the queue exceeds 5min, the game lets me dabble in single player while waiting and informs me when the match is ready.You've also got one of the best communities I've seen, so it's not hard to find peeps to play/get acquainted with. Chat is restrained to a selection of speech options like you'd see in Hearthstone... At first it unnerved me a little, but then I went 20 straight games without reading a single homophobic slur or N4z1 slogan and I decided that that was OK with me.As important as I feel multiplayer is, I don't think you'll ever suffer from the population problems that crash giant multiplayer-only titles. Low connection requirements, community, and ability to sub in an AI slot in a pinch mean you can always find a game.The one thing that initially drove me nuts about the game is the same things that bothered some other reviewers here: Dat RNG. There were times when I first started playing the game where I didn't just curse fate--I wanted to take all of the kittens in the world and punch each one of them in the face. Yes, I was that angry. But I've come to realize the error of my ways.There are a couple aspects of the game that take getting used to.First--the mechanics... Managing cards and dice rolls can have a subtle but powerful effect on how the game plays out. You have opportunities to affect what kind of dice you roll, how many, and even whether or not the game comes down to a dice duel at all. Waste these and you'll be constantly at the mercy of RNGesus. You can't control the dice--but you CAN influence them an awful lot.The second thing is that there are multiple victory conditions. This, I think, is one of the ways in which the game truly shines. Contrary to the most popular negative review on here, I'd say that your path to victory is NOT obvious in the first few turns. It's constantly changing, and you need to pursue multiple paths simultaneously or make some titanic shift in your favor at just the right moment so that no one can counter you.Get a strong start and someone will pull the rug out from under you. Let someone else draw fire and you might slip in the side door when no one's looking. You have to be flexible and play it loose because you won't even know what the winning combo IS until that perfect moment arrives. Push down one path every time instead of going with the flow = 75% chance of Doom.Lastly, the statistical hurdle: 4 players. You'll lose often enough, because 3 people lose EVERY game. Maybe you can whoop the AI, but against random Interweb goons even a 75% win rate means you're semi-pro. If your sense of self-worth is centered around executing consistent strategies and earning consistent rewards... then Armello may drive you to madness. Get used to feeling like everyone else is trying to drag you down--they are.The devs support their game with multiple weekly events. What's already here is good, but with this support the game also seems to be on a good long-term trajectory.I'd rate Armello as a $30+ game masquerading as a $20 title. Since I can't retroactively pay them $10 I'll probably just buy the new DLC.And the Guppy plushy. Guppy is the next big thing in video game mascots.			"

Like A Song of Ice and Fire! With Animals!-----Version 1.0 Update is finally here and this game has become everything it set out to be. My review still holds, please read below. As for those complaining about RNG, yes there is a lot of randomness to aspects of this game, but as the store page says ""Difficult to Master"". Learn how to utilize what is dealt to you. Once you learn the ins and outs of this game you can see the light in what you may consider bad luck of the draw or dice roll. Cards have more functions than to just be played. You may go into a game with one strategy in mind, but be prepared to change things up. I've had plenty of games where I was seemingly at the bottom but would rise to the top to finish strong and win the throne. Don't give up like some of these negative reviews that only have 0.2 to 2 hours played. They barely scratched the surface and do not see the potential.-----As a kickstarter backer, an alpha and beta tester, I can say without a doubt that this game is truly a gem. Even in its alpha form it was very well built and fun to play. You can see how much love LoG puts into their game in every single detail of this magnificent world. The story is deep, and engaging. The basic idea is that a Mad King is cursed and slowly dying. The goal is to over throw him and become the new King/Leader of the land.Each character has their own backstory, bonuses, and generally a typical way they should be played, with room to wiggle: After selecting a character you get to choose from Rings and Amulets, both of them giving you more bonuses and traits that will allow you to help shape your strategy for winning.The game plays like a board game, with many mechanics and elements added with the cards, but simple enough to play casually if you'd like. However, in my opinion, the fun really begins when you really try to strategize to win. There are several methods of winning, Prestige (having the most prestige at the end of the game), and over throwing the Mad King in several different ways starting with overcoming the trials placed around his castle. If you pass those trials you can then enter into combat with him and over throw him, or you can present 4 Spirit Stones (Aquired by exploring dungeons, encountering druids, or taking them from the other players) and banish him from the realm with their magic. You can even win by becomming more rotten/cursed than the king and being able to over-power him.The cards in the game are wonderfully crafted peices of artwork. They move, and flow, showing off the talent this team has even further. Each card's picture faithfully represents what the card's gameplay function is. There are spells to cast, traps to set, tricks to play, equipment to wear, and followers to join you. You can play cards with either your Magic, or Gold. Some cards even make you more Rotten when you play them or take your Prestige, so be sure to read the card carefully if you are going for a certain strategy to winning (Sometimes you want the Rot, and sometimes you just don't care about Prestige!).I haven't covered many mechanics this game has to offer, but to quickly throw out a few there are Perils, Quests, Dungeon exploring, Settlments, Terrain effects/bonuses... not to mention the incredibly engaging Dice rolling and Card burning system during Combat and Perils!Well, to sum it up, I think this game is amazing, and I highly recommend it to absolutely everyone. Especially those who enjoy a strategic board game, a love for animals, a beautiful world, and most of all when actual HEART is put into a game!Thank you!PS) Be sure to read the Quick Start Guide (along with the many others) in the Community Hub by Alvorn and 8BitProxyI play in 4k with two 980ti STRIX in SLI. Overkill. Runs nice and smooth. My iMac late 2015 model also runs this at max settings, although not in full 5k resolution like the screen is. Still runs really well.			"

												I bought this to play with my friends, problem is that there are no friends in Armello.You will lie, steal, backstab and betray everyone you know and you'll have fun doing it. Best of all, you're all adorable innocent little forest creatures. Nobody ever expects the chubby squirrel.Once you understand the game mechanics (and have patience, you'll learn all the nuances soon enough) you'll likely end up addicted and trying to coerce your friends into playing. If you're a completionist, some of the achievements are going to drive you bonkers, in a good way.Even if you're not really into strategy games, check Armello out. I'm not big on strategy games either and I have lost so many hours to this game.			"

								Armello is a turn-based strategy game similar Civilization V as it has a similar grid based layout and turn taking system. Your goal is simple, winning, but how you do it is up to you as there are multiple ways of winning a game of Armello. from what i've seen Armello provides an enjoyable single-player experience as well as an enjoyable multiplayer experience.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:Art style is very aesthetically pleasing and very nicely finished.Gameplay is enjoyable.Its a great game to play with you friends.Its a relatively easy game to learn.Cons:Matches are a little short for my liking (I am too used to Civilization matches).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Armello is an very enjoyable and promising game, I have been playing Armello since it was in alpha and i've seen the game grow and improve drastically and I am really excited to see what Armello has in store for us in the future.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games.

												I picked this up on a whim, because I love boardgames, and I am completely floored!First, the production values are through the roof. This game has an aesthetic and feel that I was not anticipating. I've only had it a week and already put 20+ hours into it. I love the inclusion of multiplayer chests/keys (like TF2/CS), and it looks like a ranking system is already in place in the game, just not activated yet. The rules are not too difficult, but the strategy is immense. It's best described as some sort of hybrid between Settlers of Catan, Elder Sign: Omens, and Magic the Gathering... with a bit of Game of Thrones whipped in.If you like boardgames, I definitely recommend this!

												Armello is a video game for folks who enjoy the pace and randomness of dice-based board games, and tend to play online with friends. It isn't for folks who enjoy the pace and skill-grind aspects of PvP video games, and tend to play online with strangers.I imagine most people don't sit down to spend an hour-plus playing a board game with random strangers in total silence. I imagine most people play board games with friends, and they chat while doing so. I imagine a four-friend team with an open Skype call is the ideal way to enjoy Armello. I wouldn't know, because only one of my video gaming friends bought it, and he stopped playing before I did.I gave Armello just over 40 hours, and stopped playing in late August. It was taking too long to find matches in the wee hours EST, or I'd find one, then fall asleep at the PC waiting for it to finish. I dropped into the forum recently to see what people were having issues with. It's the same as it was 3 months ago: length of games, multiplayer problems, lack of chat.I admire the aesthetic and ambience of Armello tremendously. I wish the gameplay were up to the same level.

												Once a time, there was a wolf, a rat, a bear and a hare…And they all fought each other, as well as the bad lion king!While being beautifully drawn and animated Armello is not necessarily a childs play.Indeed it is beneath the beautiful exterior, quite a complex board game variant, which mixes board-game with card-game and rpg elements. While you act as champion of your clan, liberate towns and followers and fulfilling quests as well as fight the other champions and the kings forces. Fitting to the scenario though, you also have different ways to win. For example you can even become corrupted by the dark forces.On the negative side i would add though, that there sadly is not much of a story, besides the tutorial, so it really is more preferable to play this in multiplayer.Conclusio: Armello is a beautiful board game, which is best experienced with friends. Would have loved a real single player campaign though.Point Scale: 7/10 "

												+ 500 Hours. High time I did a review for ‘Armello.’ Here goes.Armello (Lets keep this brief)Armello is an adventure-strategy board game. Follow four heroes as they race for the throne of Armello, ruled by a corrupted king. There are basically four victory options. Prestige victory: gaining prestige from completing quests (unless you fail), killing banes (unless your corrupted) and heroes. Spirit Stone victory: banish the corrupted king using four spirit stones which you’ve gained through quests and stone circles. And finally, Kingslayer and Rot victory are very similar, you have to kill the king via combat and survive, when trying for Rot, your Rot needs to be higher than the king's. (Just play the game, the mechanics are engaging and easy to pick up.)Gameplay+ 4 different clan containing heroes with unique abilities (Always increasing variety of heroes) + Hex tile design+ Day/Night cycle+ Huge replayability (+ 500 Hours in fact)+ Four victory options+ Interactive turn-based system+ Cards+ Story-driven prologue – including the tutorial. Really easy to understand and explains the game mechanics.o Multiplayer (host leave may crash the game)o Luck and random number generator (can be frustrating at times)Based on the games originality, artistic design and the games narrative style, has kept me hooked to this game for so long. With heroes moving on hex based tile, and trying to get prestige, magic, coins or even rot sometimes. Quest to increase your hero’s stats, whether that be towards Fight, Body, Wits or Spirit, all depends on your game play. The amount of strategy within this game is huge which adds to the replayability of Armello.Multiplayer, create a party or lone wolf against other competitive players, you decide. Host quit? Don’t worry, the games mechanics are good against leavers or delaying players and the AI’s still oppose quite a challenge, although, when the host drops it might result to game crash, with constant up-dates, the developers are working hard and fast to resolve this.Visual+ Amazing art style+ Animations (Including the cards – nice touch)+ Dices- Few graphic glitchesArmello is visually stunning, and with the addition of the new seasons DLC, each season has its own glorious allures. Also combat animations with dice rolls are amazing, differing whether the dice explodes or not, also hit to the hero differs from a blocked attack. There are still some graphic glitches, but very rare and doesn’t usually affect the gameplay.Soundtrack+ Stylised+ Lisa Gerrard performance+ Changing accordingly to the atmosphereSoundtrack is very well created and composed. Songs are underlining the dark-fantasy atmosphere and whilst also creating a place of serenity. Lisa Gerrard participated during the composure of the sound track, her voice well known from Dead Can Dance or Gladiator suits melodies, really adds to the music’s ambience. The soundtrack is also released and made available to all, including the non-early-access players.Story Time! (It’s important fun to role-play) In game chat is disabled, this eliminates the possibility of players encountering toxic or hateful language, as this game is designed to suit players of all ages. However, the use of chat emotes allows players to communicate, regardless of their language, and to fully immerse oneself into the world of Armello, whilst retaining the character’s demeanour and tone.Furthermore, the developers are receptive to new idea and suggestions on how to expand and improve the current chat tree.With a little creatively, the current chat emotes can be used to forge alliances, taunt your enemies or simply express your characters emotions. Narrator: With the addition of Usurpers, 3 heroes’ gazed dumbstruck towards the castle, as a seemingly out of place bear, continued to idle around the castle battlements. Confused? Perhaps the bear was bewildered by his good fortune, or perhaps he shared the other heroes’ sentiment. Elyssia: Ow! That. Ow.Magna: No! I can’t believe it!Elyssia: Speechless.Narrator: The heroes’ stared in disbelief as the bear continued to marvel at his new heritageSargon: Ill fortune.             Fate is fluid. This is but a minor setback.Elyssia: Who’s fault was that?! (Elyssia snapped, accusingly)Narrator: Resentment and bitterness blossomed between those whom had lost the race to the throne, however, despite the squabbling, carried the distant cries and whoops of delight. Ghor: Woooooaaaaaahhhhhh……..          As King, will I ‘have’ to live in the palace?.Magna: I don’t want to be part of this. (Magna concluded, hefting her shield)             Until we meet again!                               ……….. To be continued!This is only one potential outcome, How will you play?!? Would you play fair? Or team up to crush those who oppose your claim to the throne. Strategy or luck, you decide, but a good player will always ensure that the odds are in their favour. This is going to be dramatic. (*Popcorn at the ready!*)Take a Hint!Hero’s traits, rings and amulets are extremely important in determining your play style during early game. An experienced player will also take tile advantages/disadvantages into account, as well as, the Day and night cycle also brings an important aspect to the game. Never attempt fate if you can help it, luck is a risk and can be terribly frustrating. Minimise the risk and ensure you equip item cards which best server your play style and repeatedly burn your cards to ensure you have the hand you want, remember, each card has a unique symbol – sword/shield/rot/wyld/sun and moon, burn these cards during combat or perils to ensure the outcome is in your favour. Finally, be sure to watch an opponent’s move: (Cannot express how important this it!)Money and Magic usage:  Is a good indicator of the sort of perils your up against. States and Equipped items: Will help indicate whether you need to play aggressively or defensively.  The community! (It’s worth a mention)The game is constantly going through bug fixes. The community is always kept up-to-date with patches and with any new additional content to the game. The developers are very friendly and receptive to any great ideas found though the Amello community, that be through steam, facebook, twitter, youtube, twitch or the forums. Members of the community also show no lack of passion, creativity and empathy. However, this is only maintained thought the developers zero tolerance to hatred and discrimination. Overall, the community is very welcoming, just be respectful and mindful of your opinions as it could potential be harmful to others.Diagnosis!Infection, query sepsis ?!, Potentially infectious. Refer these animals to their GP; for a prescription of antibiotics. (Penicillin, Amoxicillin + Fluoroquinolones) My overall rating for Armello: 9/10 – Would put the King out of his misery again!Also got my vote for ‘Steam Awards Nomination 2016’ – Keep up the good work!On a final note, are the DLC’s worth paying for? Yes they are, the developers have never asked for anything, with free up-dates and content being constantly added to game, this is a way for us to help show our support. Armello is a truly inspiring game, let’s not lose it.			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.“Imagine Magic The Gathering meets Final Fantasy Tactics, and Game of Thrones meets Kung Fu Panda,""Armello is a turn based strategy game that was released in September 2015 on PC – being developed and published by League of Geeks.  The game was originally an iPad title that was released in mid-2012 before going through a successful Kickstarter project to get the game onto Steam. The game play in Armello feels is almost like an actual board game. There are lots of different dice involved, and hex squares in which you can move your character. You take control of one of eight anthropomorphic animals and plot to oust the corrupt king from power. You can do this in many ways, either by becoming even more corrupt than the king, winning by coming the most prestigious character in the game by completing certain tasks, or killing the king yourself in battle. The game has a day/night cycle, you get two turns per day to carry out your actions. The game lasts for 10 nights usually. Each turn the king will lose one health but becomes more corrupt.   Your character has about 3 action points, moving, attacking and casting spells all cost one point, meaning you can only do so much in one turn – planning your turn is key to this game. The game has a card game element to it all be it a very small one. You have an unlimited deck of cards; the cards consist of equipment, spells and traps. Each turn you draw the amount of cards you used in the previous turn. One way in which you will be able to win a game of Armello is to become the most prestigious character on the board. You earn prestige by killing other characters in combat, killing corrupt “Banes” which the King summons, or by completing various quests. Each character will have one active quest at any time; this will involve traveling across the map to a specific hex square. The quest will always be completed, but you can take an extra risk by taking your chances on a dice role in order to get extra equipment or stats; failing this will mean you lose stats. I personally found the questing system in this game really fun – the flavour texts of each quest is a nice addition and the simple resolutions keep the game flowing. Graphically Armello is a really pretty looking game. All of the characters look like they have been drawn in a children’s story book, and they just look gorgeous. My personal favourites are the rat characters; they get the animation nailed down on their run. Even though there is only one map in Armello, it has various different weather effects to keep it looking fresh. The game’s UI is OK. I would have liked to have seen a few extra information boxes on screen to see the rest of the characters stats/points, but this can be accessible in a few button clicks if you want it anyway.  Although the game does have a fairly lengthy tutorial that does actually do a good job of explaining the rules of the game; it still took me probably two full games worth for me to just get the basics of the game down. Even now there are parts of the game that I don’t understand; it would be been nice to have a little bit of maybe a tooltip with a lot of the buttons and card effects for you to easily understand what is happening without throwing you in at the deep end and letting you click random stuff to see what happens.  The game can vary in difficulty; sometimes you can be completely screwed over by pure randomness of the cards you are dealt or the dice roles – such is life when you play board games. I think I have got about a 60% win rate at the moment which is fairly good I would imagine. Like I said before, there is only one map to play on, but the game does a good job of creating a different landscape for you to fight on every game, the randomness of what each hex square can have on it differs from game to game, such as dungeons and settlements all being scattered across the map to keep things fresh. There is plenty of replay ability in Armello, I have been playing for almost six hours now and I still have a strong desire to keep playing. There is no “story” mode to be exact; it is just a case of skirmish battles. The game has its own unlock system where you can unlock special equipment for your characters by completing specified tasks in game, meaning it gives you a reason to keep playing to unlock things. The game has eight characters for you to play, each come with their own set of tasks and unlockables. Not to mention the games online mode – whilst there isn’t many people playing it online, hook up a few friends on the game to play in the four player mode for some real competitive action. The game runs perfectly fine with no technical hitches at all; being able to play at 4k resolutions on ultra-high settings makes this a really well optimized PC port. I did try to play with the Steam controller, but it just felt better with the mouse, as you would expect from a strategy type game like this. I personally think this is quickly turning into one of my favourite turn based strategy games; it is highly addictive, and the learning curve keeps you on the edge at all times. Matches can be completed in twenty minutes or so meaning you can get a couple in when you only have an hour to spare. If you are looking at getting into a strategy based game, I can wholeheartedly recommend Armello to you. I do think it is maybe slightly overpriced at £14, 99 – but still it is a quality game with endless amounts of replay ability.

Early Access Review
								I work retail at a board games + gifts shop and Armello captivated me right from the get go. With redwall-esque anthropomorphic animals, deadly rot vultures called Banes, and a solid board game behind it to boot; this game was a no brainer for me. But is it for you?Well, I've logged about 40+ hours in the first week of owning it and here is what to expect if you add it to your steam collection.It's a bit much to dive into if you have no previous experience with board games, but if Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan, Power Grid, and Lords of Waterdeep are names that are familiar to you, then you shouldn't have any problem. There are currently 4 characters (with extras for the folks who kickstarted it) each with unique starting stats. Players will balance things like fighting skill to be able to beat other players/banes, wits to increase hand size and solve challenges, health to survive longer on the game board between turns, and spirit which dictates how many spells you can cast.You'll also be collecting gold, influence, and magic while also trying to limit the amount of rot or corruption you garner. Or will you...That's the best thing about Armello. The way to win in any given game isn't immediately obvious. In fact, there are 4 win conditions. There are turn cycles, day and night, and with each passing day the corrupted King at the center of the board grows weaker. So your options are 1: collect the most prestige points and hope he dies. 2: Collect 4 spirit stones and bring them to him to cure/exorcize the king 3: Fight him in battle and survive to claim the throne. 4: Purposely allow yourself to be corrupted by the Rot and obtain a Rot Victory. The last seems the hardest, but it gives each of the characters an interesting advantage over one another. Mercurio is great at scheming in the background stealing gold and settlements, but you can build him almost as bruisery as Thane, the wolf who is the pen ultimate of fighting. Each game can have random stuff set you back or catapult you forwards into the lead. And sometimes that can be frustrating because it's not necessarily through any great strategy of your own, or even an opponent doing something annoying. Then again sometimes it is. So I feel like any board game it tries to balance luck and randomness with solid player strategies and tactics. The communication at present is done through emotes alone and it's hard to really convey much to the other players. It certainly isn't the same as chatting with your friends around the game table, but it's still so damn fun without the option to chat. And the art/videos/concept is simply amazing.There is no single player campaign, so don't fool yourself into thinking this is anything but a board game. Now, it's still in early access and with the success of it who knows what they do next, but my assumption would be, more characters, new items, plot cards, perhaps new perils or monsters, eventually even new game boards or modes. But it's a board game in virtual form. Nothing more, nothing less. If that's your thing, then I hope to see you in a game soon. :)			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a must-have for anybody that loves board games.  Armello features a different board each playthrough and randomly spawning evil and good mobs to help terrorize your opponents; these things make every run a unique experience.Due to the random nature of the game, I don't feel discouraged if I'm losing halfway through.  There are enough weapons, armor and followers to ensure my character at least has access to tools that'll turn a losing game into a winning one.I'm a huge fan of Talisman and Elder Sign: Omens.  A game of Armello can be played in under an hour, and there aren't any characters that can just roll over other characters by default (such as the Assassin in Talisman).  Although dice rolling can be brutal, there are plenty of ways in Armello to ""fix"" your dice results and improve your chances; the game rarely feels unfair (unlike Elder Sign, heh).Before purchasing this game, I did feel the price was a bit steep.  I'm glad to announce that I have no buyer's remorse; Armello is worth every penny.			"

												As mentioned by many, the bugs ruin what is otherwise a great game.  They are unbelievble to be frank (game breaking in many cases).  Good example, sometimes the game won't even shut down.  Or the main logic loop will freeze up and the gameplay halts entirly.  For the technically inclined, this is likely due to bad IPC or multi-threading.  That's an educated guess, I did not spend time dissembling,  However, great art and game design with gameplay that's very unique and a breath of fresh air.  But not one of those companies willing to own up to their downfalls.  Instead releasing new content (which costs extra, fyi).  This is coding 101.  Bugs first, everything else second.  But that mantra does not appear to exist here.Is the game good?  Absolutely.  Is it stable?  No.  And that will kill your otherwise fun gaming mood in a heartbeat.  If there ever was an abandonment or the code open sourced (unlikely IMHO) then they could easily be fixed.  Until then I would stay away.  I'd create a community patch but I would likely be met with hostility, where other companies would welcome it.Hats off to the game designers and artists.  Credit goes where it's due.			"

												Armello is an enchanting boardgame about taking down a mad king before any of the other players can.The gameplay is pretty straightforward - go on quests, fight other players, avoid traps, and get to the king. Admittedly the gameplay is a little too random for my tastes, but while frustrating, I still find myself having a fantastic time playing with friends. I would compare it to Catan meets Risk. You can plan for the future, but dice rolls will screw you over at some point or another.Other than that the sound, art, and gameplay are very well polished and well executed. Definitely feeling like Redwall meets Game of Thrones in that essence.Definitely a solid 4/5 stars.			"

												Update 11/11/2015Thought I'd refresh my review yet again.  1.1 is out, and while the Ranked mode was pushed to a later patch, there's been other great additions.  Connections between people in multiplayer are more resilient while pirates seem to have been booted from Steam's network.  More item cards were added, font size is bigger for better readability.  Single player mode is now lightning fast with fast-forward mode on: you can finish a game in 15-20 mins instead of 40.  The new house rules also let you tweak aspects like turn times, character max HP, or King's starting life.Sharing of the Bandit characters is functioning, with their full release still planned for Early 2016.  Things the community is hoping to see in the near future:Full reconnection to games when a player drops accidentally.Cross Multiplayer between Steam, PS4, IOS, and DRM free.More Houserules.Ranked Mode.Even More characters post Bandits.Update added 8/2/2015Addressing concerns found in negative reviews that are no longer accurate:When this game first annouced early access, there was a controversy about a set of 4 characters being limited to only people who backed the Kickstarter.  This ""Bandit clan"" has since been declared open for purchase as a paid DLC to be released a few months after the official release.  Those that were backers will get to play their ""Beta"" a bit before release, but only in single player and friends match games.  Prestige being the only victory: Early on, there was no way to raise stats and thus beating the Palace gates required luck of dice or card draws.  Now you can weaken the Perils with trickery cards, raise your Peril beating stats by 2 points each (4 total points to spend, no more than 2 per stat), and the act of finishing your 5 quests gives you the ability to automatically pass the Palace Peril closest to your home.  Without other players acting to stop you, Facing the King happens quite often.  Spirit stones are much less luck driven in acquisition and there's no way to lose them like there used to be.  Acquiring Rot is more sensible too, it's easier to gain rot after corruption when before it used to be very difficult to find Rot past 5 points.A few corrections in my review below: Winning by spirit stones changed.  Now instead of heroes starting with stones, and stealing from each other, stones will appear on the map to be picked up as an alternative to pursuing your quests; once you have them you can never lose them.  You can also chose to quest with sprit stones as the reward.  Questing also helps you get Rare Treasure quality gear or followers.The new builds are on break until release, but they've already annouced 1.1 for a month after release to implement Ranked Public multiplayer games.Card library is complete for trickery, missing just 1 spell, and then a handful of items/treasures/followers.  Around 100 distinct cards with a Rarity system so some cards appear many times a game and others just once.Original January Review below this point.Short version: The Art is beautiful, the mechanics are solid and unique, the Dev team actively engages the forum and spits out new builds at least every 3 weeks.  If you like complex boardgames that handle all the rules themselves very efficiently, you are going to like this game.  If boardgames, fantasy kingdoms, or walking talking animals are not your thing, you wont like this game.Long Version:Do you like fantasy boardgames?  Armello gives you a cast of Anthromophic heroes on a quest to succeed the throne of Armello as its Dying King goes mad from the Corrupting disease ""Rot"".  You can perform quests, slay monsters, and even dispatch your Rivals to earn prestige and become the people's hero for when the King dies of supernatural causes, the King will even ask you for advice in his new laws.  Or perhaps, you can just kill the king yourself and take the throne before his increasing insane laws harm the populace, but the King is powerful and well guarded, you'll need to explore deep dungeons or collect tribute from towns to gear up and wield wyld magic spells to make yourself stronger.  Perhaps you'll find more of the sacred spirit stones that have been told might Save the King from the horrible disease; the heros of the other clans each have 1 (See update correction).Or perhaps you'll fight darkness with darkness.  Sink deep into depravity and the darkness will grant you all the power you desire to take the throne.Each Hero has variations of 4 stats: Fight (how many dice you roll in battle), Body (your max HP), Wits (your ability to draw cards each turn, sneak into the palace walls, solve many of the quest's dilemmas and avoid Trickery's set by other players, and Spirit (amount of MP you reset to each night and ability to dodge harmful spells.)  In combat you roll sword, day or night (matching whether the game round is night or day) or the Wyld symbol to hit (Wyld symbols even reward you with extra dice for critical hit like effects); shields to defend, and the Rot symbol just revels in your failure.  The 3 to 1 offense defense ratio makes combat vicious.  You can use unwanted cards in your hand to force Dice to be the symbols you want.The map is randomley generated from hexagons.  Forests let you hide at night, towns pay you if you own them at dawn, swamps injure those who ford them, mountains take extra time to cross but give you the high ground in battle (extra defense), and stone circles let you heal your wounds.Each round you draw until you have your Wit stat in Hand size.  You can pick item cards that cost gold to play and can equip 3 non consumable items.  You can pick spell cards to cast from your nightly regenerating mana to buff yourself, teleport, or harm your rivals.  You can also spend your gold and reputation on Trickery cards to raise your public standing or harm your rivals.  Usually, you have 8 days and 8 nights to make your claim, but animal sacrafice to the King's evil can prolong his dark reign.The game is still in early access, so the card deck is only about 70 of the planned 130, some odds and ends of mechanics is open to feedback like the effects of some spells and the slight customizations each character has (would you like bonus magic from waking up in forests, or become invisible when you enter towns?).  Each game takes about 30 minutes versus the AI (Turns over in 15 second) or 90 minutes versus 3 other humans (turns given a max of 2 minutes).  You communicate to other players via a hardcoded list of chat phrases.  Or you can use Steam's friends/chat room functionality.			"

Early Access Review
								The game plays like a delightful combination of Settlers of Catan, Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon, and my favorite multiplayer Wii game, Dokapon Kingdom. Armello is, however, superior to all of these because in this game, I can be a BUNNY.			"

												When I first saw Armello, I thought that with the old Disney style animations it would be aimed for a younger audience, and I didn't put much thought to it. I thought it wasn't my kind of game. Then I eventully bit the bullet and bought it.And damn, this is actually a remarkably good game.Armello is a board game set in the Kingdom of... well, Armello. You play as one of several animal heroes who are all vying for the throne of the kingdom. The King has gone mad with a disease called the Rot and when he dies, the most prestigous hero will become the next monach... unless someone kills him first.It's quite clear as you look deeper in that despite the Disney style animation and the colorful graphics, this is a much, much darker game than it seems at first glance. The events that take place in the game, along with the dialogue and info on the cards tells a mucher darker story than what you would expect in the lore.You can select upto eight heroes, one from each of the four animal clans, being wolf, rat, rabbit and bear with the vanilla game, though one additional DLC grants you four new heroes and there are four more as part of a new Bandit Clan on the way. Each of these heroes has different stats and a unqiue perk to start off with and you can mix and match different rings and amulets to change up how that hero handles in game.The gameplay itself is easy to learn but is remarkably complex. Four players take turns moving around the board, taking settlements, completing quests, dealing with the King's Guard and Bane NPCs, the perils and of course, the other Heroes themselves. There is a day and night cycle which changes the conditions on the board and makes some Heroes stronger than others. As you play through the game, you can complete quests which allow you to level up your characters stats as you go along.You have a selection of cards to pull out of three decks, Item, Magic and Trickery, which lets you equip items or you can use them with their varying affects. Such as damaging another character or putting on one of the perils on the board.All combat and peril solving is done with dice rolls, any cards you have equipped or effects that have been applied to you can alter how much attack or defence you have guarenteed or how many dice you have amongst other things. Dice in the game aren't just RNG either, they are physically rolled much like real dice, although this can be a small pain for lower spec   PCs.This mix of dice and card based gameplay allows for varied tactics and approaches which often vary depending on who you play as. You can either enhance your character's strengths or remove the weaknesses to balance the character out. Each board is different each time and it offers varying oppitunities to play your game in different ways, and with four different ways to win, each game can be quite different.Now, the only con I've noticed is one you can't really eliminate with this kind of game with dice and cards. Luck is a big thing. There is a good chance someone is going to get all the good cards at the right time or get through without a scratch and go on to dominate the game. Others might not get anything good at all and fall behind the curve. Since there is no comeback mechanic other than getting lucky, this could leave one player just dominating and another player just left to wonder around the board unable to challenge someone or deciding to quit.Or those damn card players who get all the attack cards and keep killing you before you get close or slowing you down. It's really frustrating.Likewise, luck can quickly change the tide of the game quickly and as the game begins to draw to a close you can feel the tension as you try and play your approach and hope your luck holds. It's a little bit annoying but it's also what makes the game catch your attention and keep you invested.Regardless, tactics and strategy still apply, which can carry you through a game. The games can be quite long though, easily coming upto an hour or more, so keep that in mind.The game has quite a few things in it, singleplayer and multiplayer is both around, you have a card collection to see all the well drawn and animated cards you have come across in the game. All the games you complete will also give to a chance to get a chest or a key, combining the both together can give you dice you can use in the game itself.Both singleplayer and multiplayer offer numerous options to change up the standard gameplay, which is a nice touch.Now, some content you have to buy, though none of it's pay to win and it's not ridculously priced whilst adding additional heroes and new map styles, so it's worth the extra dosh.All in all, Armello was an unexpected little gem, it's a bit rough around the edges but whetever you are a furry or not, this game is certainly worth your while, with additional content on it's way. It's definitely worth your time.			"

												I really want to like Armello, but I have to say it has a few very large flaws, including one that has inspired me to write this review.Simply put, it is a lengthy multiplayer game. A game can take about 2 hours to complete. Should anything happen to a player's connection, there is zero ability to reconnect. Which means if you are playing the game with friends, you may find yourself having to start over after investing over an hour in a game, or you have to finish the game against AI. As a single player game, its fun but ultimately limited. And the lack of any ability to deal with disconnections/reconnections is a dealbreaker for multiplayer games. If I'm going to spend the time in a match, I want to know that I- and my friends- will be able to finish it.There are technical issues as well- notably I couldn't get the purchased DLC to actually work. The game can be fun, but I can't recommend it.			"

												There is about two things that annoy me on negative reviews here. And that's complaining about the game being ""too random"" and ""long wait times"". Guys, seriously. Have you ever played a Board game? I don't think so.Also, unlike other Board games you actually CAN DO stuff while the other's are at turn. You can manipulate the enemy with your cards, you can set traps to avoid enemys approaching you or their goals. You can study their inventory and their goals.  Rethink your strategy if someone is much further ahead of you with the same strategy.All these things you can do while the other's are at turn. And I think it gives this game a more strategic element that you think.Games are about luck as soon as there are dices or cards in it. Have you ever complained about Yathzee or any card game being a stupid boring game because you have to be lucky? Then it's just not for you.Overall I think this game is really fun, even with just a 25% win chance (because only 1 of 4 players will win)These negative reviews are mostly by people who are afraid of losing.I know this isn't a real review about this game but there are plenty of good reviews out there already so it won't matter.

												I wish there was a ""I am neutral to this game""-button on Steam, or a rating-system using numbers or stars or whatsoever. Because all in all - while I would lie if I'd say ""Oh no, I NEVER had any fun in playing Armello!"" there are a few things that spoil the fun. Armello makes a wonderful first impression. It is a board-game with cards and dices, unique heroes which you can equip with different rings and amulets to suit your playstyle. The first trailer is nicely done (the soundtrack to that trailer is also wonderful), and the the following trailers (Horrors and Heroes / Ursupers) are quite enjoyable as well. The setting is also interesting - reminds me of the Redwall-series (with the benefit that the rat-clan seems to be the intelligence network, but not necessarily the evil guys), and that there are actually different ways to win the game sounds also quite cool. Most of the card-illustrations are quite well done, too - even having a flavor-text (though it took me a little until I found that out).  I can see and feel that indeed a lot of love went into the concept of the game. The tutorial consists of four little chapters; each of these is played with one of the ""classic"" four heroes (Thane, Mercurio, Amber and Sana), and teaches you what you need to know to play the game. A little tweak could be made here: you have the ""Burn""-symbol for challenges and battles before the tutorial tells you what card-burning is. And unless the game told you what it is you cannot burn cards. I was a bit confused at the beginning, so I would recommend to make the burn-symbol invisible until the tutorial reaches that stage. Sadly one of the most enjoyable parts in the tutorial is NOT in the ""normal"" Armello-game. As your hero wanders the lands, goes dungeoneering and questing (s)he can recruit followers. In the tutorial those little rascals say a few lines here and there, sometimes to explain things, sometimes just to create atmosphere. Which is really cool. Unfortunately - in normal games only ""The Stranger"" talks. I am not saying that my followers should babble endlessly. But for instance if The Bard gives you the prestige for escaping from a peril he (or she?) could say something. For players who find that annoying - including an option to shut the followers off should not be that difficult. Also the theory that you can win the game by 4 different approaches sounds better in theory than in reality. For the Rot-Victory you need more luck than for any other approach. Yes, of course you can equip the Rot-Amulet (once you unlocked it, which might end in a grind, even if you unlock it by battling the A.I.). But whenever I tried to go for a rot-victory I usually was not lucky enough to get my paws on cards which gave me rot (not even with Sargon, though it's a bit easier with him). So I am usually trying to commit suicide on a Bane a few times in a row, hoping that no other player (or no king's guard) is killing the Bane until I am done with it. Most players will go for Combat- or Prestige-Victory. If you find yourself carrying 4 Spirit Stones you could as well walk around on a mine-field, because everybody is trying to keep you from getting to the King by any means necessary. Yes, that is part of the game. If I got my 4 spirit stones basically by accident (because they spawned in a circle where I was standing, or I went through a circle with one, because I needed to quest, or I got it via a dungeon) I found myself having decent gear often, so I could defend myself. If I tried to gather them deliberately I neglected quests which would have given me gear/followers, because I wanted to gather my spirit stones faster... but then I seldom made it to the palace anymore, because every other player could beat me. Do not get me wrong - I KNOW combat is part of the game, and I behave COMPLETELY like that, when I see others having 4 spirit stones in their pockets, too. But that does not make the last 5-10 minutes of a game less frustrating. I do not know if it's possible to ""balance"" the 4 ways of winning the game a little better. After all, for every approach there might be a hero suited a little better to do this and that, but so far it feels a little... ""meh"" to know that basically combat- and prestige victory are the easiest way to play the game, when there are 2 other options as well. The next thing that keeps me from enjoying Armello throughoutly has something to do with League of Geeks themselves. Yes, I know they are a small company. Yes, I know the market out there is worse than a shark-tank. I have been there myself, and - though in another field - I am still freelancing. I am not hitting at the infamous ""laying their eggs into too many baskets""-topic (at that point I think they just overdid themselves, and people do that at times), but the way they are talking to the community reminds me of companies such as Riot or Blizzard. Yes, they are having somewhat of a ""dialogue"", but to me it does not sound like a dialogue, instead it reminds me of parents patting their kid's shoulder after the kid told them how much (s)he got bullied, saying ""There, there, it's gonna be alright, we'll think of something"" - and then they give the kid a sugar-cane instead of actual help. (Yes, that's really not the best example, but the best I could come up with right now). The Bandit-Clan is screwing the community. About a year ago it was said the clan would be released in Spring 2016. Then it got delayed and delayed, until we got told they would come with the iOS-version of the game. This version, however, would not be released around Christmas-time because of the huge competition on the market. Fine with me. But that was the last thing we heard. If you ask you get the same answer over and over: ""Hold tight for news."" Last time I heard that was last summer when I tweeted on a patch something like: ""I hope it [] comes to GoG, soon, too"". Well, I know how that turned out. I heard rumours about the Clan being released on spring 2017, but maybe that is just wishful thinking. The biggest annoying thing for me, though, is the server-instability. I get kicked from a game so often, and often enough when it's almost finished. Especially with the new amulett that you can only unlock once you reach player-level 10 it's one hell of a grind.So yeah, while I DO have some nice time with Armello, and I simply love playing games where I can feel all the love and effort that went into a game from the very scratch, I would recommend Armello only to people with a high tolerance to frustration (because it IS frustrating when you spend 40 minutes in a game and you achieved nothing, because the game just crashes). Still I have high hopes that the problems will get solved in the future, and I wish LoG still all the best.			"

												Armello is a fun, addictive online board game for up to four players.  My friends and I have been playing it since it came out, pretty much non-stop.  And while we may scream in anguish after a particularly unlucky die roll, we always end up coming back for more.  An extremely tight and polished game.Pros:-Authentic Board Game Experience-Incredibly addictive-Beautiful Artistic Style-Four paths to victory, giving options for each player to always have *some* chance of pulling out a win, even if it's from someone else failing at the last moment-Multiple character types with unique traits and starting stats-Three card types (Items, spells, tricks) that work very differently to achieve the same goals, allowing for more diverse strategies-Dozens of unlockables with additional unique traits-Easy-to-set-up multiplayer, especially with friends-Relatively short but satisfying games (30-45 mins single player, 60-90 multiplayer)-Excellent tutorialCons:-A fair amount of luck involved, some of which can be significant enough to foil the most well-thought-out strategies-Can get heated in multiplayer, when someone chooses to attack/interfere with another player unprovoked-The random terrain might slant the game for/against certain people from the start-A lot of (often random) events can provoke excess frustration, such as getting a teleport/bane from a ruin, having wandering guards/banes move into your path, being hurt by the daily declaration, etc.-Getting across the map (usually to reach your quests) can feel painfully slow-One victory path (Rot) significantly more difficult and luck-based than the others-All followers and treasures (ie, the best gear) can only be attained through ruins and quest bonuses, and both of these are entirely luck based.  This can lead to gear disparity between players based on what are essentially coin flips.-No way to get back in after a multiplayer disconnect (though an AI will take over for you)-Some finicky, non-obvious rules are not covered by the tutorial, especially when it comes to gaining/losing influence and rot-Like most board games, will eventually get repetitive			"

												Pros: * Amazing visual style. Pretty much the strongest point of the game.* Simple enough combat system* Fairly good tutorialCons:* Balance. Attack/defense balance is cranked all the way towards the former, which means that even if you can kill your opponent thrice over, they are likely to kill you too, throwing you back to square one.* Way too much is left to chance. If RNG hates you, you can't do anything about it.* Matches are too short - 20 turns, 24 at custom rules, and any attack that wounds the King cuts that further down.* Next to no settings, specifically graphics, language (it always takes the setting from steam), ans such.Overall, the game has great potential but it needs fixing. Right now it has little to boast aside from the good looks.			"

												This game is like crack. Highly addictive. If you're a fan of board/card games, you'll enjoy this. The splash of RPG is a wonderful additive. It's cutesy (squee, animals!), the artwork is beautiful and the gameplay has been smooth. I love the difference between the characters, and the many ways to win the game. Just finished a spirit stone victory, and greatly enjoyed maneuvering my way to the castle as quickly as possible before the king died to rot. So far, I have only played with friends, and we are having such a blast we haven't tried the online multiplayer, so I can't give feedback on that gameplay. I know we'll get many hours out of this, and I hope to see more content added! I've already racked up 9 hours in one day of owning this game. Worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								Armello presents a true personal experience each new time it's played. From personal experience I can say each new match is unique - the map has procedural generation (which plays for the reach of resources such as settlements to conquer and dungeons to loot), the player starts each new match with random cards in hand, and this adds to the opponents being placed in different base camp locations (for example, if opponent A was placed on northern base camp in a match, there is a chance you can find it placed on the eastern or western base camp on a next match) plus the strategy you're thinking about running.As the game truly is a legitimate digital board game, there is the possibility a player's strategy may be entirely destroyed in only a single turn, or it can turn on this player's favor as well - and this is the true beauty of Armello. The playing of cards - at any time - adds an interesting dynamic to the experience, not to mention the rot, the quests mechanic, the rings and amulets chosen before the match that help the player on his/her strategy and more elements to list.Additionally, the environment, the lore, the graphic design (character's and even the cards' illustrations), the sound effects of this game, they're all great.As a more personal note, I'm reading the Redwall series and, as in my opinion making a proper Redwall game wouldn't have a good result, I must say that when I want to effectively ""play"" Redwall, I go play Armello. This is really an amazing experience.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has come quite a long way since I first got my hands on the Alpha build and has made great strides going to Beta and now Early access. Lot's of little improvements to the UI have been made to make keeping tabs on what goes on in-game much easier. Cards have been added and balanced as needed with the current total so far being 60 out of a planned number of over 100 cards. The game mechanics have been all put in their place to produce a decievingly deep strategy board game that can have you at certain victory only for someone or something to quickly dash your hopes and make you lose everything. Armello overall is a game that involves a good mix of luck and skill to win. The luck aspect comes from what cards you draw, dice rolls, and dungeon exploration among other variables.  Skill on the other hand comes from knowing where to move, using the terrain to your advantage, and how to use those cards to give yourself an edge. Gameplay itself may last anywhere from about 40 minutes to an hour for multiplayer matches, depending on how long players take on their turns, and at about 30 minutes for matches against the AI. Currently there are a series of tutorial pop-ups present when you play your first game to help guide you through everything Armello has to offer since it can be a little daunting to first time players. Plenty of this game itself is seemingly done, but there's still plenty of polish to be added and feedback to be given. This in turn is where any prospective Early Access player will be able to help make this game even better by providing a fresh perspective on everything already in game plus new ideas for the future.League of Geeks still has lots of work ahead of them, but I already know from what I've personally seen that they will get it done and do a damn fine job of it at that.

												I am somewhat getting addicted to this game slowly. Out of all of the games i own, Armello is the only other game besides the Fallout series to get me to go in depth into it. The concept is very great, simple to grasp gameplay (learn how to play in roughly 5-20 mins) is awesome, every game you play is totally different than the one your friend will play. The list goes on for this game, but just like a lot of games they do have some drawbacks. For example there is no custom characters for yourself, though it be great to see it in the future to have a custom character that you can make (only one) and see him/her progress in the game. Though the only other thing that i see as another downside is the map size. The map size never changes, it is great that it is like smallworld where the tiles changes every game, but there should be at least one or two different map sizes other than one. Because game map size is somewhat small for me, and at least they should offer a bigger mapsize too for people, like me, who like extra long games.Thanks for reading my review, though all my reviews are not as detailed and pretty as some, i do try to give you all my own thoughts of the game to help your decision to buy a game or not. This game gets a 9/10 in my book, and i do highly recommend this game to anyone who like GOT (game of thrones), Table Top Games like Small world, or anything that is RPG related. To devlopers of this game, you guys did a very good job with this game and for that i am glad to play Armello.			"

												Armello is one of the most enjoyable, addictive, and engaging games I've played in a long time - among video games and tabletop games alike. The characters are charming, the artwork is wonderful, the concept and mechanics are both unique and easily graspable, while still offering a tremendous amount of depth and complexity for experienced players to delve into. I would love above anything to praise this game and recommend it to anyone and everyone, because it's brought me hours of excitement and enjoyment.But I cannot, in good conscience, do so - rather, I feel compelled to do the opposite, because of the attitude that the developers have come to display.The actual game is priced at $20. Hundreds of cards, eight characters, thee entirety of gameplay, along with the collectible dice system and all - $20, more than a fair price. But then, character skins, purely cosmetic changes, costing $7 EACH - I could buy THREE SKINS, or another copy of the ENTIRE GAME. Packs of four playable characters costing $10 - half the price of the entire game - the latest of which are characters who have existed (in some form) in the game code already installed on my computer for months, now hidden behind a paywall. And persistant bugs, affecting connectivity, matchmaking, and gameplay so significantly that people have stopped playing altogether because they've found it THAT difficult to remain connected to a playable game long enough to actually see it all the way to the end. Clearly, the real value in Armello - as far as the developers are telling us based on their pricing - is not in the gameplay, not in the experience, not in the fun, but in the assets: the ENTIRE GAME is literally worth less to them than three character skins which functionally affect gameplay in no way whatsoever.As far as the developers seem to be concerned, Armello is not a game anymore, it's a money farm - a platform for microtransactions that consistantly prove overpriced and underwhelming. It is, in a word, tragic, to see such a wonderful experience being used not to create fun but to line pockets.			"

												For the artwork, atmosphere, music and writing I would wholeheartedly reccomend this one. The way the game's systems are designed, speak to the imagination, requiring dedication to a theme and they are presented in a way that is exciting and satisfying. Things like day/night and your character's purity/corruption, cause great differences in mechanics. The world has enough character and colour for you to believe there's an entire world of wonders out there to discover and indeed there are amazing details and happenings to be stumbled upon in the forests and in the mountains. The way a stoic guard dog's tail wags when he defeats someone brings a smile to your face. Armello is a wonderful, intriguing world to visit. Since I'm a sucker for such things, I'm happy with my purchase and getting my money's worth.However, as a game and compared to other boardgame, it has shortcomings that obligate me to give it a thumbs down and leave a few warnings.Part of the problem is that this is a very short game, the standard ruleset used for sittings that count for achievements and multiplayer, shorter than 9 full turns (counting both day and night cycles, as you'll only get new magic points and cards after a single day). That alone isn't enough of a flaw. I'm fine with quick, satisfying games that don't take a lot of time.There is also quite a bit of random luck involved. Certain events are incredibly rare, certain quests only carry certain rewards at random and the spawn points of certain mobs and objects are hit and miss. This alone, isn't a fatal flaw either, as I'm fine with the luck of the draw if at any moment, fortunes can turn with good RNG. However, the combination of short game WITH a lot of luck involved, coupled with victory condition that require a solid fall-through, is a definite flaw. Luck and Randomness can only give players a balanced experience when given enough time, which Armello doesn't allow for. The result is that you'll need to make the best of your starting cards, location and quest and that the likely victory condition out of 4 (and most of these condition pretty much exclude the others) is already apparent from the first few turns. You need to follow through quickly, or lose the game before turn 3. There's no writing your hero's story, thinking on your feet or realistically hoping out for late stage game changers. The gameplay design messes with the game's ability to tell a story and your ability to create one.Want to go for the ""dark ending"" by corrupting your sneaky rodent character? Not likely when you're not getting any corruption cards and Banes spawn too far away.Want to heal the kingdom by gathering spirit stones as the bear priestess? Not so when all your Spirit stone quests just so happen to fall in statistics that you're low in, or all the naturally occuring stones fall in the wrong hands. Prestige and Kingslayer victories then become the most likely options, but the both of them are so reliant on combat skill that it leaves half the game's potential superfluous. The best of the people on multiplayer can carefully min/max their way towards consistent victory, but this sort of ratrace seems oddly incongruent with how Armello presents itself.All of this is hallmarked by me avoiding multiplayer competition somewhat and just wanting to do all the single-player achievements to see all that the world has to offer, but constantly restarting the game while doing so in the idle hope that this time, the game gives me what I require to properly progress on my chosen path or see the things I want to see. Again, reccomended for the atmosphere and storytelling should lady luck allow it, not so much as a smooth, flexible game.EDIT: After a small discussion with one of the game's developers below, I'd like to humbly propose Gremlins Inc. as a game that - despite being a looker but not nearly possessing Armello's art direction - also has karma, money and politics mechanics, but is as a boardgame, far better and more closely designed around revelling in RNG and making positive use of it. When going for victory, especially in multiplayer, Armello's RNG either keeps you on the track to victory or pushes you off it permanently, facillitating the kind of anguished min/maxing that goes - in my opinion - against the game's atmosphere. Gremlins Inc.'s sense of universal chaos is shared much more evenly, creating equality, and its cutthroat setting makes it a better competitive title in both body and heart.			"

												This game is a unique combination of a board game, a card game, and an RPG all at the same time.  Every match can be played in a completely different way, with hundreds of cards, items, and followers to mix it up.  The animation is extremely well done, with each card having its own custom art and animation.  Armello is a great purchase for $20.			"

												After being in both the early access and experiencing the first week of the ful release, I like to think I understand Armello a bit. It is fun, but feel somewhat poorly tuned. Lets start with the bad:- There are four victory methods, but one seems entirely based on luck (Spirit Stones) and the other feels as if you are attempting to push a boulder up a mountain with a toothpick (Rot). - The stats of the characters seem as if they were intended to be ""balanced"" but fall short of the mark. Some characters have inordinately amounts of advantage compared to others. If you intend on attempting a Rot or King kill victory with a character like Sana, you are in for a bad time. Whereas characters like Thane seem excellently tuned, and capable of Prestige, Fight, Rot, and Spirit Stone victories due to their natural ability to fight other characters.- Most of the game feels random. Cards you draw and dice rolls create a frustrating sense of the need for luck, despite your best laid plans and strategies. Cards seem to appear in poor ratios, with common useless cards getting stuck in your hand because you cannot burn them off on perils or battles.Now the good, and honestly, this does make up for the bad on most days:- It is EXCEEDINGLY beautiful. The characters all are colorful and interesting, the map gorgeous, and the card art is superb.- The music is relaxing and engaging, which is helpful while waiting for your turn. It was a pleasure to hear that early access players would receive the soundtrack for free, and I find myself listening to it frequently.- The varied methods of victory make an interesting game. Not everyone is always going for the same goal, and there are different reasons that a character may fight another. Maybe they need to get to a quest, or can see your quest and want to prevent you from getting to it.All in all, it is a joy to play, but it does not feel entirely complete. I hope to see more from the development team, and I would be more than happy to see DLC for this game. 7/10			"

												I really want to love this game. I got it in early access, and awaited eagerly as more elements were added. It has many elements that appeal to me. A tabletop feel, fantasy world, anthropomorphic characters. Throw in gorgeous graphics, especially on the animated cards, and a great soundtrack, and surely we're onto a winner.Sadly, I have to say the full release has disappointed me. The game just feels empty. But unlike many early access games, which end up as buggy unfinished excuses to take your money off you, Armello feels like it had a lot of love and effort put into it, which makes what we are left with a let down indeed.There are four ways to win in Armello, and only two of them seem worth pursuing unless you like a self imposed challenge. The 'prestige' and 'spirit stone' victories are fairly straightforward, but the 'kill the king' victory is an exercise in masochism, fail at it (which you will most likely, as the king is an absolute beast of a fighter) and you'll be too far behind to try for the other methods. The 'rot' victory is identical to the 'kill the king' victory, except you have to punish yourself even more to get it.You can play many cards during an opponent's turn, but good luck finding them: the mouse scrolling gets stuck very easily, and if you zoom out to see the whole map, an inexplicable layer of cloud obscures the whole map! Compare this to a true tabletop card game, where you can play cards against your opponent sitting round a table. Imagine if you had to get out of your chair, chase them around and physically hit them with it before they played their hand. In Armello Seeing as you don't know a card has been played until it's effect kicks in, there is very little one can do to protect against it. Most of the time, you will never have enough resources to ever use that card that's been in your hand for the past 2 turns.Once you've won a few games, repeat plays become a chore as you watch your 3 opponents slowly take their turns, then watch the king's guard take their turns, THEN watch the banes take theirs. Games become incredibly drawn out for all the wrong reasons. I think the developers could have added more settings to change gameplay rules, define what type of victory conditions are active and so on, give the player some customisation options to add longevity. Currently the only reason to replay is to unlock the many beautiful cards.The game is beautiful, and fun for a little while. It's just a shame it leaves you wanting more so badly.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game for a year now.But when i saw when developers made dice marketable and tradable.And soon after they added stupid chests and keys like CSGO i have notice that people start to farm these.Due to that players started rushing throw out that the game to collect them fast as possible.That pretty much is ruining the games now. And a lot when there new chests added in to the game.they haven't done anything against these players this problem continues be warned.One of the good and bad things about the game is there it's available on multiple platforms for example you can buy it from the PlayStation Store.And you can play against players if you play from PC.But the bad thing is if you want play the game on a different platform it means you have to pay for the same game twice I'm not against it. But the problem is that you have to buy all the DLCs that you already have from another platform.New heroes that are added into the game are not free you have to pay for the usurper pack to gain four Heroes.I suspect also future content that you would have to pay forFor a buy to play game is too much ask.

												A beautiful game ruined by excessive RNG.  It feels as though every strategy is trumped by die rolls, random map resource spawn, and card draw.    Yes, you can try to sway the values in your favor, but these seem to be gentle nudges to the odds, with significant resources often spent for no actual gain.  In the end, every game I lost felt less ""I made a critical mistake"" and more ""the cards/dice/etc. just refused to fall in my favor"" and my victories were also less satisfactory as a result.All that said, this is a gorgeous game that I liked thematically.  If the HEAVY reliance on RNG doesn't turn you off, then you may find it much more enjoyment here than I.  If, like myself, you need more of a sense of agency in a game, I would give this one a pass.			"

								I love it. At first i was struggling to get the core concepts of the game. I thought man this feels rigged but then i realized i was the one that sucked... and needed to learn how to play. Its a great game that i really, really, reaaly wished that there was local play in it. Since it run perfectly (better then hearthstone) on my surface pro 3 i7 it would be cool if i could set up a local game and just pass around the tablet when its the other players turn. guess i should post this suggestion on the forums or somethin. Anyways besides that its a great game. Get it. Friend request me. Then play it with me.			"

Early Access Review
								(This was written while the game was still in Early Access)Armello is a board-game RPG type of game with beautiful graphics, awesome mechanics and proper diversity: this is a game that really feels completely different every time you play it. Though some cards may appear more frequently, I've really had to adapt a different strategy every game I've played.This is also because of one of the best parts of Armello: the victory conditions. There are 4 different ways to beat the game, and the four conditions are able to be reached by anyone in the game, provided they plan for them. This helps keep the game interesting for everyone: it's hard to have a completely hopeless game, you can always try to fulfill one of the different conditions, regardless of the other player's status.The game takes a little to learn and understand, and (at the moment) some tooltips aren't always easily readable, but it isn't a particularly hard game to learn.There is ONE big problem with the game at the moment: lack of local multiplayer. This is a boardgame kind of game and the lack of local multiplayer is a big oversight. The developers have said they may add it in the future, but at the current moment it is sorely lacking it. Keep this in mind, because this lacking feature and the somewhat high price tag compared to other board-games, makes it hard to fully recommend.If you consider buying it, watch some gameplay videos first. Then, think about how you would want to play the game more: Do I like playing these games online with strangers? Can I wait for a local co-op that may not come? Do I have friends that play online and are willing to buy their own copy for $25?Armello is an amazing game and should be given a try, but at the moment the multiplayer options have a few bothersome conditions.

												I wish many of the early release games ended like Armello, I have buyed some of this games and most of the time I have ended feeling disappointed of the final release (Planetary A recently) or plainly cheated (Godus breaked my heart), but Armello was a different history, I fell in love just by seeing the early art concept and videos, I purchased the early access for that... and... wow... Armello never stopped getting better while being developed, and the final release felt complete and well done, I concur that a hotseat option would be great, but the single player and multiplayer are already quite fun, really hard but quite rewarding even when you lose.This guys promised and really delivered, this was money well spent for me, I hope this game turn into the success this guys deserve.

Great artwork but a disappointing board game.Armello has some similarities to Talisman, in that a way to win is in the middle of the board, but you need to improve your character's stats and gather useful equipment before you have any chance at it.However, killing or curing the king hardly ever happens as you have to be incredibly lucky for either to be feasible, so pretty much every time the game will run out of turns and the player who happens to have the highest prestige wins.Winning or losing is almost entirely based on luck. Meaningful decisions don't really come up, each player will tend to do their own thing, clicking on the next 'quest' and hoping to randomly have the most prestige when the game ends.Quests and encounters consist of a random die roll. Most of your time is spent waiting for the other players to take their turns, more so even than most other board games thanks to all of the neutral units taking their turns.In general it is just rather shallow, dull and repetitive.I love board games but there are many other board games, both physical and digital, that are better and cheaper than this one.However the 2D artwork is gorgeous and the in-game graphics and animations are nice.

												Frustration simulator 2015.A beautifully designed and drawn bcomputer board game. Entirely charming, addictive, easily played through fairly quickly per session.But Oh My God. It's so frustrating. It seems like every die roll is stacked heavily against you.Need some money? Well explore a dungeon! From the icon wheel that spins up when you do, it appears more likely that you'll get a coin result, but no. Four dungeons in a row you'll spawn a bane. Not just that but despit there appearing to be only one bane icon on the wheel, you'll tick past it only to stop on another striaght afterwards.Got 7 fight dice and great gear? Think you can beat that other character who has 4 fight dice and poor gear? You'd think so, but no, you wont. In fact you'll roll worse than him for all three actions of your turn and get the snot kicked out of you.Got a handful of cards and want to deal with that peril? No I'm sorry, all the icons will be mismatches for your cards and you'll fail all the die rolls you couldn't cover with your cards.Oh and do you have a quest with a 70% success chance? Well you'll succeed... As long as the reward isn't an item that you really want, because if so, your success chance is actually 0%.I really don't know how they have coded chance into this game, but failure at almost everything is the norm.I keep playing it, so I really have to recommend, but for the love of god, if you don't deal well with frustration, if you are prone to mouse or keyboard beating... Perhaps choose another game.			"

												To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this game. This is one of those games for which ""neutral"" opinion is perfect. So, what Armello is all about?It's a mixture of a board game, card game and strategy wrapped in gorgeous graphics and very nice soundtrack. Audio-visuals are very good and immersive. It feels like a fairy tale, every character is unique, likeable, and has a very cool design. Atmosphere is warm, nice, and calm... under one condition, and that is, if You have luck on Your side. Because this game can turn from a family friendly game to a table flipping rage fest. Why? Answer is simple, and to many people it's a turning point in buying a game or not. RNG! This game is so filled with randomness that sometimes You will feel You have no control over what's happening on the board.-Card picking at the beginning of each turn? Kinda random, except in one case if You have Usurpers DLC. One character can see what cards he's choosing.-Quests locations? Random. And the game is programmed that every time You complete one quest, next quest starts at the opposite side of the map/board.-Villages, main source of income for Your equipment? Random. So, it can happen that one person can have two villages nearby his clan grounds while another player has none and has to walk further to intercept it.-Exploring dungeons? Random. While exploring You can get many different outcomes, like finding gold/treasures, recruiting companions or The Stranger, spawning a wraith or even being teleported to another dungeon. The annoying part is that it isn't being determined by any factor at all, You just have to be lucky to get what You want.-And now the worst part. Battles with another players or npc's (knights and the king) are based on throwing dices, and although it's understandable it is random (since in real life throwing a dice is also random obviously) it presents a very, very nasty problem. The outcome of the fight isn't determined by Your playing skills but by sheer luck and the amount of dices You hold. The amount of dices depends on Your battle stat but even so there will be times when You're overpowered, having 7 or more dices and You still lose because RNG ""decided"" that You will roll 6 Rots and 1 Sword while Your opponents will roll 3 Wylds which gives them 3 additional rolls... and that can lead to another Wylds, and so on until You end up getting rekt. This can be very frustrating, to the point where You just quit the game. I would rather see some other mechanic that involves You as an active player more. You can burn Your cards to force symbols to appear, but that doesn't help much. At least not in my case.But despite all these flaws and rage inducing moments, I still enjoy this game for the most part. It may be because I am a calm person in general, but I can see how some other players will hate this type of gameplay. I wouldn't give this game a negative review, but positive one is also a little bit of a stretch, because that depends heavily on what kind of a player You are. If You are a rage quitter, You won't like this. But, if You're chill and aren't taking games that seriously, You can definitely enjoy Armello.			"

												I picked a bad time to start playing a good game.I had a blast playing the first couple weeks after I got the game via Indiebox up until my first major update even happened.Update 1.6 introduced character skins as purchaseable items in the shop or via the steam marketplace with no chance of dropping them via in-game actions at $7 per skin. It's impractical to try and sell the loot you get as drops toward buying these skins are most dice are worth around 15 cents or lower, and it's even less so if you don't have a mobile phone that supports the Steam app and have to wait 15 days for your dice to go up for sale and hope it hasn't dropped in price.It also added an image on the main menu that directs you to the in-game purchases screen with no way to disable it. It makes this $20 game feel like a free to play mobile app with how prominent it is.The 1.6 update also brought gameplay bugs that I have not yet seem remedy for, such as multiplayer games disconnecting without warning and no way to reconnect. I've had experienced a couple blue screen of deaths while the game is running when I oridnarily experience none with other applications.I had my fun, but the way the game is now I just cannot recommend it.

												Pros:Great graphics and art directionCons:Music is a bit basic, not that you need much here but it would be nice if they didn't just phone it in.AI seems fine until they decide to challenge the King with only 2 health thus handing the game over to the Prestiege Leader.The biggest con: Almost entirely luck based. While there are a few decisions to be made nearly everything in this game revolves around luck. From the cards you begin the game with to every challenge in the game. While you can do things to increase the odds in your favor such as focusing on a stat the sad reality is that it all comes down to luck so even that is no guarantee you'll win a crucial contest. If you're the kind of boardgamer that enjoys an hour game of <insert random luck-based american game that you played when you were a kid here> then this game is for you. But if you prefer a game with a bit more strategy then I suggest looking elsewhere.			"

												This is a beautiful game, graphically and mechanically. Armello mish-mashes several things I enjoy playing: card-based games, strategy, and tactics. This isn't just a ""beat your opponent to the King and layeth down the smack"", it's got far more depth than that. The methods of winning the game are part of the draw here: individual play styles can shine and are rewarded for the effort. Pacing your gameplay will depend on your play style.Artistically, the game draws me back to the worlds created by Richard Adams in Watership Down and The Plague Dogs, and the Redwall stories of Brian Jacques, all of which I enjoyed in my youth and still enjoy now. I actually like the disconnect from human-rendered characters as animals can offer similar, but much more mystical histories. As far as the story goes, there's not much more than a few simple bases: you're part of one of the four animal clans, you're attempting to dethrone the King, and each character has a special skill that can be used to essentially envision them within your own imagination. I like games that allow me to sort of ""flesh out"" a character for myself rather than having some contrived backstory forced on me, it makes each game more interesting and kind of intense as you're able to invent something for your character to be working toward upon taking the throne.Cons, I suppose, would be some of the things that I consider pros. Not everyone enjoys turn-based games, and waiting for the King's guard and the Bane to take their turns can become tedious (especially if there are a large number of them on the map), and not everyone enjoys card-based gameplay. However, if you don't like turn-based and card-based games, this one shouldn't even be on your radar. Luck is also part and parcel to this game, as it is with any dice-roll game, and if you don't like raw deals from Lady RNG, stay away; stay far, far away.One of the pros that I particularly enjoy is that each game can't just ""drag out""; the King has diminishing health and will eventually just keel over, ending the game whether anyone's breached the palace or not (no, you cannot heal the King other than one specific means). This keeps it from becoming stale, and since there's that added sort of time limit, it encourages progressive gameplay techniques that are learned from playing the game and understanding its tactics more.Another pro is the ""chat"" system in multiplayer games. There is no ""press-enter-to-type"" chat function, rather a series of basic dialogues available through the chat tab (like Hearthstone). I've long disliked chat systems in most competitive multiplayer because it seems like some people spend more time ""chatting"" (rather, trolling or raging) than they do actually playing the game. In the future, I hope that this minimalistic ""chat"" function is not replaced by a press-enter-to-type system; personally, I feel that it would hinder more than accentuate multiplayer. So far, the only basic way for someone to rage out and quit a match is to simply leave the game. I like this, I don't need someone's vitriol about being behind or ganged upon clogging up my screen. So, if a dev ever happens upon this review, please know that at least one fan of the game likes the ""chat"" system as it is; it keeps things far more civil in game.In all, Armello has an aesthetic that will either appeal or dissuade players in its art style, mechanics, and gameplay. It's easy to sink several hours into this game without noticing (or sometimes caring) that time has passed.			"

												It's been a while since I took my time to write a review.This game is different.As soon as I saw the trailer and the pictures, I could not believe it. It was everything I looked for in a game.It has clever combat, an amazing backstory, good mechanics to it and I don't get sick of it. Although, as time of writing, the player pool is small (probably due to the gigantic shadow of MGS5 and Mad Max) it has enough players to form games. This game is absolutely amazing.I have played many good games in my life, the likes of Demon Souls and Civilization 4, and I can say this one found a place amongst them.A polished, well thought, well written, 10/10 game.

Early Access Review
								It's hard to describe a game like Armello.At it's core it's a board game, but it's so much more than that. It's also a turn based strategy game, it's a card game, and it even has some RPG elements. More importantly, all these elements work well together.There's currently 4 characters to choose from (in Early access, there will be more at full release), each of which belongs to their own clan, and each character has their own stats, abilities and starting items. They are all different enough that each game feels fresh.When you first play Armello it might seem a bit complicated, but once you've played a match or two, you will know exactly what you're doing.Even though the game is currently in Early Access it's fully playable.

												I used to love this game... but the gradual game-greed has crept into yet another one.  $7 for an f'ing character skin?  get right the hell out of here.  Practices like these put a horrible taste in my mouth and often leave a game feeling soiled... so sorry LoG, but your business practices have soured me quite a bit on your otherwise wonderful experience.(Edit: I Understand the need, especially for a small dev, to keep funds flowing.  But charging an astronomical ammount for a tiny cosmetic change is NOT the way to increase sales / loyalty and bring in new players in the long run.And you know, if you were to take these individual skins down and repackage them as say. a 4-pack called a ""support the devs pack"".. I bet you 'd make a lot more money AND community goodwill.  Hell, I'd be first in line to buy THAT!)			"

												I feel like this is more of a $10 game, so I would recommend waiting until there is a sale. Overall the game is fun, I just wish there was more - either different maps or more characters or something. The maps are random, but always the same number or tiles from the same tile sets. Again, it's fun, but I've played it around 15x now (the games are quick, like 1-2 hours tops), and I just feel like I've played it out. I mean, $20 for 15+ hours of anything is still a good deal, but I'm just used to getting more play time out of games.			"

												Take the giant creatures from Black & White, the cards from Hearthstone, throw in some hexes with terrain from Civilization, some of the gameplay from Talisman, and the hellish RNG from Blood Bowl, and you have Armello.While it looks lovely, don't let its looks fool you, underneath that beauty is a twisted evil (the other players), just when you think victory is within your grasp everything changes.With several ways to win you can't simply focus on one thing and assume you have victory in the bag. And if it's all going horribly wrong, you there are ways for those who are falling behind to try to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.Cunning, and beautiful, worth every cent.			"

												A 4 player fantasy regicide board game.Update v1.0 is a massive improvement on the beta build. All the cards have been animated, annotated and even have sound effects. The card book got the same treatment, it also now highlights new cards so you can easily view them. The world map now has much higher level of graphical detail with each clan getting its own unique starting location and rotten ruins reciving a sinister purple glow during night turnsAs for the new heroes, the wolf ranger arrow offers safe first strikeRabbit tinker can swap items cheaply allowing you to rapidly shift tactics as the turns unfolds.Ninja rat is fragile but gains ambush advantage at nightBut the second magic bear...wow. He channels magic into smash-gic, every magic card used ups his attack. This synergises outrageously well with his clan signets and any spirit treasures/followers you pickup along the way.The devs will respond to any bugs you report with the bug report tool ingame or on their forums and are a friendly bunch.Games only last 18turns at the moment but id expect options for custom rules in a future build. If you like board games and fancy something new, give this a shot.It contains magic bears.			"

								The latest update- still pretty early in Early Access- really made this game click for me. Clever mechanics that tie into the themes well, plays like the board game it's supposed to be while taking advantage of digital in all the right ways. Armello is good at forcing tough decisions on you, and the range of routes to victory tend to make for a desperate finish. Art is absolutely beautiful. Amazing use of animation on the cards.It just feels RIGHT, y'know?			"

												Do you wih you like board games ? Do you wish you had one to play with anybody at any time ? If the answer is yes, then get ready to buy one of the best board game online !Good points :- Amazing graphics, with wonderful looking characters- Easy to learn gameplay, takes only 1 game to understand the basic, after what you'll want to discover all of the cards- Start a game with a weak character, and slowly watch yourself becoming a true warrior, with equipments and party members- 8 playable heroes (12 if you then buy the DLC), each with its own stats and a unique special ability, and customable with small artifacts- Different strategies, with different winning conditions, you never know what the next game will be like- Awesome community, just give a look at the forum and ask any question regarding the game, players and even the devs answer and help - Get gogeous looking dices, and if you don't need them, sell them on the store to earn your money back on the game :p""Meh"" points :- A game with dice and cards, so there is rng. I dont consider it a problem though, since your objective through a game is to earn better stats, in order to reduce your bad luck possibilities- Once you see yourself really behind (after behing focused by other people), it is hard to catch up, and you eventually end up trying to slow down other people journey to the king- A single game takes up to an hour. Just be sure to have some time before starting a session !Would i recommend Armello ? If you're not afraid to spend time on a board game, learning new things after each victory or defeat, trying new compositions and strategies, always improvising with what the rng gives you, then stop reading and BUY IT !Ps : Did i mention that Armello has the best devs of any game i know ? Well, now i did. "

												Honor and courage. Trickery and deceit. Adventure and quests. Armello is a multiplayer strategy game that embraces several different styles of play and has a colorful cast of characters to choose from. With four different paths to victory, every game is challenging and requires you to pay close attention to your enemies each turn, and each game will be different. When I first read about the game, I thought it would be fun and interesting, but I didn't expect it to be so addictive! Reminds me a bit of Game of Thrones, but with anthropomorphised animals instead of Sean Bean. Whether you want to play versus the AI or with friends, Armello is worth the $20, and the community is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy board games. A+, 10/10.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I'm quite pleased for a game that breaks the archtypes of animals, meaning that a rat isn't necessarily a bad or evil character. Really, it seems that YOU are the one who determines the alignment of four characters, a Thane (wolf), Sana (bear), Amber (rabbit), and Mercurio (rat). Each character is trying to become the next lord of Armello, and it can be done with intrigue, murder, or muscle. The game is a card/board/dice game so each play is different. Cards can be used to make your ascension easier, or more difficult on your rivals. And all the while Banes, something like a corruption elemental, are spawning and wreaking havoc on the land while dungeons are ripe for exploration. Declarations can be used to make thing easier on you, harder on others, or just a touch of randomness when nothing else is beneficial.This is one of the most unique games I have played and I enjoyed it, it's easy ot learn and isn't a game that is all to lengthy in play. You can play alone with computer players, or you can get some friends together and compete for the throne in multiplayer.			"

												I backed this game's Kickstater from day one at the Bandit Tier. I even bought a copy for my wife, and a copy for my PS4.  As an avid fan of board games, video games, the world of Don Bluth, Disney, and Brian Jaques Redwall book series, I couldn't help but believe in it. I was not disappointed. It's a true marvel among games of it's type. Not only is it fun, but it's challenging too. Plus it takes a bit to master, but I assure you all of that goes out the window once you gather three of your friends to play the game. The art is rich with detail and warmth. So much charcter place in the little sprits. The abilities and cards are well thought out and give the game new dimensions. My only Con and it's such a small one is that they should add a chat box players can type what they want to the other players, even add a whisper function to allow strategic attack and defense. In the mean time, just load up Skype and talk to your friends through that while enjoying the game. League of Geeks did a great job with this one, I look forward to other ventures they have, whether it's in Armello or beyond.			"

								Playing Armello is the a new great way to make your friends hate you, its like Mario Party, but for PC. In this game you pick a character, right now there is 4 different, and you should always pick Thane. Then you proceed to find the best bling between rings and amulets. When all that is done, then you go around as a greatsword-wielding wolf and beat the sh*t out of magical birds of evil, and you friend that decided that a cute little bunny was the best character ever. After having played around for a bit, you will find yourself at a fight with the mighty king. Or once mighty, because he has grown weaker over time, and since you are pure, then his rot means nothing. In the end you claim victory, and even tho you failed on most of your quest, you find out that the sword is mightier than the pen, and you got the biggest sword in Armello.10/10Cant wait for new characters to rival Thane's unmatched strength, so my friends might want to play with me again			"

												Armello is one of those games that makes me think I'm sitting around the table playing board games with friends in college again. The game seems to follow the age old quip of ""Easy to play, hard to master"" as there are so many different strategies revolving around all of the different characters and win conditions.The first few games were easily played with a friend as we both learned the ins and outs of the game. With four different kinds of victories capable, I have come to find that the Prestige victory is one of the easiest to obtain if you play your cards right (pun intended). The Rot victory is one of those victories where you can't start a game and go, ""I'm going to go for the Rot victory right off the bat."" I know this review doesn't help in terms of convincing you to buy the game, but it's just a few minor thoughts. The DLC is well worth the price, the game is fun to play alone, with friends, or even online. The lack of a chat function is kind of disaapointing, but I suppose it's like Hearthstone in that it does help avoid all of the toxicity filling today's games. Grab Armello, grab a drink, and get ready to feel the nostalgia of board game night!			"

												Beautiful animations, beautiful artwork, hypnotically immersive soundtrack, fluid game mechanics and overall gameplay that just oozes originality while also being ridiculously fun to boot. Armello is a turn-based RPG/Strategy Card game which is honestly more of a Virtual Board game than anything else. You pick a Hero, each possessing their own strengths/stats/abilities and proceed to compete against 3 other players while trying to win the game through 4 different methods (kill the king, gather 4 stones and confront the king etc etc). All the while, you have random events, dictations from the King (player-chosen events), and even an evil race of monsters (called Banes) that are trying to kill everything and everyone. Sometimes you will work together with other players but it's important to remember there can only be one winner, so backstabbing is friendship killing levels in this game. Final opinion? This game is a hell of a lot of fun and I highly recommend it even if it's just for the Aesthetic alone... Now excuse me, I'm going to go maul a few animals with my Spirit Bear.Gameplay and Review:

												The TL;DR version: It's Redwall Mixed with Game of Thrones in electronic boardgame format and is exactly as awesome as that sounds. Buy it!The Proper version: Armello is a strategy game that blends both strategic, tactical and luck based mechanics into a very well-polished package. Your typical game lasts about an hour (Longer for Multiplayer) and has you in a race for the crown. During each game you compete with both your opponents and AI controlled entites like Banes and Castle Guards to progress to one of four victory types. The variety of characters (8 in total as of launch) ...each with their own unique starting stats and special abilities and the variety of victory types (4 in total) means that every game plays out differently, especially since the map is randomly generated every game. Even when playing the same character, you might find that the terrain and early game events might make one type of victory better than another.The main victory in the game is a Prestige victory. This follows your standard victory point progression like other board games. The other three victory types are ways for players who are behind to ""Steal"" the win from the prestige leader. This is good as even if you fall WAY behind, you are still able to claim victory, yet it isn't unfair to the prestige leader as the prestige victory is the lowest-risk victory, and players trying to 'steal' it from you must take a riskier and more difficult path. It also means that a game isn't won or lost until the final turn, so every player is still engaged even if someone takes a very early prestige lead. The Single Player AI is competent, most of the time. However, the true challenge and fun comes from multiplayer games. With ranked multiplayer coming in 1.1, this could absolutely be a good game to play against other people. And while there is still luck involved, more skilled players can pull off wins much more readily than novice players... thus demonstrating that skill and strategy play a signifigant portion in how well you do and that luck is merely *a* factor, not *the* factor in determining how well you do. The price point is spot on and worth every dollar. If you compare it to a physical board game of the same scope, complexity and nature, this is about 1/3 the price that a physical board game would run you, and is a lot easier to setup and play than one. Even if you aren't a big computer game fan, if you love board games like Agricola, Carcaconne, Settler's of Cattan and the like, you'll love this game. In all, highly reccomended!			"

												This is probably one of the best strategy games I have played in a long time.  It brings to the table a sense of RPG, TCG and PVP like no other ""board game"" videogame I have ever played.The Multiplayer is pretty cool.  I can see why the developers wouldnt want a chat in the active multiplayer game, because it would lead to all sorts of things that derail you from enjoying the game, BUT I would add a chat in the Lobby, because waiting for players to appear, well its tedious.As far as the characters you can play go, I have been playing with Zosha, which is a complete steal and I think it's the most OP character in the game due to it's night time advantages.  Still no character is better or worst than any other, so they are pretty balanced.  You just need to be good at strategizing your moves, and have a little bit of luck :) But it is doable to win out of an irrecoverable position in the game.For example, during my last multiplayer game for example, I wasted too much time reading the amulets and I didnt get to pick one, which is a bit of a disadvantage.  Then I got hit by Rot, which kills your health on a turn by turn basis, I spent most of the game without any prestige... I honestly thought I was going to lose.  But as luck turns out by following the quest line, I was able to get rid of the pesky Rot, gain enough fight to have 10 dices of it, and eventually made my way to the castle where I brought the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ king well deserved tears.  I really have to tell the devs that this game has truly gone beyond my expectations.  Boardgames brought to video games usually turn one dimensional (take for example Smallworld2, which had an excellent opportunity to be a great game and it ended up sucking...) but in Armello, the board is simply gorgeous, I love the minituarized effect when you get really close with your mouse wheel, the animations are pretty solid, the gameplay is fluid and never boring.  The game has an excellent balance of cards, which bring to play fight, defense, items, magic, etc.  The AI is fairly competent.What I can expect from this game in the future, perhaps is different settings for the boards, and more characters, although the current 8 that come with the game are pretty cool so far.Bravo for the devs.  This is the type of game I wish I had been able to kickstart because you guys did an amazing job.So if you havent bought it yet, then you should go right now and buy this game.  $20 is cheaper than hookers and blow or a date... which are overrated anyways.  What are you waiting for... go buy it... now dammit.			"

												Have only played Singleplayer so far against AI but its been great. The enviroment of this game alone makes it a must have. Disney like characters and a very detailed map with Cards that have amazing artwork. Different victorys, multiple people to play each with unique traits, various items like rings and amulets that add different stats all add to this games replay value. If your the type that likes theorycrafting and having a ton of ways to approach victory this is deffinitly a game for you!The board itself is fairly small and the king slowly dieing does add a little feeling of being rushed at first. But once i got the hang of it i really started to enjoy it. The games actually can take a fair amount of time and you have ample time to play out your strategys and explore the map. Ive already got 7.5 hours played and i havent even entered Multiplayer. I am the type of person who likes to know as much as i can before entering a PVP situation(Years of theorycrafting for WoW :D) and this game is actually taking some time to learn all the ins and outs. Honestly i still feel like a noob! Very fun haha.You cannot receive any chests/keys in singleplayer. They give skins to dice which are purely cosmetic so not really an issue. Just a nice long term goal for some people to look fowards to. I honestly am pretty excited to start multiplayer and face some real challenge!I bought this game 100% for Singleplayer though, full price and bought the usurpers DLC(the one with the 4 new people)and deffinitly say i got my moneys worth. And all the hate against the DLC and microtransactions is the same old typical hate you find on every game with it. They arent gamebreaking in anyway and most are cosmetic. Deffinitly giving this game a 10/10!!!Update: Have now dumped 20+ hours into multi-player and love it. Cons: There are a few cases where i ran into a Bot or afker who would sit in base all game skipping turns(to make the games end fast as possible  to farm chests). And of course the rage quiter who would leave after slightly falling behind.Other times a team of 2 or 3 would gang up on me completely making it imposible for me to win, which is very annoying.  However this rarely occured. Most of the games I had friendly players who played till the end, Still a 10/10. Cant wait for more future updates :D			"

Early Access Review
								I've been following this game's production for well over a year. Aside from the fact that I've wanted to do voice acting work in this game since the moment I saw it, the art style appealed to me greatly. Over the last year, as more and more assets have gone public (most notably the animated card art), my excitement for this title has only increased.There is also the fact that the dev team pays extreme attention to the community members playing this game in early access; often playing against various members in weekly livestreams. They maintain an open dialog with the community and take our desires and interests to heart when bringing this world to life.The singleplayer campaign has, thus far, been incredibly engaging. I find myself compelled to continue playing even when things have not been going my way and I'm getting frustrated. There is always something which makes me want to keep going.""Okay...I need to get to sleep. I've got work in a few hours. Buuuuuut.......maybe just one more game.""			"

												Oh my god I love this game.It plays as beautifully as it looks. If tabletop/board/dice based games are your thing, this game was made with you in mind. Only played for 3 hours so far, but I am super impressed and can't wait to play some more.			"

												I had mixed feelings when starting Armello.  However I am a big board game fan. That tag got me interested in Armello.However I was rather concerned by the fact that it never was a real board game.  In the board game world that is the equivalent of a strait to DVD release.  They tend to be kind of poorly done.  I purchased this intending to use steam refund.However the game is one of the better games in the non-RPG adventuring genre.Like most games in that genre there is a ton of dice.  However Armello, unlike most, give a player a choice in what they want to do, instead of mandating go here fight this, etc.  It provides a variety of things to do and avoids a grind.But were Armello really shows its glory is the card play.  The game has great hand management.  There is definitely some tactics to when and how you play your cards. I even found myself debating if I should wait for optimal use or just play the card to get another draw.The game is competitive and does it correctly.  Most let you either just race or perhaps slow your opponents down.  In Armello you can actually hurt your opponents, but never remove them from the game.The theme for Armello is fine and I like the graphics.Now for the weakness --The game requires you keep track of the other players (at least to play on the top level). However what a player is doing is sometimes done so fast that if you blink you'd miss it.  Other times another players turn can be painfully long while you mostly sit there.  The game needs to speed its turns but also keep a log or make it easy to see what they did.In conclusion. This is a good game.  It is relaxing and crafted with a professionalism you do not normally see in this style of computer board game.  Solid graphic, solid game play with a solid recommendation.  Although sometime I wonder if my opinion is inflated due to low expectations.			"

								While bits and pieces are still being added and fine tuned (as should be the case with any early acces game) this is a full experience and a great one at that.Beautiful visuals, wonderful music and really well balanced game play add up to make a great game to play with friends or enemies.The League of Geeks team have done a really good job here.

												First off, it's totally bootyful. The art, animation, presentation, music, all of it, awesome. The game is super easy to pick up and play, and it isn't all too deep. Matches last for 45 mins, maybe an hour, and each one can play out differently, with different win conditions that are better suited for different characters. A few account-level unlocks, but nothing too skewed toward power. So there's a fair bit of replay, but it's not infinite. No local multiplayer, currently, but there is online. Single player probably won't keep you occupied for too long, and it is rather easy (difficulty levels would be much welcome) but multiplayer has some potential, especially when ranked play comes with a later patch. Still, grab three friends, sit around without pants on, make a drinking game out of getting rot, and you're probably have yourself a good time.			"

								This game has the essence of what I love from a good game of Civilization V with friends all boiled into an experience that is far less time consuming! The artwork is great, the soundtrack is immersive, and the gameplay always stays fresh! Although some may criticize the amount of chance in the game, a good player will know how to play circumstances to their favor. My favorite part of this game is that no game is ever set in stone. One player may be winning at first, but if they aren't careful another player can easily sweep in and steal their victory! When you are not playing with friends the game still allows you to play with bots that allow for a good challenge and a fun time, though, the game really does shine with friends where the amount of animosity it can create is glorious. I heartily recommend this game!			"

								The only strategic game I play on steam. As a Kickstarter backer, my opinion is somewhat beholden to the money I've given to the project. That being said, Armello had one of the fastest Kickstarter turnaround times I've ever seen. The proof is in the pudding: Armello is one of the most beautiful games available on Steam, with a strong sense of artistic self. Its parts create an ideal whole.With over 100 cards and a total of 12 playable heroes (4 during the Beta, at least 4 more at launch Sept. 1st 2015, plus 4 additional ones for backers and eventually, late adopters) there is enough variety to keep you coming back for more, to see how each game plays out. Randomized gameboards and multiplayer support only further this. The additions of quests and storyline are icing on the cake, and I expect the full release to be even richer in terms of how the story is told. I've taken to playing the game just to unwind; the mix of beautiful art and serene, appropriate music is enough to please the senses for every moment you play.In short, you owe it to yourself to experience the world of Armello, which in itself is so compelling that even without the exemplary game system it would serve as the basis for a series of best-selling fiction.

								This is definitely one of the best games, I've been playing, recently.The game is easy to learn, and it's perfect for casual-gamers, as well as for people who like to spend weeks, playing one game and getting better, than anybody else!I've played a few other Early-Access games, but none of them was this balanced. Most of them were quite unfinished, but this game can be played for hours and you probably won't come across any bugs or stuff that doesn't work, yet.Over the last two days, I've played the game for almost ten hours and I quite enjoyed it. The only thing I don't like, about this game, is a detail in the multiplayer matches... When somebody disconnects from the game, the whole match will be ended, immediately. I've played a few multiplayer matches, but I've never finished any of those... this should definitely be changed, soon (maybe they'd turn the disconnected player into an AI), but it's just a small point.If you're searching for a fun new strategy game, you'd definitely get Armello!

												  I had backed Armello for $150 on kickstarter, and I had been playing it since beta.  I have, on record, 200+ hours meaning I am experienced in Armello (and I have won a fair amount of games.)  I have seen the changes made to Armello as it progressed from beta to early access to full release and now patches.  I had high hopes for Armello in the kickstarter, and I really wanted to enjoy it; but I feel Armello suffers from having too much RNG.   RNG is fine in video games, infact it's what makes a game.  The complaint is the AMOUNT of RNG this game has:  dice, cards, coin flips, percent chances.  It takes out the skill of anything that could be done.  There are some other key elements that also make it an even more unpleasurable experience:•RNG -Dice Rolls:  The dice roll chances come out to | 3/6 attack | 1/6 shield | 2/6 miss |  not exactly balanced -Card Draws:  Adds to the RNG aspect with obtaining random spells/equipment -Movement:  Dungeons can spawn banes (obstructing your path) or teleport (sets you back further but can help in very few situations) -Quest Rewards:  Three sets of quest with rewards (spirit stone, random follower, or random treasure,) even a chance to fail the quest depending on your stats•Community -Griefing:  Partied up players like to gang up and bully the fourth player (LoG has took initiative to ban these players from what I've heard) -Quiters:  Some players quit games due to their favorite characters being picked or leave because of unfortunate events in the game -Aggression:  Uncalled-for aggression from other players, even unprovoked (On other negative reviews there seems to be die-hard fanboys defending the game blindly and aggressively) -Unfriendly:  Some spiteful players tend to emote laughs and other emotes after being extremely hostile in-game•Gameplay -Battle:  Fights tend to end in a stalemate with both players dying due to 3/6 chance of rolling attack (unless luck is involved) -PvP:  No allegences between players except between friends, everyone stabs you in the back eventually -Strategy:  There's almost no strategy, everything's situational; and the game's too random for there to be any kind of set strategy (the only strategy is knowledge of cards and what the opponent could have/do) -Crashes:  There are constant freezes and NMAs which seems to happen more frequently as the game updates•Design +Art:  I do love the designs of this game, but really that's the only positive thing I have to say about Armello ○Sound:  Nothing too impressive, but it's not necessarily bad Even in private full lobby friend match there's no enjoyment to be had.  Everything feels like a matter of chance with no skill required.  There's no rewarding feeling you get when you win a match, because it's all luck-based.  After doing a good amount of private matches, we agreed to either playing a different game or just stopping all together.  Armello has plenty of potential to be a fun game, but with the randomness of everything it just kills any enjoyment.  Winning sessions comes down to luck (almost every game ends with being really lucky, or really unlucky.)  Armello could be more of a strategic game if the random elements were toned down.  For now, this will be a negative review, unless several mechanics of the game are revised.			"

												Hello there stranger! (or potencial stalker :OO), this is Armello one of the few digital boardgames that i genually like and simply because it plays like one and it's not overly complicated like many others digital reboots.Anyways aside from the smooth and fun RPG system that it's not the worse to get used to but also challenging this game offers a scavenge style lore. Which means you'r only given the base part of it and the rest is in: items descriptions and quests.  And as a side note most of the cards that you play are a bit animated a beautifully draw :)			"

												Armello is a board game... of sorts.  You play as heroes of 4 animal clans who fight to save their kingdom, or to destroy it. That is entirely up to you, the player. You have a choice of 8 characters (currectly, more are being added!). Each clan is represented by 2 heroes. They have a variety or special abilities which make them unique, and you need to adapt to their playstyle to win. Some character might be too weak but strong in battle, yet other might lack in battle but win with magic and amounts of health.But as I said, Armello is a board game! It is not the best, but not the worst either. It has its flaws. For example the game relies too much on RNG. Which means you might get really good drop and on the other hand you will do so miserably and ask yourself: why? The gaming board represents the kingdom or Armello, its procedurally generated, so the game will always be different, although the shape of the board stays the same. The board is filled with villages, dungeons, enemy mobs, forests and mountains, and also with traps.The goal of the game is to defeat the king, who has been taken by a Rot. (Rot is a special condition in a game that drains 1 health every 2 turns) The king is slowly loosing his health. You have many options how to win. Be a fighter, a diplomat, the one who purges the darkness away from the king or a corrupted hero who decides to rule with even darker hand than the king himself.You can play alone with AI controlled players, join up online with friends or online against random players to have a chance to drop some sweet loot that can be sold on Steam market (really, free, no microtransactions!), or be kept for you to admire. (Seriously, a dice that sparkles... count me in!)Although the game is really clinging on randomness and it sometimes feels like its more based on luck than actual skill (which might and might not be true. If you are really lucky you can win, but if you think about your moves, you can win just as much) its very fun, matches might take over 60 minutes sometimes, but with its randomly generated maps the games are never the same.

								Wow!What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? As a huge fan of real-life boardgames, there is often a bit lost in transition between the tabletop and the digital realm. Rarely has a game of Settlers of Catan or Magic the Gathering felt nearly as compelling online as it has in person.However, Armello seems to meld just perfectly the best aspects of both real-world boardgaming and videogaming. The card art is gorgeous (and wonderfully animated), as is the world and the lore that is set up. Each character is unique, while still remaining viable and seemingly balanced. With four different possible paths to victory, players must adapt quickly and cobble together a winning strategy from whatever comes their way.It must be said that no game has ever had the level of collaboration between developer and player that Armello has. As a successful Kickstarter, the game has grown past anyone's expectations thanks to the free exchange of ideas from the community. I can only hope that Armello, and the League of Geeks team, serve as models for what future videogames can accomplish!			"

												So I wont be saying much new here, but at least its worth having the key points reiterated:- Fun idea for a game, major problems with connectivity, pacing and sociability.Basically you get a board game thats interesting to play and varied enough that luck and tactics are well-balanced for fun, but its like going to a party where at any point you or your copartiers will be pulled out by a bungee rope and not allowed to return, and you'll be replaced by a Stepford party-goer. (i.e. if you lose connectivity, you're gone for good. No returning to the last 5 minutes of a game you were about to win).Also you have to wait for ages for everyone else to take their turn, requiring just enough concentration that reading a book is not possible, but not so much concentration that its engaging or challenging to follow.2/5. There's better things out there for sure.			"

I am not very good at reviews so I'll just say if your feeling the way I did about it dont just go ahead and buy it. Once I bought and started playing I totally forgot about the Bandit Clan issue.Also the Dev's seem like really decent kinda guys  so I think they will keep their promise and look into the issue off the blocked content.Stunningly beautiful game and Dev's that really seem to care about what they have created here .. 10/10Ps .. did I mention Lisa Gerrard of Gladiator fame sing the soundtrack ?

												This game is honestly pretty worth it. More so if you have a few friends to play with. The game is pretty easy to pick up, and continue to play with out knowing much, but it is also rich in stratagy for those who want to plan every move up to taking the throne for yourself. Have not tried it since 1.0 release but I know I'm looking forward to the devlopment of new characters and cards as time progresses. Will have to admit the battles are probably my favroite, I wish there was more of NPC threat with out it being a guard. Though that would be my only complaint. All in all for the type of game it is, I give it a 9 out of 10. Definitly worth a pick up for you and your friends to play on game night. :3			"

												Very beautiful game, especially with the new board skin DLC, which I heartily recommend! This game is quite simple at its core, play one of 12 heroes(if you're not a founder) which are all unique and guide them on your chosen path to defeat the King and become King or Queen of Armello. There are four ways to win, some a little less tasking than the others. However, while this game is straightforward, the world can be perilous and certainly deceptively complicated under its simple face. It allows you to plan ahead, despite the randomness of most events. This same randomness can be considered a blessing or a curse, as it may impede or boost your fight for the throne. Something that might intrigue some players, is that no matter how poorly you may think you're doing, there is always a way to become the ruler of all Armello.There's really not much to say about this game anymore, it's a masterpiece in its own right with very few bugs. Look forward to future and past content from the wonderful developers!			"

												Armello is a computer boardgame set in a fantasy kingdom of Armello, a world filled with antropomorphic animals of various kinds. Rot has corrupted the good king of the land, making him erratic and mad. This of course will not do and the clans of the kingdom set out to solve the problem, some of them harboring a solution more sinister than the other. It falls to the player's clan to either cure, kill or replace the king by being the hero of the people.The game starts by the players picking their characters from a bunch of eight different heroes belonging into four different clans as well as the starting trinkets which the player can use to get and advantage in a specific situation on board and a statboost of their favourite stat. The board is then randomly generated with the King's palace in the middle. The map is made of a bunch of different tiles such as high mountains, dangerous swamps, periless dungeons, busy villages, lush forests etc. etc. Almost every tile has a special purpose, giving the player either a defence boost, health refill, invisibility, wound or something else. For example Dungeons give various rewards from money to magical items and Villages pile the heroe's purse with shiny, clinky, coin at dawn. The tiles can be further changed by various cards and events.The goal of the game is to either kill the mad king and take his place. Cure the king with four magical stones or wait till the king dies by succumbing to the rot (or being slain by another hero with both the king and the hero dying) and claiming the throne as a prestigeful hero of the good people of Armello. By completing quests each hero increases their attributes and prestige.The player heroes all have a handful of cards they can play any time they want. Even when it's not the player's turn to act provided the player hero has the money or magic and the proper conditions to use the card. These item cards range from beneficial items to magic to shady deals to spring traps and other evil things upon the unlucky contestants.Attributes include Fight which determines how good your hero is in combat, Body that servers as your hero's hitpoints and health, Wits which lets you draw more cards to play later and Spirit which measures your magical prowess. Each of these stats are used in either combat, questing or when facing a peril. Naturally the higher the attribute the more chances your hero has winning the encounter.Secondary attributes are Gold which is used to play various types of cards to enhance your own hero or make the life of other heroes more difficult. Magic which is the fuel for using magic cards for the same purposes as above. Prestige which helps you winning the game and Rot which... measures how much you rely on the dark evil. Prestige and Rot both require some attention here.Prestige measures how famous your hero is. Having the highest prestige at dawn has the benefit of letting your hero give the mad lion king advice on which of the two new rules he's going to enforce for the coming day. This can be used to make the life more difficult for the other heroes but the choises aren't always beneficial for the prestige leader. When the king dies, either by succumbing to the rot or when killed by another hero unsuccesfully, the player whose hero has the highest prestige wins the game. Players can also lose prestige by killing the royal guard or by dying. Some events, such as certain quests when failed, also drain prestige. Player can increase their hero's prestige by killing opposing heroes the evil banes and by completing quests.Rot is the dark influence heroes gain by dabbling into evil magic or being corrupted by rotten creatures. Having rot can make your hero stronger, but it comes at a cost. Each dawn a corrupted hero takes damage and if your hero is very badly corrupted, the normally beneficial healing shrines will kill the hero instantly. Having rot makes your hero more potent in combat, but only if you fight against other corrupted creatures. If the hero's rot value is bigger than the opponents, the player may add the opponents rot in dice to their dice pool during combat. Also each time a rot corrupted character slays somebody they refil their health by one point and is not hunted by banes. Having rot is a very aggressive strategy towards winning the game.When a fight breaks out the player gets to roll their Fight dice. There are several items and abilities such as shields, armor, weapons and magic which add or reduces from your or your opponents dice pool. Players try to roll as many hits as they can as well as blocks to negate enemy hits. Fights can end in a several ways but dying doesn't punish the player too much. The defeated hero will respawn in their clan's starting ground and is back in the game as soon as the player's turn is up. The player can also burn the cards in their hand to get a guaranteed result on a single die.The game has one nasty flaw though, if you can even count it as a flaw. The game is very random. By having a poor luck with the tiles near your starting zone or a bad starting hand of cards you may find your hero's chances of winning being very low from the get go. Bad card draws and unforgiving dice can also completely ruin your game, but that's given, considering the game is closer to a board game than a what you normally have on a computer. But besides that I find the game very enjoyable. The presentation is great. The game has some really fine artistic style, fitting music and it's just a joy to play. It's a bit boring alone, but with friends the game really shines. Armello is not for everyone but I believe anybody who's into board games will probably enjoy this one immensively.			"

												Armello is a fun tabletop rpg sort of game. Always fun playing with friends, sitting in the discord server making jokes and commentary on each other's turns. Recommend playing the prologue first, then hopping in single player, or straight in with three other friends. 10/10			"

								It's pretty much the Buffy The Vampire Slayer of games. Entertaining, fun, intelligent, but very difficult to put into a particular genre. It looks AMAZING, and it's very clear a lot of love and effort has gone into making it what it is. Having not played anything like it before, it took me a few rounds to work out what was going on, but once I got my head around the gameplay I was hooked. Highly recommended!			"

								My review for Armello as posted on: http://www.grabthegames.com/preview-armello.htmlA digital board game like no other, it really feels like Game of Thrones but with animals.  The first aspect that I loved about this game is that is not a simple board game but it has a solid and interesting story that makes the game experience even better! Moreover, the game features beautiful graphics and a really captivating soundtrack and in game music as well. The game is also fast with a high replay value. The day and night cycle is a great addition to the game with both of these cycles affecting the game play. Everything is also so beautiful in this game from the animated cards that will be more than 100 in the game to the captivating board of the title. Furthermore, the game has a lot of heroes to choose from that each one represent a different clan. Each clan representative has different set of skills, advantages and weaknesses with more to come when the final version of the game will be out. The heroes are also highly customizable with rings and amulets with impressive attribute. The title also features a dynamic sandbox. This means that every game you play will not be the game as the previous one because the maps and the quests are randomly generated. However, there are some negative aspects that I should mention. The biggest one for me is it lacks a good tutorial; I found it hard to get used to the title but after two or three games you will be able to learn it easily.  To sum up, if you love gorgeous games and tabletop title this is the game you must pick up without second thought. Totally recommend it despite the negative aspect. It has a great feature and more content will be implemented in the near feature. Verdict: 8.5/10 +graphics+customization+sandbox aspect+day and night cycle+100+ animated cards-desperately needs a better tutorial "

												This game is so incredibly beautiful from the world, the 2D art to even the music. Every part of this game is made with love and care. I absolutly recommend this game.EDIT After Early Access Experience: From day one, Armello was a beautiful game with solid gameplay but the game it started as is nothing compared to the game that it has become today. The artists worked even more magic and completely overhauled everything to make Armello one of the most beautiful games out there from the UIm the character models to every card in the game. The programmers and other teams members have also been working hard working with the community and their suggestions to make Armello play incredibly well. If you ever need an example on how to do a good Kickstarter and a good Early Access game, Armello is it.I could not reccomend this game enough if you are a fan of the genre and if you aren't there is still lots of fun to be had with this game. I am really looking forward to this becoming the new game that me and all of my mates play out our next LAN party.			"

												As an avid collector of table top games that are mostly strategy and/or role-playing games, I would say that this game is worthy of my collection outside the fact that it is not made of cardboard.  haha. I just played through the tutorial, and it was spectacularly helpful and not boring.  Then I played through a full game with bots.  I can't wait to play with some friends.  The artwork on the cards is gorgeous. The animals are adorable.  As far as I've played, it's pretty balanced, but I would like to see how it fairs with real players instead of just bots.Just a few small spelling errors here and there on a few of the cards and tutorial material, but nothing to get all bent out of shape over.

												I've been enjoying this game immensely.When I first started playing it I was worried I was going to get sucked into a black abyss like when playing civ 5 since it took me about an hour to get through the tutorials.  It surprised me though, after trying out a few rounds with AI eventually it would take me about 30-40 minutes to get through each game which is pretty nice in my opinion.I lost my first three games too, but the only one I got frustrated about was when the AI Thane managed to get one prestige above mine and the King died the next day.  I like the fact though that things can easily change from turn to turn.  I haven't tried multiplayer online yet, too worried I might get my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me.  Overall great gameplay and very addictive! Would definitely reccommend a thousand times over!			"

												This is one of the games I wish we had the option for a neutral review, but since I feel the pros slightly outweight the cons I'll go with a positive one even with its issues.The game itself is rather fun. Think of a Studio Ghibli movie meeting Game of Thrones. It's a board game where you and 3 other people or AI roam a beautiful board trying to complete objectives while fighting each other and the board pieces or making alliances. There's 4 ways to win a game and all of them require the King to die or get banished so you become the next King/Queen, the thing is the vast majority of games it's gonna be one of two ways, either a Kingslayer or a Prestige victory.There's 4 clans, each of which has 3 possible heroes for you to choose, 2 if you don't have the Unsurpers DLC. Every one of them is a viable choice for competitive play and uniquely built with their strengths and weaknesses.The game has a good enough mix of strategy and RNG. Sometimes you can find yourself in a corner because RNG screwed you in a game or ahead of the others because it favored you. Building your hero in a way that minimizes the RNG effect on you is also a core part of the game.The queues always felt good to me. I see a lot of complaints about people waiting too long for games yet I never had to wait over 2-3mins. I don't know if it's a timezone thing but for me this never was a problem.The real problem with the game is the stability issues. If you get disconnected in Multiplayer that's it, there's no way to rejoin the game. And more often than not this can also cause the match to completely freeze, forcing everyone to abandon a 1h+ game. And it can really freeze at any time, without anyone leaving too. In my experience this affects 25-35% of the matches I've played.Also LoG has decided to milk their customers by going down the DLC and microtransactions route. First there was a character pack which let's say it's okay. Then a 5€ DLC that just adds 2 more color palettes for the board map. And with version 1.6 came ridiculously overpriced Hero Skins as well. At least besides the character pack everything is purely cosmetic and does not affect your game experience.Lastly the community seems to be a rather decent one in my experience of Multiplayer. There are the occasional trolls and afk farmers but they're much more uncommon than pleasant people you meet during your matches. The problemtic thing is the AI that takes the place of someone leaving the game. They are really not the brightest ones around. They're generally quite bloodthirsty even when the odds are really stacked against them and will rush breaching the palace quite often(that's the last phase of the game).tl;drPros-Beautiful artwork-Balanced-More than 1 victory type allowing you to play in different ways-Enjoyful experience(when it works)-Good variety of cardsCons-Multiplayer Freezes sometimes-No way to reconnect in an ongoing game-cosmetic microtransactions and DLCs-a bit prone to RNG -Horrendous A.I.All in all I'd say if you enjoy board games and don't mind some RNG involved it's a good choice for you, it certainly was for me!

								It's a great game--a combination of a traditional tabletop and board game, but two things that are crippling the game, or at the very least, are proving to be worrisome, are online play and DLC.Currently, if one person even remotely disconnects during the game, it completely ends the match and returns you to the Menu Screen.   On several occasions, I played game nearly to their completion, only to have a player, whether intentional or not, disconnect, completely ruining the match and wasting whatever time you devoted.  Something as simple as a screen for the remaining players to decide whether to wait or continue with an AI would have sufficed, but as it is, there's nothing more furstrating than to figuratively have a player throw the game and table.Second, between their Kickstarter page and their Wiki, there are currently 4 playable characters with 8 additional characters being released as DLC--four of which are slated to be paid DLC, and other four only available if you donated at least $45/$55 to their Kickstarter.  While I can appreciate something being special or exclusive, for what is supposed to be a casual stategy game, I can't help but feel a bit sleighted of being denied content simply because I happen to be late to the party or don't have a fat wallet.  Maybe if it was one or two characters, or even vanity items, but to devote a whole faction--literally a third of the currently planned playable characters, with a time and money requirement, I can't help but feel this game is pay-to-win even before leaving the gates.

												This game is a simple delight. Once you get a grasp of the basic concepts of the game, it's a fun strategic, yet simple, game you can play against friends, people or AI in a relaxed environment. The art style and characters are charming. There is enough variation with the characters strengths to take different approaches to gaining victory over your opponents whether that's attaining prestige via questing, bane slaying, hero killing, alliances, etc. or trying the alternative ways to victory such as collecting spirit stones to cure the king or preparing for a final fight to kill him either with good gear and stats or becoming more corrupted than him.The game does have a heavy dose of luck involved but you can try to play around the odds smartly to avoid bad rolls. It won't always work out and sometimes it works out in your favour.Unless you are playing with friends who have backed the game and bought DLC, the full character roster is hidden behind barriers to entry. I play with a backer and with another person who owns the DLC. So in our games, we get the 4 bandit characters and the additional 4 DLC characters in our game's roster.			"

								As a long time board gamer and video gamer, I really appreciate Armello in so many respects. This was not a board game adapted into a video game or vice versa, this game truly is a standalone experience on the computer. You could not have the high quality cards, dice rolling, or opening cutscene in a cardboard version of this game (though honestly, I wouldn't mind owning one).I'll be honest, I saw the gameplay and I was like, ""I guess it looks like a game I would try out"" but then I saw the two videos produced for Armello and my mind was blown. I appreciate the deep lore and story that they put into a turn based board game. I am in love, please produce a movie!As far as gameplay goes, I find it to be a very well balanced board game that is very down to the wire! I appreciate when a game gives you interesting decisions and Armello does just that. There are 4 different victory types but only 1 winner, breaking the possibility for a runnaway leader. One improvement which many board games have incorporated is alternate turn order to prevent unbalance based on when you go in a given round.The game looks good, plays good, and has my heart. Would definitely recommend.			"

												Armello is an online multiplayer board game (although there's an offline single player option against AI, too) set in the Kingdom of, you guessed it, Armello, ruled by a mad lion king who's infected with Rot. It's your job--as one of eight (twelve with DLC) heroes from one of the four clans--to reclaim Armello by winning the throne, however you choose to do that. You can kill the king with pure strength or healing spirit stones, gain the most prestige in the land to usurp him when the time comes, or become even more corrupted than he is.The gameplay itself is based predominantly on dice and cards: cards grant you skills or bonuses on the field or in battle, while dice are rolled in battle itself to determine your attacks and defence. Of course, this means that luck--or the RNG--can disadvantage you, even in your starting hand, and the AI can utilize rings and tokens (which modify your character's stats during a game) that you have to unlock. In the couple of games that I've played thus far, I've felt a little as if the AI had more opportunity than I did, but I was still able to win.My only real complaint would be that, although beautiful (as is the rest of the game's graphics), the maps are fairly similar and feel a little small to me. I'm sure this is to keep the game moving and to force players into conflict, but it's a little annoying when you're trying to get to a certain square and all of your possible movements are blocked or risky to take. The game rules themselves are customizable, but not so much the maps.I would definitely recommend Armello if you enjoy a mix of strategy-based board games (with a hint of luck thrown in there thanks to dice rolling!). It's a beautiful game with a simple but clear story that wouldn't be out of place in Brian Jacques' Redwall series, and it's entertaining to play.			"

												I really like it, as a big fan of Redwall and Miyazaki films and board games. It's really pretty with beautiful animations that ooze character, and easy to learn, and tough to master. There's a nice element of randomness that keeps it fair for people of all skill levels and makes it fun to come back and hope to see new things.So yes, I'd recommend it. That said, I have to complain about the fact that this is a ""board game"" where people can't have local co-op or hot-seat multiplayer; everyone has to have a separate computer and copy of the game to play, which is tough to organize and pay for. I would, for instance, really like to play this with my brother's family (my nephew would love Barnaby), but sixty more dollars for three more copies is prohibitive. I was also looking forward to playing this with college friends and their children, and can't, which saddens me. For a ""board game"" this makes very little sense to me.On a related note, please note that chat in multiplayer in this game is limited to a set of canned responses. I understand why this would be done (moderating chat is tricky) but it makes it near impossible to discuss strategy with other players, which can be unsatisfying when another player takes your ""Greetings"" as a threat rather than the intended friendly gesture and decides to hit you with an Immolation.Despite these absent features, it's still worth checking out, and I don't regret buying it, but those features would make it absolutely perfect.

No two games are the same but after about 35+ games under my belt each averaging 45 mins. to an hour.You start seeing the same strategies applied when it gets to end game . The game is defintly worth buying for sure-Pros*Replayable*Great artwork*Great sound track*Gameplay feels balanced*many charaters to choose (more coming)*Fun politics*Challenging but in a good way*Decent AI-Cons*I've had my multiplayer games get stuck on some of the dice battles (happened maybe 3 times)*I'm not sure if its just me but the frames drop occasionally nothing gamebreaking though*After playing with all the cards im left wanting more (you don't really notice it at first but when you see how many cards there are you are just left wanting more)There is nothing I can think of that would not make me reccomend this game . With what little cons I have seen and more content on the way I cant wait to see whats in store. If you would like someone to play with just add me up :) .			"

It is not what a longtime gamer would consider a traditional RPG in any way, shape, or form. Great graphics and animation.Highly recommended if you have a group of friends that are willing to purchase and play with you. Its still enjoyable as a single player game and the computer seems to play fairly (something that doesn't always happen with electronic board games) but I feel it is much more enjoyable when playing with other players, especially people you actually know.

												I realized I've sunk over 400 hours into Armello and never bothered to review it... probably because I was too busy playing Armello!Armello is a digital board game where you quest to improve your hero's stats, with the ultimate goal being to overthrow the king with one of four victories (prestige, combat, spirit stones, or rot). Given that there are decks of cards and dice rolls, there is quite a bit left to chance, but there is also a LOT of strategy involved. The game requires equal amounts of planning several turns ahead and improvising.Having been playing since the beta (or alpha?), I've benefitted from learning each component of the game as they were gradually implemented, but for a new player it could all possibly be overwhelming. The basics are fairly easy to grasp, but there's a lot of deeper gameplay to master. There's a brief tutorial and also single player bot matches for practicing, but the best way to learn is to dive on in! You're going to lose your first few matches, but stick with it!If all that hasn't scared you off, then you're going to enjoy it!See you in Armello!			"

												If you love those interesting tabletop board games, then you'll enjoy this game.Armello is an original digital media IP that has everything you'd expect from physical board games!Bottom line: Do I enjoy this game? Do I think its mechanics work well?Yes.I've played all 4 of the prologue (tutorial) chapters, and also played 4 regular games. I enjoyed playing, and each game was a bit different since the map is semi randomized, each character has different strengths, there's various quests to choose from when you start or complete a quest, and there's several different win conditions.The art in the game for the cards is very cool. Each of the cards has some little bit of animation like blinking/shifting eyes, or a forest whooshing by as a person runs through it, or a bit smoke moving. The art style of this game is wonderfull, but you can see that in the screenshots.The rules/mechanics:It has its own 6 sided die with symbols instead of numbers.It has 8 different characters, each with a unique special passive ability and slightly different stats. This means each character will play a bit different as one might be better at battle, but another might be able to cast more spellcards or more expensive spells.Each character has 4 main stats:Fight- Determines # of die you roll during battle.Body- Essentially is your max HPWits- Determines # of die you roll during Perils, a negative event card played on a space you entered. It also determines your maximum card hand size. You draw to this amount each turn.Spirit- Essentially your max MP, you restore to this number each nightAll 4 of these are also used in quest challenges where 1 stat point x10 = % chance to succeed.You also gain/lose Gold used in equipping Item cards / hiring (equipping) follower cards or playing Trickery cardsThere's Prestige that you gain/lose through certain actions like completing a quest, and some few Trickery cards will cost Prestige instead of Gold. There's a thing that is basically your current MP for the day. Finally there's Rot. If you are infected by this, you lose 1 HP per day and there's other mechanics surrounding this. The king is infected by this setting the turn limit for the game.There's a card system as mentioned as well. There's Items (including equip-ables, one use, and followers), Spells which can be buffs / debuffs/ or even direct damage to other characters, and Trickery (You triggered my trap card, Yugi! Sorry I'm unoriginal). Trickery cards most of the time are played as traps that can be set on certain tiles and when anyone enters that marked space they must pass a challenge by rolling the # of die equal to their Wits.There's a bit more to the game but that's basically it.The king is dying and mad (crazy/evil) due to Rot infection. You must have the highest Prestige when he dies to win, or you can kill him yourself and become King/Queen, or you can gather 4 sacred stones and attempt to cure the king and the land of Rot.			"

								Never really been into board games, and despite this, I love Armello and consider it one of my favorite games. It's fun, strategic, and beautifully detailed. The atmospheric visuals and music really draw me into the world, and the cards are gorgeously illustrated and animated. It's hard for me to pick a favorite hero since they're all well-balanced, have great designs, and deep backstories. The heroes have different stats and abilities which can end up being helpful, but this doesn't mean they have to use a certain strategy in order to win.			"

Do I think its mechanics work well?Yes.I've played all 4 of the prologue (tutorial) chapters, and also played 4 regular games. I enjoyed playing, and each game was a bit different since the map is semi randomized, each character has different strengths, there's various quests to choose from when you start or complete a quest, and there's several different win conditions.The art in the game for the cards is very cool. Each of the cards has some little bit of animation like blinking/shifting eyes, or a forest whooshing by as a person runs through it, or a bit smoke moving. The art style of this game is wonderfull, but you can see that in the screenshots.The rules/mechanics:It has its own 6 sided die with symbols instead of numbers.It has 8 different characters, each with a unique special passive ability and slightly different stats. This means each character will play a bit different as one might be better at battle, but another might be able to cast more spellcards or more expensive spells.Each character has 4 main stats:Fight- Determines # of die you roll during battle.Body- Essentially is your max HPWits- Determines # of die you roll during Perils, a negative event card played on a space you entered. It also determines your maximum card hand size. You draw to this amount each turn.Spirit- Essentially your max MP, you restore to this number each nightAll 4 of these are also used in quest challenges where 1 stat point x10 = % chance to succeed.You also gain/lose Gold used in equipping Item cards / hiring (equipping) follower cards or playing Trickery cardsThere's Prestige that you gain/lose through certain actions like completing a quest, and some few Trickery cards will cost Prestige instead of Gold. There's a thing that is basically your current MP for the day. Finally there's Rot. If you are infected by this, you lose 1 HP per day and there's other mechanics surrounding this. The king is infected by this setting the turn limit for the game.There's a card system as mentioned as well. There's Items (including equip-ables, one use, and followers), Spells which can be buffs / debuffs/ or even direct damage to other characters, and Trickery (You triggered my trap card, Yugi! Sorry I'm unoriginal). Trickery cards most of the time are played as traps that can be set on certain tiles and when anyone enters that marked space they must pass a challenge by rolling the # of die equal to their Wits.There's a bit more to the game but that's basically it.The king is dying and mad (crazy/evil) due to Rot infection. You must have the highest Prestige when he dies to win, or you can kill him yourself and become King/Queen, or you can gather 4 sacred stones and attempt to cure the king and the land of Rot.			"

												Armello did something for me that no other game has been able to do effectively. It made tabletop strategy seem accessible and fun for me. The tutorial does its job well. The way it presents the various gameplay concepts, staggered through different characters to show different approaches to the game, really helped make the ideas stick. While Armello has some fairly complex aspects to it, I was never left feeling intimidated as I often am by other games in this genre. The art style is gorgeous and I feel this is one of the most beautiful games I've played in a long time. Despite basically being pawns on a board, each hero has its own distinct personality, which I personally find necessary for a game to be engaging and to have any longevity.Though I'm only a few games in and can't comment on it at length, I do like the inclusion of a progression system. Being able to unlock items for my characters that allow me to alter their play style gives me more incentive to keep coming back. The pace of the game can be a bit slow at times, since you not only have to wait for other players' turns but also the king's guards as well as any banes that have emerged on the map, but I feel that's really a minor issue. Overall, I'm really happy with Armello so far and look forward to trying out the upcoming multiplayer ladder.			"

												This game deserves more attention from it's developers as the universe they created with this small game contains a lot of character. It's a fun universe to discover.After my 30'th hour playing I still have more unlockable to achieve however I wish I could unlock more, including Skins / Characters / Cards and more.The staleness of the game comes from the small maps and single game mode with single player and multiplayer options, leaving the desire for DLC game modes such as: Story Mode, Adventure, or even a co-op.The Decks used in the game seem shuffled in the beginning however because the decks can include a vast varity of cards it makes playing what can loosely be called a 'class' is difficult as there is no ~build a deck~ mode.I have been unsuccessful with contacting the developers directly in regards of the direction of the game or to leave feedback. I find this not normal for an indie developer.Lastly performance: I play on an i5-4300 machine (Surface pro 3 - 4 gb ram)The game is playable, manageable via touch inputs.The performance is not, feeling always at a low 20's in fps on low setting at any resolution it feels like there is a lot of un-optimized code. Testing this game on my Desktop rig caused the temp’s to climb to the high 60’s in a machine that can render starcitizen in the high 50’s.Overall 8/10			"

								Armello is a game that you can see the roots and passion for boardgames shine through. From the character traits to the perils you locate as you wander the 'board' you can feel the designers admiration and devotion to the tabletop genre. The art is beautiful. The trees manage to bring forth the feeling of dark and deep adventure, the dungeons do the same. Honestly the amount of atmosphere created from such little space is truly extravagant.  The attention to the detail is something you'll be noticing with each game you play. The only major drawback is that is falls short of enjoyment when wanting to play with strangers via the public games. There are very few people queued up to play and when you do play there is no way to communicate to each other. This means that the hilarity and competitive fun that you get when playing with friends is lost. If you are looking for a game that blends the polish of many modern day games and the mechanics of old style tabletop boardgames where the dice play a huge part but your strategy and wits is what truly separates you from your competitors then I'd recommend Armello 9 times out of 10.I would suggest inviting a few friends along for the fun though!

												I enjoy Armello quite a bit, and I've had my great moments, my dismal moments, and my meh moments over the course of time that I've put into this gem of a game. The world is beautfiul and aethestically pleasing, the characters diverse and full of life in their designs and battle animations, unique movements for each one I must say. And for those who enjoy lore, one can find it in the form of cards, quests, or a certain follower known only as the Stranger. He adds an interesting depth to the game, but I'll won't elaborate on him. Armello is a simple enough game to understand, but it's very difficult to truly master.Armello is a digital board game with hexagonal tiles that can favor those who have put a considerable amount of time into it, but it doesn't mean that said players, myself included, will win. I have been a part of many a game where someone with far less time won or ruined me, even though I was employing my knowledge of the game to try and win to the fullest. How did this happen you might ask? The answer is simple and is partly why I enjoy Armello so much. RNG. It will make or break your game depending on your dice rolls or on the cards you draw. Sometimes you get fantastic rolls or draws, others are terrible, and often they're a mix. The beauty of this is that it makes players think strategically about their moves on the campaign map, and how they can utilize their hero skills and the cards they've been dealt to the best that they can in order to win. Furthermore, when one is in battle or facing a peril, then they can burn a card provided it has a matching symbol, though the question is should one save a certain card for later or not. In terms of combat, it makes the player think about the risk versus the reward for killing a player or a bane; in that said hero could die, come out victorious and gain a prestige, or both combatants could die depending on the die rolls. What this means is that you can seek out combat or avoid it to the best of your abilities, and know that there are cards in the game that can increase your chance at a succesful combat by taking away health or delay an enemy player if they're pursuit. Provided RNG gives you said cards.Now, there are some factors that people claim are major issues with the game; one is the combat system attack die rolls, another is the comeback system after you die, and then there are those who claim some heros are more powerful than others. In all my hours of Armello, I have seen many a die roll that either brought me victory or ended those hopes. Now, it is true that there are four sides of the die that favor attack, three in reality due to two of these sides being dependent on the time of day. And, yes, there is only one shield side, but that shouldn't get your hopes down. Rather, it causes you to think and plan how you'll play a round. Now, you can have a massive hand of say 13 dice and you only get three defence from them, or you can get 10 defense sides from them. It's all dependent on RNG. I've seen many a battle that netted a massive amout of attack, or defence, or even rot (Much to the benefit or detriment of the player depending upon their current status) and I can say that although attack is favored by the die, that doesn't mean you'll get attack die. As I said, it's all dependent on RNG. Furthermore, if one is worried about defense, then there are plenty of defence item cards that grant automatic defense die without subtracting from your hand that can be aquired, provided you have the gold. Furthermore, you can burn cards with a defence symbol on them to boast your defense, though you must think tactically on the possible results and if they'll be better or worse.Now, there are those who complain that the comeback system is detrimental to players, but I say it causes one to rethink their strategies and pursue either the same old goal, or develop a new one to win. If you can't get to a quest because other players keep killing you, then change your tactics and focus on something else, say a dungeon or spirit stones. One does not need the quests to win a round in Armello, they simply provide benefits that increase your chance to win or even fail. I have lost plenty of games to people who never completed their quests but focused on other aspects of the game that caused them to win, be it rot, prestige, spirit stone, or combat victories. What's more, one can use this system to land them closer to their quest, if it's by their clan grounds, and that causes other players to think about the benefits or negative of killing a character in that sure you'll get prestige if you succeed, but what if it turns put you simply put them next to their quest which resulted in them winner. Choices, choices, choices.  Some people say that some of the heros in Armello are overpowered, and that is only true if you let them be overpowered. Otherwise they're in a similar boat you, the player. If you know how a certain hero works, then you can utlize the cards in your hand to either deny of benefit said hero if they are an opposing player. What's more, there is a certain cost in regards to supposed overpowered hero abilites in that there are certain restrictions on them that can easily break someone's attempt to win. Let's take Barnaby for example, his power allows him to add or remove item cards and not dispose of them as what happens to other heros. Problem is, the amount of cards Barnaby can hold is entirely dependent on his wit level, and the only way he can dispose of said cards, outside of two very early decrees, is either burning in a peril, or in battle. And that's not even counting if RNG grants him decent or good cards.Mulitplayer wise, Armello can either be quiet or bositerous depending upon the time of day and on how many people are playing. Granted, this is a bit of annoying area if you don't have friends or have not yet discovered the Unofficial Offical Armello community where one can often find a game instead of waiting a time for a random match. I will state that the vast majority of people who play in the random mulitplayer matches stay through to the end of a game, I rarely see someone quite because they couldn't do what they wanted, and most people who do leave simply DCed is all. Multiplayer Armello is utter joy with friends in that you can test your friendships, watch salt meters build, or determine which player RNG does not favor that round. One of my friends is noted for chasing the rest of us down if we are too annoying to him even if it means he's risking his attempt to win. One more little morsel of information for you to sample. The community of Armello is wonderful from what I have found and there is a place where you can meet fellow Aremllians for a possible game. What's more, you can have a chance to face the devs themselves in a game of Armello pretty much every Sunday at 6 PST/PDT depending upon the year. Perhaps we'll see some of you there, and if so, then good luck. If you've read down this far, then have some Bubble Tea or Hot Rot Wine on the house and know that I wish you a good time. In the end, only you can decide if Armello is right for you by playing it, trusting the word of others only gets you so far and is open to possibly damaging interpretations of a game.			"

								Here are some quotes that sum the game up better than i can.This is a hard game to categorize, but extremely fun to play. An RPG with board game and strategy game influence, a very unique combo! Great purchase."" - Original Traders Group.""Because it was made in Australia"" - Australian Made games.Now for my review bare in mind i haven't play thing game much. *don't know why really*Armello is hard to put in a group. It's a turn based RPG with boardgame elements while having a dash of card games in it's DNA. Some including myself have labled this game as Redwall (a fantasy novel series with animals as the characters) crossed with Game of Throne. Now this may not be fully accurate but that's the vide we get.Gameplay is simple. You have Action Points (AP) which is used as you move on a hex tile base. Combat is Diffrent, you can ""burn"" cards in your hand to get extra icons that either help or hinder you in the fight. Now for the cards. How many cards you get in a hand is based on your will. Cards are split in three groups. Items magic and a thrid one that's more will based. They either help you or hinder the enemy.The objective of a match is to usurp the throne. The king has taken ill and his illness is effecting his mind making bad descions. the Clans, Rabbit, Wolf, Bear and Rat(?)  belive that now is the time to take the throne. The king himself is had to beat early on but as his sickness goes on it weakens his health. His castel also has several trap/challanges you'll have to overcome in order to face him.Overall i'd give this game a 8/10 with my recommendation.			"

								This is by far one of the most creative games I have seen in a very long time.The rules are pretty difficult to understand at the start, but once you played the game for a bit (or read the ""Unofficial Game Guide"", it because a whole lot more clear.Apart from the game to look astonisching, the game's mechanics are creative and can cause for some fun tactics to be used against others. Remember the game is still in Early Access, the characters still require some more balancing and there are not a whole lot of variety in the cards. As a result the game as it is could become somewhat repeditive.			"

  Save your money, buy a better strategy game.  I've been playing this game for about 100 hours and I think it's time that I write my reviewFirst of all I'd like to say that this game is VERY RNG based, the only ""strategy"" there is to this game is knowing what the cards do, and even then drawing the right cards is based on RNG (you'll most likely draw a scouting card). I'd also like to point out how bad the tile placements are in this game, usually I end up getting 2 swamps next to 2 mountains  in the general area of my clan grounds completely blocking off one side of the board. On more than one occasion I've had 2 dungeons next to each other and ended up spawning 5 banes (3 of which I managed to roll for in their RNG based dungeon system and kill) and the last 2 just straight up spawned from the dungeons at night targeting me and ultimately killing me.Another thing I want to point out is how badly broken this game is, most of the time the game just freezes up when I enter the palace to find the king loosing about 45 minutes of gameplay this is VERY frustrating, another common bug is the Menu straight up not working, on occasion when it asks me to ready up the ready button dissapears kicking me into another lobby and punishing me for leaving the game because I couldn't ready up, even the main menu breaks to the point where i'm just stuck looking at a blurry background of the king sitting on his throne.Another issue I have with this game is the online lobby completely not working at all, when i play with my friends we all ready up and suddenly it just throws us out of our lobby swaping fast between multiple lobbies of people waiting to play the game (I have no Idea how they plan to implement ranked mode with the current lobby system being garbage).Finally I'd like to finish this by saying that I had high hopes for this game but ultimately it ended up just being next to just another shovelware game, maybe the developers will fix it but probably not, I see people on their forums complain to them and the usually they respond with a snarky comment followed by people whiteknighting them. All I can say to LoG is Maybe next time.			"

												Oh, Armello!  Shall I compare thee to a summer's night of Munchkin?  No?  Risk, maybe?  Dungeons and Dragons?  Alright, perhaps that's pushing it too far.  It is an excellent party game for up to four friends online and with a somber atmosphere and interesting level of lore and immersion.  Even if you're on the losing side, every game feels fun and compelling--the tables are always ready to turn and even in the face of utter hopelessness, you can always take on the role of a vicious saboteur.  Some will say it is too dependent on chance, but I would argue otherwise.  It is a game about choosing a path and then leveraging your odds.  Every move matters and it's possible to turn even a game fraught with terrible luck into a last-minute victory.  Game length varies a bit; single player games last me around an hour, but it's about twice that with friends.The King is corrupt and marching toward his death.  Take on the role of one of several heroes representing the clans of the kingdom, each with their own unique traits, tricks, and motivations for claiming his throne.  Will you play the pacifist and build rapport within the kingdom, elected to power when he inevitably succumbs to his sickness?  You could fight your way through the competition with guile and brawn to slay the monarch yourself, taking the castle by force, or perhaps the Rot has found a more powerful host in you and he is but your final meal before your dark ascension.  With so many paths to victory and the freedom to devise your own strategy, you're guaranteed to find plenty to explore within the world of Armello--especially when you adventure with friends.			"

												I'd really really love to love this game.... so I did.It's really pretty and I love strategy games that needs you to outsmart other people.It's also fun to stop a competitor's plan like slapping him in the face and saying ""NO!""My problems about this game is the fact that after going through the achievements, ring unlocks, every card identified, and every victory achieved, the game goes down hill. I still love this game, but the motivation to play got harder after unlocking almost everything. Which means I always look forward for new updates and features added in every update, but we all know it wont simply come whenever we want it.All-in-all, I love this game's style and gameplay. I doubt I will fully stop anytime soon.PS: Barnaby is bestPSS: Still waiting for BanditsPSSS: Keep up the great work LoG			"

												Engaging card or turn base strategy game, but with some teething issues with regards to multiplayer skirmish maps. You will control a Hero Avatar from 1 of the 4 main clan (Wolf, Rodent, Hare or Bear) in which you will strive to achieve victory (Different victory objectives) againts the Corrupt King. Game play is smooth and the controls are straightforward, was able to grasps the game by playing a few matches. Wide varity of cards, ranging from Equipement cards (1 use / Equiped to Avatar), Spell Cards (Uses magic points to cast instant spells to aid your hero's objectives), Trickery Cards (To saboutage / diplomatical achieve your hero's objectives), Treasure cards (Powerful item obtains from completing quest and challanges around the map), and Follower Cards (A trusty sidekick with useful abilities). By using the different cards with your hero, you have to complete quest to clear victory objectives before your opponent to win the game. With New DLC unlocking new heros and cards there is sufficent replayability at the moment.			"

												Oneshot, Mad King.That's all I need.This game is a board game with eight different playable characters, each with their own unique ability and two to a single Clan, and can be played with friends or against bots as you quest to become the king or queen of Armello.If you hate RNG, just avoid this game.The game is heavily RNG-based, but heroes' passive abilities do work quite well, and the difficulty of the four victories varies. Prestige is easiest while Rot is hardest in my own experience. My only problem with the game is that it has a severe reliance on praying to RNGesus that whatever is happening goes in your favor. I'm honestly writing a review way sooner than I should be (11.5 hours upon writing this review) but so far I enjoy the game.Definitely a 4/5 to me, one of the games that I feel deserves an attempt at one of my few serious reviews.

												Really good game but the developers are abusing the steam market and their power in many instances.You can buy and sell dice in the market for which reason the devs decided that games between 4 friends will not drop chests/keys thus  you cannot play with 3 other friends to get the dice but you can play with 2 other friends and abuse the poor 4th person who will play against you.

												UPDATE:11/18 -  My feeling and opinion on the game itself have not really changed from what I wrote before. I still find the game to be underwhelming and the enjoyment of it disproportionate to the love I see it getting. However, the community on the whole here has been EXCELLENT. I mean I have been pretty adamant (though respectful) in stating my opinions and I have to say with one or two excepetions the reaction has been civil. That does not happen on the internet. Except for here apparently. So if you are okay with taking the community health into consideration I am actually gonna go ahead and say I would Recommend this and move up my rating to a...5.1/10I also have to take into consideration that my expectations for the tile may have been too high. More frustarting is that many other people that like simliar games seem to be completely satisfied with the experience and delivery. Its pretty unusual that I wind up an outlier in satisfaction when I am (or felt like I was) a part of the core demographic. Armello seems to be enjoyed by people like me. I barely enjoyed it for 5-6 hours before I found myself searching for reason to like it but I just can't quite figure it out. Anyway if your on the fence I say give it a shot. 11/9 Was pleased to see that with the new update the speed of the AI controlled players was adjustable. I would have to say that experience for singlplayer has been streamlined and improved dramatically. Sadly, I still did not enjoy the game. I only realized this after playing for another few games and realized I was searching for reasons to switch this game to a recommend.In response to Kletian's comments to my review:I agree that picking your deck can influence the outcome however there are just too many random variables that are outside of your control. Is this game strategically superior to chutes and ladders? Absolutely. Risk? Not even close. Monopoly? Probably the best comparison. The random or uncontrolled variables in this game include:3 other players turns1 King turn (King's Guards)Banes TurnPlacement of Quest MarkesCard Draw (Mitigated by choice of card type but still random)Dice RollsBoard ConfigurationThat's alot of randomness to contend with. I am in no way opposed to RNG or believe that it should be a left out of any serious strategy game. However the way this game is structured leaves little room for interesting choices as the game evolves. The randomn elements seem to dictate the way you should be steering your strategy and trying to go in another direction is almost always going to put you in the losers bracket. Armello offers you choices in your strategy but the design of the game itself hamstrings you into playing one way or the other and its just a tough pill for me to swallow.The game is still gorgeous and I agree with Kletian's comments that game is more similiar to Rouge-likes in progression type. However, I would argue that old-school rouge-likes rewarded you for measuring chances and taking risks which is something I found lacking in my time with Armello. The end result was that were often (not always) rewarded for taking those risks to gain advantages and overcome challenges. In Armello you are rewarded for understanding which path to victory is most likely to be successful and than gearing your startegy towards acheiving that goal. Abberations to this formula do exists but they seem far to infrequent and unintentional to be considered a part of the strategy.For a game that involves startegy and measuring risk I would recommend Chaos Reborn.I would take a pass on Armello unless you really love the art and animation (both are excellent).5/10OG REVIEW:I have very mixed feelings for this game. I'll keep this review short and update it as I play for longer.Current Playtime: 6-8 hours (5 games total on a friends account during early access)Pros- Original and creative concept for a game- Ran Smooth on low spec computer with med graphics setting- No bugs encountered - Beautifully Crafted World (card art and animation are my personal highlights)- Limited Game Modes at Launch (ranked coming soon per forum post)AC/DC-RNG Heavy from a double down effect of having card draws and dice rolls as random factors-Universal Card Selection (no deckbuilding element if you are expecting a more typical CCG experience)Cons-Repetition of Game Board Means it all looks the same after awhile-Some progression exists but a overall a little light on the RPG element promised-Balance - Several ways to win a game but two of these are extremely difficult to achieve-Long playtime for each game especially Multiplayer-RNG + Balancing Issues + Long Playtimes = Frustrating ExperienceEven shorter review: 3-5 hours: Sweet! An Online Digital Board Game with RPG progression.5-8 hours: Slooow Moving Game (3 turns other than yours to contend with) and disappointed to find that a strategic approach is smaller element is secondary to dice rolls/card draws.I will keep playing as I still love the premise and several of the issues I have with this title have been acknowledged and are being worked on by the developers. Priced out at $20 US dollars in its current state I am going to have to give it a thumbs down for the time being.			"

Early Access Review
								Been following this game's development for a while, and after getting my hands on the early access (finally) I can see that everything is as it should be.I'm a huge board gamer, and this game's tabletop roots show through. But the developers went a step further here, and took advantage of the game engine to mediate things in ways no tabletop experience could replicate as smoothly. This not only takes all the boring round by round management, tracking, upkeep, and calculating out the experience, but allows for hidden movement, trap placement, and other subtle elements that would not be possible at a table.Because of this, the developers made a REALLY smart move by allowing Armello to be played at a table with a single device, because at its heart, Armello is still a board game, and being able to play it face to face will enhance the experience tenfold. I cannot wait til September when the full version comes out, and I can sit down with my family and friends, a few beers, and have an evening of Redwall-styled treachery and high-adventure.			"

												Wonderfully designed video board game. Games are a predictable length (30-60 minutes), and always tense. The art style is absolutely top notch. I recommend this game to all my friends looking for a great casual game, and those who love board games in general.			"

												Pro:The game is cute with appealing graphics, numerous heroes with different abilities. The tutorial explains stuff quite nicely.Con: Solo Player Mode   *gets boring - well, no surprise. Multiplayer Mode   *takes forever to gather people which are then afk and you start the gathering from the beginning.  *when you dc while a game is going on, you can't reconnect - no rewards, loads of time lost.  *often nothing happening because characters are in stealthTo be more precise: This game is most fun in Multiplayer Mode but you have to have some time for it: 20+ Minutes for gathering people, ~2 Hours for the actual game.

Early Access Review
								Man, I actually regret not backing this on Kickstarter now. I wanted to because the art style and unique Bedknobs and Broomsticks-esque fantasy setting is definitely of a high caliber, but watching the gameplay videos it just looked slow and honestly quite boring. As soon as I began playing I immediately realized that was not the case. This smooth turn-based strategy game may be infinitely less complex than a lot of the bigtime 4X games, but I think that's actually to its benefit (and mine). The mechanics and four different victory conditions centered around the King are particularly interesting.I'd like to see some diversity added to the Banes (AI minions that spawn on the map) and I'm generally not a fan of anything being dictated by dice rolls, but overall this is already a very solid and polished game. I'll have to play more before the cracks start to show through, but the quality of the game as is and the dev team seem to indicate any major issues will be addressed over the course of the six month Early Access.

												Love this game!  Always been a big board gamer, and have played a lot of Talisman with friends.  Armello is the perfect balance between RNG and strategy.  Sure there is dice rolling (beautifully rendered dice rolling), but you DO have to weigh the chances of success over those of failure, and then go for it if feasible.  Sometimes you win, sometimes not.   So much charm in the characters, and different strats for each one.  You move, play cards, equip items on your own turn, but you can also strategize on your off turn, look at other players, and play cards to thwart them.  I also love the chat lines for each character, keeps the multiplayer civil and adds a delightful flavor to the game.  The endgame is fantastic, sometimes you've cleared all your quest to gain automatic entry into castle, other times you have to knock out another player, and still other times you sit with that banish card in hand to protect your prestige lead, a lot of paths to victory to contemplate, always tense!  To top this off, the developers challenge you to play them each week on Twitch, and they are such a fun group of people!  Join me in multiplayer!			"

												I have played a couple of single player games to learn the mechanics. and 15-20 multiplayer games.  Some of those have been with friends and some solo and all of them have been fun.Pros:-8 characters (more on the way?) with different skills and playstyles-Multiple win conditions 3 fairly easy ones and 1 that is kinda difficult to set up if you want to give yourself a challenge-If you can't win play the spoiler and just mess with others for fun.   Winning doesn't appear to give you anything other than some steam achievements so losing does feel bad just have fun playing.-Fairly quick queues for a game only once have i had to wait more than 2 minutes-Looks great graphically.Cons:-Disconnects and freezes have happened 4 out of 20ish games (couple times friends DC, once game just wouldn't roll dice, and once another player DC, then the other two DC and i had 3 AI in the game).  If the game gets stuck and doesn't progress you don't get the chest/key at the end.-No ranked yet (hope its coming soon)-Playing against a group of 3 in solo queue is fairly awkward when 3 work together. 1 person clearing out the castle and moving away so the player with the stones can just walk in and kill the king while the other 2 play bodyguard just isn't all that fun.   has happened a couple of times.Overall the game is very good and certainly worth the pickup.  Reminds me of Talisman a bit and can see where the inspiration could have come from and thats not a bad thing.			"

												I backed Armello on kickstarter (something I almost never do) based purely on the visuals, and boy am I glad I did. Aussie devs League of Geeks have done a exemplarary job - even the earliest build was a great deal better than most finished games, and they have continued to polish and refine the game, and built a thriving community of Armello enthusiasts that they have really listened to - this is kickstarter done RIGHT.The final release reflects that polish, with love and attention to detail oozing from every pixel. It's unique mix of turn based strategy with RPG and card game elements is backed up by lush, Studio Ghibli inspired visuals, gorgeous music and inspired (and in multiplayer excceptionally devious) gameplay. There's a engaging story - a mad king, a kingdom under threat from the Rot, and now eight playable heroes attempting to either hold the kingdom together, take it over or destroy it. Each hero is unique, can equip different gear, and hold traps, hard won followers or spells for battle against the opposing players - some cards can not just snatch victory from defeat but change the nature of the game or the victory conditions if played well. Combat is via nicely animated dice rolls (themselves modifyable by the cards in hand) and often deadly - it's not uncommon for two heroes to kill each other in the same bout, there's the creeping horror of the Rot to fight (or allow it to possess you) and then there's the mad King with his strange edicts affecting all players who eventually will destroy the Kingdom if players allow it. Multiple victory conditions abound here, and the wily player may need to change their overall tactics multtiple times in a single play through.The single player game against AI oponents in engaging enough, but it's in multiplayer that Armello truly shines. there are some utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moves available to the canny player, and interplayer communication, while cleverly limited, is more than enough to form (and break at a opportune moment) alliances. New players are well catered for, with excellent tutorials, and Armello is one of those rare games that's relatively easy to pick up but difficult to master. Cross platform support (it's available on PC and PS4 at launch, with ios and android coming) means you'll never lack for oponents. With it's sheer beauty, devious tactics and engaging gameplay Armello offers something different, and the incredible beauty of the game is made more astonishing by the fact it was created by such a small team - only 5 people who literally risked everything to bring the game to life. League of Geeks have to date offered unparalleled support, and knowing their devious minds I imagine ther'll be more than just tweaks and bug support in the future - the premise certainly lends itself to further expansion in the form of new heroes, extra cards snd perhaps bigger DLC.If you're a fan of board games, story driven RPG or strategy it's a must purchase - even for those who are more into other genres should definitely give this a go. I really can't recommend this superb game highly enough.  "

												If you like boardgames, or you just want to try a good one here on Steam, I suggest adding Armello to your wishlist.Here is a small list of the things I appreciate the most, that may help you decide if it's worth your interest:. different ways to win (adapt your strategy as you play). characters and stats modifiers (lot of combinations to experiment with) . dice (in great quantity with nice skins and effects). cards (to equip, use or ""burn"" before dice rolls to mitigate results). missions (to upgrade your stats, get better equipment and find followers). rules alteration (game changes if you are corrupted or not). prestige points mechanic (if you have the most you can influence the game). hand management, area control, stealth mechanics. random board generation, great art and nice soundtrack. well... there is more, but I think you should experience it ;DI find in Armello a great variety of elements I enjoy, so I keep coming back for more. I like trying a different strategy everytime and the fact that other characters will be added, definitely keeps my interest high. You can't play it hotseat, but that's because some mechanics don't make it possible. Even if I'm not playing with friends, my online experience is totally fine (no one ever left the game or purposely made the game end faster). If you have problems finding opponents, just keep an eye for special events organized by the LoG devs. Have fun Armellians!			"

												Pretty disappointing.I'm a big fan of board games, and was recommended this by a video reviewer I put good faith in.The game is gorgeous, and has a lot of charm, however the gameplay just doesn't hold up.Maybe it's because I listen to a lot of podcasts on game design, but this game was a fail. There's way too much luck involved, and most strategy you can conjure up hardly matters. The first two games I played I just happened to win because I was doing quests and playing cards when I could. A good game boils down to making interesting decisions, but when playing this game there's very few to be had. Most of it doesn't even matter. Do I pick the quest that gives me a 30% chance to get a Spirit stone and a spirit that I won't use, or do I pick the quest that gives me a not useful companion that gives the health I'll probably need? Do I win by killing the king because I happened to get some rot cards and died to the birds? Or do I kill the king because I got lucky enough to get two spirit stones from the dungeons and it was super easy to get the rest? It's just horribly dull.Gameplay boils down to. ""Pick a character, use amulets/rings to give them small advantages."" This gives you the illusion that there's strategies to explore, but in actuality it ends up more like this: Go to quest. Hopefully get something good out of it, or don't 'risk' it. (But good luck having any sort of a chance if you don't.) Explore dungeons, get random stuff, or don't. Get into fights. Win/Lose them depending on what equipment you happened to get and how lucky you were on your rolls. Someone on the board gets enough Rot/Spirit Stones/OP equips to kill king. Very little you can do to stop them. They fight the king and usually win. Sometimes they'll die in the process and someone else who did nothing all game will win instead. Game's over.I hope more people explore the interesting design space there is in a digital board game in the future, but this game felt like all style and not substance.If you're looking for a super casual game and have a high tolerance for swingy gameplay to play with a few buddies, then this is the game for you.If you want something anything deeper than that, look elsewhere.2.5/5			"

												Armello can be overwhelming at first, given all the options you have in the game, but once you understand the core mechanics, you can develop different strategies for it. Luck also plays a part, but it's not the most important aspect, as you can change your strategy depending on what is happening on the board and how your opponents play. I highly recommend this game, every time I play it, there's a different story developing, a story which is rich and unique everytime.			"

At the end of the evening the only thing we could do was speak in predefined sentences.The game has enough to offer in tactics and achievements to keep you comming back for another game.It is a game that i lost many times. a few times because of back luck and a hatefull RNG and a few times because of bad decisions. But the most memorable sessions where the ones that, against all odds, i snatched away victory in the last rounds with some good planning, a hail Mary and lady luck rolling the dice.Ahhh those victories. With only two quests done and three hitpoints left, slaying the king and grabbing a Rot victory. You should have been there to know the excitement.Oh, and it has ingame colletable dice to.			"

												Great casual game with a surprising amount of depth. Can be enjoyed from a surface level or by diving into the strategy element for more depth. RNG can be a bit frustrating at times and an unlucky roll can often determine the outcome of the game. I bought the game on sale and have been pleasantly surprised with the amount of replayability. Being able to queue for multiplayer games while playing single player is nice, however I wish there was more customization in online play. As it is, it's hard to say the $20 price tag is for everyone, but with future updates to online play, more playable characters and cards, and possibly more game modes, this game will be a must have for fans of strategy and card games.

												A throwback to a seemingly-forgotten era of involved strategy. Upon hearing about the game I was immediately interested, as the subject matter reminded me of some of the earlier tabletop games I played. An interesting, albeit macabre story, revolving around a slowly decaying kingdom, and a king falling deeper into madness due to a strange and malevolent force known as ""The Rot"" gives the players a sense of urgency and purpose, in saving or destroying the kingdom, depending on what you do. And the multitude of ways the game can end gives each new game a sense of novelity and uniqueness that is somewhat gone in mainstream gaming nowadays. I definitely recommend you pick this up right now.			"

												This game is awesome!Armello is a board-type game with emphasis on the long game. The game's graphics and art style are incredible, with every card having a little animation bound to it and every character flaunting a personality without needing to say a word!The game shines when it comes to the long game. Stats that players have focused on for the entirety of the match often turn tables when it comes to the endgame, and gunning for repeated 'little victories' often ends badly. This is especially well done with the oddly satisfying combat animations, where you can see your plans play out perfectly.A frustrating part with this game is that it's very possible to be uttlerly screwed by RNG. If you're essentially untouchable, there's always some ridiculous 'win game' card that seems to apply to different scenarios of nearing victory.I'd get it if you don't mind being blue-shelled in Mario Cart; pretty much every game is memorable.

												This review was written on the day of the 1.3 patchSo I've had armello for a while, and not really played it much, and there's a pretty good reason for that.Until patch 1.3, there was no real random lobby presence for multiplayer matches. With 1.3, you now get chests and keys to unlock... *drum roll* dice skins.It's a little lackluster, but hey, some people are into it.For the game it'self, it's a fun boardgame. The art design and style in general is amazing, the rules are pretty solid (if still being tweaked) and games tend to last 30 mins to an hour, which is pretty solid.If you're thinking of buying it my advice would be to try and grab it on sale. Sorry LoG, but it's true.This game is Ok on single player.Pretty good on multiplayer (now wait times are down)and I hear it's great if you have enough friends for a full game (R.I.P. the 4 pack T_T)If you're still on the fence, LoG has been teasing more characters, and eventually iOS support along with even MORE characters (woo, bandit clan), so maybe wait for that.But yeah, if you're into stuff like Talisman, but want a shorter game, pick up this cross between Wind in the Willows and Game of Thrones.If you're more into Gears of war... what are you even doing here reading this? shoo!

												I've been playing this game on and off throughout it's release, and I have to say - it's a rather well developed game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves a good board game while having great graphics and storyline at the same time.There's a class of character for any style of player, and replay is very high.With the new addons and graphical enhancements - the game keeps getting better!Nominated this one for a Game Award.

												An excellent game that just keeps getting better.I have been playing this game with friends online for months now.  The games last about an hour, and are filled with cute, furry animals, backstabbing galore, and engaging strategy.  While frustrations can arise and luck can turn decidedly against you, we've found that even characters who suffer crippling misfortune early on can (and often do) bounce back to take the win.  However, you need to know your strategy, because a bad choice can lose it for you even when you are ahead.The nature of the game and relatively short duration of the matches allows players who normally have trouble with competatively backstabby games to enjoy this, making it a game we all have fun with.The multiple paths to victory make for a lot of fun.  You always have to keep an eye on the other player's progress towards other victory types even as you pursue the one you have chosen, and you often find yourself trying to keep as many paths open to you as you can.The game is cute as hell.  The characters are adorable.  And the fights are a lot of fun.  (I'll admit, I have spent an unreasonable extra amount on skins for characters and dice just to customize.  I don't play with random online groups, so I am not concerned about getting them through random drops.  It's easy enough to just buy exactly what you want in the steam community.)Instead of interest waning over the last couple months, we find ourselves still playing regularly and eagerly looking forward to content updates.  (We all can't wait for the eventual release of the Bandit Clan!)The only complaint that we have had is the occasional difficulty in first connecting to a group game.  Sometimes, one of the players will have to restart Steam and be re-invited in order for their connection to be stable enough to start the game.  But that is an extremely minor inconvenience, and once the game starts, everything is fine.  I know that those playing random online groups have had lag or connectivity issues, especially when the group includes people on opposite continents.  But if you have friends on Steam, I find there is no need to look to random groups to play.			"

												Flowery review:I would have a hard time distilling what about armello makes it so great. There is the enchantingly crafted art style, the beautiful music, the fun varied strategies of differing hero's and victory types, it seems to really have it all. The only fault I find is that it is such a complete package and yet you are left simultaneously satisfied with the experience, and wanting more. Nuts and bolts review:Armello is a digital board game,  unlike most of its kind it seems distinctly aware that it is in fact digital and takes such advantage of its medium from the animated battles to the day/night cycle of turns, they really knew what they were doing with the tools afforded them. That said the game is not without fault mainly your problems will arise from sometimes excruciatingly long queue times to the fact that if a player disconnects for any reason there is no way to rejoin the game you were in. These slights are unfortunate and like many board games matches run for around an hour so you have to allot time to play a match and really hope you don't have any issues towards the end of a particular session or else you can lose all that time you spent. There is also an element of luck involved with winning in any particular match and some of the victory types are easier to achieve than others, however the variety they afford the games strategy overshadows the seeming unbalance of their ease. Pros:- music, art, and subjectively gameplay  are extraordinary- masterful execution of a digital board game taking advantage with animations and even important functions like the day night cycle that just couldn't be replicated on a traditional tabletop.- wonderful game to play with friends.Cons: - connection issues while not extremely common can really be a big bummer.- there is a fair amount of luck involved in actually winning the game.- speaking of winning some victories are far easier to achieve than others.- queue times can be abysmal at times added to the fact that matches run long and it could take one and a half to two hours to get from queue to finishing a match.ps. I don't normally write reviews more than a couple sentences long so I am aware this is a little disjointed and not the best but this game really deserves a longer explanation in my opinion let that serve as a recommendation in and of itself.

												Imagine the Game of Thrones taking place in the world of Zootopia. Lie, bribe, and plunder your way to claim the throne. In the world of Armello, the end justifies the means.Pros: Armello provides you with 8 unique heroes, each with their own traits and playstyle, and 4 winning conditions. This makes the game balanced to each hero (provided you play your hero to their strength) while giving the game an excellent replayability value. Tutorial is decent, covering the basic gameplay without spoiling the gameplay too much.Cons: Lack of story/singleplayer campaign might be appaling to those who play games for their storyline.			"

												This game is fun, it has pretty visuals and graphics, an outstanding soundtrack and very addictive gameplay that will keep you playing for hours even when you are not the winner of the game because there are some worthy unlockables on the game for better experience. You enjoy every turn and have to make thought decisions in order to become the King/Queen, also the game needs a little balance specially for River and Braun and to fix some other little details on the game like the cards text because sometimes they are not readable at all and some actions happens to fast on the game and the camera doesn't foucus at the right time.I have already played some games on PS4 and just started the PC version, the experience is almost the same with the PC version being better with the controls so I highly recommend this to any gamer that likes board games and stretegy games.

												This game makes a fantastic first impression but (as detailed in so many other reviews) it becomes quickly apparent that the influence of random chance is so strong in the game that the experience is more like spectating than playing. Other elements - which could be interesting if truly random - are frustratingly predictable, such as the quest tile appearing at pretty much the opposite side of the board from where you are (apart from the first quest), meaning you're endlessly trekking rather than responding to interesting chance. I could say more, but there are so many reviews which have covered the ground.This could have been such a great game.			"

												I really wanted to like this - it's gorgeous, generally well-polished, and I really like the idea of a strategy game where you only have one character (avoiding the usual problem with something like Civilization, where turns get longer until the game isn't fun).Unfortunately, the strategic depth just isn't there.  The game has harsh coin-flippy rewards and a terrible snowballing potential, meaning your result on the first challenge (where it is most like a coin flip) determines the course of the rest of the game.  This, and some of the supporting systems, lead to the best strategy being to simply stack your highest stat as high as possible.  Three of the four stats eventually lead to a massive pile of prestige, which lets you win by default a few turns before any of the other victory conditions are possible (without extreme luck).  Better balance between the victory conditions would help, but ultimately the problem is that the game's randomness can only be steared when you're ahead.There are other problems with the game - cards are samey, lots of useful information is animated away before it can be read, and the UI has some serious rough edges (burning cards has a pile of issues, in particular).  But the core problems with the strategy are what kill it.			"

												90+ hours in and it still hasn't disappointed. Granted, I have really bad luck so the whole ""roll the dice"" thing usually doesn't work for me but this is fun even at that. If you've read other reviews then you know what I'm going to say next: I wish they'd let you chat with people. The character dialogue is cool but it would make multiplayer matches seem shorter if you could actually chat. Other than that this game is great. Certainly a game I would recommend to anyone.			"

			I check out Armello from League of Geeks which just released on Steam. This is a great RPG mixed without board game elements. I'm addicted to it right now!		

This game is a new addiction for me. The game has a surprising amount of layers to it's mechanics.Games last roughly up to 1 hour so it's a nice short table top feel. 4 possible victory conditions which you need to try and acheive while also hindering others as best you can. Combat is dealt with via dice but you can swing it in your own favour more by clever use of terrain, stealth, followers, equipment, spells and traps. The animations during combat are pretty damn beautiful. 8 characters currently in game (hopefully more in future) each with a special power you can make use of to help you find success. Love this game to bits worth every penny and highly recommended.  "

Everyone can win, everyone can loose.Players are really friendly too, thanks to all. This game deserve more... prestige !			"

												Was skeptical about getting this game about 5 months back, but then the steam summer sale came by and I decided to try it out, not many board like games come to interest for me. This one changed that, but this review isn't going to be a thumbs up for a handful of reasons.Pros:The game has a good tutorial on showing the mechanics of the game. (Compared to others I've played)It has various victory conditions which keeps it from being a dull (kill everyone else) game.Characters with different stats and equipment that can change the flow of the match in a single turn.And many others.They did not implement an actual chat system into the game. This is actually good because I'm sure you all know how kids online act when they can't get their way in a game. Instead, the chat in-game is by pre-set commands that can be used to praise a player for a good move or to warn players etc etc.Cons:When learning the game from a few AI matches, the AI doesn't seem overall challenging, they don't set many traps or use cards to boost themselves sometimes.Online matches will never be fun unless your playing with friends you know or they fix the current issue. For some reason online skirmishes allow you to invite your friends to fill slots if need be. This is what really breaks the game. In my case I had a 3V1 match because one player had 10+ Prestige, the other 2 players played most of their trap cards on me and prevented me from getting to quests by sitting near each other near it, but let the 10+ prestige player wonder about getting to dungeons to boost themselves. So the match ended with the prestige leader winning by favor of help. The game is good, but can be better with a few simple fixes, until then I can't give this game a good review because online matches is pretty much what this game is all about.			"

												I first noticed this game when it was up for a possible free PS+ game a number of months ago.  I voted for it without hesitation and have been telling myself to buck up and buy it ever since it didn't get the votes needed.    After purchasing the game and spending a few hours in it, I realized that I probably didn't know what everyone else knew when they didn't vote for it.I want to talk about the positives first.PROS:-Great graphical style.  This game really is beautiful in an indie game sort of way.-Brilliant setting.  I was immediately immersed in the setting and the world.  A pretty substantial feat for such a small game, with such little information.  I found myself wanting more and more setting and story information.-A unique take on the classic ""Talisman"" boardgame.-Variety of intriguing characters to play.-Variety of unlocks and gear to modify your charactersYou'll notice that nowhere in the ""PROS"" section was there anything to do with actual gameplay.  Gameplay is atrocious.  The sheer amount of lack of control you have is absurd.  You will spend the majority of the game just watching random terrible things happen to your character, that you have no control over, which can very easily chain react and spiral out of control.  The game also punishes you at every opportunity.  You get to draw cards at the beginning of your turns, up to a hand limit, but most of the time those cards are useless for both their icons and abilities.  You are also not able to simply discard cards.  You have to either use them or burn them (trading a die roll for a guaranteed result depicted on the card).  Which means that you will end up losing multiple ""Perils"" or events just to get rid of cards that you don't want, hoping to draw new good cards, and then invariably drawing more bad cards.  That is just one aspect of the game.  Let's look a possible sequence of events.  And when I say ""possible"" I mean common.-King presents two laws for the current leader to choose from (random)-Draw cards at the beginning of your turn from three different piles, of which none are useful to equip or burn (random)-Encounter a Peril in which you roll dice to succeed at (random)-Fail the Peril because it is a Wits challenge and you are a Fight character and don't roll well enough (random)-Get warped to the farthest Dungeon away from that Peril-Encounter the Peril on the Dungeon, in which you roll dice again (random)-Fail the peril and suffer the consequences-Encounter the Dungeon (which is essentially a die roll where you can get gold, treasure, a spirit stone, magic points, a parasite (that takes control of your character and moves it), or a ""Bane"" which is a Rot-stricken enemy.  End up with a Bane, from the die roll (random)-Get moved off the dungeon (possibly even further from where you were trying to go), because you encountered a Bane.-Bane attacks you and initiates Combat which is a bunch of dice rolls (random)-Lose the combat to be killed and warped back to your starting location.Seven of those steps heavily involve random draws or dice rolls, and that doesn't even include the random Quest attempts, and those steps that did not involve a random element were simply suffering the consequences of the previous random step.There are those who will defend this game saying that it is a board game and you can't do a board game without excessive random elements.  That's wholly and completely incorrect.  I am a boardgamer more than a videogamer with an absurd collection.  There are plenty of boardgames that reduce the amount of luck you have to endure in order to increase the amount of strategy you can use.Instead of dropping money on Armello, go take a handful of dice and throw them around your kitchen table for a while.  You will likely have more fun, have less wasted time and money, and can move onto something better.			"

Game is quite dim and brutal with lot of tactics and some luck, cute furries are just added content. Game looks like a board game with some uncommon mechanics (like invisibility at night), and plays like one. You play against 3 other players and try to win the throne. It is a solid mix of a tactical, card and dice game with elements of resources management. Includes loads of thinking and luck. Characters are well balanced, community is nice and devs are really into improving this game.			"

												A rich and rewarding creation from an independent studio that combines classic, dark intrigue with a setting not unlike Disney's Robin Hood.I backed this game from it's kickstarted inception and played a role in helping play-test and shape it and the rapid turnover for changes and fixes showed that the creators took it seriously.Even now, the game continues to be given improvemnts post-release. The artwork is vibrant, rich and beautiful, the character designs are diverse and interesting and the gameplay itself brings a fusion of RPG, cards and strategy that will always remain fresh thanks to a proceduraly generated board. It's easy to learn, fun to play and depending on your play style, you may find some characters more to your taste than others, but I highly recommend you play as all of the different characters!I recommend this game to anyone, be they hardcore sorts or casual, as it has something for everyone.

												I've gotta say, I was skeptical at first. I had never heard anything about this game before my friend sent me it as a gift, but when I installed it, played a few matches, I can say this is a really good game.The tutorial is fairly good at explaining the basics of the game. Though, it's kind of slow. Not saying that the pacing of it is bad (it might just be me), but I prefer being able to take a tutorial at my own pace, rather than a forced feeling of control on the game's part.Actual gameplay, this game is spectacular. I can't begin to describe the satisfaction (or mild amounts of grief) from your amounts of control. Just abvout every function is perfected. HOWEVER, this game isn't entirely skill-based. Sure, you'll need to know what to do and when, but you'll also have to cross your fingers for RNG-Jesus. It's the only downside, but not necessarily an entirely bad thing. It gives the lesser players a chance to shine, or lets the knowledged players dominate.tl;dr:qt Barnaby op plz nerf/10			"

												Armello, or Furry Chess, is a turn-based strategy game modeled on tabletop games of old. You'll find it whimsical and charming, I'm sure. STUFF WOT I LIKED AN' THAT  Lots of fun, nice variation of characters, eight in the base game and four more in the DLC. Plenty of replayability thanks to the characters, the unlockables and the new Custom Match option GORGEOUS art style, I honetly can't stress enough how beautiful this game is Nice integration of diceroll and card-based mechanics into the structure Perfect in terms of complexity: This game has enough depth to be continuously interesting and challenging without being as beardy and convoluted as games such as Civilisation. It's very easy to understand the basics. Tutorial is very well done, broken into four short, modified game sessions that introduce a character and a couple of key mechanics at a time. There's also a great guide to the gameplay available in game, even in the middle of a match. Sure beats having to pull up the wiki in a pinch. Doesn't drag on too long - The nature of the game means the timer runs down, so matches won't run on for hours on end. This is perfect for more casual players who don't want to dedicate three hours to one single playthrough,  like me Be warned, though, multiplayer matches will take a while longer. NOT SO GUD M8  Public multiplayer is a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥ Since there's such a tiny playerbase matchmaking can take a pretty long time sometimes. However, the devs were canny enough to pre-empt this, and you are able to play offline games while you queue Don't hold your breath for the Kickstarter DLC, since it's only going to be available when the mobile version launches... whenever that may be.Overall, I'd say this game is definitely worth your time, whether you're a fan of strategy games or not. It would make a good gateway into the genre, with its excellent balance of depth and simplicity. It's a very unique little game with a lot of charm and effort put into it, and it's obvious the devs really care about this game working.			"

												Armello is a beautiful but relatively simple board game.Armello excels in aesthetics and music but for some gamers (even tabletop gamers) the gameplay can be a bit lacking. How and if you win the game are heavily dependent on RNG. This can be very frustrating to players who want a more strategy based game.RNG determines the outcome of dice rolls, dice rolls determine the outcome of battles, battles determine the outcome of the overall game. To be fair, dice rolls can be manipulated by cards in your hand and by your equipped cards. However, what cards you get is up to RNG and you may end up with poor equipped items or a lack of the card type you desire for any particular battle. Also, the amount of cards you can hold is determined by your wit stat, which always seems to be lacking unless you are a rat (at which point you have very little of any other stat).Aside from RNG, my one qualm with this game is the speed. Waiting for turns to go through can be excruciating. While I recommend watching the characters (as you may find ways to trump them), there are times when all the characters are in stealth... So you will sit there, listening to them rummage around for a bit, waiting for your turn while almost nothing happens visually. I HIGHLY recommend turning on 'Quick AI Encounters' after your first game. This will speed up the turns quite a bit.There are 4 victories you are capable of attaining: prestige, kingslayer, spirit stone, and rot. By far, the easiest victory to attain is the prestige victory; it depends more on strategy than any other victory. Rot is the hardest victory to attain; it is highly reliant on RNG. If you are a completionist, or even just want to attain all the victory achievements, you will be kept busy for quite a while. However, if you are fine playing it once through, it will maybe keep you occupied an hour or two.I recommend the game if you like to fight against the odds and have decent luck with RNG.I do not recommend the game if you hate RNG dependent mechanics (for which there are many).

												A great little role playing strategy game with cute graphics, excellent mood music and lots of replayability including online multiplayer.Armello is a well designed game whose main game mechanic revolves around traversing a fixed map of varying terrain and obstacles with your player character.  It is a turn based game which allows you build deceptively complex strategy with a little bit of luck.  Any person familiar with table top role playing will understand the mechanics of Armello well.  Gain cards in your hand and play them with the appropriate resources (money, magic and in some circumstances prestige or even health).  Move through the map gaining resources and doing quests (by landing on the quest tile and passing a short game of chance).The story behind the game is simple.  Armello's ruler, the king, is dying of rot, an evil infestation making him go mad.  4 seperate factions are vying to take control (wolf, bear, rat and rabbit) through their agents.  The base game comes with 2 agents for each faction.  They are well balanced and will require unique game play strategy to win.  The gameplay is relatively short when you get the hang of it.  Online mutiplayer is not a mode I have tried therefore I can't comment on this aspect of the game.That said I very much like this game.  It isn't an expensive game but the developers have contunually been adding elements and tinkiering with game play.  There are expansions which add 1 new agent for each faction and a soundtrack, but these aren't neccessary to have many hours of fun playing the game.			"

												Yes this game was kickstarted, and i'm one of the few backers, it's everything i could of hoped it to be! if that's not enough reason to buy this game then well fine, here's my review.It's a game of throwns but with animals instead.The community is one of the most civilized people I have ever met.The game is still recieving active updates, changing things for the best each time! ( literally i haven't seen any updates that did cause any hiccups or dissheartening changes! )The Dev's do listen to their backer's and any of their customers, finding the best solutions into improving this game as a whole.Honestly, this game holds a special place in my heart as it has been very humbling to watch this game come alive and grow. I can't thank them enough for doing such an amazing job, while many many other indie titles out there currently aren't living up to their expectations. a few come to mind but i shall not name any of them sense they're not part of what we're here to talk about!honestly i don't see very many cons to this game. the only things that can come to mind is that well.. it's characters are animals? ( if you really aren't into that style of characters )that's all that comes to mind really. it's an extremely fleshed out game. everything is there for a reason. every step can mean life or death.

												NEW and Updated Opinions on the game Armello...I started off with some pretty low expectations and rushed a review out displaying my first impressions of the game as fast as I could.... But now through multiple playthroughs and many different outcomes My overall opinion has changed on the game so let me break it down to three catagories, the good, the bad, and the ugly....The Good,  - The gameplay has improved over time, where at some times the game would drop a frame like skrillex drops a beat  expecially when rolling dice, but now it's much much more smoother.- The many ways you can ♥♥♥♥ over another player and prevent them from winning proves how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people are in games, in one scenario, I had high prestiege and prevented another player from slaying the king before I could claim prestiege victory.-there are many different cards you collect will change your strategy up a bit. makes for multiple playthroughs.- The Animations and opening cutscene are amazing!The Bad,- Prestiege is wayyy to easy to win while other victories are much more harder... This needs to be balanced out.- Because prestiege is the easiest, even with different cards, the game can get repetitive sometimes- Even though there are alot of cards, I would like to see more, like you would see in card games... But this is a personal gripe of mine.- Would like to see bandit clan sometime soonThe UglyNot really much that wasn't allready mentioned in the Bad SectionOverallI do enjoy the game alot more than before, but at times it leaves me wanting more content in this game...

												Armello is awesome. You like strategic boardgames dont miss out on this. I havent played boardgames in a while since my brother always won in axis and allies (he played online and knew every tactic), boring for me. Anyway this game brought me back in, and im pleased. No matter which tactic you decide on, the possibility that you have to/should/must  reconsider is always there. No matter how dark things look, even near endgame you can turn it all around and laugh as you crush your enemies confidence in their win. The only downside I can think of is the ragequitters and disconnects although they are replaced by AIs the AI isnt very smart and can cheat you of certain victory in the most stupid way like attacking the boss and dying in the progress giving the victory to your enemy. This is not near enough to keep me away and I highly recommend this game to anyone actually, even my daughter and wife looks on sometimes and find it interesting(my wife hates videogames). I will try and talking her into buying it aswell ;P thumbs up			"

												I've played quite a lot while this game was in early-acces and finally decided to create a review since it's just fully released. So here's my quick review :DPros:- A lot of strategy: There is a time limit of around 1.5 minute online per turn. You really need this time to complete your turn properly. Every move is a decision. - Great artwork: The game just looks absolutely amazing. Especially the cartoonish artwork in the 'fight scenes'.- RNG: The game works with random cards you get in your hand, this makes every match a different experience. The fight system works with dices, so you can get lucky or very unlucky, but overall, the player with the best odds wins most of the battles.The RNG part is something you may or may not like. I personally liked the RNG part, because the winner of the match is still mostly decided by skill, not RNG. Cons:- Slow: In an online game you are waiting most of the time. This isn't that much of a problem since you can still play cards while it's not your turn, but still, one game takes about one hour. - Matchmaking: Getting into an online match can take some time.EDIT: As of now, the wait timers are very reasonable.Overall this game is worth your money if you like Strategy games and can enjoy the RNG parts.

												I've only had a few hours to play the game but I see a lot of potential here. The artwork is absolutely spectacular, soundtrack is great, and it really does feel like the kind of board game I'd want to buy to play with my friends. (Hint hint development team.) :)As for bugs and the like I've, so far, only had two issues. The game force quit itself during the tutorial one time on me. I've also had issues with the in game camera. For some reason when I try to move around the board the camera will only move towards the four corners of the screen.Other than that (crashes happen and I'm sure if enough people have the camera issue they'll fix it) I highly recommend.

Early Access Review
								Having been a beta backer and following this since it came out on Kickstarter I've been playing a few games of Armello and I'm impressed with what's come out so far.The world is immersive, the animations are smooth, the artwork is stunning and the characters feel balanced. It's a very high quality creation. League of Geeks have created something very unique in execution and deserve plaudits for that.That being said, I want to point out that League of Geeks are making a ""digital board game"" and that shows. If it was a physical board game, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat without a second thought. As a video game though it suffers from a short game time and a lack of rewarding play. With friends it's a lovely experience, but the single player feels very quick and lacks the level of strategy that is expected of a modern strategy game. The AI also feels basic and a little suicidal at times, attacking higher level opponents or players despite little chance of success.There are bugs, but it's in Early Access, and I've only had 1 total crash in around 10-15 games some multi-player some single player. The only noticable other bug was I retained Magic when I should have lost it. League of Geeks have got the fundamentals of a board game down and added so much prettiness on top that I definitely recommend the game. Go into it thinking ""I'm buying a digital board game to play with friends"" and it's worth it. But if you plan on playing it entirely solo I'd hold back for a little more content			"

								From what I have seen, Armello is one of the best digital board games in steam. Very easy to play, with intuitive menus, and lots of in-game tips that facilitate the approach to the game for the new players.  The graphics and music are just gorgeous, the game is fun to play, and overall I like the design and mechanics, though a I miss a hotseat local multiplayer mode... maybe in a future version? In any case, the game has a very well implemented online multiplayer mode. I´d really recommend it for anyone into board games and game-of-thrones-like thematic.			"

												             As a digital board game Armello’s goal is clear. It tries to be casual enough to allow the players to get into the game with ease, but tries to be complex enough not to let its mechanics become boring after a short period of time. The game tries to reach for a wider audience and as a competitive game it deserves one, despite some of the more annoying problems that the multiplayer has to offer.As a newly born world and lore, Armello only teases the players with its potential leaving them wanting more. The story options are limitless and I can’t stop myself what a positive influence a story mode could have on this game.                Armello has the enchanting atmosphere of a fairy tale with the brutal gameplay of a deathmatch and the tactical decision making of a strategy, but with its fate trapped in the cage that comes with small budget indie development.Pros:+ Charming world+ Awesome heroes+ Lovely 2D animations, art style and UI design+ Great music+ Easy to learn+ Good enough mechanics to stay interesting for a whileCons:- A small map with no configurations available- Victory conditions aren’t properly balanced- Slow multiplayer- No chat- The game is crying for a story modeRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/09/armello-review.html "

												I like the mechanics of this game. It is a nice choice for passing the time.  I have not tried multiplayer yet, but can recongnize a somewhat griefing tactic to the game. I would recommend playing the single player mode about 10-12 times to get a feel for the flow of the game. I do not think it is a game for everyone. The dice do not go in your favor very often and takes a great deal of building for some of the lower stat line characters to skew the odds more to your side. If you enjoy board games I think you would enjoy this as well.			"

												I kickstarted Armello based on the art-style and the background.I'm playing Armello because it's a bloody good and balanced boardgame which allows players to pursue different victory conditions. There's a large variety in the playable characters, and in addition you equip each character with two bonus items - maybe you want to start with higher Wit, allowing you to hold and draw more cards each round. Or you increase your Fight stat, making you a deadlier combatant.All of these allow for a huge variety of tactics and strategies, which don't get old even after a dozen games. Armello is an exceptional boardgame with a great story attached to it.Come and play with me!			"

								I've been looking forward to this game since I first saw it come out of its kickstarter. Loving board games as much as I do video games, this seemed right up my alley.When I first launched it, I was instantly hooked. The game looked great, ran great (aside from hanging on the character sheets a little) and played great. I'm still struggling with beating the game any way other than with prestige, but I'm sure that's a playstyle issue, not an issue with the game.As someone who has played lots of board games in the past, it's nice to see a few new mechanics introduced into one game, and have them all work cohesively.

I still liked it, but sometimes felt like the game played me instead of the other way round. But in the end, Armello can entertain me for hour after hour.			"

								In this 4-player competetive board game you take the role of one of four heroes from the great animal clans (wolf, bear, rabbit and rat) each having their own strenghts and weaknesses. I could use a lot of words describing the game mechanics , but then again, just watch this video from Pinstar: 


YouTube™ Video: Pinstar Plays Armello (Evil Rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Run) 

			Views: 514		

			Armello is an early access turn based strategy game. Feels like Redwall, plays like a board game. Very fun. Take a look! Skip to 7:00 to jump right to the action.		

Pros:Play online in public games, against friends in private games, or offline against AI opponents.Four different win-conditions allows for various strategies.Gorgeous graphics style and sound.Very well thought out card and dice system.Playing time is approximately an hour, so you can easily squeeze in a match in your busy schedule. Cons:Although strategy is involved, so is a lot of luck.No hot-seat mode (the game mechanics won't allow this, because cards are hidden from other players and it's possible to perform actions when it's not your turn).No LAN- or dedicated server-mode, which is really a shame. Dependency on a central server is never a good thing. Hopefully the devs will fix this. "

												This game was a great purchase. It takes the gameplay of a tabletop board game adds some strategy to it and becomes a digital game. The games don't seem to be too long and I think that is perfect considering it is a four player game. There are a few ways to win in the game and all seem to be very good considering you can go from one way to another but risking being to slow to win in other ways. I would totally recommend this game. It also has a certain ""cuteness"" to it. The characters are very well designed and the maps are interesting.Graphics: 8 - It is a very beautiful game, even with graphics turned down to the lowest it still looks great.Sound: 8 - Lovely music, only issue i have found was the King's roars are really loud.Gameplay: 9 - Game mechanics are interesting, different ways to win and multiple game mechanicsStory: 8 - Not sure if there is a story in single player yet, but the prologue story is very well done and interesting.

												This game is easily one of the most well done digital board games made.  That's not to say I don't have my small issues with it, but they're easy to over look.  With 4 victory paths, the game has the potential to be very interesting with every new game.  The reason I say ""potential"" is a lot of the matches tend to have mostly people who will just try and cheese their way to a win through prestige.  It's understandable as it's the least risky way to play, but it leads to a more boring match.Down to the brass tacks here, Armello is, as mentioned, a digital board game for 4 players.  Featured as of writing are 4 seperate factions each with their own focus on seperate skills, and 3 unique playable characters in each faction.  A quick example, The Wolf Clan focuses more on combat abilities, while The Rat Clan focuses more on subterfuge.  Each of these clans have 1 goal, become the new ruler of the land of Armello.  There are multiple ways to accomplish this goal:Killing the blighted King and taking the throne;Banishing the King and his corruption through the gathering of 4 sacred Spirit Stones;Having the most Prestige Points when the king dies from his Blight (or if another player kills the king and also dies in the same combat);or corrupting yourself even more than the King and seizing the throne.Throughout your turn-based adventure through the land of Armello you'll own villages, explore dungeons and fight both monsters and players.  Every turn, if not at a full hand, you'll draw cards from your choices of three piles until your hand is full.  These include equipment cards, followers, trickery and subterfuge, items and magic.  These add a lot of strategy to your play and help to alleviate the RNG elements of some parts.  On top of this, these is also a meta game before the game starts where you can select different rings and medallions for your character that offer small stat boosts and passive abilities, mostly specializing you towards a certain type of victory.There's a lot left to describe in terms of gameplay elements, but I've done my best to touch on the major factors here.  This game is easily worth the asking price, and it's always been a blast every time I launch it.  There's a certain depth to the game that keeps it fun, but it's still accessible to new players.  Great art, and the light touch of lore for those who look for it is a nice treat.			"

												Armello is a beautifully crafted game with easy to learn rules/controls, gorgeous and vibrant art and a soundtrack that could calm the nerves of raging bull. There are still a few minor bugs with the gameplay BUT this is easily forgivable since it is still an Early Access game.Speaking as someone that does not play many tile based and turn based games, I was a little hesitant when jumping in for the first time. The game, however, is very charming, not overloading you with books of dialogue about the characters or the kingdom. It feels more like an emergent narrative that allows the player to decide there own fate during the game play. It's very replayable as there are many unlockable items that can change your strategy when in game. There are also more characters confirmed for later release which looks very exciting.The Art, as mentioned, is amazing and consistent all the way through. One thing that I do love is that they have 3D animations for tile game play and traditional 2D animations for combat. Any fan of 'Redwall' or 'Mice and Mystics' will be able to jump into this with no problems.Definitely worth a look for anyone that enjoys tabletop and roleplay games!Update: I still find myself coming back to this game. It's still replayable and with the extra content that's being added in new patches it guarentees theres always something new to try in each game.			"

												Armello is beautiflly crafted, well thought out digital board game, which is NOT like Catan, but more like Arkham Horror, including the horror. However, instead of real teamwork, you race towards your favored method of winning and achieve it, before someone else slays the king.Armello looks and feels gorgeous. On the mechanics part, they are easy to understand and use and, as soon as you get the hang of it, you will find burning cards is a wonderful feature which you should use often to get many different cards. On the ""bad"" side, even though the maps are randomly created, there are not enough features to make a map feel special. For a boardgame, this is no problem, but a digitalized one could add more spice. I remember the digital Catan game, where you could zoom into the lands and see people work. But this is a minor nitpick, as the cards and effects do more than enough worldbuilding for themselves.After a few games versus bots I will try myself against humans, to see how they play the game. Maybe there is a cooperation element I did not yet discover, since it seems as one winner takes it all.A map editor for custom maps, rules and restrictions would be a great addition, as the one single mode with random map and enemies can grow old rather quickly. House rules and stuff, so to speak. But let us give the game time to settle and gather input.			"

												Played several hours in offline mode, as some of my achievements will show. If I were to sum up this game, I would refer to it as a ""fixed"" Dokapon Kingdom. Dokapon Kingdom is a fusion of board game and JRPG that - while immensely fun - was simply too long, too random, and encouraged players to jerk each other over far too much. Despite these flaws, Dokapon Kingdom is probably one of my favorite games despite the few situations where I find time to play it.Armello brings down the randomness quite considerably as battles are no longer a roshambo match and instead focus on dice and card usage, all determined by stats. The complicated class system is replaced by heroes that determine your abilities. The game length feels to be around 30 minutes a game as opposed to the 20 something hours that Dokapon Kingdom can take. While you can certainly attack the other player, no one ever feels the need to quit since the game is so short. But these changes take out some of the charm of a game like this, if you're going to make a direct comparison to Dokapon Kingdom. There's less a sense of an adventure, the board is really small and you never feel invested in your towns since they change ownership so quickly. The lack of global objectives and the use of personal ones can also lead to the sense of a lack of interaction sometimes and your teammates become more random encounters rather than opponents if everyone goes different victory routes. Armello is nice, a nice light game to pick up your day. Probably not a game I'll invest 100+ hours in its current state, but a game I'll play every now and then.			"

												Excellent game. Visually appealing and the sound and atmosphere is amazing. However, the ""strategy"" isn't quite there and I'm not sure if it ever will be. The ""easy"" win condition is just stack Prestige and wait until day 9, which isn't that hard to do. This game really shines when played multiplayer as the single player experience lacks smart AI. I would still recommend this to friends as I believe that the developers will address the ""strategy"" issue and make the all of the win conditions a bit more balanced.			"

												I am recommending this game BUT not for the audience its art style might attract. That is not saying that its art is sub-class or lacking; no, it is actually quite the opposite; since it will cater to a large number of players, both old and young. But I find that as a problem for this game...since the cute, 'wolf in sheep's clothing' (with some pun intended) art style masks the complex mechanics this game offers. Though, it was able to hook me as a player. But yet again, not for entirely the right reasons. I find that there is too much randomness in its mechanics - from perils, wild sun dice rolls, rewards, king's orders, drawn cards...there's too much randomness that forbids me to create a good, well thought-out strategy from the get-go that would allow me to say at the end of a campain, ""ggwp"".

												From the totally unique aesthetics to the wonderfully original gameplay, Armello has it all. The moment the opening cutscene began, I knew I had bought something special. A one-of-a-kind boardgame/rpg experience. The lore and core story are epic as the best medieval stories (Armello TV series please, League of Geeks) and the quests are all entertaining and have a great Dungeons and Dragons flair about them. And let me just praise the tutorial segment of the game. It's done EXACTLY how a tutorial should be. It eases the players into the (seemingly) complicated mechanics, but in an organic, story-driven way that is entertaining and informative. By the end of it, I had a firm grasp of how to play, was ready to dive right into my own game, but I also was so excited to learn more, find all the secret quests and fill up my card collection. A true gem of a gaming experience.			"

												"" (Armello) never acquires the necessary maturity to evolve into a deep web of war and conspiracy that is often found in titles like Civilization or Age of Wonders III. It’s true this bite-sized formula works well for tablets and mobile devices, but when playing on a computer, Armello leaves much to be desired in scope. Regardless, the potential here is immense and I can only hope it sells well enough to warrant a sequel addressing these issues. ""Full Review here: http://www.tech-gaming.com/armello/ "

												Alright, I'm not a very big gamer and I just like to play games every now and then. But Armello is fantastic!! In my experience, I have never played a game like it. The theme is awesome and probably the number one element that drew me to the game in the first place. The music is great, and the gameplay is unique. I really like the tabletop aspect to it. Armello has become one of my favorite games, especially for light strategy I like to call it. You can be in and finnished with a sinlge game relitivly quickly; probably between an hour and an hour and a half in my experience. And for me with the strategy games I play (Total War, Sid Miers, etc.) it feels nice. I feel satisfied when a game ends and I do tend to ask myself the question ""Another round?"" In my opinion, there aren't many other games of this quality for this price and experience around. You don't need a massive computer to enjoy playing it.  One of my top favorite games for sure! If you don't have it, well, change it, 'cause you should.			"

												A visually stunning and impressive game. The game is a sort of adventure game of intrigue, combat, and politics. 8 characters across 4 clans of animals are playable in a game to either kill, or cleanse the king.Each clan has their own ring set to expand upon their playstyles to alter how you play. Amulets allow you to give a bonus stat at the start or a head start on some of the winning conditions in the game.Gameplay follows a lot of your adventure board game stylings such as super dungeon adventure. The map is essentially a big diamond with various tiles for different effects. Each player has a quest to start with from 3 pickable ones. If you get to the tile you can either risk a roll for a bonus item but if you fail you will lose things such as health, magic, prestige, etc. This is all the while fighting off banes brought from void dungeons, other players, and occasionally the kings own guards. Each day has two turn cycles of day and night. Each day the king loses 1 of his 9 health until he dies on his own and at night his rot level grows by one. This means there are 18 turns in total until he dies. In that time you have 4 ways to win the game. The first is that you have the highest prestige when the king dies on his own or by someone killing the king who dies by the kings hand in that same fight. The second is that you kill the king without dying to him. The third is to kill the king with more rot than him (Rot victory). Lastly is the cleansing victory which has you gathering 4 spirit stones found across the map occasionally or by finding one in the dungeon tiles.Combat in the game is an interesting concept as well. Each character has 4 stats to work with, Fight increases the number of dice you can use in combat/defending, Body determines your characters health points, wits increase card carrying capacity and peril dice, and spirit determines how much magic points you get at night to use on spell cards. Upon entering combat you roll dice equivolent to your fight stat against your targets fight dice. Any bonuses from equipment are considered as well. rolls determine your attack and defense numbers and are compared against your targets. Fights can end in double KO's.Each turn you can draw cards up to your wits number. Cards come in 3 flavors: Items come in the form of equipment, or useable one time items that require gold to equip or use. Magic cards allow you cast the spell on them for it's magic cost. The last card set is trickery, they allow you to alter events or cause trouble for a gold cost.The soundtrack enhances the mood of the game quite well. It suits the fantasy medieval setting very well.Now there are some gripes with the game in some aspects. For the most part each character has a unique playstyle that doesn't have a glaring detriment. However there are two characters who's specific abilities aren't all that helpful to you in progressing towards a win condition. The first is the rat mercurio, whose ability of taking a gold from a settlement owner when he takes it himself starts becoming useless in the later parts of the game. The second is the bear Sana, her ability is that she can use her spirit stat as her fight stat when she fights anything that's corrupted. This is a big loss for her in the early game as the only thing that's corrupted early are banes (rot birds that spawn from dungeons), so unless someones going for a rot victory or you are going to try and fight the king, her ability is practically useless until the very late game.A second issue i have with the game is that you have a visual range of about 8 tiles of the board for clear visability. If you zoom out, the game gives a kind of through the clouds look which blurs your vision a bit. For a game that's supposed to be board game like, it would be nice to have an option to view the entire board clearly (outside of stealthed enemies). It is mitigated by quick keys to jump to certain sections of the board, but it would have been something nice to have.The last one i have is that the online is a little to be desired. As a whole it functions, but you can't host an online match until you get a friend in your game nor is there a list of available games. Your options are look for randoms which with the low player count can take some time, or invite a friend then you can have others join you or fill with AI.I would recommend the game for anyone who enjoys adventure like board games but don't want to spend the 70-150 dollars it costs to buy them. The average game length is about 50 minutes to an hour and no suspend feature for online so make sure to have some time to play through to the end.			"

Early Access Review
								Update after the 1.5 Patch: With the constant game updates since release (new cards, changed mechanics, multiplayer progression...) and the new heroes, this game only improved! A fantastic digital board game!---Armello is a digital board game set in a medieval fantasy world inhabited by animals.The king is afflicted with a dark curse that slowly drives him insane and eventually will kill him. The 4 clans (Wolves, Rats, Rabbits and Bears) now try to gain the upper hand (or paw) and fight each other for the throne of Armello.You play as one of the clans' heroes, like Thane the wolf warrior or Sana the bear druid. (4 heroes available right now, 4 additional heroes + 4 Kickstarter backer-exclusive heroes already confirmed)Traveling over the board in a turn-based system, you draw cards (items, spells, trickeries/traps, followers...), conquer villages and explore dungeons for gold (to play your cards) and treasures, complete quests related to your hero's backstory, fight monsters and other heroes for gold and prestige in a dice-based battle system and try to raise your stats (like number of dice, life points, etc).In the end, you can face the king in battle. Or banish him with magical spirit stones. Or just collect the most prestige and wait for him to die. There are many different ways to win the game.A special feature of Armello is the rot. Your hero can become affected by the same curse as the king, completely changing the course of battles. If both you and your enemy are affected by rot, the hero with more rot gains the other hero's amount of rot as bonus dice. If your rot is high enough, it makes battles against other heroes or even the king way easier (when you suddenly roll 5 more dice than your enemy). On the other hand, you lose health every turn and can't use the healing stone circles anymore. Managing your rot  is an important part of the game.There is no best hero or best way to win the game. Some lucky dice rolls, bad card draws or finding a good follower in a dungeon can and will make you adapt your strategy.Maybe you were the prestige leader the whole game and lose everything by accidently attacking a King's Guard. But then, a quest and some dark magic increase your rot and you suddenly have more than the king. Now all you need is more fighting power. With a bit of luck, you'll find enough gold in that dungeon over there to equip the expensive battleaxe you found two turns ago. Or wait until next turn and try to draw a card that lets you steal the rabbit's morning star...No game is the same as the last.The game has come a long way since the beginning of the Backer-Alpha and lots of things have been improved during the Backer-Beta (like a complete rework of the rot system). Now, with some of the things added and changed in the latest build, this Early Access version definitely is the best version of this game so far. If everyone keeps submitting bug reports and suggestion to make the game better and the developers at League of Geeks keep up their great work (and I'm sure they will), this game can become one of the best digital board games in years.------Pros:Great artstyleLikeable charactersBeautiful animated cardsEasy to learnSurprising strategic depthInteresting dice battle systemGreat 4 player Online-Multiplayer (maybe still a bit unstable, but steadily improving)Cons:Bad luck can make you lose in a single turnAI sometimes too easy to beat/no difficulty settingsSome heroes/strategies actually ARE stronger than others right now, but with more cards and balance changes, I'm sure this will be fixed after Early AccessIf you like board games, fantasy settings or animals, or you're just looking for a relaxing game, I can definitely recommend Armello!

												First and foremost I want to address the number of people moaning and groaning about microtransactions.  I get it... MTs can ruin a game... but not a single one of the MTs in this game changes gameplay.  Even the DLC that unlocks the 4 new characters doesn't really change much because all the new chars are balanced.  So quit complaining about cosmetic micro transactions and saying it ruins the game.This game is a lot of fun.  There are four different ways to win the game and there is always a chance to come back.  I would say the game boils down to be about 35% luck and 65% tactics/skill.  The game always plays out differently so it is hard to get bored of it.Definitely worth 20 bucks and would definitely recommend.			"

												Armello might be the first digital board game that I enjoy very much.It has good looking and cute graphics, is easy to comprehend and one match won't take longer than an hour.It's great for playing online with friends, and most of the characters are well-rounded.Sometimes a match will make you feel like the game wants to screw you over, but that can really be attributed to plain bad luck with the random number generator. In the next match after that, the table can turn in your favor again.The ""board"" is randomly generated each match so that no settlement, mountain or dungeon will ever be in the same place.I can recommend this game for everyone who enjoys competing board games with friends!

												An honest review after playing only short time, it's not possible to do so more cause of annoying bug of half the sounds being static.It's a fun boardgame with a few elements beyond capabilities of reality boardgames that make game even bigger of a charm.The art style is purely awesome. The illustrations of cards, menu, characters and fights are simply awesome and even though the game is not big on 3D work, it's good too. The system is explained and even though seems complex at start, it is easily explained multiple times it's not hard to memorise.The 'fights' and also interactions have a massive downside of being RNG-based as of rolling the dice and has nothing to do with skill as of for most of the game too, but also at the same time giving the 'surprise' charm you get when playing a real game.Story isn't very special, usual magic adventure with a rather interesting character roster filling up for that. Not much to say.Overall, well-worked out game. Not sure if curent price is worth but i got it as a gift and it also has Multiplayer. Definetely fun to play with other people so probably mostly worth only if others play it too.			"

												Armello is an awesome game and I will definitely recommend it to my friends if being asked. In the world of Armello, you're going to act as one of the four clans, fighting for the crown while the lion king is creeping to death.I love this story and the various goals for winning, it offers you multiple ways to achieve your success, besides that, you can play Armello with AI or with different human players, which means a lot of possibilities in the game, and you can play it for many rounds without feeling bored.Armello is easy to pick-up, but hard to master. You need to seek the balance between different powers and three kinds of cards, and that's the intelligence you'll need for a victory. I really love the challenge which Armello gives me, and I like the experience competing with other players, it's really a good game you need to try.			"

For me, it would be possible to sink in around ~100 hours with just base content. "

												This is absolutely a board game.It has a tiny 9x9 hexagon map. Single player games generally last an hour for ~16 turns. It does a few things you couldn't do in a physical board game, like hide player units when they're in stealth and change the writing on cards.I was somewhat disappointed at first because I prefer my turn based strategy/RPG hybrids to be sprawling fantasy 4x empire builders. This is so good I'm very happy it isn't. The game mechanics are really fun and well balanced, while the artwork and character design is absolute top notch excellent. One of the things I didn't notice in videos for this game is the card artwork. It's by far my favorite part. The cards are all animated. The animations are short, but they give a lot of life to the cards. Check out teleport, it's one of my favorites. Can you find the frog?Singleplayer has a lot of longevity, there are so many neat steam achievements to get. One thing that could be improved is the single player AI. There's nothing obviously wrong with it, it seems competent. but the simple fact is I end up winning the vast majority of games played against it, even though I'm usually just achievement hunting without much care to weather I win or lose. It would be nice if it got a tuneup.Update July 11th, 2016: I've played a few multiplayer matches. I've been able to find a game quickly even late at night, and the game worked well without much lag. The game is well paced even when a few players were slow to take their turns.			"

												I'm a bit of a new-comer to Armello and have only started playing it online today. So far it's all been stable for me. And i've really enjoyed the game. It's a well designed digital board game adventure and rpg elements and with a dice and stat based combat system card based items/powers/abilities. I defniately found it a decent step up from Talisman which i also like. As you have more options and much more open in how you go about things. So if you like Talisman, Bloodbowl 2 or Mordheim even. I'd recommend Armello. If you don't like those games then you probably won't like Armello but you never know!			"

Great soundtrack. YES, it has a few bugs, and the multiplayer can be slow to find a game. BUT you can add me lol. Add me and come play with me an my friends. Trust me, try it. You'll like it. This game deserves WAY more attention! -

												PROS: The best game sofar I have played for the times you want to just lay down on your bed a just use poinr-and-clicking of your mouse to play it is Armello. No rush rush clickig with precision. It requires very little memory of some complicated large map or massive playing pieces or an  understanding of some major large deck of cards.  It does work your mind very well in trying to figure the quickest route to victory given the few cards you are delt.  The game has a turn limit so, when it ends, it ends.  No sitting down for hours at a time.Iin Armello, bad results early just mean you alter to victory through a different path based on the cards and die roles.  There are different ways to win, just choe the path to take given what you are dealt.CONS:  Getting to understand which route to take requires maybe losing  to the computer several times just to get the idea of what works and what doesn't.  As you are first learning the game, the music and artwork are sure to keep you affixed to the game and content in your progress.  Just playing the first couple games and losing actually opens up new items to use to enhance the character you choose to play so, a loss is never a loss to start your first adventures.			"

												From the moment I first laid eyes on the trailer for Armello, I was captivated by the enchanting 2D animations. Armello offers a superb table top game experience easily accessible from your computer. But is that all it has to offer?However, due to the character limit for Steam reviews, please read our full review here.[gamereviewsau.com]Quick Gist Of Our OpinionArmello is one of the most charming games I’ve ever played and has such a unique play-style that you’ll probably not find anywhere else.The graphics are superb, the story is incredibly well written (and leaves you wanting more, more, MORE) and there are so many ways to win a game that you’ll be engaging your inner strategist just enough to keep your brain trained.My one qualm with Armello is that the Prologue is so short. I really want to see more story!

It combines the aspects of tabletop RPGs with questing, equipment and stats with the competitiveness of any free for all tabletop game. My thoughts on the game as goes is that it hits a solid 8/10. The graphics are amazing, gameplay is pretty good  and music is gorgeous. It's a unique take on tabletop gaming and something I would suggest to any fan of these types of games. Of course if you aren't a fan of leaving lots of aspects of the game to somewhat controlled luck, then I suggest you don't buy this game.			"

												I'll start with, well, the only thing I can think of right now: this is a breathtaking game.I run an over-modded Skyrim off of my beefy overclocked rig. Good graphics are to me what a mug is to a coffee snob - I need it before I can even begin to feed my addiction. Armello didn't look like it fit the bill at first. It looked too stylized, and without enough substance. I am delighted to have been so wrong.Armello isn't an immersive, living portrait in the way that Skyrim can be. Instead, you're invited to play a boardgame crafted by people who set out to make something clever and beautiful, then happened to make a game out of it along the way.			"

												Armello is one of those games that's likely to always be here on my hard drive.

												This game has potential but it hasn't been reached.There is a bug in here and certain mechanics that merits from me recommending this game even after playing it for about 80 hours.A major bugWhen a player leaves a game in the middle of an ""action"" taking place, it can ruin the whole game for anyone playing that game. The NPC have no idea what to do. Once the player leaves, the npc stand still forever. That round of a game is gone.This bug has been hanging since the beginning of the game's inception but it has improved over time.But don't let that stop someone when you do them wrong. They would abuse it for the chance to ruin your game.Order of TurnIf you are the first to go in any game, you have an advantage over the player going last. In fact, going last leaves you at a bigger disadvantage to anyone going before you.This is due to how some of the cards are balance. There are ""Spells"" card that put some players at a disadvantage. Some of them that  hinders movement on the board.If you are first, you will NEVER be hindered. The day and night cycle will always give you the advantage to be reset your status. You will always go the maximum distance and no one can do anything about that.You will also have the advantage of casting these spell to hinder the players as well.PlayerMost of the game is played online for a better experience.However, that can be turn against you when this game is suppose to be a free for all.You will find games where it is 2v1 or 3v1! It is not a enjoyable experience to be bullied.There is no Soloqueue.And also not to mention the AFK botter who are farming the keys and chest of this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Aloha Steam-ers and Stream-ers,Warning: The following will be presented first by a short blurb about my thoughts on the game, followed by a very dense reflection on the aspects of the game and all the nuances I have come to find during this Early Access Period. If you just want the short and sweet Review, Look only to the first paragraph. If you want the Essay...continue ^_^--Blurb--Currently Early Access: Not all features unlocked, not everything is in final game form, soul of the game and it's potential is immediately apparent. Play with a friend or by yourself.Game of Thrones meets Redwall for an epic ride through the lands of Armello in the format of Settlers of Catan...without all the tradingThis turn based strategy desktop gaming with a furry overtone will have you forming secret coalitions, laying deadly traps, braving forgotten dungeons, hunting deadly creatures, and praying to the RNG gods for their blessing. With multiple methods to achieve victory and only having 16 turns for you to accomplish one of those conditions, this mad dash for the crown will leave everyone scrambling till the last second.Goal of the game: Become King....sounds easy right?How to reach that goal:Kill the King and take the throne by forceBanish the King with magic of the WyldWin the loyalty and support of the peopleEmbrace the Rot and become the new Dark LordPros (imo)-Achievement System: Good long term investment if you wish to discover different strategies of play-Card and Dice combat: Good Planning is countered by Good Luck and vice-versa, makes sure everyone has a chance-Questing System: RPG style of character building along multiple routes to aid you in your victory path-PVP and PVE Adventuring: Fight other players or monsters to enhance your chances of winning-Graphics: Beautiful art with minimal animations subtly draws you into the game as you play-Not a ""Winner's Game"": you've played them before. Everyone who spends 15 turns to attempt to achieve victory has a chance to achieve victory. Lovely aspect of the luck based combat system.Cons (imo)-Combat Log: When first learning the game, you'll be swamped by a feeling of ""what just happened"" a lot. The combat log is small and hard to keep track of since every turn is packed with so much information.-Early Acces Bugs: Not completed yet, so if you're looking for a finished and polished game, you will not be getting that right off the bat. Community and Developers are working to iron them out and plan on improving the game throughout it's life span-Hidden Information: Lots of things about this game I don't know about. I don't know what the goal is, payment plans, development schedules, etc. Putting a lot of trust into the developers. However, considering how much they've done with the game already, I don't think that trust is misplaced.-Addicting: This is just me.....I put it as a con cause you may have a life....I love being addicted to this game.Overall Impression: Love the game, can't wait to see what else they do with it. More characters, cards, etc. So much more is planned for this game and I am enjoying seeing what comes down the pipe.--End of Blurb-- (Yeah...THAT was the short stuff ^_^)--Beginning of Rant and Praise--The once beautiful land of Armello was ruled by a wise and benevolent King. The inherent animosity of the Bear, Rabbit, Rat, and Wolf clans were tamed under his rule. With fair hand and heart, the King provided a place where all would be welcome and war would cease. All was well and right in the world...until the Rot came. Dark magic permeated the land, spawning terrible creatures that roamed the night, preying on the innocent and frightened. With the King's guard called away to confront this evil, another evil arose to line their pockets with gold and wet their blades with blood. Without their protection, the citizens were terrorized by criminals and bandits who thrived in the chaos abound. The once peaceful coalition between the clans have been torn asunder and fear for the future has called the clans to call out for heroes, namely YOU, to claim the throne of a Mad King.The writing in this game, when I take the time to look at it, is simple and straight forward. There is enough spirit and wit (there is a pun there) in this game to give it a kind of life that seems like the next generation of ""board game"" feeling. Growing up with a large family, we had lots of chances to play board games with each other and the once powerful alliance of one game quickly became a bitter rivalry the next. With the dawn of video gaming (that should indicate how old I am that I witnessed this transition), that tabletop game feeling seems to have died out. Why bother playing with such a static field when the bells and whistles of computers and consoles are so much more appealing. Somehow, this game has found a balance between those two aspects. With the graphics of a console game with the core mechanics of a tabletop board game. What's improved is that nobody is saying ""that's against the rules"" and digressing into a 30 minute discussion about what the manual means. The rules are programmed in, and everyone is always subjugated to the same ruling. Maybe that will change in the future when they allow us to create our own games with ""house rules"", but it doesn't change the fact that the rules are always going to be implemented fairly.That's another big part of this game. Fairness. Although there are some things that need balancing still, the goal is to legitimately allow every player a chance at victory. Emphasis on ""Chance"". The luck system in the game keeps it so that there isn't really a ""sure way"" to win every time, you need to learn and adapt to the cards being played, how the board is laid out, and what your opponents are doing. Despite this, a ""good player"" who has strategy and executes their goals effectively will have a distinct advantage over a player who relies completely on luck. So there is a way to be a ""good player"" in a game and reduce the chances of someone sneaking a victory over you by being ""just lucky"". That being said, there are a few aspects of the game that could use improvement. Many of them are mentioned and developed by the discussion boards and forums. The developers seem to be actively interested in the concerns of their gaming community and address each presented problem in some way. Again, the game is still in early access, so there is much to be done, but I have yet to feel like this is a game that is already set in stone, and I am going to just play it. From the time I heard about the game to the time I started playing it, which was only a few weeks, the YouTube videos are already showing that what was mentioned has been addressed and fixed thanks to the watchful eyes of the gamers. It's a very rewarding experience to be a part of.One of the sad things is being forever in Queue to find a public game. Hopefully that will change when more people find out about the game and it begins to hit a larger audience. Playing with the AI, though easy to get a victory out of, allows you to polish and attempt strategies to see how the random luck player would do against you, but I am dying to test out my strategies on other players and interacting with them in this environment. The chat features are somewhat limited, but considering just how cut-throat this game is, perhaps it is best that players are not allowed to rage at each other with harsh words and foul language. This game really is ""you vs the world"", and though sometimes it may seem like every other character is just bashing you, you can still win. If 3 players decide to pick on only one person, and trolls will be trolls, there is still the chance that one person can sneak into the castle and Kill the King. Hopefully, if they change the Rot Victory prerequisites, if one person is being bullied in game, they can get ROT and win!..(am out of space)			"

												VERY well done game.The combat, graphics, story... Basically EVERYTHING works with this game.That being said, its lacking a certain kind of polish.In my brief time of playing, I have been constantly plagued by audio bugs, such as crackling audio, delayed audio, doubled and sometimes tripled audio, certain sounds not muting when the sound sliders are set to 0 (mainly the life-stones and the banes noises).Another grievance I have with this game, is the lack of a proper graphical options menu, instead you have the choice of, ""Very Low"" to ""Very High"" settings. I am aware that this is a duel launch game also made for the Sony PlayStation, but this does not excuse this. ALLLL of that being said tho, do I hate this game? No, far from it, I adore this game, to the point that in my brief time playing, it has managed to work its way into my heart,  topping off my favorite games, at least for the time being. On a side note, they really nailed the, ""board game"" aspect with the Dice roles. 90% of them resulting in your face being melted by the pure hatred of the dice, but the other 10% turn out to be as if some divine figure reaching down and giving each of them a soft kiss. TL;DR: If you like board games and can deal with a bad options menu, get this game, you will NOT regret it.(Also, no I did not just buy this because it has anthro characters...)			"

												If you're a board gamer, or have sunk hours into Dokapon/100% Orange Juice - this is probably going to scratch your itch. The rules were easy enough to pick up after one game, and any other questions we had were quickly answered by the game manual (which is hidden in the escape menu). The characters seem relatively balanced, and thankfully, not pandering to furries.The game has solid depth, and I could see myself replaying it for the forseeable future before it gets stale (I'm estimating about 60 games). Playing around with different characters and pushing yourself for the more difficult victory conditions is a riot while everyone scampers around the map jumping on each other to prevent everyone from doing the same. While there's a healthy element of randomness to it all, much of the luck can be mitigated by smart plays, so generally the more skilled players win. That said, the card element is a little tricky to control, and I do wish there was a way of influencing your draws other than by card type.Just note: this is a short game that's meant to be replayed. There is only one 'map', and the game lasts around 40 minutes; even though the trailer would seem to have you believe that it's some kind of sprawling epic. The map itself is relatively small, but that serves to keep everyone running into each other consistently, which is point.Make sure you have a friend along for the ride, because the amount of banter you're about to get up to on Skype is worth the price of admission alone.

												This game is pretty amazing, but it suffer somewhat alittle bit from the RNG-devil. I mean you can have high prestige at the end of the game(talking in multiplayer) and loose like 4 prestige at the last round because there's ""anti-cards"" to your strategy and stuff. That makes for a pretty interesting and fun gameplay(for those that get those cards).Multiplayer suffer in other areas too:1. Matchmaking is also suffering from the ""someone picked my hero, so I'll go and rejoin another game"". There's no penalty for leaving, and the ones that ragequit mid-game will get an AI instead. And yes, it has happened, the AI won that time :P2. There's no proper chat, it's all predefined lines you can say, like in Hearthstone. It opens for console of course, but it's kinda annoying that you can't ""talk stragegy"" at all. You can't say exactly what you want. But you can try add them on steam as their steam ID is the ingame one.3. You can sit awhile and wait for people to join the extremely simple matchmaking in like ONE lobby room. Games can take long maybe up to an hour or hour'n'a'half.Lastly, I want to apologize to the one player that we kinda made a pact from the start of the game against the two other players. Some cards allow you to gain resources as long as one of you don't die. And that I had to kinda ""backstab"" him in the end, I had 10 prestige and was closest of the two of us to win, I had pretty good shields and I knew he had loads of +fight. And the quickest way I could get to the one about to attack the king was to get killed in order to go back home(and it was closer to the winning guy, due to perils blocking of the quickest path. And so we still didn't make it, but that wanted me to explain myself and my tactic after I attacked him and tossed ALL I had at him(had to maintain the prestige if I happen to win), but you can't.. Can't say anything, and he kept using the treathen lines at me.It's a pretty addictive game over all,unlocking stuff as you win matches and gain ""XP"" for starter ""items"" and ""favors"" I guess they're called.And I'm really looking forward to future DLC of new characters, new cards, new rings and favors as well as new maps(? -because the maps are randomized every game) or new texture-set for current map. I'll buy it all! :)			"

												EDIT2: I finally got to playing some mp games and I must say wasn't very impressed so far. Firstly, I barely managed to play them because every time I found other 3 players and we started up the game it would disconnect. I verified several times that the problem is not on my end. - After finally connecting to a game it turned out to last veeery long because players don't have immediate actions like AI (and even AI seems slow after several games).- players can leave the game when they like without any consequence and then AI replaces them- there is a huuuuge amount of luck involved in the game (a bit too much for my liking)- I still recommend this game because it needs more players to get better and it has quite a bit of room to be better, especially because these are some very nice foundations, but I wouldn't call it a final product because it kinda lacks content.I kinda bought this game on a whim not knowing what it's all about. I just like board games.This will be a limited review based on just my first few hours and I didn't even play the multiplayer yet.I was only disappointed in one aspect -  there is no real campaign mode or something similar, but I should've expected that since this is, primarily, a multiplayer game.Tutorial was really nice and I think single player serves only the purpose of teaching you the game so you can get into multiplayer. That purpose is served well.The setting, art, gampleay are all very nicely made and as I said, this will be a limited review since I didn't yet play the biggest aspect of the game.EDIT1: I thought cards had to be collected for mp, but I was corrected by Goon for Hire (thanks). This makes it even better since you are immediately ready for mp.			"

												EDIT:Forget what I said below... Im editing this review because I still come back to play this game, I still love this game, and Its still just as enjoyable as it was.I dont know what all the DLC related negative reviews are about... you dont have to buy any of it to play, but considering this developer is still updating after all of this time (and dont pretend you dont know the lifecycle of games on here or how quickly theyre abandoned), paying $6 for a cosmetic skin seems like not only a fun visual treat, but a nice way to keep the updates coming.This is still a really good game.___________________________________________________________________________I Love It!Dont be dissuaded by the (few) negative reviews, this game is very much a dice and card based tabletop boardgame, and it does that quite well. There are multiple ways to win, and certain animals have a slight advantage depending on the way you plan to win, not that you are AT ALL limited in choices due to the creature you chose as your avatar.Dying is a part of the game. You WILL DIE. But depending on the strategy youre using to win, you may find that an occasional death is helpful. There is a lot of strategy involved, and as other people have mentioned, one roll of the dice may see you needing to completely revamp your strategy... but as a tabletop gamer, I'm used to that, and find it to be part of the challenge.Single and multiplayer modes available, and I find the AI on single player to be challenging and enjoyable... you can invite friends to multiplayer games or just queue up for a pick-up.  I got it for 25% off ($14.99), but it is definitely worth the $19.99 full price.As I write this, I have 18.0 hrs of play time, and that is in two days... so yeah, I kind of like it. If Settlers of Catan, Risk and Hayao Miyazaki had a baby, this would be it; and it is adorable!			"

								Armello is a turn-based game with cards and cubes with 4 different heroes, with different stats and abilitys where you have to win the kings trust and get retribution of citys while defending your self agens 3 other players either locally with AI or online, while deadly banes sneaking close to you to stand in the way.We have 4 heroes to play as. Thane the wolf, Mercurio the rat, Sana the bear or Amber the bunny. Each hero has it own stats and what their specialty is. Every player has 3 Ap start points (Points to move around the map). When you have picked a hero, you can choose a ring which will give +1 in a stat. When you're in the game, you can choose between 3 quests, and after that there wil be displayed your flag over a area you need to take care of to also recieve your quest items etc. Besides this, there is instances that gives loot, money etc. At night ""banes"" will come out of the instances and will hunt every city and player on the map.The cards gives you a overview of what you can do. Either you pick Item, Spell or Trickery. You need to be aware of what cards you have to win the fights and every card you pick might have a negative effect. If you spend your inventory on cards, you will lose cubes to throw, since they stand for the same. Be aware that some cards need gold before it can be used. The cards can also be throwed at your enemies or on your self or over citys to make traps, effect, health, damage etc. Making traps will show a icon on the area you placed. Besides all this, there is 3 types of gamemodes while playing to win the game. Each player can have it's own tactic and do the same. Either you:  1. Be a king slayer, 2. Spirit s tone victory, or 3. Prestige victory. The king has 7 health and is loseing 1 each day, when he dies some one need to take his place, but the kingdom is guarded by kings guard. If you kill or attack kings guard, the king will set a bounty on your head where every kings guard will follow you. Each game can last up to 60 mins, so you have much to look forward too!Besides what i've written so far, you can already see that the game has much to offer. If you have a hard time under the game, you can always press ESC and re-read the information you got in the first place to get a re-cap. I can gladly recommend this of it's huge amount of quality of content and playtime.Here is a demo:

								Armello, in my experience, is  a fun AND frustrating game. I cant put it down! The single player needs more story, I want to understand this world better than a simple ""click here, click there, the kings a jerk."" I wouldnt even know the charecter backstory unless I read the wiki. That said it's a very refreshing experience, I love Catan and Dungeons and Dragons,  Armello takes some influence from them, but without others to develop the world via voice or any charecter interaction it makes the nostalgia fade at a shockingly fast pace.I would deffinatly reccomend this game to others, Steam Early Access has been riddled with terrible games but it feels like the Devs deffinatly care about players and the product theyre creating. I cannot wait for the next stream and update! I want Armello to be as aclaimed as it should be. Good luck LOG!			"

								A fantastic game that really shows what can be achieved when board games are intelligently created with electronic play in mind. The early access phase has been great, with lots of communication from the dev team, and lots of new content added after listening diligently to the feedback of the players. The game mechanics are simple, yet allow for very complex play. The methods of winning are also quite varied, and the challenge of obtaining some of the harder victory conditions will keep you coming back for more. All in all, an excellent game, easily 9/10.			"

												Wow, where do I even begin with this game?Within the last 5 days of purchasing it, I have already clocked 24 hours, (not Skyrim can top that). At first I was weary because a lot of people didn't like it because it depends on chance. No, not if you play your cards right. It's very similar to table top games like Warhammer, the actual warhammer version. Once, I got a hang of it, I have so much trouble putting it down.Not to mention the art style and characters. They're all so pretty and unique, and speaking of characters each one has their own special abilities, but that doesn't mean you follow what you think they would.  Again, it's about playing your cards right.The music, the art style, the character design and style it just blends together well with the game design. The only flaw would be the multiplayer, my friend and I either can't find other people, or it cuts out really badly, (although I do like being able to replace players with AI)Also my friend said ""I would play this more than Call of Duty Black Ops 3""THAT's saying something			"

												Armello is addictive and fun, but a bit complex and slow-paced. One map could last for 1-3 hrs depending on the pace of the players. I would like to have a mode or a class where there's a limited amount of time to act upon. Also I'd really wish there was a better tutorial in-game and a Story Mode. So far it's mainly a online multiplayer game seeing as the single-map option where you play agianst bots quickly gets repetetive and boring in length.The game has GREAT potential with a turnbased system where you can move past a couple of tiles per turn and use several cards to alter the fate of your opponents and the game itself. Personally I would, as earlier stated, appreciate a story/campaign mode. The videos of the game here on Steam are a bit misleading, cause when I bought the game it was because it seemed like a story-rich game. This is false. Hope to see the developers add a story-mode in the future. I REALLY like the gameplay and strategy options of the game, so I have to give it a thumbs up even though I feel like I bought the game based on expectations that weren't met.Recommended			"

												Wow what a game! Being a huge fan of Board games and strategy video games, This is perfect for me. The art work is beautiful, music is splendid and the gameplay is fun and addictive. You will find yourself playing over and over. My only wish is that there was more diversity in the level design, Even then, Where this game is so new, Im sure more content is yet to come. If you are a fan of turn based games, or board games of any kind. Dont pass this up.			"

												Armello- Civilization with Animals? Not really.While there are playing cards and a hex grid with various gameplay elements incorporated… the combat is what held this experience back FOR ME. The dice rolling around on the screen make me feel separated from the game itself.I usually don’t play with friends, and that’s probably why this game isn’t 100% for me… the game prohibits interaction beyond a handful of speech bubbles. Beyond that is an interesting game… if you thought this would be a condensed animal version of Civilization with Cards- than maybe it’s not for you. But as a 4X fan who likes Hexagons I had to make room in my library. "

												If you listen carefully, when the villages are being sacked or catch on fire, the screaming villager sound effects are actually the screams from Roller Coaster Tycoon! XDI love this game. I like these types of animal portrayals and I love how it has a slightly Game of Thrones feel. If you love Settlers of Catan and the Civilization games, combined with like....the board game ""Sorry"" i guess XD "

Early Access Review
								DL;DR:Good game if you like turn based gaming with a fast game play.Over all 8/10, game as it is now needs more ""maps"".Short-ish:I backed the game on kickstarter and was verry happy when it got funded. Then some time later I a mail with a key for the game on steam and I was really happy. Then I played it and enjoyed it a lot, I have a friend whome I played with and talk about the game, so this review is based on what we talked about when playing.The game was easy to in to in just a few rounds we got to know what to do, but it still took a few plays to beat the AI (sad I know). The game has a fast way of playing with out to much happning at one time.There are diffrent ways to win the game and you can take more then one at the same time and then chance it later, it's not like you have to pick a way you want to win, it's just the way you play you have to decide wich way you want to win and then play that way.The game it self is a good solid game, I mean it's nothing SUPER RARE NEW TYPE kind of game and at the same time it's a new way of an old game so worth your time.

Early Access Review
								I grabbed this game last minute in early access, and I'm glad I did.  Quick rundown:The world of Armello itself looks great and feels very alive already, even though I've been playing for only a few days.  I'd love to see something like a single player story mode for each character in the full release or down the road, because I feel like the characters have strong potential for development.  That would also expand the gameplay possibilities in single player. As for the gameplay specifically, it seems complicated at first, but it doesn't take long to pick up.  There are tool tips everywhere, so you can figure out everything on your own at your own pace.  I also believe tutorials will be added for the full game.  That should help.I see just a couple drawbacks in the game right now.  First, it seems the A.I. is a bit overwhelmed by it all.  Once you have the basics down, it's clear that if you come in with a specific victory in mind, it's not too difficult to win a single player game.  With just one difficulty level, there's no scalability to the challenge; once you've figured out how to win, you routinely beat the computer. Second, it's hard to find a multiplayer game at the moment, but that's an easy fix as long as the userbase expands on full release. Those concerns aside, I'm quite impressed with this game, and it should only improve as it leaves early access.			"

												EDIT2: I finally got to playing some mp games and I must say wasn't very impressed so far. Firstly, I barely managed to play them because every time I found other 3 players and we started up the game it would disconnect. I verified several times that the problem is not on my end. - After finally connecting to a game it turned out to last veeery long because players don't have immediate actions like AI (and even AI seems slow after several games).- players can leave the game when they like without any consequence and then AI replaces them- there is a huuuuge amount of luck involved in the game (a bit too much for my liking)- I still recommend this game because it needs more players to get better and it has quite a bit of room to be better, especially because these are some very nice foundations, but I wouldn't call it a final product because it kinda lacks content.I kinda bought this game on a whim not knowing what it's all about. I just like board games.This will be a limited review based on just my first few hours and I didn't even play the multiplayer yet.I was only disappointed in one aspect -  there is no real campaign mode or something similar, but I should've expected that since this is, primarily, a multiplayer game.Tutorial was really nice and I think single player serves only the purpose of teaching you the game so you can get into multiplayer. That purpose is served well.The setting, art, gampleay are all very nicely made and as I said, this will be a limited review since I didn't yet play the biggest aspect of the game.EDIT1: I thought cards had to be collected for mp, but I was corrected by Goon for Hire (thanks). This makes it even better since you are immediately ready for mp.			"

												VERY well done game.The combat, graphics, story... Basically EVERYTHING works with this game.That being said, its lacking a certain kind of polish.In my brief time of playing, I have been constantly plagued by audio bugs, such as crackling audio, delayed audio, doubled and sometimes tripled audio, certain sounds not muting when the sound sliders are set to 0 (mainly the life-stones and the banes noises).Another grievance I have with this game, is the lack of a proper graphical options menu, instead you have the choice of, ""Very Low"" to ""Very High"" settings. I am aware that this is a duel launch game also made for the Sony PlayStation, but this does not excuse this. ALLLL of that being said tho, do I hate this game? No, far from it, I adore this game, to the point that in my brief time playing, it has managed to work its way into my heart,  topping off my favorite games, at least for the time being. On a side note, they really nailed the, ""board game"" aspect with the Dice roles. 90% of them resulting in your face being melted by the pure hatred of the dice, but the other 10% turn out to be as if some divine figure reaching down and giving each of them a soft kiss. TL;DR: If you like board games and can deal with a bad options menu, get this game, you will NOT regret it.(Also, no I did not just buy this because it has anthro characters...)			"

												I backed it on Kickstarter and it was the right thing to do. Armello is a great mixture between card, strategy and board game. The graphics and animations are amazing and so is the soundtrack. I haven't played the MP yet, but the Singleplayer gives you a good choice between different heros and especially during the first few hours you will always find new cards which can change the game. Replaying will always give you a slightly different map, different AI players and quests. So it's definitely worth the money. You can take your time to find the best strategy but you will also get a game for in-between, because one playthrough takes roughly an hour. 10/10 would kill the King again with honor, prestige and Soul Stones.

												Armello is one of those titles for slow tactical gamers that like to enjoy a Challange of the Mind and Patience... Only those who  know how to conceal their intent will stay out of the crossfire to win any given game...This game is all about the multiplayer so dont bother with the AI... Play the tutorial and jump in, thats it.The smarter player will always win. Choose your way to win and see yourself either trying to protect or kill the King in the Centre of the map. Recognizing the wintype your enemy is going for will almost always lead to easier victories.As a noob id go for prestiege wins first..As for now nobody really knows how to play so prepare for easy wins and ragequits.. All in all the game is good. I just hope it becomes more popular and people learn how to not ♥♥♥♥ up and ragequit -.-			"

												I'm a big fan of board and card games, so of course when I found this game, I bought it to see how it worked. It's a Virtual board game, so it couldn't be played in the real world, but is it fun as itself, ignring this aspect?Yes, yes it is. While I wish I could play with freinds locally with my copy (as some virtual board games allow.) Just playing it a few times wins me over. The lovable, visual charms of the game combined with the complex, yet easy-to-learn rules and mechanics made it a total blast. At currently 4 hours of play I'm certainly no expert on the entire experince, but the gameplay was fun enough that make me want to set aside more time for more games.Speaking of my little play, however, when looking at other reviews with FAR more play than I do, there's a common complaint about bugs that freeze up the game or make it unplayable. I've not encountered these, but then, I've only played about three full games.Final Thoughts: I own, and like, this game. I've not encountered any bugs, but they may appear more rarely, so who can know for sure? It's a reccomendation from me.			"

								After being exposed to Armello during PAX Prime 2013 and jumping abored LoG's Kickstarter, the game continues to grow concederably day by day.  It's one of the most perfect mashup with elements of Settlers of Catan, Magic the Gathering, Sorry, and a bedtime story that is classic and eternal.  I've spent more money eating out and got less in return than the cost of this game.  In short, the risk is low and the reward is high with Armello.			"

								Armello is a board game and  the premier game from League of Geeks featuring fuzzy characters, some RPG-like elements, and cards to help get a leg up on your opponents. This to me this is a great example of how early access should be used. The amount of love, attention, and focus to detail is shown. The devs are regualrly fixing major problems that crop up or fixing balancing issues. Speaking of bugs and problems there arent a ton in the first place that really cripple the game. It has its quirks from time to time sure, here's lookin at you dead bug-eyed bear. They are currently working on ironing out the first bit of content then we can expect to see more content. I can say if you are looking for a change of pace in gaming or if you are into in depth board games this one is for you.			"

								Hello!Armello really is a great game; people have likened it to Settlers of Catan, Magic the Gathering, Endless Legend, etc. It definitely has the feel of a board game, but in a semi-fast paced, strategy, top-down rpg added in. The art style is beautiful, and most of the mechanics are thoroughly ironed out for an Early Access Game. I admit, some things need balancing and it is lacking just a tiny bit more stuff. (i.e. Stealth really doesn’t work well, and AI needs to be buffed/has to have an easy-medium-hard slider.) But the game is already very complex and complete, with 4 characters to work with (4 more coming when it is fully released), several rings/amulets to choose from, and 4 ways to win. That’s not including the dozens of items, spells, and treasure you collect from wandering the smallish map and battling opponents.The price I feel could drop 5 dollars where the game is at currently, but it is still early access, and with the implementation of 4 more characters + the Ranked Mode, I would say it is a fair, balanced price at 25 dollars.A great recommendation from me!~Wolfy			"

								I fully recommend this game to anyone that is a huge fan of board games and card games or table top games in general. This game is simply beautiful, the music is phenomenal and sets a wonderful mood while you are playing the game. The art style adds a wonderful look and feel to the game with out taxing your system to the limits but also at the same time the game looks amazing and has a beautiful high definition look. The game mechanics are easy to learn and easy to play but with a deep level of strategy in the game. As far as early access games go this game is fully playable and feels like a complete game. The length of a match is perfect for board game fans and  players who want a quick satisfying game with out dedicating hours of play. During a match you never feel like you don’t have something to do which is nice in keeping players intrigued. Playing this game single player is a bit on the easy side but it is a good way to master the various victory conditions and try out new things before you take them online. The rpg element add a nice feel to the game and allow for each character to feel unique and diverse with a different play style. Simply a rare gem on the early access market that you don’t see very often.			"

												It's a fun game to play, and I very much recommend it. It's definitely a unique experience for me and definitely for those who like to mess with other players and get ahead for the win. There are a bunch of different characters and it's been fun experimenting with each and every one to find out your preferred playstyle and your favourite character. Plus with unlocking rings and amulets, you unlock ways to either alter your playstyle or buff it up which I quite like.The board's randomised from what I can tell so to me, it never feels ""same-y"". It feels like a new, fresh experience each time and it all plays out differently, which I'm very fond of. So, Armello definitely gets the thumbs up from me!			"

												First off, let me say that the game is fun. At times.The gameplay of Armello is that of a normal board game, with one objective, to become king (or queen). In order to do this, you have to remove the current leige. The twist is that there is four ways to win, which balances out characters quite nicely.  One of the pleasant things about Armello is its art style and soundtrack. Thats probably the only thing that keeps me from leaving a match that I am inevitably unable to have a chance at victory. But the game has a few, and utterly annoying, flaws.One of these flaws is the Constant disconnection that a lot of the reviews talk about. Keep in mind I have played the game for 110 hours, and let me just say, at least 1~2 games disconnect out of 3. I know it isn't my internet or my computer because I just got a new one that surpasses the recommended requirements. That aside, lets talk about the DLC, microtransactions, and rewards.Ah, Microtransactions. Sadly, with the 1.6 update, League of Geeks decided to add skins to the characters that are about $7 bucks a piece. It would be understandable if they bundled skins into a pack of four for each category of hero (Like the wolf clan, rabbit clan, bear clan, and rat clan), but they went the way most games are going now days. Essentailly, the skins only change the characters looks, nothing more, nothing less. Now to move onto the DLC rant.When the DLC for the Ursurpers was released, I bought it without a second thought. The characters are still pretty strong, but base game characters can still beat them. But, I am not complaining about that. Its the addition of the extra rings that are annoying. There is one such ring that allows the wolf clan 3 extra dice when they fall below 3 hearts. Sounds nice, but base game players do not recieve this ring because it is a DLC item.One last concern is the lack of variety in player character species. If you supported this game on kickstarter, then you recieved a character pack that added a few more characters (The Bandit Clan) than when you buy the game after its release. These characters cannot be used in multiplayer as of now because of unbalanced issues. Now, before all the early supporters get mad, I want to propose that the characters should be added as a DLC, so everyone could use them. I understand it was an incentive to support LoG, but they are just laying dormant in the games files. The Bandit clan added a little variety to the game.The species issue continues, however, in the actual game. The enemies you fight are the kings guard, who never change, the king, banes (Vulture like abominations summoned from the underworm) and the characters the four players chose. What gets me is that there are quest givers that are not apart of these defined factions. Like the spymaster, the blacksmith, the miner, ect. There should be a playable hero that is not apart of these defined factions.If you like board games with variety, then you may or may not like this game because it does get repetetive with the disconnections and long wait times, and there isn't really a variety with species. Also, before I forget, there is a nasty bug that just started to happen. When you find a match finally, the screen that allows you to join the lobby sometimes takes forever to pop up, and may not even show up at times.			"

								I don't think there's much I can add that already has been said, but here goes...Yes, it's a digital boardgame. There's a heavy focus on cards for items, spells, allies and playing nasty tricks on your opponents. One thing that differs from most turn-based games is that you can play many of these cards on your opponents' turn, so vigilance and timing is important. Both the AI and human players will play cards(if they can afford them) to stop your turn earlier or delay you in any other way. Not all players will like this, but it's definitely part of the game's strategy and I think hard core strategy players will appreciate this(after all I am one; takes one to know one, right?).Yes, several of the elements of the games are randomized. You roll dice to avoid traps and during battles. Your success in quests depends on how high your tested attribute is. Some players will not like this. However, it's not completely randomized. During battles and when evading traps, you can ""burn"" cards to directly add successes to your rolls. In quests, you can choose between three quests that test different attributes and even if you fail a quest, you are guaranteed a small prestige award and your tested attribute is boosted by one.One of the best things about Armello is balance. The game doesn't guarantee any one action during a turn will be successful. This means it's hard to exploit certain strategies and the Armello tends to reward the player who varies his strategies, at least most of the time. It also rewards players who adapt to ever changing situations. Players who unsuccessfully try to reach the same objective again and again tend to get punished heavily. That way, even a player who seems overpowered can be hindered significantly to the point that he is denied victory. On the other hand, a player who has started as the underdog can get the upper hand quickly depending on the situation. Armello teaches the player when to practice prudence and when to take risks. It also encourages experimentation. Not a lot of strategy games do this.No, it's not Disney. Don't be fooled by the cute-looking animal characters. Each has a deep and meaningful background story and the world they live in is pretty dark by cartoon standards. You can read all about it on League of Geek's website(just google Armello). More on this can be found in the art on the beautifully rendered(and animated) cards. A few of them are comic in nature, but most display sinister forces, wondrous treasures, powerful spells and sometimes, a cruel world. The object of the game is to dethrone the king(by any means necessary more often than not) and every part of the game demonstrates that. The music is almost melancholic in nature, it reminds me of winter for some reason, but it fits the atmosphere of the game nicely and is very pleasant to listen to.Yes, the game is not finished. There are still a few problems with the public multiplayer systems, but the developers are working furiously on it. You can still enjoy a private game with friends or go head to head with the computer in single player. The AI is not the smartest, but it can still surprise you from time to time. Either way, it's constantly being improved. There's plenty to unlock and discover in the game while you wait for the full release. Every game is 30-45 minutes, rarely going above an hour and very replayable. It's the kind of game you can play in between bouts of another Steam title to change things up, prevent boredom or avoid carpal tunnel syndrome from excessive button-mashing.All in all, a great game, with the potential to be greater at its official release.

												Time to wage war and anarchyBetray and spin the web of liesOnly to lead the land to deathThrough Cunning and DeceitThrough Strength and HonorI shall take the throneand only one to rule them allI shall lead Armello to truth and life!I shall bring peace once moreAnd bring the land to its name!-----------------------------------This game board game is a well-made game. It's alot of fun and great for friends! While turn-based, other players can place traps and other cards to help or hinder others. A free-for-all battle to the throne allows players to think about tactics and play that would favor the player. Risky play are rewarded, but there are moments safe options are a better choice. This game is a great game to play and losing in a game can be enjoyable (or salty). This game is worth picking up!Plus, the cards are animated! WHO DOESN'T LIKE ANIMATED CARDS?			"

								Besides the fact that this is a digital depiction of the original Armello board game, it's quite a great mash-up of Board Game / CCG Card Game / RPG and story / quest driven entertainment. Constantly adding new features, cards, characters, unlockables and quests. I won't say much more because, I don't want to spoil ANY of the features and game play. I, myself, own a low-end laptop PC and the game, before starting all the animations and itself, alered itself to operate optimally outside it's available graphics settings, in order for me to be able to play (SUBJECT TO CHANGE due to developments; I can no longer run this fantasic game now, but do not let that detour you from purchasing this game at all, still a very fantastic title; make sure you meet ALL the minimum system requirements before purchasing this [edit added:8/12/15]). LoG definately is immersing us ALL into this title to make it a community favorite and keep us happy. I foresee this game becoming a ""Cult Classic"" in the future.~11/10 Burns~			"

								Armello is one of those games where your decisions matter. Each turn is short and sweet and has consequences and rewards. No tedious turns or units to manage.Positives:- Each playable character is nuanced enough to allow varied play styles without losing the overlap that makes characters feel balanced with each other.- The art style. This level of polish for a game still yet to release in full is impressive.- Each play through takes around 40 minutes to complete.Negatives: - The Spirit Stone and Rot win conditions are difficult to pull off and happen mostly from exceptional RNG luck. (although when you win via these methods you feel awesome)- The difficulty of Perils is sometimes too high, with no guaranteed way of avoiding them. This leads to more failures than successes, but victories can be achieved regardless.			"

								One of the best early access games out there. The game is wholly playable, including multiplayer. It takes a moderate amount of time to finish, but it never feels too long or too short. Like Hearthstone turned real cards into a fun, digital game, Armello does the same with a turn-based board game.I do have some gripes about it, which is kinda expected from a game in early access. The AI difficulty is laughable and more often than not they manage to get themselves killed. I have yet to see an AI actually win a game. Having to play lots of games to unlock some of the content is frustrating, but thankfully the system isn't DLC and you don't have to actually win to unlock stuff.In its current state, I would say it has a 7/10 rating. Just needs polish around the corners to make it a must-buy.			"

								Very surprising and thoughtful addition to the digital board game genre. Despite the lack of a tutorial (at least until release), the game is very easy to start playing right away and only gets better as you continue playing more games. Some would argue that the game is a tad pricey but it's well worth it considering this game is one of the most polished games I've seen in Early Access and I don't regret getting it one bit.			"

								Armello I think is a fun early access game. That being said, a few things hold it back:- The map, although randomized, never changes its basic structure, and therefore feels very similar in each game.- Limited environment tiles. You're on a mountain, forest, or swamp every turn. (other than structures, which there are only 4 of if you include the king's castle.)- Only four playable heroes. (Many more on the way i hear though.)- No custom game rules/Not any options really.THAT being said, it's an early access game, and a bunch of those will probably change! What I really did enjoy was:- The Art.- Playing with friends.- Card and dice system.- Current victory choices.- The game takes awhile, but not too long.Would I recommend this game for an EA buy as a fan of board games and strategy games? Yes.			"

Mercurio weighted the Spirit Stone, smiling to himself. This was the last one. He had everything he needed to break the curse that had nearly devoured his king. And it was just in time - the king's mind faded with each day, and before long he would be beyond saving.On his way to the castle, Amber, the infamous gold-digger crossed his path - the ignorant fool! Couldn't she see that his task was infinitely more important than quarreling over riches? Mercurio felt little regret as he pierced her heart.To make things worse, Thane, the lord steward, fell to the curse, too, and driven mad with the rot, he was battling his way through the king's guardsmen.Unfavorable circumstances forced his hand; Mercurio had quite the way with words, and a fat purse to emphasize his arguments. He claimed the title of lord steward just in time to sign a decree that rallied additional warriors into the castle.The king was safe - for the time being. All that remained was to overcome another valley, another forest; and the ever-present Banes. It was a rough journey, but Mercurio did not come so far to fail now; battered and bleeding, he stood before the palace gates at long last... imagine his surprise when the very guards he rallied to ensure the king's safety approached him, weapons at ready!While he was busy battling the Banes, Thane, the corrupted madman, had put a bounty on his head!This was the moment of truth. Mercurio played all his cards, pulled all the strings; accompanied by a group of mercenaries, he cut his way through the royal guard and into the throne room, hastily applying the Spirit Stones -despite the circumstances, HE DID SAVE THE KING AND ENSURE PEACE AND ORDER THROUGHOUT THE REALM!---The point: this game is absolutely charming and magical, and the people behind it clearly love what they're doing and care for Armello.Worth every penny <3			"

								Hello!Armello really is a great game; people have likened it to Settlers of Catan, Magic the Gathering, Endless Legend, etc. It definitely has the feel of a board game, but in a semi-fast paced, strategy, top-down rpg added in. The art style is beautiful, and most of the mechanics are thoroughly ironed out for an Early Access Game. I admit, some things need balancing and it is lacking just a tiny bit more stuff. (i.e. Stealth really doesn’t work well, and AI needs to be buffed/has to have an easy-medium-hard slider.) But the game is already very complex and complete, with 4 characters to work with (4 more coming when it is fully released), several rings/amulets to choose from, and 4 ways to win. That’s not including the dozens of items, spells, and treasure you collect from wandering the smallish map and battling opponents.The price I feel could drop 5 dollars where the game is at currently, but it is still early access, and with the implementation of 4 more characters + the Ranked Mode, I would say it is a fair, balanced price at 25 dollars.A great recommendation from me!~Wolfy			"

Early Access Review
								Kickstarted this game a bit ago and while the art style is gorgeous I'm left hoping that they'll fix some major issues I have with the game when it hits full-release.CONS:1. The tutorial is lacking and always feels a step behind the gameplay. You get plopped into the game and it just sits there. I didn't know what to do with my cards, how I moved, how to fight...everything was confusing.  I've played these types of games before so I DID figure it out after a bit but it was still worrying that a tutorial didn't kick in and say ""Oh by the way here's how you do this thing!""2. Win/lose conditions aren't entirely clear. This goes back a bit to the confusing turotial, but quite a few times I was left wondering how or why something happened. I defeated the king but also lost? I killed this player, I survived...but also died? There is probably something I missed in some dialog box somewhere explaining this, but as it sits now it just left me disgruntled, confused, and annoyed. 3. The music/audio clues need work (This may seem a bit nit-picky, but I believe it's worth noting). I realize that this is a pre-release version, but as it currently stands the audio of the game needs work. I found myself getting bored from the game's repetition that it was honestly putting me to sleep at 4pm. When things happen in the game that is a big deal (dying, battles, monsters appearing) there needs to be a bigger impact on the game audio. 4. The game is, quite frankly, boring. This is harsh, but it needs to be said.  Everything about this game LOOKS like it should be a fast-paced adventure game based on mostly skill and a bit of luck, but it mostly ends up feeling slow and repetitive. The enemies don't feel scary, your deaths don't feel like they mean anything, and most of the time I end up saying to myself, ""I have no idea why that happened...what's going on?"" Yes, with time I'm sure everyone can learn what is going on and why things happen, but currently it doesn't feel rewarding enough to want to continue on. PROS:1. The game is gorgeous.  No really, this game is beautiful. It's very obvious that the art team spend a ton of time working on the art for not only the game board but also the game cards. The GUI is beautiful and streamlines and everything just makes sense as to where it is on the screen.  2. The gameplay is smart. While certain things I've mentioned before need work, once you actually get to the meat of the game it's pretty good. Draw cards to gain followers, items, spells, etc...but make the wrong decision and you may be missing a necessary item when you go to fight an opponent. You need to plan a few turns ahead of time to figure out if you want to hide, stockpile gold, or attack. It's not a new concept in games by any means, but it IS an interesting one. ConclusionWhile still in pre-release stage, I'm fairly happy with the way it is progressing. No major game-destroying bugs to be found yet, the gameplay is smooth, and for something technically not finished it played extremely well. For all of the CONS I gave it I'm still very optimistic that the development team will work out all the kinks in the future and this will turn out to be a terrific game. "

								As an avid collector of regular table top board games Armello immediatly caught my attention. A single game can last 20-60 minutes (depending on the luck of cards/dice) but at any moment you may have to rethink your strategy depending on what someone else is doing (or if something is done to you). Since I have played enough games to unlock all of the characters selectable abilities I can say it is fairly balanced right now. The only improvement I am waiting on is the implementing of new cards there is about 20-30 cards I haven't seen out of the 40+ games I have played.I recommend you support this game if you are an avid player of board games and if you see any bugs please report them to make it even better.

												This is my first review on steam, so I'm going to be somewhat soft.First off, I think the game looks very well done and playing is enjoyable. The graphics looks great, the map textures are awesome, and I like the 3D models for the characters on the board. I like the animated battle scenes. they look great to me and change the pace a bit.  If there is one or two things I would change, it's the battle system and a story mode for the single player. Sure some strategy is used to place yourself in a favorable position, but it comes down to luck when it comes to getting cards and the die rolls. Can't tell you how frustrating it is to lose to someone who has lower health but get an awful roll. I've played a few time, losses on my part, and I still go back to play more. Adding in a story mode will give more depth into the lore of the Armello world and maybe even discover a thing or two about the characters.Overall, the game is enjoyable, this is a game where you'll learn from your mistakes and try to get that win that you always want through prep before game start. Yeah the battle system can be tweeked a bit, and maybe add in some sort of story play for the single player.			"

								This is what Dragon Commander tried to be and failed miserably at. Few games do the 'living board game' genre justice, where you take the core of what makes a fun board game, and a fun video game, and then mash them together. Armello has harnessed that magic masterfully and I can but recommend them and bow to their prowess.If you like video games, will you like this? I dunno. I guess it depends on what sorts of video games you like, but if you're anything like me (or Ron Gilbert, who's apparently also like me) then you have the capacity to enjoy a slower paced game. It wouldn't be fair to compare it to strategy games, though, that's not its jam. It is very much the living board game that everyone has been trying forever to make. If you like board games, will you like this? Definitely. This is a form of dark magic that brings a board game to life to be played in a way no other has.Not only that, but this game has a remarkable amount of lore behind it. How far did they go? There are audio books (!!) for it, which are beautifully done and excellently voice acted. I'd genuinely recommend grabbing those, too, as they make Armello such a complete experience. Armello is a place, a world, on a desk for you to interact with.Give it a try. It's like nothing else you've ever played.			"

												Want to point out that I really like the concept of this game. For the little bit that I've played it, it was really fun and I was hoping for a very imervse game. Graphics for a table top are fantastic and the involvment is nice. That being said, I do see one game play problem. The system in which to fight seems horribly inbalanced. The multiple ways of attacking with explosions are nice, but defense you fall quickly. Needs to be better worked out for that.And don't know what's been going on, but I haven't been able to try it for very long without frequent crashing. It could be my pc, but can't say for sure. I just bought my laptop a couple of weeks ago, so shouldn't think so, but since I'm on an extended out of town, can't test it on my pc. Good luck for everyone else though.			"

												This is my first review on steam, so I'm going to be somewhat soft.First off, I think the game looks very well done and playing is enjoyable. The graphics looks great, the map textures are awesome, and I like the 3D models for the characters on the board. I like the animated battle scenes. they look great to me and change the pace a bit.  If there is one or two things I would change, it's the battle system and a story mode for the single player. Sure some strategy is used to place yourself in a favorable position, but it comes down to luck when it comes to getting cards and the die rolls. Can't tell you how frustrating it is to lose to someone who has lower health but get an awful roll. I've played a few time, losses on my part, and I still go back to play more.

												While a splendid concept on paper, and sporting some of the finest visuals you can imagine in a board game (the cards look completely amazing), the game is ulltimately too random and too glitchy for me to recommend. There is an overwhelming dependence on luck, and skill means little to nothing when your quest spawns on the other end of the map while hostile enemy entities spawn right around you and neutral units block your way, combined with new randomized rules every turn which usually make the game even more chaotic.This, coupled with the numerous bugs (many of which stop the game completely, such as the enemy AI crashing) makes it very hard for me to recommend this game I originally kickstarted.

												I want to love this game, I really do. It's just that it's held back by absurdly clunky UI, lack of graphical options, and the fact that stat-boosting items are progression locked for some inexplicable reason. While the game's atmosphere and its core mechanics are interesting, it's just bogged down by its appalling execution. There is a strange lack of borderless windowed in the video options and there is no way to turn off the clouds above the game board if you try to zoom out. There isn't even a way to look at the whole board, nor does the in-game UI give any at-a-glance information. Instead, you are stuck clicking in and out of menus just trying to keep track of each player's information. The gameplay itself is incredibly boring, even by board gaming standards. Eighty percent of the time is spent waiting for things to happen, only interspersed with several seconds of dice rolling, reformulating strategy, or watching the AI take its turn. Even the amount of RNG in the game is exceptionally high. While granted, there are several ways to reduce the RNG required, the sheer number of times it comes up-- spawning enemies, loot tables, King's choices, perils, dungeons-- puts it way over the top. The card decks are heavily watered down with seemingly no copies of cards, meaning that the chance of drawing specific cards in order to avoid RNG or simply be useful are slim. The only way to remove useless cards from your hand is to blindly charge into perils or combat in order to 'burn' them. If you want a strategy game, look elsewhere. If you're into dice-rolling and short trips to your local Taco Bell but can't afford to play Warhammer 40k, then this is the game for you.			"

tl;dr -> After losing friends while playing physical Catan at someone's house, you can boot up Armello and ruin friendships even more from the comfort of your own homes. 11/10 would load Tabletop Simulator to flip digital tables again.I received a review copy of this game and was very excited to try it because I have a deep love for tabletop games, and this one seemed to blend many different archetypes of the genre like dice-rolling, card mechanics, and map tiles. After playing both the singleplayer and multiplayer game modes, I was extremely pleased with my gameplay experience. Be advised, however, that the game truly shines when played together with friends; singleplayer may get dull after a few playthroughs.If you enjoy playing tabletop games – especially ones with dice-rolling, cards, and map tiles; managing only one character, and playing against other people, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good – the amount of detail in the character models, terrain tiles, and everything else is high and very well-done. The dice-rolling looks and sounds like actual dice, and the cartoon-style battle animations are fluid. The map can eventually become repetitive because the only change between each playthrough is the randomization of the tile placements. The sounds and music are great and create a nice fantasy atmosphere.Controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. There are a number of tutorial missions that help you learn the gameplay mechanics and how each clan works. The learning curve is mostly minimal to moderate depending on your experience with tabletop games. Although the AI can be fairly challenging, the game is meant to be enjoyed with friends, so do not base the difficulty solely on the singleplayer experience.Gameplay revolves around beating your opponents in a variety of ways, with a rapidly dying Lion King as your turn timer. After every player has completed their turns, the King will take one damage (starting the game with 10 health points) and issue a royal decree. The royal decree will change an element of gameplay until the next round – for example, one type of decree will force all players to pay 5 gold, and any unable to do so must give a piece of equipment. The player with the most valour points chooses which decree will pass. Valour points are obtained in numerous ways, such as completing quests, defeating monsters/players, et cetera.During your turn, you are given a number of action cards (categorized as magic, equipment, and guile) based on your character’s wit, which also determines your maximum hand capacity (high wit = more cards). Equipment cards may give you bonuses like extra health or dice. Magic and guile cards can benefit you (similar to equipment) or harm opponents (ex: damage someone within range). To play cards, you need gold or mana (if you are using a magic card). Cards played on opponents usually require you to be within a certain range of tiles.You are allowed 2-3 moves, however, moving onto a mountain tile will cost 2 moves (but also provide a bonus to defence). Swamp tiles will damage you for one hp, ruins will give you a random event (yielding cards, damage, quests, etc), and town tiles will be captured and generate gold per turn.Quests can be selected when you begin, and completing them will grant you an item, bonuses, and valour points. To finish a quest, you will usually have to travel to a specific tile and can either risk a full (there is always a % of success/failure shown) or standard completion (higher chance of success).The King sends out castle guards, and monsters spawn during the night- these can be fought for valour, however, attacking a guard will put a bounty on you (that other players an claim).During combat, your attack rating determines how many dice you get to roll; endurance determines how many dice you get when on the defensive. Cards/equipment can boost your dice count, and “selling” cards allows you to lock in a particular dice roll (for example, selling an axe card guarantees an attack roll, removing one die from your total pool). Your attack rolls are subtracted from the opponent’s defence rolls, and any excess do direct damage. It is possible for you and an opponent to kill each other. In the event of a death, you respawn on your next turn in your specific corner of the map, losing a number of valour points.To win, you may do a number of things. If the King dies from his ailment (he is inflicted with chaos), the player with the highest valour wins. Killing the King, collecting all the spirit eggs from ruins and entering the castle, or attacking the King when you have more chaos points than him (you get chaos points from killing monsters/players) will also allow you to secure victory.Overall, the gameplay is fleshed out very well, allowing for smooth, fun experiences. The singleplayer can be a bit lacking due to repetitiveness (without the human element). There is a lot of replayability because you can unlock different starting items and abilities for your characters (usually by winning with them). Anyone interested in digital tabletop games should definitely give this title a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

												While I do not recommend this game. But it's not because the randomness in it. It is dice based and as such much of the game is quite random. The reason I don't recommend this game is because it's very shallow. A game takes about 1 hour and sometimes less. The different factions have some small differences but all in all they are quite alike. After playing about 4 games (each of the factions) you've kinda tried everything.On the positive side, the different cards are very well made and beatiful to behold. Obviously, this doesn't make up for the fact that this game is very repetitive. I'd love if they had implemented more maps than just one.. Perhaps that would have made it 2-3 games more interresting, but in the end I'd not have played much longer.If on offer for about >10 you should take it. Otherwise, use your money on something else.			"

												I have not only bought this game for myself but also convinced 3 more of my friends to buy it so we can all play together. And instead of getting rewarded after each game, we do not get loot so if we need to get any dice loot (without having to buy it from another player) we have to play against strangers. That may seem ok BUT you are not allowed to work with your friend to achieve victory since everyone seems to threaten you that you will get banned because you are cooperating. A crappy loot system and developers who are banning you because you have a different opinion about the most ridiculous loot system in any game. The reason they have stopped loots from 4man premade games is to prevent people from farming dice...when they have ALREADY added a limit to how many dice you can get daily which makes the whole thing contradicting to itself. All in all a nice game but only if you don't have enough friends to play it with (and i wonder if i am the only one that thinks it should be the other way around in the worst case scenario)For the record this is my ban message:""Actually i am wrong about the COOP tag...but nontheless there is nowhere a statement when you buy the game that that is the case...so still my point is valid""Ban Reason:""Intentionally provocative and disrespectful language, directed at both the developers and peers. Breathe, relax and treat people with respect.""			"

												Having reached over 100 hours in-game, and with a new update recently released, I've updated what I had originally written to reflect both the current state of the game and my thoughts on the matter.TL;DR  -   Armello has a wonderful visual aesthetic and lore but has about as much ""deep and emergent strategy"" as yahtzee or mario party.  Gameplay has an overwhelming reliance on RNG, resulting in skill and tactics offering no significant impact on the game's outcome and making the gameplay generally frustrating.  Armello is additionally hampered by numerous graphical and UI bugs, a finicky matchmaking system, and one of the worst online multiplayer netcodes I've ever seen.  Well over half of the multiplayer matches I've attempted have never been finished or even started due to one of the issues listed above.Avoid if you have any love for strategy board games and videogames, Armello is nothing of the sort. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I originally wrote a review for the game last year, shortly after the game's release, with around four or five hours of gameplay on my belt.  Although the game had beautiful visuals and a stellar artistic design, I was more than a little bit disappointed in the actual gameplay;  over-reliance on RNG for most of the game's challenges left little control to the player and made most actions unnecessarily frustrating.  I could look past the frequent crashing, bugs, and the sheer difficulty of finding a full game, but the gameplay was a real dealbreaker.As of May 2016, the game's currently on version 1.3, and I have spent roughly 100 hours in-game.  There have been a number of changes made to the game's balance, additional content added, and some new mechanics implemented.  However, the real fundamental issues with the game were not fixed...  If anything, they've been increased with each update.  In it's current state the gameplay is so unbelievably FRUSTRATING that it overpowers whatever good the art, sound, and design give, and the developers really don't give any indication that it's ever going to change.  The real kicker here, though, is that most of the time you aren't even going to experience ANY of this.  The game's multiplayer functionality is completely broken and sporiatically functional, frequently crashing, freezing, or ending multiplayer matchmaking at a moment's notice.  The issues plaguing multiplayer matchmaking have been around since launch, but despite reassurances by the devs that they're working on fixes very little has actually been addressed.   Let me explain my gripes with the gameplay in more detail.  Although the store page proudly claims that Armello has 'deep, tactical card play, rich tabletop strategy, and rpg element', spend a few hours in game and you'll quickly find that this is false advertising;  The gameplay is almost entirely dictated by randomness (in the form of card draw, success chance, or dice rolling), leaving virtually no room for any actual strategic planning.  When just going for a ride and messing around, the game's fine fun.  But, the moment you TRY to do something, be it as simple as moving to a specific tile or killing a near-dead creature, you'll more often than not be met with stupid amounts of frustration.Wanted to move a couple of tiles to reach a quest?  Oh, sorry, you spawned an enemy bane that knocks you back, wasting a precious action and forcing you into a combat.  Have six dice for a peril challenge and need to meet only one symbol to beat it?  Sorry, you never rolled what you needed and you succumb to the trap.  Need some defensive equipment to ward off hyperaggressive players?  Wouldn't it be fun if all you drew for three turns straight were scouting, rot-related, or sword cards?    Forced into combat with an enemy, and have to push it out of the way to progress?  Hah, wouldn't it be a shame if you dont roll a single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shield[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com], resulting in your spontaneous death and sending you back to start?  This level of crap doesnt happen to you EVERY game, but its not a rare occurance by a longshot, and in each game hands down at least one or two players are going to get the short end of the stick while the others move unhindered.  A little RNG is good for games, as it keeps them fresh, but EVERY ACTION you can do in this game is a gamble with very little reward and a whole lot of risk.  And, unlike other games heavily reliant on RNG, there's NO limitations imposed on it.  You're equally likely to get ♥♥♥♥ed over when you're down as you are when you've spent the game trying your best to stay in the top.  When the latter happens, it's pretty annoying, but when the former happens you flat out want to uninstall the game.      Even when I win, it never feels earned, and from personal experience none of the players ever leave these games feeling particularly happy or satisfied.  I WANT to like Armello.  I keep diving back in now and then and try to find some kind of enjoyment for this game, but every time I end up closing the game for the same reasons.  I do feel like Armello is a huge waste of potential and could be a much deeper, skill and strategy-based game... but right now its just 'pray to the RNG gods for good luck'.If you're art-focused and don't mind bad gameplay, can look past the astounding amount of ui, graphical, and gameplay bugs, matches randomly freezing, online randomly booting you out of parties, and horrible AI, you might enjoy the game more than I have.  But there's no way anyone in their right mind could ever call this mess a good strategy game.			"

												A pleasant suprise! I'm not too familiar with any turn-based strategy games and this has essentially been my first introduction to the genre. The art style is really appealing, each character you can choose from have their own unique play style, and there are multiple endings that can be triggered. The strategy portion revolves around planting traps, claiming towns, gathering necessary gear, and choosing which ending path to go down. I'd recommend this game on sale or at full price.			"

Restricted Comment system during online play, keeps the trolls quiet.House rules galore for playing with friends. Competent AI for Single Player or the very occasional DC by other players.Occasional bugs, but open lines of communication to report them anf get them squashed.All in all a must buy for those who like board games.

												Fun game, but was completely unaware there was no singleplayer campaign to speak of. Read they have no plans on implementing one, that's a bummer.The art is very impressive with a unique style, it's something I'd expect from a blockbuster game. The 2D and 3D art meshes very well and the animations(both 2D and 3D, again) are top notch. Props to whoever the artists are!The gameplay itself is interesting, but I haven't played enough to really comment on it as I'm still learning it.Overall, I'd recommend it if you're aware that it's not really meant to be a singleplayer game. I don't regret buying it despite not researching it first, I'll probably play it with friends from time to time.Also, it works flawlessly on Linux which is always a plus for me.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful.The gameplay interesting and fun. It's sort of a cross between a board game and a tactics game.But what I absolutey love is the stunning graphics. Each and every single card you use in the game is animated, character design is amazing and there's so much detail to UI and animations!			"

												Armello. The Game thats ruined more friendships than Mario Party, it's a pretty cool game i guessSet in a fantasy world where the king of armello (Aka the lion king) has been infected by something thats called ""Rot"" Which basically means that he has gone mad and wants to do something!... yeah they never really explained what he wanted to do. Anyway! The citizens of Armello decide that since thier king is sick and needs help. They are going to end his life. even tough he hasn't really done anything (Yet... i guess) So you and 4 other players are tasked with quote ""storming the castle and becoming the King/Queen of Armello"" end quoteIn the game there are up to 4 clans that you can play as:The Wolf Clan, A clan so racist they will only wolves be part of it. The Bear, Hare And Rat clan are just as racsist as the wolf clan and will only let one specific race be part of thier clan. And every single one of these clans want the kings head. No ExeptionsArmello is essantialy a game about betreyal,Murder,suffering and death. Just like Mario Party.The Characters you get to play as are: A Werewolf, A female Werewolf,Winnie the Pooh's parents, A rat ninja assassin, a normal rat that nobody likes And 2 wierd HaresWould i recommend this game?YesDo i have any friends left? No10/10 i regret nothing			"

The art direction is beautiful, filled with animations and visually pleasing graphics.The soundtrack is very atmospheric and blends seamlessly with the games' many soundeffects.And the story, though tragic is equally powerful and immersive as both the visuals and the music.The gameplay itself is rewarding in every sense of the word, with things like microrewards just for participating in games, and a myriad of other ways to keep hope lit during a particularly unlucky streak.

But since there's little restrictions with what cards can be played on other people's turns, you quickly learn how to not only speed that wait up, but keep yourself busy during it.As with any game boasting this much variety between every match, luck can of course also become an obstacle.

												I'd heard it described as a ""Game of Thrones board game with animal people""... That's not far off.At its core, this is a board game. Or at least it's styled as a board game. Besides the tutorial, there's not really a campaign. Each play offers you a small array of quests to choose for your character that form into something like a story. And that's fine: You're not playing against the program. In true board game fashion, you're playing explicitly against other people.The game is designed with enough complexity and win conditions close enough together, so that it never feels as though there's simply no hope. If you're not doing so well with one strategy, try switching to another. Play is well-balanced and fun. The art and animation is absolutely gorgeous. It all blends together to build a very well-crafted board game-like experience.If you enjoy the turn-based spendor and strategy of board games, Armello is perfect for you. Grab a copy for yourself and convince a couple friends to buy, and have a great time. If you find board games in general kind of slow and not really to your taste, it's simply not for you.			"

												The game is fun to play, there is no real story line. It is more like a board game you sit down to waste an hour or two doing. My only complaint is that it is incredibly easy to have both combatants kill each other. There are 4 ways to gain an attack move, but only 2 ways to gain defense, and one of them is being lucky enough to pull good armor from your deck. Also, the decks aren't tailored to each individual (i.e as the rat clan, there aren't more stealth based gear/magics). Still fun, worth 10-15			"

Very addictive, simplistic to understand, yet complicated to master, video game style board game. It's on sale right now, and for $13.99 it's a great gem to add into your collection if you like turn based and dice rolling style games. Very nice art style. Just a lot of fun to play. Bring your friends, but the game does have an active multiplayer community. No chatting allowed, emotes only in game.			"

Once again Steam didn't log all of my playtime and didn't record some of my achievements, I am working to fix this problem. Now Onto the ReviewTabletop games and video games feel mutually exclusive to one another at times. Tabletop players often think that video games are too easy, and video game players think that tabletop games are too needlessly complex. What if there was a game that managed to keep the challenge of tabletop games, but presented it in a more straight-forward way for the main stream video game audience to understand? Well, you'd get Armello, a game funded by Kickstarter, put into early access and now fully available on Steam by the developer and publisher League of Geeks. It's as if the world famous Redwall books made a pact with Game of Thrones and decided to make a game, and its results are fascinating.When it comes to gameplay, that's where Armello shines because it tries to make each and every experience unique so you'll never be playing the same game twice. You start out from the clan that you picked and you choose a quest. You can do this quest by moving across the game board to the appointed area, and there you can either choose to do a dangerous action or take the easy way out. If you take the easy way out then you'll complete the quest and gain prestige, but if you do the harder path, you'll be forced to play a game of chance, which might give you new items and more prestige. This game of chance isn't completely random since your success rates are based around your stats inventory and such, so you can turn the odds to your favor. At the beginning of each turn you're given the option to draw items, spells or tricks. Each can benefit your character in different ways, like giving them armor or chasing guards away from your point of interest. They're also a way of gaining more prestige for your overall goal. Prestige is the amount of points you gain to sway the king to your side, and if you lead in prestige you can advise the king to do actions you want him to do, potentially destroying the other players in the process. Gaining prestige one of the main ways you can win the game, along with gathering Spirit Stones, gaining more Rot than the king himself from various sources and becoming corrupted to kill the king, or just normal old killing the king. Each of these can be gained more efficiently by some characters than others, and it's up to you to figure out which characters are best at each strategy through trial and error or a guide online. Though you can figure it out through deduction from their skills, stats and abilities. Any character can do any role, but some excell slightly better at some roles than others.

SummaryA gorgeous game that seems simple at first but has a surprising amount of well-balanced depth.ReviewArmello is essentially a board game.  Actually, it’s a very complex board game that could only exist in any practical sense on a computer.  When developer League of Geeks created a physical prototype during development to hash out the gameplay, the result required two dungeon masters to keep track of all the rules and calculations, which I imagine made it a chore to play.  The computer, on the other hand, is an extremely capable dungeon master and is able to make the numerous calculations in a split second, so Armello matches are always fast-paced and fun.The King has come down with a sickness called “rot”.  Every morning he loses one point of health, and every evening he gains one point of rot.  This serves as a ticking clock because the King’s days are explicitly numbered - eight, to be precise - so games can’t drag on forever.  A menagerie of armored and weaponed bears, rabbits, wolves, and rats make up the four heroes vying for the throne, and whoever has the most prestige points when the King expires wins the game.  Of course you can be more proactive and seek to claim the throne by killing the King yourself before he succumbs, or you can collect four soul stones and cleanse him of his affliction.  There is a fourth victory type which requires you to become corrupted with rot and then kill the King, but this is generally the most difficult victory to attain and therefore the rarest.  You know, now that I describe the premise, it strikes me as rather brutal, but this isn’t immediately obvious when the main players are adorable woodland creatures.Players take turns moving their characters across a small hexagonal landscape and playing whatever cards they happen to be holding.  You acquire prestige by completing quests, killing banes (bird-like monsters from the underworld), and killing other heroes who then lose one point of prestige and are resurrected at their starting point.  Whoever has the most prestige at any given point in a match has the King’s ear and can choose which of the King's edicts to enforce each morning. This gives the prestige leader a small advantage, but it's mitigated by the fact that the edicts apply equally to all players, including the prestige leader.  During a player's turn, they can explore dungeon tiles which use a coin toss to decide if players are rewarded with treasure or if they awaken a deadly bane, claim towns which give gold, encounter a variety of perils that use dice rolls to determine if you succeed or fail, set traps for other players with trickery cards, hunt down soul stones which periodically appear in the mysterious stone circles, and pursue player-specific quests to improve your character stats. While you might be tempted to sit back and simply watch other players make their moves, it's important to realize that you can still play cards to the board even when it's not your turn. In fact, off-turn play is an important strategy.When you first play Armello, you may think that a prestige victory is the surest and least risky, and this might seem unbalanced.  After all, you just have to keep your prestige total higher than your opponents’ and wait until the King expires.  But by its nature, this is the victory that also takes the longest to achieve which leaves a big opening for more aggressive players to storm the castle at the center of the board and go mano a mano with the king or cure him with soul stones.  The prestige leader also has a big target on his back and will be under constant threat of direct attacks and treachery.  It’s not unusual to see the “Prestige Leader” title change hands several times during a game, so a prestige victory is never a sure thing.  It's often best to pursue one of the other victory types while keeping a prestige win as Plan B.One of the more curious aspects of Armello’s design is how the developers have gone out of their way to conceal information.  It’s impossible to zoom out far enough to see the entire board, and once you get a small distance away, your view becomes obscured by clouds and haze.  Basically, the developers allow you to get an overview of your immediate surroundings, but they actively discourage you from playing that way.  If you want to get information about your opponents, you can open a panel that covers most of the screen and then page through each hero’s status sheet one at a time which can be a little tedious.  League of Geeks has said they do this deliberately to discourage “metagaming” because they want Armello to feel more like an adventure than a board game.  Basically, you’re either doing recon on your opponents, or you’re watching events unfold on the game board, but you can’t do both at the same time.  I will simply say that I don’t entirely understand or agree with the developers’ reasoning here, but it’s not a deal-breaker.One thing I can say without reservation is that Amerllo’s presentation is outstanding.  This is a low-priced “indie” title, but it looks like it came from a AAA studio.  The heroes are well animated and full of detail and personality, and the game board is a lush palette of gorgeous terrain and a lovely day/night cycle.  Then there's the various cards which feature beautifully hand drawn and subtly animated illustrations which put even Blizzard's Hearthstone decks to shame.  In short, this is one fantastic looking game.One of the more unique aspects of Armello is the dice system.  Dice rolls are used to determine whether you succeed or fail a peril, or how you fare in battle.  And when I say “dice rolls”, I don’t mean an under-the-hood random number generator but physically simulated three-dimensional dice that bounce around your screen.  Depending on the situation, there could be as many as a dozen dice in play which can be quite entertaining to watch.Most importantly, Armello is fun.  Matches against the capable AI can be as short as 20-minutes if you enable fast AI turns, so there's always time for a game, or you can dive into multiplayer if you want a real challenge. I've seen people complain that victory or defeat depends on random luck, from coin tosses to dice rolls to which cards you draw from the deck, but isn't that the case with every board game, real or digital?  This is, of course, where player skill comes in, and there are various strategies for dealing with runs of bad luck.  It’s the skillful player and not the lucky player who will win. I think this is a good start for League of Geeks, and I could easily see Armello’s rich tapestry expanded into adventure games, RPGs, and even the 4X strategy genre.			"

												Beutiful game with a sound track to match! It is really fun to play with your friends, but I would not recommend buying it to play by your self. It would be nice to see a story mode, or some way to utilize the amazing cinematics. In short, I recommend getting Armello, but only if you have some one to play it with.			"

												Like settlers of catan, but much deeper and no commerce. Mechanics seem to have been well balanced. Very unique take on an old table top combat system.Follow Up, after purchasing the Usurpers add on: still balanced, but now seems a bit easier to get corruption victories. Magna and Elyssia are awesome, but struggling with the other two newbies.New Bandit Clan announced and looks very cool.			"

												I LOVE IT! It's incredibly interesting and fun! I play board games a lot, Catan, risk, warhammer, etc. I havent played a lot of card games though. However, this game combines both! It's strategic from the charcter you choose (Different charcters are better for completeing different objectives) to how you play your cards and how well you watch other players movements, battles, items. 100 out of 10!

												Armello, where do I begin. The moment I saw the trailer of the game I was hooked, in 1:30 it managed to get me excited for the game. I'm not going to talk graphics and such as each game that's being released nowadays looks great, and so does this one. As for sound, after playing a couple of rounds I grew bored with it, turned it off and putt on some Youtube. Not to say it was bad, but you know, you can only listen to the same song and jingles that many times.Controls! Oh boy, I have a couple of gripes here. One being the cards being to close to your dice in combat and perils. Sometimes you roll dice when you meant to grab the last card to burn it, it's annoying. This is pretty much the biggest one, but there are numerous others. Camera resetting to a zoomed in position while you zoomed out, your camera being jerked everywhere when something happens, I think you get the idea, I'd say it's annoying, not game breaking. Bugs! This game is great when you play it casually. When you're trying to get the achievements, not so much. I had it happen numerous times that I was going for an achievement and the game just froze, in the menu, between turns, rolling dice, for no reason at all. This gets really frustrating at times and makes me want to punch the screen. Multiplayer. There is one, but I'm not going to try it because of the above reason. And also because there are exclusive characters you could only get when the game was being kickstarterted. I'm not playing against characters I know nothing about, it's an unfair advantage and these characters should be DLC at some point, be it with in a different skin, or some other model, I'm sure there is some solution.Should you buy it? Well, the game is worth the money, I'm at 44 hours now and have yet to get all the achievements, and some of the other unlockables. If the devs first work out the bugs, tighten the UI, and level the playing field multiplayer wise it's a solid title worthy of your collection.			"

												Guess I should have reviewed long ago but I am quite new to steam apparently.Overall, it's a boardgame made digital. It's intrigue. I've always wanted to get the feel of a board game, with dungeon master and so on. And this game sort of digitalized the real paper table game, and creamed with beautiful graphics, highly detailed environment and cute looking fluffy characters. For what it is, looking at the real board game now is less appealing anymore because they are all flat papers, decolorized statues, packed cards, tokens and have to calculate the maths yourself. And there's no special effects (unless the dungeon master got creative) like clouds, snow, day and night cycle. And since its automated, everything is running based on strategic skill and luck (rolling the dice). And I imagined having this feature sort of reduced the chance of players going against the dungeon master for ""fairness"".In the game players can either choose to go against each other or form an alliance (sometimes temporary). The main goal is to win the game in the end. And there's only one victor. Though most of the time I would just go in, and enjoy the pretty graphic, killing the monster spawned, or simply annoyed the hell out of other players by setting traps all over the map (to loose some steam). XD The cards of items and spells are fully animated, and I would dazzle by each new cards drawn. There is a downside to this however, the entire game Armello is still running on a board game system. It IS a board game in the end. While we normally won't have any feeling towards the little miniatures that we used to symbolize our place in the board, after looking at the cute, beautifully animated animals we control in Armello, it's hard not to develop any feeling towards it.  While the tutorial prolouge did give off some insight to the characters, I would really looking forward for more. Like how the characters would really interact with each other in some kind of RPG way. But that brings me back to my early statement. When all boils down to it, it is a board game after all (digital version).For those who are looking to enjoy a board game experience with friends, ranged from 1hour 15 min to 2 hours give or take. I would recommend trying it out. It has pretty graphics and very cute looking animals in it.			"

												A four player board game with great artwork, music and animations. The gameplay is addictive and each game takes around 40-70 minutes. There's plenty of smart mechanics which makes it run much more smothe than other turn based mp games. You can equip items or cast spells on other players turns, and select quests AFTER you finished your own turn, significantly speeding up the turns. I had high hopes when I started playing this game and it exceeded all my expectations.			"

												Pro: Visually pleasing, strategy plus a little luck goes a long way, very detailed cards, characters, and quests.Con: Spirit Stone victory is pointless, collecting them is a waste of time, as they don't do anything. Wish there was more quests to do, less chance. Can not customize a character very much.I would like this game more, if you could unlock permanant upgrades/outifts to the characters as you play one more. It would also be nice to have more spirit stone rules, like being able to steal from others.			"

												Armello is a fun, light hearted fantasy game which features a rich experience in terms of playstyle and visuals by incorporating animations and detailed artwork to its card selections. There are a number of heroes each suited to a different playstyle, and every game leads to a new way to approach victory. With the random cards offered and different perils one can encounter, it offers a great amount of replayability and is fun with single player or friends in the multiplayer skirmishes. Makes a great gift or a purchase for yourself, either way someone's guaranteed a fun experience that dutifully recreates the feel of a classic board game, updated with interactive visuals and intuitive play. Definitely worth a try, you wont' be disappointed.			"

												This game is chocolate-covered bacon. A flashy video game with the heart of a solid board game. A sweet coating of eye candy with dark undertones. The gravity of Game of Thrones blended with the charm of Redwall.Given a casual glance, this may appear to be a strategy game or RPG, but make no mistake... this is truly a multiplayer board game experience in digital form. Expect much card-drawing and dice-rolling. All players take turns in succession. Complete games are fairly short, about an hour or less. It's very tightly designed, trading unnecesary complexity for satisfying depth. Each playable character has its own unique strength. While waiting for your turn, you are able to choose quests and play cards, so the thumb-twiddling common in many board games is minimized. Breaking from strict physical game tropes, there is a modest amount of progression in the form of unlockable amulets and rings that grant bonuses.On top of all this, it's very pretty, the character designs are delightful, and the animated artwork on the cards is just wonderful.It is not without its faults, though. Randomness plays a very large role, especially since conflicts are resolved with dice rolls. However, you can ""stack the deck"" in your favor with equipment and followers, and by burning cards. Also, the AI tends to make some pretty silly decisions at times, particularly when it comes to attacking the king. I have not played public games, so I cannot comment on the general experience there.Overall, Armello is easy to recommend if you love board games with dice and cards, especially if you can play with friends. If you are not a board game fan, this is still worth a look for its uniqueness and fun multiplayer.			"

												Armello is an engaging game that I really liked. It has it's basis in board and dice games, and I found the learning curve pretty easy. The graphics and music are beautiful. It has single player as well as online multiplayer. Each game takes roughly half an hour. There are 4 different ways to win suiting different play styles, fight (fight and kill the king, and live), Spirit stone (Gather 4 spirit stones. You don't have to fight anyone if you don't want to), Prestigue (have the most renown from completing tasks/killing banes or other heroes when the king dies) and Rot (one of the hardest victories for me.)I would definately recommend this game.

												Armello is a visually beautiful, tightly designed, quick-to-play adventure. I tend to play by myself, but multiplayer is functional and offers a bit of a different experience. I love this game.It's rare to find a game that packs so much, narratively and in terms of interesting mechanics, into a 90-minute session. All of Armello's characters are quite different from each other, and there's a lot of variety in how you set up your character to start. Once the game begins, though, it's time to be flexible, because with dice fights and card draws, you've got to enjoy rolling with the punches. I disagree with the reviewer who said that everything is determined in the first few turns -- things can, and do, change suddenly. If you want to set things up perfectly and then have them go exactly according to plan, you'll be thwarted.Armello is well worth the money, and so is the expansion. It's fun, thrilling, sometimes heartbreaking, and just technically really well done. The studio crossed their t's and it shows, and I hope they continue expanding it in the future. I would definitely throw down cash for an RPG set in the same world.			"

												Let me start by saying this: Armello is a fantastic game, one that I could spend hours upon hours playing for my own enjoyment. It rarely ever gets old for me personally.Armello is an anthropomorphic digital card/board game developed by the awesome people at LoG, featuring beautifully and lovingly crafted animations/artwork created by several artists, lovely background music/sounds that help to immerse you in the world, and some pretty sweet gameplay that provides unique chance and strategy based challenges. Not to mention the fully animated 3D heroes, dazzling winter/summer maps + tiles, and a cool story that's sure to have you hooked. Some may criticize the amount of RNG that occurs in this game, but really, I feel like it isn't any more than it should be. Sure, the chances may be annoying at times, but not once has it pushed me over my limits. (Basically, it didn't cause me to ragequit.)Here's a quick little bit of lore, to anyone who might be interested in this game: Basically, the King of Armello has become infected with a horrendous disease known as the Rot. It is slowly killing him a driving him mad, causing him to do outrageous and destructive things. The four clans (Wolf, Bear, Rabbit, and Rat) have put forth their heroes to take the throne and become the King/Queen of Armello by any means: Killing the King in a fight and winning, letting him die of natural causes and becoming the ruler through popularity (prestige), banishing the King with four powerful chunks of ore called Spirit Stones, or becoming an even darker lord than the Corrupt ruler, using his own rot against him in a war of sickness. You must spend the game finding resources, becoming powerful, and rising up in Armello's world of politics so you can face the King yourself; but remember, you aren't the only one with eyes on the throne. You have competition, who wish to steal the crown for themselves. The perils of the treacherous landscapes have doomed heroes for all eternity... but they have also made Kings and Queens of the unlikeliest of characters.Not only is this game top-quality in almost every aspect, but the fact that LoG is constantly putting out Updates just continues to improve the game. I could go on a whole rant about how our community is probably one of the best game communities I've ever been a part of, but I'm going to attempt to stay on track with this review.So far, I've mentioned several positives about Armello. But trust me, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few things to be desired, and the main ones are the Multiplayer issues that appear often enough to be frustrating. Lately, I've found that I get kicked from the network at random, though that hasn't happened very recently. The game would crash for pretty much all of the players involved if it happened to one. Also, there have been complaints about not being able to return to a multiplayer session after disconnecting, but there isn't much that can be done about that. LoG themselves have stated that those particular aspects of the game have more to do with Steam than anything, so if you've disconnected, you're disconnected. Not much else to say.One last little nitpick I have: Singleplayer can become somewhat boring after a while. If played enough, the patterns (though mostly RNG based) can become familiar, and I've found that I can predict many of the AI's moves. However, AI is exactly that- Artificial Intelligence. Besides the very advanced specimens of their kind, AI will rarely ever maneuver a hero with the unpredictability and calculation of a real human player. So that, I can let go.To summarize, here's an organized list of Pros and Cons for ya:PROSIncredible game quality/experience. Top-notch graphics, orientation, and design.A lovely track; pleasing to the ears, but sinister when it wants to be. A true conveyor of the mood.An immersive plot - interesting lore and fun tidbits of story scattered throughout.Over 100 animated cards that directly credit the artists, in-game, a great sign of respect for these awesome people!Multiplayer games help you meet new people, observe new and interesting play styles, and this can really help you improve your own actions while in Armello. I noticed that, after playing nonstop multiplayer games these few weeks, I've gotten much better. AND gained a couple of awesome new friends!A fairly constant stream of updates from the Geeks themselves. I speak for the whole community when I say that their dedication to us has been beyond incredible.Awesome custom dice skins to boast!CONSMultiplayer related issues involving game crashes and lost network connection.The occasional bugs (which, mind you, LoG works VERY hard to eliminate)!Two or more players ganging up on one in particular. Sometimes people will make ""Teams of Torture"" where they play just to torment the odd player out. I have not come across such people before, but I know of some who have. Be reasonable, please!Leeches... people who sit at their clan grounds and continue to end their turns, simply to farm Chests and Keys without having to do any work. The very REASON LoG put these items in the game was to get people to play some Armello with each other! Avoiding doing any work while playing with people just isn't fair.I don't have much else to say in terms of Cons, because I have very little against this game at this point. 9/10, LoG, highly recommended to anyone and everyone. <3			"

And i'm always up to play armello in between other games.Sitting back and relax.BUT even i understand the Skins etc added to the game are to help the devs.It is still sad to see them beeing pricy.They are only skins, so they won't take away from you'r experience of the game !Just wanted to point that out since microtransactions arent the best business model out there.A DLC pack like the heroes and season pack wouldv been smarter to do with a game like this.Again its a good and sollid game for us boardgame fans !enjoy the game, and i hope you role the dice correctly, stay away from the rot !!!and save the kingdome !sorry for the bad english.

												In Armello, you play as a hero representing of one of four clans (Rat, Rabbit, Wolf and Bear) vying for the throne of Armello. At the start of the game, the King of Armello is infected by the Rot and starts dying slowly. You and three other players must gain prestige, fight battles and cast spells while the king descends into madness and finally dies in order to ensure your place as his successor on the throne of Armello. I've fallen in love with Armello for several reasons:  It is a deep strategic tabletop-like experience with multiple paths to victory and interesting decisions throughout.  It has an epic scope with games lasting around one hour and half with each turn being more exciting than the last and never leaving you bored.  The game design is top-notch, its greatest success is that no matter how behind I am, I've never felt out of the game.   It has beautiful 2D and 3D artwork and animations.If any of this sounds interesting to you then I hope to see you in Armello.			"

												I don't often write that many Steam reviews, however I felt like I had to for this one.To put it simply, Armello is a fantastic game. There is so much about this that makes me squel with joy when I play. It's just oozing with love and you can clearly see that the developers, League of Geeks, put a great deal of effort into this title. There is a ton of character and charm behing this. The art direction is fantastic. The whole game idea is just so good. This is one of the best ""tabletop to video-game"" takes that I've had the joy to play.There are a few things that I would like to see get added to the game though.First, I would love it if there was another game mode. This is obviously something that would take a ton of effort to produce. However, I'd be more than happy to pay some if this was part of a DLC pack or something. The base game offers a ton of variety. This is due to the fact that you can aim for a variety of different victory conditions. It would still be cool if there was a secondary game mode that was some other task than trying to deal with the king and his rot. This could also be an avenue for creating a game that lasted shorter. As it stands, the games take quite a while (not too different from a board game). Some people might not always like that, or have the time to sit down and play for that long. If there was a secondary one that went quicker, that would be awesome.Second, just give me more Armello! More heroes, cards, quests, and all the like! I just love the game so much, having more content to it, even though it really does have a ton right now, would be so sweet!Sorry for the long review. If you can't tell, I really, really, love Armello. So yeah, if you like strategy and/or tabletop games, get this. Seriously. It's fantastic.Alright. Gushing over.			"

												I've been playing this game on and off for months.  I make sure to get in one game at least every day, simply because its that much fun.  Playing with friends only makes it THAT much better.  Only thing I could ask for is more characters, particularly from the Feline Clans and Fox Clans, but otherwise, a beautiful and well thought out game indeed!			"

												Short version: A delightful, quick, fun game. A dice & cards based combat system. Easy to play, fast game matches, custom modes. Worth the price but a must buy if discounted. Good as a single player but more fun in multi-player. Worth it.Long version: This is a fun digital boardgame that allows you to take as much or little interest in your opponents as you wish. Choose a character from the different clans that best suits your style whether that be sword & adventure, subtle & stealthy, magic & trickery or a mix.Graphics: The cut scenes are very nice, the cards have small animations that a subtle and humourous whether this is a stranger twitching his eye or seeing a bear get struck by lightning and seeing the skeleton & ribcage light up, it's a nice touch, The movements are smooth and the rigging on the characters have been done well. The interface is easy to use and clean.Sound design: Decent mix of music and sound effects. The ambient environment sounds can be repetitive and annoying at times but zooming out removes those but they are be overwhelming if you are zoomed in at maximum. The music is good but there isn't any theme or music cue that really stands out but it's enough to give you a decent feel of the mood but it isn't the most amazing soundtrack which I think is probably the low point of the game which means the rest if pure gold.Game-play: Tough to describe as it's a mix of drawing cards, dice rolls, substituting dice rolls if you have the right cards and using passive abilities at the right times as well as gaging when to use active abilities based on the day/night cycle.It's fun. It's easy to pick up. Each character has a very distinctive play style but you don't have to beholden to that and can easily play your own way. I like that it can be a very coop game until the last few rounds as it becomes a race to the crown but it can just the same be played as PVP all the way through.Overall I'm impressed with the game's theme, style, structured tutorial which is heavily story-line focused making you gain an affinity for the characters then suddenly have them turn villain on you as soon as you are invested in them emotionally.Looking forward to seeing what else the devs bring out. Excellent.			"

												I love this game already. I've played many great graphical games but few have given me the kinda of thrill I had tonight on this virtual board game. As Thane (the wolf) I was locked into this epic duel with the king as we both constantly kept endlessly drawing each other other in attack versus defense with him down to one HP and me down to 2 WHILE fighting off rivals THREE times all in two turns! It was amazingly epic.This game is really addicting but every game has its cons sadly. But there's really only 3 i can mention, so I will just name 3 of each of my biggest cons and pros.Cons:-Short gameplay. Even ""Epic"" setting isn't long. I don't like that the king auto dies after a period of time. At least let him retain one HP or have an option to turn rot off on King or something.-Map can feel small. It has some random generation but 4 heroes + 2 - 5 kings guards and banes (or even more) all at once can make it feel congested. That means lots of battles, which can be hard on people trying to be more stealthy. It might be just my lack of experience so far, but it seems flat out battling with decent equipment is the way to go. Did a round as the Wolf and never died once with a defensive build while managing to kill off most people by sacrificing saved up cards for +damage rolls when I felt needed to.-Lack of customization. I don't think there really needs to be one but it would be nice if we could, say, create a custom with our own name of choosing, cycle models and pick the one we like most then pick a playstyle or something. Either way, implemented or not I enjoy the current characters a lot. Pros:-Creativity. Man does creativity come into play or you could find yourself surrounded by enemies. It's not a bad idea to draw some spell cards or trickery cards to lower someones HP or find a way to make a quick getaway.-Battles can get intensive and the world change instantly. You can go from peaceful to people surrounded by banes and guards going after player bounties. I love the complete randomness of it! Even quests are never a promised reward.-Freedom and Politics. Politics can change the flow of the game. And I love going from being the prestigious kings right hand man to stabbing him in the throat the next turn for fun.In the end, this game is amazing. It's random, can change in a flash, and when you get into it you can FEEL the struggle sometimes. Seriously, worth the pay.			"

												Great artistic design, cute and charming characters, and a good, if quick board game to boot.  Recommended with friends!  We all know the positives, so I'll take the time to list out some moderate to mild issues.  NOTE: I have only played singleplayer so far.Number one!  OPTIONS MENU.  PLEASE LET ME ADJUST DETAIL MORE SPECIFICALLY.  Medium, High, and Very High run at around the same framerates but low bumps me up to a flat 60 no problem.  I want to enjoy the aesthetic but dropping below 30 is unacceptable to me.  Unfortunately, Low has the most drastic change and blurs out a lot of the detail.  Two: AI could use a bit of tweaking.  Sometimes they'll walk into swamps and...die.  Oh.  Othertimes they'll be great.  Varying AI difficulty would be nice, if difficult to integrate, but it would go a long way into extending the longevity of the game.3: Game balance?  Prestiging seems like the easiest way to win right now, at least against AI.  More often then not, I inexplicably end up with 5-6 prestige a few rounds in (without trying) while the AI generally has much less than me.  There need to be more prestige debuffs, I think.  Also, it seems the more cards you hold, the more likely you'll be able to win, so that might need to be rebalanced as well.			"

												A fantastic collision of whimsy and extremely detailed game mechanics. This game is very, very in-depth, and each playable character represents a completely separate gameplay mechanic, as well as completely separate rules to win a game. If you don't play the lengthy tutorial first (which simulates an actual game), you will be lost. The narrative is quite good too.The card animation and art is top-notch.10/10.			"

												Armello basicly is a digital boardgame in which strategy is important. You play against 3 other characters, which could be AI, or online players/friends. I must say that when you play against AI, you are almost sure of a prestige victory or a kingslayer victory when you choose the right character and have the right items equipped. Although, luck must be yours, since it seems that the game also depends on the luck you have.It has amazing animations and artstyle in both the board and the playing cards. The fighting scene surprised me, since this is not like the rest of the animations, but is still amazing.I normally play games that support controller with a controller, but I must say this game is also perfect for keyboard.I've played AI games of around 50 minutes, when not playing on double speed, and online games of around 1h30m, since turntaking takes some more time. If you've played with all 8 characters available at the moment I write this, it's best to move to online, because of the earlier mentioned reasons. When playing online, everything can happen, even going from prestige leader to last in the final round.To summarize:Beautiful boardgame with amazing artwork, though it can get a bit boring if you don't play online.

Armello, an online board game with turn-based strategy. I’m astounded by the progress and expansion of this game. Followed it since its Kickstarter days! I’m looking forward to even more updates and expansions.4 clans fighting to overthrow a corrupted king. Though all with the same goal, there are a handful of different ways to go about it. There is so much variety in characters, cards and strategies to win the game - which is what makes it so wonderful. On top of the gameplay, it’s aesthetically-pleasing. The world is beautiful and the characters are finely crafted: It’s clearly shown how much effort the devs put into this game to make it as great as it is. Armello is awesome you guys! ‘ v ‘			"

Posted: January 9, 2016
												It is amazing to me that I have yet to write one of these for this game but this is what I have to say about Armello. Armello is an amazing game, with astonishing visuals, awesome battle animations and amazingly crafted characters and variety that just screams ""MUST REPLAY"". Even with rather light-hearted customization abilities, the character personalities and the separation via clans has you clutched in a constant internal battle of which character best fits you and what clan do you truly belong to. (Personally I prefer Rat clan, Mercurio is love, Mercurio is life).The game really is simple to learn and easy to pick up, with hundreds of card combinations that allow for a different experience within each play through. I always find myself delegating each character to different victory types only to realize that I may have misjudged one, and having to play even more Armello to truly discover the potential each character has. Having 4 Victory conditions, that being in Spirit Stone, Rot, King Slayer and Prestige also adds to the pace and variety of the game, as you may find yourself geared towards a King Slayer Victory only to realize that you have 4 Spirit Stones or a ton of prestige and thus having to change your method of plan in order to better suite the type of victory that you are geared towards. This also allows you to find different ways to play the same character and really discover their potential even further. The game is loads of fun, every game is different, every play style is different, and having so many characters to choose from (with more coming soon) really allows for a fresh feel every time you play.  The board design is beautiful, with the chance of winter occurring and snow being sprinkled all over the land, as well as a really awesome transition in animation whenever you enter a battle sequence. The swift strikes of Mercurio's blade, the bulky bludgeoning blows of Brun's Mace and even the Cute and Adorable expressions that Barnaby makes when he swings his hammer really adds personality to the battles. But don't let that adorableness fool you because Barnaby can really kick♥♥♥♥♥ I wlil admit the damage animation really surprised me as well I definitely wasn't expecting blood and the sound effects that accompany really instill the feeling of pain in you, you almost do feel annihilated when you are super over-killed by any character. This definitely livens up the battle and makes it a much more invigorating aspect of the game to engage in.I will say this however. Armello is hard to master, but not because of real complexities of the game and characters. Yes you can customize the stats of your character in so many different ways offering so many different ways for you to play, but at the end of the day Armello is all luck. Yes there are ways in which you can modify your stats and skills in order to better yourself for victory but everything down to the bone of this game is luck. The cards you draw, the dice you roll, the gains from dungeons, the spoils form quests, everything is luck and in the end you are basically finding ways to manipulate RNG to work in your favor. Which brings me to defense. Armello loves seeing the attack dice stack up to ungodly amounts, (I myself have had 20 attack dice in a battle before) with 3 sides of the dice awarding you with a hit on either time of day corrupted or not, you can literally get infinite attack if the RNG works in your favor. Unfortunately there is only 1 of the six sides that awards you defense, making it extremely difficult to survive in some cases. Yes there are items and cards that can remedy this but again it is up to the luck of the draw and luck of the roll to gain shields. Even with that, you can enter a battle with 20 dice against someone with maybe 5 and still end up dead due to favored rolls for attack and getting no shield dice. You only need so many hits to kill and so many hits to survive and more times than not you will find yourself overkilling by massive amounts only to get hit just enough to die, making the overkill, very enjoyable to receive but meaningless in the end due to dying anywayIf you are looking for a game to play ""competitively"" Armello is honestly not your game, sure there is that wonderful rush of ""you are never truly out of the game"" but more times than not it is the game just rewarding you with lucky rolls and draws than it is you being rewarded for playing skillfully. Which is unfortunate because while it feels great to win games in Armello (believe me I take so many screenshots and share them happily, they make great desktop backgrounds) some of that glory is taken away by the shear fact that as strategic and skilled as you can be in the game, 90% of that was still RNG potentially playing in your favor or it playing your favor when it mattered most. With that being said, I have played well over 300 hours and as frustrating as this game can be (believe me, it really can) it has that charm and style that makes you want to play more. Part of it is the competitive player in me not accepting a loss and having to prove the might of the rat clan (RNG please Mercurio loves you) but another part really just is the connection you establish with the game. The characters in my opinion are more than board pieces manipulated across a board. They are characters with personalities and styles that give life to the game you are playing. For the longest my twitter handle Read *Rat Clan* because I truly enjoyed the witty gameplay that came with Mercurio and the rat clan. This game is tons of fun to play with friends, and still an experience to behold online with other players. But I can completely understand people growing weary of it after a few hours of play and there are definitely ways for this game to be even better than it is.I end this by saying one of the biggest reasons I still play and have played over 300 hours is the community. The developers are really invested in the community, listening to forums, chats, hell every week they have a Dev v Community game stream where you can face the devs (I won one, not many people can say that ;)) and that really breathes a deeper life into this because you become even more invested in a game that you know is not only bringing you a satisfying experience but one that is listening to you as well. Mercurio knows that he can be OP sometimes but he is doing his best to understand your pain and tone down his desire to Hoodwink you. Buy the game, it is worth it, even if you only play a few times!			"

												Beautiful game. Great to play with friends. I haven't played much online against random people, so I cannot comment on that, but playing with people you know is a lot of fun. There is a bit of randomness in the game, but it keeps it exciting and makes each match different. It can be a bit hard to comeback if you fall behind, but there are many ways to win, such as going for wyld stones, or slaying the king near the end, so you can always pursue a different course of action if your original way isnt working anymore. It keeps you on your toes and forces you to figure out the best way to proceed given the cards you have and your location on the map.Definitely a fun board game with lighthearted elements and gorgeous animations.

												Overall, I find Armello to be a unique game with a lot of effort put into stylistic artwork, sound effects, and music design. It is really a multiplayer game best played with a group of 3-4 friends. I can't say that I found it to be riveting, as at times it does seem to be somewhat repetetive in the way that it plays out, but nevertheless I have enjoyed playing the various characters, who each have their own strengths and strategic paths to victory, and the overall vista of the map. One criticism I would really like to make, and what better place than here, is that there is an effect where somewhat transparent clouds obstruct your view of the map when you are fully zoomed out, I assume as some kind of 'atmospheric effect', but in actuality it is very annoying and I would prefer a crystal clear view of the board at all times, if it is available to me.

												This is a very fun game that takes some tactics and planning, you can't just rush to a victory off the bat, and the RNG is real, it doesn't allow save scumming either as far as I have seen and tested, results are results, So you have to accept it and move on. Death isn't perminent or even the end, it's just a setback, so you have to plan properly for both combat, and spiritual stuff, and know when to use basically 'trap' cards. I highly Recomend this game, and best of all, no voice chat, so no annoying children screaming at you about the size of your♥♥♥♥♥♥or how they ""pwnd"" you, not even text chat, only default test gestures you can use!

												This is my first review on steam. I have played about 80 hours on the game and have probably unlocked all the rings, each game taking about an hour or so. I bought this game out of curiosity since the graphics were just amazing to look at. The sound impressed me as well. What I like about it is that it is a friendly game that doesn't have in game chat. It kind of hinders the social experience of the game but keeps it civil, instead having the built in text to choose from. This game has an interesting concept of having four ways to win which is rot victory, highest prestige, 4 spirit stones, and defeating the king. It's really fun how there are lots of ways to win and kill your opponents. There is a lot of strategy going on, such as skill cards, magic cards, and trap cards. You must go on with your quest while defeating your enemies and winning by one of the four victories. There is a lot going on in this game. The dice is also an excellent touch, since it allows you to click on it randomly which allows it to be fair aND challenging. Beware that although I do recommend this game, there are still more developments that should be made. Such as when the Internet connection is loss, you are automatically kicked out and cannot join the same game. Penalties for leaving games should be longer since it destroys the overall game play of having to play with AL players. Ranked matches are also not availible yet. Overall I recommend this game despite its ongoing developments because it is visually satisfying and fun.			"

												An addicting and amazing boardgame with a relatively steep learning curve.The game has an amazing vibe, good compelling dynamics and is beautifully, masterfully crafted in order to make RNG not only competitive but not that frustrating!!So to explain how they did that (or why I believe they did) I must first say that, I bought this game as a boardgame designer, to understand some really interesting peculiarities.It is imbedded in RNG and as far as transparency goes, this game is not an example. So is it bad? No...As a strong believer in pre-production and heavy design in order to combat rng and give space to balance and skill, this game showed me new possibilities for luck and uses it in a way that hasnt really been seen in Boardgames before.Most decisions in the game, involve luck ( % ), however, it is post luck, as in, first macro decisions (where you go, what you do and so on) then micro decisions that will have luck mechanic. To illustrate: you gear your character, move him on the map and decide whether you want to engage in luck events or not. IF you do, then your gear, character info (relative to race, buffs, etc) shall weigh the outcome of the event, may it be a battle or some other encounter.So luck serves as a weight to your moves in order to make the game more competitive and dense Strategically wise.Furthermore, the game uses really amazing Aesthetics to brush off unecessary intensity and soothe your experience, as a hot soup blow. So when rng does get on your nerves, you will barely notice it over the amazing music, illustrations and whole experience.The only con to the game, is the amount of info you must attend to simultaneously. Meaning that, while it does have a good UI, it uses the fact it is a digital boardgame, to incert more information than anyone could possibly process. PLus, the learning curve is indeed steep and although tutorial process is connected storywise, it is still a dull process....All in all, this game is really really good and worth cutting through the tough leathery learning membrane. Online games are really intense but still manage to maintain the shoothing game's vibe. 8/10			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWAs an avid play of board games, tabletop RPGs, and computer games, Armello was an obvious choice to try. A very beautiful game with a lot of care and craft put into it so far, but not without its problems. PROS:- The artwork is amazing, making even the humdrum activities like running into perils (traps set by other players or npcs) or picking out items sublime. This alone is worth the purchase IMO.- The blend between board game and computer game is carried out well. While on the surface Armello may appear to be an adaptation of a board game for computers, what with the map, the dice, the cards, etc., the automation of the game format allows complex rules and events to be streamlined in a way no board game could reproduce smoothly. It manages to be both casual and relaxed while still involving the players and suspending disbelief.- The graphics are not only serviceable but quite nice to look at. The aesthetic is strong visually, and there's very little clutter. The models for the characters and npcs are very faithful to the art.- The sound, while not spectacular, is pleasant and fits the thematic elements of the game nicely. After hearing the music over the dozen or so games I've played I can still say that it's not grating. CONS:- The price point of $25 is a bit steep if you ask me. Perhaps it's just because it's still early access that I feel this way, but for those of us on a tight budget it's a shame to have to hold off on purchasing such a beautiful game for want of funds. - Understanding that this is still early access, I can't help but feel that, after 18 hours of playing this game, it's starting to wear a tad thin. They do release updates fairly regularly, adding new cards and quests, but it is starting to feel repetitive. There's only one game mode and right now only four characters. This means that every game of Armello will run pretty much the same way, with some variations. Apparently four more characters are coming with the full release (in fall maybe), but I'm not sure that even that will be enough to get me to invest another 18 hours. Generally the game follows one of three possible outcomes (prestige victory, spirit stone victory, or killing the king), with the same time limit every game based on the king's deteriorating health. Personal quests vary the game quite a bit, but often you can only get one or two done before the game's conclusion.I would like to see the introduction of optional modifiers. Perhaps options to extend the game, or perhaps team-based play could help the repetition. Or maybe different ending objectives, such as we see in Talisman, could improve replay value. Something like a bane-rush mode, where Banes spawn more rapidly, or where players work cooperatively to repel them. CONCLUSION:This game has its problems, but I don't hesitate to recommend it. Quite possibly the most beautiful game I've ever played. It plays to the strength of the board-game style while keeping things smooth and exciting with the speed of a computer game. However, don't expect to get it on sale before full release; the devs have specifically stated that they do not intend to put the game on sale any time soon.			"

												Beautiful game. Great to play with friends. I haven't played much online against random people, so I cannot comment on that, but playing with people you know is a lot of fun. There is a bit of randomness in the game, but it keeps it exciting and makes each match different. It can be a bit hard to comeback if you fall behind, but there are many ways to win, such as going for wyld stones, or slaying the king near the end, so you can always pursue a different course of action if your original way isnt working anymore. It keeps you on your toes and forces you to figure out the best way to proceed given the cards you have and your location on the map.Definitely a fun board game with lighthearted elements and gorgeous animations.

												Overall, I find Armello to be a unique game with a lot of effort put into stylistic artwork, sound effects, and music design. It is really a multiplayer game best played with a group of 3-4 friends. I can't say that I found it to be riveting, as at times it does seem to be somewhat repetetive in the way that it plays out, but nevertheless I have enjoyed playing the various characters, who each have their own strengths and strategic paths to victory, and the overall vista of the map. One criticism I would really like to make, and what better place than here, is that there is an effect where somewhat transparent clouds obstruct your view of the map when you are fully zoomed out, I assume as some kind of 'atmospheric effect', but in actuality it is very annoying and I would prefer a crystal clear view of the board at all times, if it is available to me.

												Beautiful design, art, and score. What can I say more? ;)The goal is simple: Become King/Queen of Armello. The actual accomplishment of the goal is far less simple. ;) If you've ever joked that Monopoly ruins friendships... Armello is just like that, haha! Backstabbing and strategizing all over the place-- but on a gorgeous backdrop with adorable, lovable characters.Every game is different enough to keep things interesting and keep me, at least, always coming back for more. (After a year of playing, I've finally won ONCE! But, then, I suck at strategy and thinking ahead and keeping track of my fellow players. :P) The map is variable, and you have oodles of playable character choices to cut your teeth on. :)I recommend everyone give Armello a serious consideration. You won't regret it!			"

												This is my first review on steam. I have played about 80 hours on the game and have probably unlocked all the rings, each game taking about an hour or so. I bought this game out of curiosity since the graphics were just amazing to look at. The sound impressed me as well. What I like about it is that it is a friendly game that doesn't have in game chat. It kind of hinders the social experience of the game but keeps it civil, instead having the built in text to choose from. This game has an interesting concept of having four ways to win which is rot victory, highest prestige, 4 spirit stones, and defeating the king. It's really fun how there are lots of ways to win and kill your opponents. There is a lot of strategy going on, such as skill cards, magic cards, and trap cards. You must go on with your quest while defeating your enemies and winning by one of the four victories. There is a lot going on in this game. The dice is also an excellent touch, since it allows you to click on it randomly which allows it to be fair aND challenging. Beware that although I do recommend this game, there are still more developments that should be made. Such as when the Internet connection is loss, you are automatically kicked out and cannot join the same game. Penalties for leaving games should be longer since it destroys the overall game play of having to play with AL players. Ranked matches are also not availible yet. Overall I recommend this game despite its ongoing developments because it is visually satisfying and fun.			"

												I have enjoyed this game, the art style, gameplay and over all idea if pretty fun. I would give it a 7/10 though, few reason which I'll give below.Pros:-Lovely Art Style-Interesting play style of the old hexagon rpg table tops-Animations are well done and fluid-Concept of the game is imagnitive-Multiplayer works well and tests your friendships (Who will help you or end you)-Interesting Game mechanics, from complete dice modification, to in game affect through choices.-Loveable and cute characters: I mean look a Barneby, He's so damn eager to bonk them. Cons:-No game customization (You can't alter your map experience, each map is rerolled at a set size. Ways to fix this would be allow an option of multiple map sizes, with other game alterations)-Winning is single minded: You win by having the highest prestige, whether or not you have slayed the king or not. (Ways to fix this, Make prestige victory a draw breaker [both player and king die or king dies without a killing blow being dealt] I beleive the game could have alternative ways to win as well, fix the king, remove the rot from him, corrupt him fully, etc)-Restricted Character: The block on the additional bandit clan almost made me not buy this, and some of my friends refunded because of this. This is a good way to hurt player base when you have a purchasable game with locked characters, if the game was FTP then it would be understandable, or if they were purchasable from a DLC (Which would be a good idea for future clans as well, or adding them in as free updates)-Short: This game is short, if you don't love it, you'll get bored quickly.The map is as big as a small continent from Sid meiser's Civ games. Quests only go to about 5 or 6 (haven't counted persoanlly) before you get end game quest. "

								What do you get when you mash up a board game, an RPG, and animals into a PC game?  Apparently you get Armello!  In the grand tradition of games like Dokapon Kingdom you play as one of four characters who are trying to set themselves up while the king dies.  The games are fairly quick (maximum of 18 turns until the King's demise) but with 4 ways to win (and more ways to screw over your friends) why not pick this up!			"

												An addicting and amazing boardgame with a relatively steep learning curve.The game has an amazing vibe, good compelling dynamics and is beautifully, masterfully crafted in order to make RNG not only competitive but not that frustrating!!So to explain how they did that (or why I believe they did) I must first say that, I bought this game as a boardgame designer, to understand some really interesting peculiarities.It is imbedded in RNG and as far as transparency goes, this game is not an example. So is it bad? No...As a strong believer in pre-production and heavy design in order to combat rng and give space to balance and skill, this game showed me new possibilities for luck and uses it in a way that hasnt really been seen in Boardgames before.Most decisions in the game, involve luck ( % ), however, it is post luck, as in, first macro decisions (where you go, what you do and so on) then micro decisions that will have luck mechanic. To illustrate: you gear your character, move him on the map and decide whether you want to engage in luck events or not. IF you do, then your gear, character info (relative to race, buffs, etc) shall weigh the outcome of the event, may it be a battle or some other encounter.So luck serves as a weight to your moves in order to make the game more competitive and dense Strategically wise.Furthermore, the game uses really amazing Aesthetics to brush off unecessary intensity and soothe your experience, as a hot soup blow. So when rng does get on your nerves, you will barely notice it over the amazing music, illustrations and whole experience.The only con to the game, is the amount of info you must attend to simultaneously. Meaning that, while it does have a good UI, it uses the fact it is a digital boardgame, to incert more information than anyone could possibly process. PLus, the learning curve is indeed steep and although tutorial process is connected storywise, it is still a dull process....All in all, this game is really really good and worth cutting through the tough leathery learning membrane. Online games are really intense but still manage to maintain the shoothing game's vibe. 8/10			"

												5/5 StarsI'm one of the original backers for the game, and I'm very satisfied with having backed this project. It is exactly what I thought it would be in all of the early material, and it is just as much fun as I had hoped. This is very much a board game that I don't think could reasonably exist in physical form due to its stealth, ambush, and quest mechanics, and thus is a unique experience for board gamers and something that should be added to any collection.The characters and plot quests are reminiscent of Arkham Horror, as is the concept of multiple types of victory. I love Arkham Horror for its story and chacters, so of course I consider these to be good characteristics to emulate.I love that the prestige leader gets to choose between two potentially very bad options. It provides a reason to stay competitive about prestige even if you're trying for a different kind of victory.The AI is challenging and aggressive, so getting a victory is not a cakewalk and feels more like competing with other real players.As for the graphics and music, I think the music is perfect for the game, and the animate card graphics are lovely. If I want to be picky, I think the 3D animations could have been better. They're a bit too sharp and block defined around the edges, though the movements are smooth. They're a bit reminiscent of early 3D animations in games rather than being on par with where we are right now. But in terms of turning out a great game on a budget and on schedule, I think the simpler animations were a good choice.It's also worth mentioning that if you like achievement hunting in games, this is definitely a game for you, as even if you feel you're going to lose the quest to rule Armello, you can focus on completing some of the Steam achievements, which means even a game where luck is not on your side can make you feel that you accomplished something.If you are a board gamer or know someone who is, I highly recommend picking up Armello.

												You don't just need Armello now, this game was needed ten years ago. Armello brings me back to a simpler time when gaming felt like an excursion in to another realm. And here, with the help of the other Armellians and even some multiplayer companions, I can escape into that realm. The music is so intensely beautiful that I sought out the soundtrack via Armello.com.The visuals harken to Redwall with a color pallette that looks like a fairy tale of paint and bloom.The gameplay is so quick to grab onto and satisfying that you'll lose hours to it as you perfect strategies.I could say so many things and I've reviewed this game once already online but I will say that this game deserves the meager price in which it's offered and don't let the Early Access scare you away -- this game is as polished as you could expect from a full release and is being updated regularly.Not enough love can be expressed for Armello.

												I have trouble finding the words to do Armello justice. It is a wonderfully thought up board game, but developed to be played in a digital format, as a result it can do things that tabletop boardgames just can't. Players using stealth vanish from the board, there are neutral 'characters' who have their own agendas in game, the game itself is very carefully crafted and cleverly put together to be interesting and gets very challenging if you go online.But all of this is secondary to the one thing that League of Gamers utterly nailed, and that is the theme. The aesthetic of Armello is a joy to behold, from the serene looking map and hauntingly simple but evocative background tunes to the cheery character designs and battle animations and card art that will make you want to stop and take the time to appreciate it from time to time.Okay, sure, the AI players are a little easy and finding a game online can be a little difficult depending on your time zone and when you're looking, but there is still development going on and content being added, with the Bandit clan DLC on it's way and recent 'the stranger' update shaking up the ruleset a little, it seems hopeful that we'll see some more expansions and further improvements to an already wonderful game.Highly recommended to any lovers of board games.

												I'm over 100 hours into Armello now, mostly in multi-player.  The game is a real hidden gem; it's fun, it's cheap to buy, and it's still getting cool new stuff added to it.I enjoy the competition and wild unpredictability of multi player mode the most, but be warned: it's a turn-based game, and sometimes you get a player or two that is reeeeeeally slooooow at taking their turns, which really ruins the game flow.I think as time goes on, you'll be seeing mostly players who are pretty quick at taking their turns though. It's the noobs who tend to agonize and overthink their turns, somehow not noticing that the biggest factor is simply your dice rolls.  And once the current sale is over, I think we'll be seeing a lot less noobs.For sheer fun, and cartoon animal silliness, Armello is a definite 10/10. And if slow turns get you down, there's always single player, which plays VERY fast. Almost too fast, because AI opponents love to try to kill the king and end the game ASAP. Make sure you're always #1 in Prestige ranking when you do single-player, cuz often the AI opponents aren't even close to being geared enough to kill the king and survive, so the winner ends up being the player with the highest Prestige.

												Usually i'm skeptical of games that try to fuse too many genres, but Armello does it really well. The strategy, CCG, and RPG elements and each simple enough that the game is easy to learn, but they blend in organically so the game achieves and depth through width. Plus, the individual charactes have a good amount of balanced variety so you can either rely heavily on the game mechanics you like the most or do a bit of everything and still have a chance at winning. The game does rely heavily on RNG, but there are countless ways to control it and effectively doing so is what makes you a good player. Bonus points for having a great art style. Well worth 20 bucks.			"

												This game is simply wonderful.It has a story, and a very good one at that. Its not even a story that you can act upon, since its, you know, a board game. It works as the setting to the world the game happens on, explains why youre doing what youre doing, and it even expands farther from whats needed to provide depth. There is even lore to explain what exactly is the Rot, which is a game changing mechanic, even though you dont really have to know what it is to appreciate and play the game.It has quests. No, it doesnt have level ups or anything, the quests are simply there to take you to your objective (and equip you on the way) to take the throne. If you pay attention to the questgiver's dialogue, it expands upon the aforementioned lore, so you know what your chosen hero is going through even though you arent in 1st or 3rd person controlling mode.Speaking of characters, those are charismatic, and each has its own lore and gameplay. While you can finish the game by completing any of the objectives, its clear that some characters are better suited to some victory approaches than others. This makes for a varied strategical touch, and adds a lot to the games replayability and, given that its a multiplayer game, its not as if you will only want to play this once anyways.Lastly, graphics and animations are amazing, music is impressively good (you dont mind at all that its being looped), and the spell effects are beautiful. As for bugs, so far I have encountered only one kind, which stops game flow when someone drops from the game; seems to be a bit random, although it may be caused solely when the player disconnects during a load screen. And for those of you worried about raging players, fret not, there isnt an open chat during matches; all players are limited to a quite big selection of interactions, roleplayed by the chosen characters.Overall, great game, fully recommended, way worth the full price, and it still has unreleased content, so keep an eye out for updates.

												I bought Armello upon release, something I don't usually do (wait for patches/sales/etc), but I don't regret it.Basically, it feels like a great board game ported to videogame world.Pros:- Overall great game mechanics: balanced enough so skill/experience matters, random enough to make it interesting and not pre-defined- Dice-based combat- You have a lot of options and strategies to pursue during your turn- Good art (especially cards) and lore- Flawless Linux version (single player)Cons:- Problems in multiplayer (see below)- Minor flaws in the interface OK, not for the hard part. So multiplayer clearly has some issues, and while some of them (network problems and game-stalling bugs) can be expected to be fixed in the near future, others are more tricky.The average multiplayer game lasts 1 to 1.5 hours, and you don't have much to do during your opponents turns and game events (King's Guards and Banes) - that is, 70 to 80% of the time.It would be perfectly ok for a BOARD game, where you can chat with your friends/fool around/do some diplomacy, but it i NOT a board game (although feels a lot like one).You even don't have an in-game chat, only pre-defined emotes.Some options to overcome this:- play with friends and chat in Skype/whatever- read Twitter/what you prefer during other players' turns- have a beer in hand (always helps)That being said, I still enjoyed multiplayer to a certain point, and single player is completely OK (although can get boring after 10-15 hrs).

												Usually i'm skeptical of games that try to fuse too many genres, but Armello does it really well. The strategy, CCG, and RPG elements and each simple enough that the game is easy to learn, but they blend in organically so the game achieves and depth through width. Plus, the individual charactes have a good amount of balanced variety so you can either rely heavily on the game mechanics you like the most or do a bit of everything and still have a chance at winning. The game does rely heavily on RNG, but there are countless ways to control it and effectively doing so is what makes you a good player. Bonus points for having a great art style. Well worth 20 bucks.			"

												This game is simply wonderful.It has a story, and a very good one at that. Its not even a story that you can act upon, since its, you know, a board game. It works as the setting to the world the game happens on, explains why youre doing what youre doing, and it even expands farther from whats needed to provide depth. There is even lore to explain what exactly is the Rot, which is a game changing mechanic, even though you dont really have to know what it is to appreciate and play the game.It has quests. No, it doesnt have level ups or anything, the quests are simply there to take you to your objective (and equip you on the way) to take the throne. If you pay attention to the questgiver's dialogue, it expands upon the aforementioned lore, so you know what your chosen hero is going through even though you arent in 1st or 3rd person controlling mode.Speaking of characters, those are charismatic, and each has its own lore and gameplay. While you can finish the game by completing any of the objectives, its clear that some characters are better suited to some victory approaches than others. This makes for a varied strategical touch, and adds a lot to the games replayability and, given that its a multiplayer game, its not as if you will only want to play this once anyways.Lastly, graphics and animations are amazing, music is impressively good (you dont mind at all that its being looped), and the spell effects are beautiful. As for bugs, so far I have encountered only one kind, which stops game flow when someone drops from the game; seems to be a bit random, although it may be caused solely when the player disconnects during a load screen. And for those of you worried about raging players, fret not, there isnt an open chat during matches; all players are limited to a quite big selection of interactions, roleplayed by the chosen characters.Overall, great game, fully recommended, way worth the full price, and it still has unreleased content, so keep an eye out for updates.

Early Access Review
								Board game + Card abilities + RPG and Strategy elementsThis may sound like a weird combination, and perhaps this game is the first of its kind... but it actually works well!It is based on a board game of the same name. However, it seems the developers are so passionate about their project that they added some abilities and mechanics that were not present in the original board game.Even though the game is perfectly playable and enjoyable in the current early access, they are still releasing regular updates nearly every 2 weeks. Some of these updates introduce new mechanics and remake old ones, but the overall effect is an ongoing IMPROVEMENT.Graphics: Simple 3D graphics on the main map + animated cartoon characters. The animal characters remind me of the Disney version of Robin Hood... but even MORE charming. Don't be fooled by the cartoonish characters >> this game is suitable for all ages and has enough depth and variety that older gamers will definitely find it worth playing.Sound: Once again, simple and elegant. The music complements the graphics and atmosphere perfectly. If you play this game, you will wish that they make a movie from it. I'm not kidding. The immersion is that solid. The main downsides here are a lack of narration and voice-acting. Some music tracks can get a little repetitive. Adding 2 or 3 more tracks would be great.Gameplay: The game has a perfect balance of complexity and accessibility. It is easy to learn but also requires your constant attention if you want to win. You currently play against 3 other players in both single and multiplayer (4 players only). There are 4 victory conditions, all of which are related to the King's inevitable death. (as you may have heard, it's like a Disney version of Game of Thrones... except it is way better than the current Disney stuff)In Early Access you start with 4 playable characters. Another 8 will be available in full release (according to the forums). They all feel unique and each is more suited to certain victory conditions than the others. And you can still choose your starting bonuses with amulets and rings, so there are plenty of combinations for you to experiment with. Replayability is very high and rewards you with unlocking a variety of starting bonuses.In terms of strategy, the game is mostly about making the best out of what you have and holding on to your advantages. It is currently difficult to aim for a specific victory condition without getting lucky (especially Rot and Spirit victory). So ultimately, the Prestige victory is the most likely end-scenario, especially versus AI (who is not the smartest). Nevertheless, they recently made new additions to the Spirit victory (and added cards that will help you achieve it). So the end-game scenario is gradually being improved. I anticipate a well-balanced game at full release.Overall, this casual yet engaging experience is recommended for anyone who enjoys Strategy/RPG and wants something more relaxing than Civ 5 every now and then. This is also a great game for families. If you want to introduce your kids to Strategy gaming and play with them, Armello is perfect for the job even in Early Access.Early Access rating: 7/10 - worth the priceFor more details, check out my Let's Play below! (NOTE: my Let's Play is from BEFORE the ""At Wyld's Will"" update. The Spirit Victory has been changed after that update. Keep that in mind.)

												I would say a regular game takes about an hour to play. Think: Settlers of Catan with the ability to kill other players. The animations are smooth but not being able to skip other players turns (especially the AI) is a downer. With the achievement system unlocking additional characters, items, and quests, there is plenty of re-play value. The multiplayer mode is just icing on the cake. Highly recommended!			"

												Have you ever wanted to inflict tremendous bodily harm upon furry woodland creatures? You will after the third time that smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rabbit jacks your town and ganks you with his ferret bandits. All the fun of losing at Talisman, but with animals and a much shorter game time than ""1 to the rest of your hours"".The game does an excellent job of making you always aware of the pressure, with no one person able to truly dominate one path to victory without you having alternatives. The sole change I might suggest is doing something so that most games DON'T end in a prestige victory (the equivalent of the out of turns/highest points victory). Killing the king should be hard, but attrition should be less appealing, in the interest of, well, keeping things interesting.			"

												There’s a lot of strategy involved in playing Armello and it’ll take a lot more time to explain every nuance and trick you can do. Suffice it to say that if you’re a fan of card games or board games you’ll love playing this game. It’s deceptively simple but still full of strategic depth that anyone of any skill level should be able to pick it up relatively quickly and find something to enjoy. I’ve only played a handful of games but each one was different from the last. You don’t always get the same cards and each character has their own unique abilities that make certain strategies easier or harder. I had to stop myself from saying “Just one more game” even to write this review. It’s that addicting.http://cliqist.com/2015/10/13/armello-addictive-boardcard-game/ "

												The only bad thing I could ever say, even after playing this game for several hours now, and enjoying the liveing bejesus out of it, is that I didnt know about it's kickstarter. I would have been dumping money into this.Aside from 'shut up and take my money', I suppose I shoulld give some actual details on the game.Its a board game, where the premis is simple. Become king/queen. Your competeing with three other heros and the current king himself at times, to do just that. The way you go about playing is all up to you. Do you build up your character before walking right up to the king and kill him man to man? Or do you politicaly bide your time, gaining the king's favor and eventualy when he dies, the crown.The board on wich you play is new every time. This coupled with the fact that there are eight characters currently (supposivly more in the future) means that each game can be entirely diffrent. I look forward to seeing what they do with this game.A note to the devs if only for the giggles, a playable vulpine character of any sort. Seriously, I will chuck money at that if I have to. I'm already bummed I missed the chance to support your kickstarter.			"

								Really fun board game. Mechanically sound, tight, and straight forward. The game clock seemed to be pretty spot on for wrapping up the opportunity for several win conditions being viable at once; however, I would have preferred it be a bit longer per game. Additionally, the timer for ""burning"" cards was annoying unless it was meant by design to force you to think fast. I also feel more can be done with the rot mechanic.Great early access game and I'd love it more if I had a physical copy for game night.			"

												4 ways to win, 8 characters(I hear more are coming, like Squirrels) with their own bonuses and only takes around 30 minutes for a full game.  I love how you can customize to set yourself up, but then the little bit of randomness in each of the three decks of cards (you choose which you draw from) can totally change your strategy.""I just need one more Spirit for this Teleport"" ""This ally makes my spells cheaper"" ""A staff that gives me prestige for holding towns?"" ""Shoot 2 points of rot right off the bat I guess I should try for the Rot Victory"" ""Oh a spirit stone appeared right beside me, maybe I should collect them""  ""I can box him in with Perils..."" These are the kind of things you'll be saying.  There is a large element of luck, but a lot of it is playing(or finding ways to get rid of) your cards well and the game can quickly change right up to the end.A wonderful race of guts and glory, my new GOTO game when I don't have a ton of time to sink.

												Wonderful multiplayer experience for fans of tabletop gaming of all varieties. Hexagon style board and movement with resource management simialr to catan with the developemnt and progression focused on character characfer instead of a settlement. Nice reward system that seems to give you an additional different bonus to select pregame each time you utilize a different playstyle/character , which continually opens up more options for you. Gorgeous artwork that was clearly held in high importance during development. Matches move at a decent pace, giving you limited, but not entirely absent, actions to perform during other players turns. Length of each match is nice, most taking under an hour, giving you enough time to figure out a playstyle or character and moving on to another. The music is pleasant and fits mood nicely, but does not stand out in any particular way. Combat is simple, using a unique D6 system that is supplemented by combat and spell items and based off various symbols as opposed to numbers. Could benefit from an initiative system, as of now both characters engaged in combat simply get their full attack turn with no real importance to order unless they are outright slaughtered, going nearly negative their full health pool.

												Surprisingly rich and complex boardgame brought to the PC in a really beautiful way. There is a surprisingly depth to Armello, for each of the characters, that would make this game terrible to play on a tabletop, but as a digital boardgame it excels -- impressive!There is a fair bit of cartoon violence and intercharacter conflict... which is to say, murdering your fellow players is an effective and often necessary strategy -- friendships beware. Death is only a minor setback, and may be beneficial in many cases, though.The art style is beautiful and accentuates the background story and keeps every turn engaging. Attack animations, unique touches for the characters, and wonderful card art (and animation!) are all top notch. If you're curious, investigate how they incentivized art contributions!There are a few bugs: things like chunks of the interface that can go missing, but for the most part, resetting resolution or alt-tabbing can fix that. Full-screen functionality (Command+F) on Mac seems to be wonky, but works most of the time. There are some sound issues.Game balance is pretty well done. Rot seems hard to collect, but that's about the extent of it. Some folks complain about River sniping the king, but to them I say, kill the Wolf! Would love to see better error-handling in the netcode, as there is no way to get a player that disconnected back into the game; they're replaced by a hot.Note that the game is MUCH improved by playing with real players. The AI is a little on the simple side and tends to go all out to fixate on a specific character each game -- often the player. You can't argue with AI, and the minor metagame of diplomacy does improve the experience.			"

												Ups and downs, but fun regardless, especially so when playing with friends. It's good in that the gameplay is solid and straightforward, with a simple set of rules but a lot of room for skill and creative maneuvering. It's particularly interesting in that it's not always clear whether it's good or bad to accumulate or lose points in a certain statistic. Some games you will want to be poor, some games rich, some games you'll be forced to make unconventional plays, and some games you'll find it better to suicide in certain situations, even though suicide is a bad thing in this game. Or is it? Only thing that bothered me about the game was that it just took too long for the AI-controlled units and entities to take their turns.			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutey playable!  Great concept.  Reminds me of the old MB Dark Tower game, with some great dice throwing and card dropping depth that absolutely keeps the game creative without going to the depths of slow 4x games or too much to read otherwise great turn based games.  Don't have to worry about spamming multiple units here either, unless you like spam.  Just your charcter moving across the land questing, fighting, dropping stuff on the board for others to run into.  The only drawback for me is the devs have kept the graphics options limited to ""LOW"" only for now due to the graphic memory of my computer....wish they wouldn't have.  Other systems I am sure enjoy more eye candy.  GW2 Runs great on this machine by the way!  I have an iMac: 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7,NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 1024 MB...   The game plays great and still looks good!  The Game has great potential.  I am looking forward to playing with family members online!  Thanks for the hard work.			"

Early Access Review
								Just expected from the kickstarter campaign, this game is great.Even on early access phase, this game looks like a complete one.Love the art style and animation. Love the mechanics.Poor tutorial, but like the other board game, the manual is easy to be learn.So yeah you can understand the game if you read it. I haven't tried the multiplayer mode, but I know that the multiplayer will be really really good.			"

												Having watched this game through Early Access iterations and release, I can say that the game is fun and also that the devs care that it is in a good state.HARDWAREGTX 970, Phenom II X6 @ 3.2ghz, 16gb RAM, SSDMouse and Keyboard Steam Controller - Works great, see below.Performance - The game never drops below 60FPS and looks great 98% of the time.  Minor texture flickering may occur and occasional audio performance issues from using the newly released Steam Controlled and Big Picture mode it seems.  The game is being constantly updated.  I have experienced NMA (no more action) bugs only twice or so in my 74 hours of gameplay, some other minor bugs after its release from early access as well but the release is solid and you should not experience any real issues either.  Netplay seems to work very reliably and has Steam integration for playing with friends.Gameplay - Armello is more or less a tabletop board game where you control one of several semi-customizable heroes in your quest to be the new king.  This is achieved by acruing the most prestige when the king dies of a magical corruption (or failed regicide), killing the king and surviving, or by collecting four artefacts required to cure him.   You have several decks of cards with themes of equipment, magic, and subterfuge, which you can draw and play towards your goal.  There's choices on how to progress your character, risks to weigh against rewards, and plenty of tussles to be had with the other players as you fight each other along the way.  The thematics in this game are all wonderful, and the art, music, and visuals all contribute to the great presentation.  The duration of a full-length online game is about 45-90 minutes depending on how long people take on their turns, and it can be less if a player achieves one of the other victory conditions,But is it fun?  I think so.  The game has a strong element of RNG.  Random board terrain, cards drawn, AI character movement, fickle dice rolls, and other players strangely unpredictable behavior all contribute towards making the game seem a crapshoot.  One of the more prevalent complaints I have seen is how RNG heavy the game can be.   But strategy does exist and a large part of it is being adaptive to the state of the game and trying to sway the odds in your favor.   Knowing what decks to draw out of to try get the right cards you need, knowing what your objective should be for that phase of the game, and knowing what victory condition you should be working towards (and not just wandering the board aimlessly), these are all important and more.  True, this isn't always going to work, but the game would probably be a lot more boring if every player was able to run consistent strategies, or only a few consistent strategies existed.  The randomness of the game gives you more unpredictable 'oh-my-god that just happened' moments.   It wont require any sort of grand strategy game knowledge to enjoy yourself either, so if you like to just play by the seat of your pants you can do that too.  I think most importantly, if you can be a bit laid pack and not get upset over the outcome of a dice roll going completely wrong and maybe even losing you the game every now and then, you will have a good time. All in all, its a great game.  I've played 75 hours and loved them all, and I hope to play many more.  There's been a lot of balance changes from Early Access up til now a few months after release and the devs do have an ear to the community for the most part.  There's some more content on the way in the form of new characters as well, and maybe even some more content DLC down the line (I hope!).  Its a good one.  I'd recommend it.-STEAM CONTROLLER-Game works great with the Steam Controller!  I would recommend my custom setup I have uploaded to the community profiles section, or you can read my suggested binding here.  This arrangement lets you easily and quickly view player positions and keep an eye on the action.  I put left click on the left side (unlike the default for steam controller) because it felt more intuitive to grab cards located on the left side of the screen that way.I'm Not Sue's Armello KB BindingsLEFT BUMPER assigned to Right ClickLEFT TRIGGER assigned to Left ClickRIGHT BUMPER assigned to Hero Shelf (H)RIGHT TRIGGER assigned to Inventory (I)STICK assigned to w,a,s,d respectively.RIGHT PAD is set as mouse.

You can even go the political game and gain prestige, by gaining the peoples approval. However you can go to the darkside and kill other players and become corrupted with the rot, sending Armello into eternal darkness. You have the power to do anything, just make sure it is the right one. This game is not perfect but it is a good start. I want to see this series grow into something wonderful.			"

												This has become my go-to game for a good time. It looks beautiful, the world is rich, and the gameplay is that quintesential ""simple to learn yet difficult to master"" style I love. Best of all, every game can be drastically different from the last, and they all end within 45-90 minutes, even if they are multiplayer. I find this a refreshing session time for a strategy game, as opposed to the endless and sometimes arduous hours I've found myself devoting to other titles. This is especially important when it comes to multiplayer, because unlike other turn based strategy games whose time commitment to multiplayer seems to span far into the next century, this game can be won or lost in the time frame of an hour or two. This amazing quality removes the drudgery that has bogged down other strategey game experiences I've had with friends, and allows me to enjoy the thrill of cursing them incessantly as they stab me in the back with wanton disregard for the future of our relationship. This is fantastically juxtaposed by the aesthetic style presented, letting the players watch these almost Disney-esqe animal archetypes vying for the throne in the most machiavellian of ways. I highly recommend Armello for anyone who enjoys boardgames, but hates when they take forever and therefore stop being fun. Armello's comparatively short and sweet nature guarantees a freshness that will keep you and your friends playing for a long time, but only because one more game couldn't possibly hurt.			"

First: Game is exceptional and worth every dollary, so I have to recommend.Howver: There are some frustrations. Perhaps I'm not understanding everything yet, but success or lack of failure rather, seems to boil down to minimizing attrition, because unless you have substantial gear/followers,  you are very suseptable to to being killed in one encounter.  This is due to the variability of dice/cards and the numerous modifiers within the game.  Even at full health, with some good cards, your not safe. This makes early game survival critical as heroes are going be getting sent home frequently.  Making matters worse is the variability of the cards and drawing a hand full of cards you cant use.  Sure, you can burn uneeded cards and lock rolls, but I seem to need to do that far more frequently than I'd expect.  Its easy to get discouraged when, no matter what you do, no matter what options you choose, there is little chance of success, and no real option other than restarting.  This makes the prospect of online match-made games pretty grim, as players will quit in the first few turns as soon as someone has a clear advantage.  Perhaps I just suck and don't get it yet, but before they dumped money into the beautifull, triple-A assets,  they should have playtested the crap out of the game in a physical version to expose what feel like game ballance issues.  On the otherhand, I'm going to continue playing, becuase it's presentation is so slick, I'm optimisitic the frustrations I have so far are just because I'm no good.			"

												On the surface, Armello is what the boardgaming community classify as an ameritrash. There's nothing wrong with that. Some of my absolute favourite game is an ameritrash, it just means that the game favour theme and the experience resulted in said theme and a good amount of randomness over a thinky robust mechanic commonly found in a eurogame.Not that Armello is lacking in the gameplay departement. I personally think it's quite fun. There are several characters you can choose from with unique abilities and stats that play very differently to each other. During the course of the game you explore the land to finish a quest, improve yourself with various power and weapon, harass your opponent, or work toward a victory.The rounds are finite and it's a race against the others. Every single move counts and a mistake can set you back significantly. There are multiple path to victory that's a little bit confusing at first but once you fully understood it you'll soon realize that being the strongest in the land may help, but it's not necessary to win.As you can see in the screenshot and video, the visual are amazing. it may not have the best fidelity, but the work the art department did was quality. You might miss it in the screenshot or video, but some of the cards are animated. A little touch that makes the already beautiful game more pleasing in to play. That is if you're into art.A downside of the game, much like any other game in ameritrash category is the randomness. Sometime you love the dice, sometime you wish nobody invented one. The game can overstay our welcome sometime, dragging for quite a while if nobody plays well.All in all, despite the downside, I'm still in the opinion that the game is worth your money and your time. A thumbs up!			"

												TL;DR- This game is awesome for the first couple of playthroughs. If you don't have friends to play with, playing the same game gets old very, very quickly. The lack of game types or customization destroys the replayability of this game, and therefore it's only a great game for the first few hours, and I would recommend spending your money elsewhere. I would definitely change my opinion if they opened up more options on customization to allow epic style games.Looking at the graphics and the concept of this game, I was really pumped to get it. With that being said, I probably had higher expectations than what I should have going in. This game is a board game, plain and simple, and the first few playthroughs of the game that I had with each hero were awesome, since I learned the strengths and weaknesses of each hero, the randomness of cards and dice rolling, and the strategies of how to navigate the board as well as developing an overall strategy to win the game, on top of all of the ""randomness"". (Quests are random, with random bonus rewards, with a % chance to GET that bonus reward). All in all I really liked the luck aspect of the game balanced with the strategy aspect of the game, and the music and the artstyle really help making play the overall game fun, even if I feel that the AI turns take a bit longer than I would want to. Overall, the gameplay experience for the first couple of playthroughs was amazing.With that being said, I tend to enjoy games where I can change the parameters around to make the game more interesting once I understand the and have a decent grasp of the games basic concepts. I've sadly grown fond of being able to change gameplay aspects due to modding. In custom games you can switch it up, but at the same time I would really enjoy being able to change more aspects of the game to get a different experience each time. For instance..-I would love to be able to change the size of the map, or the amount of movement my hero can make on a turn. I'd really like there to be more than 2 maps to play on, since this gets very old, very fast.-I would really like to be able to choose if I could equip more items on a hero. Having 3 helps with strategy, but I would love to get into crazy battles where I can have 8 or 9 dice with a few spells I could cast and extra cards to throw away. -I would love to be able to purchase specific items or followers for a significant amount of gold to reduce the luck factor of a game. I've played a game where certain AI can get incredibly lucky early on with items and followers, and completely dominate the game. Purchasing a key item or follower for 10 gold or 10 magic would make the game feel less luck dependent, where at least I could have a chance at being able to augment my heroes strategy. -I'd like to be able to choose in a custom game where only certain victory-types are allowed. Creating an epic long game without rot on the king just makes the AI go for a stones victory every time, versus a long drawn out game. I would also like there to be an option to be able to choose the amount of quests you can get before you are directed towards the king, so playing a longer game becomes viable.Basically, without customization factors and with only 2 maps to play on, if you are not playing with friends, this game becomes pretty old, pretty fast. I guess I have a higher bar, since I'm used to playing games that allow modding, and that may not be fair, but there are many games out there with much longer staying power.			"

								**Edit since the new update** ** Edit** I really love the new updates that they've given to the game -- the quests now lead you right up to the castle to defeat the king -- giving you at least a chance to be able to confront him or not. New cards have been added. And after a few playthroughs, the cards have become quite strategic in countering your rivals or enhancing yourself. A subtle thing that I love is the day descending into night and vice versa. As your turn begins, it is the very break of day and as each player takes their turn, it gets darker and darker until actual evening. I really like that. My love of the actual game is starting to lean towards actual fun and recommendation. :) If they keep enhancing it more, I can see Armello being something truly special. ** Edit ** I don't think I can mask my disappointment with Armello. I seen the previews, I love anything with animals and love RPG's and card games. I guess, in my excitement for something new, that I glossed over the ""board game"" aspect of it. That's what Armello is -- a digital board game. The story is very intrigueing and I love it. I love anything new and different. But, with just a digital board game aspect, I don't see how the story can unfold -- the way it could with a card game or RPG. ... You start the game with the king already consumed by the rot. You and three others journey across the board. You have a few ways to win: gain prestige until the king dies, gain more rot than the king and battle him, confront him without the rot and battle him ... Questing takes the form of dungeons on the mountain hexes on the board -- it's random what you get: either coin and objects, or a clash with a dark specter. You can also quest across the board on various tiles, performing either acts of good deeds or not. You are given three choices to make and each choice will get you a different result. Perhaps this was the rpg aspect they were advertising. Or maybe it's the table top aspect that was completely lost on me.The card game aspect feels like an add on. Again, I guess I was expecting an actual collectable card game type of thing. ... But the cards, themselves, are beautiful and a new and interesting aspect about it as each one has something animated happening in it. I've played a few games and for what it is, it's a fun way to pass the time but ... I guess with this particular game, I was hoping for something more.I'm torn about this. I really want to love Armello ... but an hour and a half of a play through as opposed to taking my time and exploring or going on a side quest to do something else, the count down of the king's life is an ever present thing.Maybe when the game devolps beyond what it is right now, I may look at it differently. I *am* in love with the story and the animal world that they've created. It has amazing potential to go in so many different directions -- books, tv/movie -- maybe an actual, traditional rpg game in future, I don't know. But I will definitely keep watch on new and upcoming updates with this game and this world.In the end, it depends on what a player likes and wants. Some people are into the traditional table-top paper/pencil experience. I suppose, in this regard, Armello seeks to deliver. If it's something more like Final Fantasy or Magic the Gathering, it's not like that all. I recommend it for a new and different experience -- and for the story. It might be what other people are looking for and others might be wanting something different. It's difficult to really say where a recommendation is concerned. If you want to take the chance, put some money down to check it out.			"

												After my sixth game, I think I have a basic understanding for how the game works. It is definitely worth the full asking price, and I can see myself playing this game for another 20+ hours despite the repetition.I'm by no means an expert, but I think I have a grasp on what are the game's sources of improvement (as well as misunderstood expectations from negative reviews). Hopefully these insights will be of use if you're undecided.It's Like Civ But Not Like CivEveryone I've seen describing this game has used at least one of the three comparisons:Redwall Series (anthropmorphic grim fairytale with some realism) + Game of Thrones + Civilization 5 = Armello While I would probably use the same base description, some aspects might mislead fans of Civiliation 5 by accident. Here is the simple answer to the question, ""How is it like Civ?""LIKE CIV:It has a hex-based grid system that generates maps for every game.  You get that ""Just One More Turn/Game..."" feeling in a good game.There are political and warfaring tactics, along with other means (in this game magic), to improve your odds. You make a small amount of moves per turn, each cultivating in the always potential victory or defeat through your own choices. Grinding certain units for rewards, i.e. the Barbarians. (In this game, the Banes and Knights.)Each character caters to a specific playstyle and has some personality.You can start the game with small bonuses to stats. (Unlockable things here.)UNLIKE CIV:It's not a 4X game. Each game (for singleplayer with AI bots) lasts 45 mins to an hour and a half.You control only a hero, not a settlement and armies. Instead of hundreds of turns, the game works with nine days (a round for day and night; 18 turns total).Character animations cannot be disabled (and there's a gameplay reason).The goal of the game is to take the throne in one of four victories. (GoT comparison).Although some characters might be better for one playstyle over another, you can win with any victory condition.RNG elements are in plenty.That last aspect is the most important one. Although Civ has probabilities, you still had a lot of control over your actions; in this game it's pretty much the opposite. But you can always better your odds.For example, ALL of the win conditions (whether for avoiding traps, fighting, or even achieving a victory) is based on some luck. You can influence your chances by improving your Wits abilities at the start for traps. You can accomplish  quests (goals to get improved stats, cards or loot) to improve your character. Or you can use cards you get every turn to better your luck or help you in the game.Like old RPGs/tabletops, the challenge is working probabilities in your favor for success.The Balacing ActThe game has an interesting gameplay element: The King. Everyone is out to kill/banish him and retake the throne from his madness, which is essentially the basic storyline. Each day the King loses one-heart, which he can only regain from killing a corrupted player. You spend one turn to breach the walls, trying to break the trap; the next one to finish the King. Regardless of your choices, the King will die at the end, and the victor is the one who suceeds him.There are one of four victory conditions: Prestige Victory (the normal victory) is when the player who has earned the most fame/goodwill with the King takes his place when the King dies. Kingslayer Victory is when the player kills the King in battle AND lives to earn the throne. Rot Victory is where a corrupted player, higher Rot level than the King, kills the King AND lives to earn the throne.Banish Victory is where a player collects four banish stones and gets to use them on the King, ridding Armello of the Rot.Out of the four, the Prestige Victory is going to be the main outcome. (4 out of 6 games I won with that outcome; the other two I lost due to the same reason.)Two of the victory conditions require you to live from the battle, which both players can kill each other in combat. So if you kill the King and die, the Prestige Leader wins. (And if you attack the King, you lose your Prestige). The ""good"" option takes some time to gather the stones and you also have to get lucky to banish the King.My take on this system is that there is a reasonable risk/reward system for going for the King. Because the odds are against the player living from the battle, it keeps players from bumrushing  on his last heart, while at the same time rewarding the player who does live to take the throne. (Many times I play the Hyena route; get on the King's goodside before becoming a cutthroat).There are plenty of means to take away Prestige from the highest player--bounties, special cards, King decrees, constant deaths, etc.--all of which are due to chance. But they are plentiful to never seem like a game is hopeless. The King Decrees are an option for the Prestige Leader to choose that may benefit him or hurt everyone--you only get two bad options that display the King's madness of power.The Rot system, while benefiting the most corrupt in battle with extra dice, takes away one heart every dawn. The magic system recharges at every dawn too to some minimum stat. Burning cards only gives you one assured stat for Perils (traps) and battles.The rest of the game is centered on luck, but measurable luck, as you can put on equipment or followers for extra bonuses and play other cards for temporary buffs or set traps. (For better or worse, you can play these cards when it's not your turn, which is helpful when an enemy gets too close or you set a pre-ambush. This is why the game won't skip animations when it's not your turn.)Honestly, the luck system doesn't bother me because I still feel like I have lots of input in my outcomes. And every decision I make feels all the more impactful when it cultimates in a victory of my own doing... But not always of my own efforts.Needs Some TweaksFor starters, having the King's health-bar be customizable might extend gameplay without ruining the balancing act. As well as having more variety in maps other than locations of settlements, dungeons, terrian, etc., randomized and given a different seasonal change.I think nine hearts system is fine since I like the compact Civ feel. The maps, however, are way too compact. I hate having to quickly backtrack to recapture a settlement because some player recaptured it after respawning at home. Again, player customizable options would be nice.Although the characters do not determine your playstyle, some characters feel pressured into one or two routes without a lot of bonuses in the game. More character classes too would be great. (Currently there are 8; two from each clan.)For example, Zorro the Rat cannot take damage, at all, and he's good for sneaking up on players (disabiling their card-burns) and getting bounties.The only way I can see him killing the king is for going for a Rot Victory to get more dice. But he'll need a lot more health to not die in three turns.I think these limitations will give seasoned players some edge in spoting tactics with the characters tropes.The typical, ""Foxes are doing something cunning; pigs are being piggish; weasels are weaselly""kind of cliche for anthropomorphic characters. (Am I the only one who hates that?) I do like that tropes are a potential mechanic.Also, being stuck with a crap set of cards is annoying if you can't burn them often. A discard option outside of perils or battles would be nice for those nothing turns.Try Your LuckI really wanted to talk about the gameplay storytelling, but I think the balancing and misguided expectations were more important to address. This is a pleasant, little surprise for 2015.			"

Early Access Review
								I was extremely attracted to this game because it immediately reminded me of the Redwall book series I loved as a kid. Bought it on sale for a rather steep $20... still not sure if it was worth it (only time will tell), but I can say that the game is fun and well-designed. Pros: Despite having very little in the way of a tutorial, I found the rules and mechanics pretty easy to grasp after a couple quick test runs. The interface and controls are quite intuitive. Playing as most characters (see more on this below...), the game's difficulty seems well balanced, not too hard and not too easy. This is due in part to the fact that luck does play a role in whether you win or lose any given battle/situation, but I see this as a positive rather than a negative. Your skill is still what wins you the game in the end. Nice art design, graphics, music, and overall theme. The game rewards you for playing and achieving different paths to victory, with unlockable perks for each character. Cons: Could use more content, more maps, maybe a campaign of some sort... The story is superficial and leaves a bit to be desired. This is also something that a campaign mode with cutscenes would help fix. One of the playable characters, the bear, seems to always lose really badly when played by the AI. I haven't tried playing her yet but there's obviously a bit of an imbalance there.			"

												Rather than releasing a dlc and whatnot, why don't you work on the bugs of the basegame?The game itself is very enjoyable albeit a bit long when playing multiplayer. More often than not, unfortunately, I have encountered game breaking bugs while playing. Out of 10 times playing multiplayer, 5 of those times the game just stops, music continues, everything moves, but no actions can be done causing the players to start leaving the game. After a player leaves, an AI is supposed to take their place, but guess what: nothing happens. You are just stuck there. This ONLY happens in multiplayer, and apart from that you get penalized for leaving.I like your game really, but a great deal about the game is multiplayer. How about we try to figure out whats up with that first?6.5 outta 10 because of that, otherwise 8/10			"

If Walt Disney was in charge of making a Game of Thrones style Might and Magic game, this would be it. Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three styles of play; The deep tactics of card games with the rich strategy of table top board games, combined with a character role-playing system. As a hero from one of the clans of Armello, you'll quest, scheme, hire agents, explore, vanquish monsters, cast spells and face off against other players, with one ultimate end goal in mind — storming the palace and becoming King or Queen of Armello. The Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils, banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading corruption known as the rot is leaving no creature untouched. Armello is League of Geeks’ attempt to revolutionise digital board and card games, whilst providing players a rich world within which they can craft their own stories of epic adventure. The aim was to create a rich game full of backstabbing, close shaves, shattered alliances, ruses and empty promises - a perfect game to play with your friends. - Highly Recommended!			"

												Premise:Armello is a game where players take on the role of heros from various animal clans (Wolf, Bear, Rat, Rabbit) as they vy for control of the kingdom come the King's eventual demise to The Rot. The Rot corrupts those that it infects, granting them power at some cost. Heros can acheive victory by either gaining the most influence by the time of the King's death, using Spirit Stones to banish the corrupt King, or outright killing the King as he becomes weaker and weaker.Gameplay:The game is played much like a tabletop game with various points of interest. Cards are drawn each turn which can assist the player and harm or hinder their opponents. Quests are given to players to strengthen their character during gameplay to assist them in dice based combat where equipment Cards can influence a combatant's attack or defense.Pros:+ Great graphics, sound, and music score+ Relatively easy system to understand and play+ Games can take from between 20-40 minutes depending on how versed players are+ Different characters and different ways to play and win leading to each playthrough being different from the lastCons:- The Rot system doesn't give much benefit to players that desire corruption- Some characters have only one way to play or win given their base stats and passives (IE: Sana)- Sometimes the Card RNG/Dice can be very cruel to where a player can litterally not win at all.- No game editor: You can't make the game last longer, you can't change the map size or gamplay difficultyVerdict:While Armello is probably one of the better tabletop-to-screen games on Steam, it does feel a bit lacking in the options department of gameplay. That said, it's a fun game to play when you're looking for a thoughtful and strategic game while keeping the gameplay casual. The price is fair and well worth a four-pack if you want to enjoy a strategic game that doesn't involve tanks, starships or explosions (Unless you consider some of the trechery and magic cards). While it's not a game you can't necessarily binge on, it's a good way to break up the monotony between other games.			"

												This is somewhat of a hard review for me to write. Do I recommend this game? In some ways, yes! I love the game. I love it too much. I've been involved with it from Day 1 back on Kickstarter. I love the art and the premise and I feel like playing it every day. However, here are the reasons that I have uninstalled this game with a heavy heart:I've played several games of Armello, some multiplayer and some single player (Note: more than what Steam quotes, as I have a different version from Kickstarter). The major flaws at this point are evident. One, in every single game I have been able to finish, the game has been won by the Prestige Leader. Every other victory condition is unbelievably hard to attain and I have never seen it done. As noted in a previous review, getting stuck in an endless cycle of dying and restarting is rampant and extremely difficult to break out of, which leads to the game timing out before anyone can achieve anything. In literally every game I have played, I have set out with the intention of winning with Spirit Stones, and while I have no problem getting enough of them, getting to the king is impossible with this endless cycle of dying. Now, onto more clerical problems. In each game I have played (literally every one), something or a lot of things have gone wrong with the running of the game. In two or three, my Gold counter has gotten stuck at a certain number and I have no idea how much I have to work with. I don't know if it is logging my newly acquired Gold, but when I try to use a card, it will always tell me I cannot afford it, despite sometimes saying I have 12 Gold even. I have run into a couple of games where it will freeze so to speak and the characters are just in a constant loop of ""fighting,"" but the game does not progress. This has been documented by two of my Steam friends as well. Two or three times, I have had friends kicked off the server and the game has been restarted automatically. The gameplay and music/sound effects often lag (like, almost always) and are choppy (even with turning down the resolution, shutting down all other processes on my computer, and changing to a more powerful computer). I have had a couple instances when playing multiplayer that a countdown clock will never appear on the player screen, or we will be stuck in an ""all-ready"" screen with nothing happening. While attempting to play with my friends, they are asking: ""Is this game in early access!?"" Unfortunately, it kind of feels that way. The minute a patch is released to fix these gameplay issues, I will be re-installing this game, because it is honestly my love right now. My recommendation is that you will want this game. Hard. But right now, maybe it needs a pass for a little while.			"

												I wanted to like Armello, this is the best implementation of a Digital Board game I've played, with elements that aren't possible in a tabletop game.Unfortunately, there is little skill  since your overall strategy can quickly be destroyed by the RNG. Randomness is tricky to do right, the best games give you tools to work with what you have, the RNG creating a new puzzle to solve. Armello has randomness at nearly every level, random card draws, dice rolls, dungeons, and quests, with very little you can do to adapt.			"

												Unfortunately, this game is overpriced and suffers from some crappy dev's - though it's a fun game.There are STILL MAJOR ISSUES with disconnecting and games freezing! Some updates have broken the game for days.And, as it's really a minigame that is comprised of roughly 1 hour matches, it shouldn't cost the same price as a triple-AAA studio game that has 50+ hours of novel gameplay for 2 copies and a set of DLC characters.The worst part of the pricing and dev' management is the DLC: each sweaty cosmetic DLC balloons the last in cost, so that 3 character skins cost more than the base game, which includes 8 characters... Gives perspective, right?Armello is a fun game. BUT, it has too many totally unresolved gameplay bugs for it to be really fun, and their DLC scheme is greedy and ugly. If you can catch Armello for less than $10 on sale, then you might find it to be agreeable for the price.			"

												Armello is a pretty fun game if you were ever into Mario Party and had enough money to buy yourself a new laptop every game or 2.Because almost everything is out of your control unless you play the safest way imaginable.Now this isn't to say that it's a bad game, I highly recommend this, but I do warn you that ANYTHING can happen.You can be a legendary wolf knight finished with all of your quests, ready to fight the king who is 1 hit away from death and you are completely decked out with the best equips and greatest party members in the game, but still get burned to death by a bunny holding an umbrella.This doesn't even factor in that almost nothing goes according to plan unless through the infinite power of Jesus Christ, you manage to have everything manage to go your way from the start.Regardless, there are many different ways to win in this game with many unique characters and equips for them for you to try and win with.It is an incredibly slow start for beginners to not only learn, but earn said equips, but once you get into things, you'll find yourself enjoying this strategy boardgame.Things get even worse when you talk about dices which you'll most likely grind for to show off your status.

												I read a lot of Red Wall when I was a kid because I wasn't really too interested in Harry Potter or all that nonsense. Uh. Not sure how that's -exactly- relevant? But it is. Armello's been an amazing experience that I'm trying to currently push on my friends. To note: This -is- basically an videogame boardgame, but it's super fun, and the animation is smooth. The tactics are varied and interesting, and there's a lot of room for risky play. Anyways, I'm probably more coherent when I hate a game. It's hard to praise a game as much as I have, so I'll get to the cons:-There's only one game board.-There's a pretty small character selection.That's uh, about it. That and turns can take a little long, but that's okay when you're doing singleplayer anyways, because you can just turn on quickturns. I'd really love it if the developer considered DLC addons for maps and characters. I would definitely buy both. I'd be happy to support a developer that's made a wonderful game like this, anyways.

Early Access Review
Before I start this review, I want to point out that my playtime is NOT accurate. Due to connectivity problems, my playtime has not been registering correctly for many games. That being said, I played this for about two hours.Ever read that book series called ""Redwall?""The imagery in this reminds me so much of when I read some of the books in that series years ago. Your choices for characters are anthromorphic animals, with different strengths and drawbacks. I will confess that I expected more of an RPG than a board game with this, but that was my mistake. The imagery is definitely rich here, and if you're into fantasy novels, there's a good chance that you'll enjoy looking at the game for awhile. The visuals were probably my single favorite part of this game, but I can't say that's not due to my weak understanding of the genre. Grid-Based Board GameReally, I should have prepared myself better for this. I'm not very good at this type of game, and I don't know if that's because I haven't played very many of them, or if it's because I'm simply impatient. The gameplay is easy to get the hang of, the tutorials are supremely helpful, and for a gamer like me it probably presents more of a challenge than it would for someone accustomed to this sort of thing. The inclusion of multiplayer is a big plus, I can see that being a determining factor when other people I know obtain the game and want to play something. The board game aspect is very strong with this - dice rolling, cards, etc. I'm a sucker for this sort of thing, but it works so much better within a multiplayer setting, where my playing was focused on a single player campaign. That's not to say it wasn't fun, that's just to say that I'm confused easily by this sort of game. Gotta Love That SoundtrackThe soundtrack for this is awesome. I've played a lot of games recently with great soundtracks, and it's starting to spoil me. My biggest complaint about most games prior to recent plays is that the soundtracks just aren't that great - for whatever reason this ignores that rule and creates a great atmosphere. As I said about the feeling of the book Redwall, earlier, I imagine that this would be a soundtrack to a movie or game made from the series, and combined with the imagery, it creates a pleasant atmosphere that doesn't become stale quickly. Overall Opinion Graphically, musically, this game ranks very high on the list. Without being able to comment on the gameplay with any authority, because I don't normally play this sort of game, I have to say that it's rather difficult to get started with...It's not a ""get-up-and-go"" sort of game, but if you're a stronger fan of the genre than I am, I'm sure you'll find it pleasant. The screen is packed full of things that you can use, actions to take, and the way the tutorial system is set up is fantastic. I will probably have to play this game more when some of my friends get it, because I am recommending it! Based on my limited knowledge of the genre, but enjoying the overall atmosphere and pleasantries of the game, I'm not hesitant to give it a solid 7.5/10. So, final: 7.5/10I will probably revisit this review after I play more of it, and definitely after I play a multiplayer campaign. As it is, I failed at nearly everything I tried to do - so the game is a challenge if you're not familiar with the genre! Great job, guys.			"

												Let me start with some simple pros and cons before giving a more comprehensive review:Pros:  1)  Easy to pick up and learn with a comprehensive tutorial.  2)  Multiplayer that lets you play with a dedicated group of frieds or random strangers.  (Plus a solid singleplayer experience for when you're antisocial or your friends are away.)  3)  Procedurally generated maps mean every board is different.  4)  With eight different characters and a variety of customization items to select before the game starts you'll quickly find a style of play you love.  5)  Rewards extra customization itmes based on who you play and how.  (Let's face it, we all love customizing things.)  6)  It's pretty to look at, which never hurts.Cons:  1)  When playing single-player the AI sometimes makes some quirky decisions...  Like walking through a swamp before attacking someone and consequently losing a fight it might have survived.  2)  The Prestige Leader vicotry condition is a little odd in cases of a tie.  Several hours and a dozen games later and I'm still no entirely sure how it picks a leader in the case of a tie...  That being said in this game ties don't last long at all.The Overview:     Armello is a beautifully rendered boardgame that is easy to pick up and learn but deliciously difficult to master.  You may gear yourself up with a particualr victory in mind (there are four different ways to win afterall) but quickly find that your plan isn't falling into place they way you had hoped.  This is the kind of game that rewards opportunists, flexible thinkers, and clever tacticians.     The entire game is played on a hexagonal board and you spend your turn moving, collecting cards that give you powerful items, spells, or tricks you can use to hamper or kill your enemies, and possibly fighing off the king's guards, banes, or other players through dice rolling.  Fulfilling quests boosts your stats and grant generous rewards so you'll constantly be trying to plot the best route from A to B.  Your final objective is to overcome the corruption in the land represented by the king by either killing him, cleansing him, becoming the new king of corruption (and also killing him) or by becoming the most famous hero in the land and succeeding the king upon his death.  The king draws closer to his demise every sunrise so you'll constantly be racing the clock to amass your power and wrestle victory away from the other players.     Also all the characters are represented by animals, which is kind of neat and gives the whole thing a Redwall meets Game of Thrones kind of feel.  This game is wildly fun, deceptively challenging, and has immense replay value.  All in all this is a fantastic game I would recommend to anyone who loves boardgames or games that reward you for being quick on your feet and flexible in your planning.  Best played with one or two friends once you've mastered the game concepts but as I said, the solo play is strong with this one.  Enjoy!			"

												Let me start by saying the game is not bad but I cannot recommend it until they balance out the victory conditions.As it is only one victory type is viable although there are 3 or 4? possible. This destroys the game's replayability. The game has limited turns and all the mechanics for a non-prestige victory take you too long and are really hard compared with the faceroll of the prestige victory.It looks beautiful, it is a great concept but it failed the playtesting for balance IMO. Buy on discount or wait until you hear victory conditions have been balanced.			"

												When you consider that a good strategy tabletop board game can easily cost upwards of $50, a rich game like Armello feels like a steal. Fantastic design and production values, varied strategies, well-balanced characters, and strong environmental storytelling, for what is ultimately a 4 player board game. Some bugs, and I wish this had local couch co-op, but for the price, it's an excellent game.			"

												Armello is a beautifully picturesque board game. From the thrilling battle exchanges, to the delightfully animated cards and intro sequence, to its storytale-like writing that paints a small saga for your character through your quests, this game is a treat for the eyes and a fun dice-rolling way to occupy about an hour. However, as Armello is primarily a board game, you may turned off by its randomness and its slower pace.For me, Armello's chief strength is the quality of its visuals. You can see this yourself, as a number of a YouTube gaming channels have recorded their playthroughs of it during Early Access, including: Northernlion; Stumpt; and Jesse Cox. There have been a number of changes to the game since it exited beta status, but what you can see from those channels is largely how Armello looks in its final state. You should also notice the ""talking woodland creatures with swords and magic"" theme, which can prove to be quite the nostalgic bonus for those of you read Redwall novels and Mouse Guard comics. Armello also features a ""dynamic sandbox"", which essentially means every game will have most of the terrain tiles on the board randomly generated, ensuring a different experience and requiring different tactics for every game.It must also be noted that Armello is quite friendly to new players. While the game starts off simply as your chosen avatar explores the land, a player can be swamped by the variety of cards and events he'll face. Fortunately, the game is very informative through its in-game guide (easily accessed from the main menu and during play) and is sufficiently detailed in its hover tips. This is especially the case with the cards, the major method you'll be using to interact with Armello's world. Each card comes with a short but clear description of their uses, so the player should never be left in doubt. Furthermore, the game has already seen two patches since its full release, and both patches have added new free content to the game including new items and cards. Details on these past updates can be found here at Armello's website[armello.com]. As is apparent, Armello has a dedicated development team behind it, one that fully intends to keep the game alive by bringing even more to it through future updates.Mind you, if you find yourself frustrated with the randomness and waiting of board-games, then Armello may similarly irritate you. While some strategy is possible, victory in Armello is greatly dependent on the luck of the draw and the luck of the roll (though this can also be an appealing spice for the adventurous). Also, every game of Armello requires 4 players, whether they be human or AI controlled. This means you'll find yourself sitting through quite a bit of downtime, watching other players go through their turns. In the game's options, you can opt to skip AI vs AI battles to lessen your waiting time, but you can't fast-forward all of it. You could leave the computer while AI turns play out, but watching other players' moves is also part of the game (i.e. planning your own moves based on where your opponents appear to be going or what they may be planning to do).All in all, Armello is a wonder for the eyes, and one round is a delightful way to spend half an hour to an hour. While PvP games online are completed in one go, offline player vs AI games can be saved and continued at a later date, making this game a fine option for a short spot of casual fun as well. If all this tickles your fancy for fantasy, delve deep into Armello and try for the Lion's throne.			"

The storyline is rich and full of character (and characters). And while it seems simple; there is masterful amount of strategy to be had in something that feels so fluid. This truly is more than a simple turn based strategy. It's a game that has depth. And while every 20 round game feels as it will be too short to truly experience anything; I find myself drawn not only into the game world but to the storylines behind each avatar's play style. To this effect I woud recommend this game and I forsee expansion packs in the future.			"

												THIS whole game is massively beautiful and charming,but here is my oppinion for this game.1-Fun to play with anyone .2-Cute cartoon animal character designed .3-Game mechanic based on both player luck and RNG.(1)What the game needs right now is bases of player whom interest and wish to play .But buying this game won't satisfied you for long IF YOU don't have friend(s) to play with.The game itself don't have a chatroom for player or even type/chat;/whisper;/all. It replaced with natural spoke of  characters.The most annoyed problem for this game is multi-player matching mechanic. Good thing about the game that allowing player to play as single-player match while waiting to find a full party joining but you'll felt a shame left in to know that most people or players were no longer interested in online-play anymore.( Maybe the number game room with bar like (4/4) game might improved online play for this game. ) ;)<Break> It still a break time right? <Break/> (...)What it called again? Number gameroom no. 04? nahh I'm too stupid of these kind including my Language skill -3- (?)*DO IGNORE THIS MESSAGE right away~(2)Before playing Armello I already in loved with characters, and I mean all of them including Royal guard themself.The cutscenes giving the atmosphere of the game thus you played your type of character , you'll almost become one with a character in the game. Like you were them. ""It a board game with visual screen that showed no more than illusion of such an charismatic theme"". ( Hope you're not getting confused by last phrase, lol )(3)By all mean, like all board game, You need stregth of both mind and body to concentrate nevertheless this game can also mess your day up by number generate mechanic or what we called RNG thus 'Random number generate' .Luck can be mean in RNG but both of them were separate from each other when it come to Real time board game.TO see picture [ Luck<-- RNG --> RNG ]Not all that I've got in mind but thing need to be wrap up now.After reading of my criticized ( Mostly like "" In my oppinion ""), Please do know that I'm not professional to the game or any of judging.It may looks like a serious criticized but fun left, therefor the matter is up to you all now , Great hero.Will you recommend this game to others or maybe share the game to support their back. =)			"

												# 53      ArmelloA board game set in a fantastical world  where animals are the dominant species, and a sickness called the rot ravages your King.  Adding cards, perils and board stylings of Catan, this board style game is actually a pretty slick joy.  Its a bit faster paced than Talisman, and way more polished.  One game ran me about an hour to play on single player, which is pretty fair for this type pf game.  The visuals are beautiful, smooth and well drawn, easy on the eyes.  And the sounds and music are very easy on the ears.  At first glance the mechanics seem daunting, with a steep learning curve.  Not that way at all.  The tutorial is set up into 4 chapters, highlighting 4 of the 8 or so clans.  Each one adding a few new mechanics, until finally you learn about how to win the game.  Like i said, smooth.  Developers seem pretty active, having a twitch stream after each new update, highlighting the new features.I was a little peeved at the price, but after sitting down with it for a few hours, 20 bucks is actually pretty fair.8/10 might buy a copy for the spouse			"

You spend time walking around a board game getting loot and spells and traps to murder/steal/scheme against your friends so you can be the next king when he dies. 2hr~ game time.  Lots of RNG but its very manageable if you play smart. If a random element doesn't bother you and you are capable of setting aside large chunks of time for this game, I highly reccomend it. "

												Armello brings the wild fun of table games to PC. Its great art style, characters and the simple, yet subtile complexity of the gameplay mixes together with a rare charm. This game most definitively deserves praise and should be appreciate by most table games lovers. Hopefully, the devs will keep on adding content to bring people back into the game, because if I can find 1 thing that counts as a con it would be that; there isn't a lot of people on the servers, thus it can be hard to find a game rapidly.Nevertheless, this game is wonderful <3~ !

												Pretty good competitive board game.  Several paths to victory, engaging combat system, and just overall fun to play.  If playing single player you'll need to go into the options and turn on fast AI turns unless you want to go get a cup of coffee after every round, but really that's a very minor annoyance.  I'm quite pleased with this purchase, and think I will be playing a great deal of this game. :)And props to the music and art people.  Well done, :)			"

												Armello is , for me the hardest game to categorize. in my entire life. of 500+ steam games not counting the others i have in other consoles, i'm a game poacher, i've played♥♥♥♥♥♥that's so bad it gives you scrotal cancer, and i've played amazing jewels of mastery and perfection so stupid delicious they just take your mind, and kick it out of the damn stadium. this game is of the latter, and if i had to categorize it , it would be something like this Armello is a Turn based strategic Rpg experience with a lemon slice of trading card game. yes, you heard me, this game is a mixture of many many amazing and counter effective things, but instead of forming one ugly disgusting paste, or a monster of frankenstein, they for this beautiful chimera with a menagerie of colors and a complexity that makes it  just impossible to say What is that makes it tick.I'm an artist, I draw for a living and I've groomed  my skills as much as i possibly could , focusing on character design and interesting ""looks"" and ""feel"" of the concept. i've read dozens of books about how to make characters work, books that tell you a bunch of unbreakable rules, rules of thumb, impossible to miss details and basics. this game somehow breaks them one by one in a beautiful majestic way, ""make your characters stand out of the crowd"" at best armello characters are the most basic representation of themselves, an animal, from an animal clan, but following a fallout feel, somehow you manage to put yourself in the shoes of your chosen character every game, how differently they play, mechanically speaking they are more deep than any tridimensional character i've ever wrote, and they don't even say a word in your whole gameplay. they feel empty of story at first, the tutorial gives you a good slice of some of the background of these fellas , but that's it, how their story evolves every match depends on you.the game is easy to understand, a quick brush at the tutorial will get you started, it also is easy to master, you will learn how to strategically place yourself, how to support, or doom the other 3 players of the round without much effort, but the ever changing nature of the game , maps and other stuff will always force you to improvise on the go, explore, do missions , find weapons equipment and magic to aid you in your journey.and now i realize , i haven't talked at all about the journey, if i can summarize it correctly, it stands like this. The king. the honourable , kind, benevolent king that managed to unite the clans, has fallen into corruption, the ""rot"" how they call it in the story, takes him over  a couple turns at a time, turning him more and more into a corrupted monster, and damaging his life every 2 turns.  his days are counted, and dark days come for the land you live in if he is not stopped in time, Banes will appear and desolate the place, other corrupted individuals will want his head on a pike just for power, brave warriors will see the end of the horror by the sword, aristocrats will seek his side, stay on top of the popular food chain so , when he dies, the noble of higher name takes his place. and spiritual  leaders from all around will seek to purify the rot, no matter the cost. this is how you win the game, none of them easy to get, since you will always be playing against other 3 champions, who of course, have their own agenda.Anthropomorphic characters, lovely music, Fantastic artwork and animations, visuals are more than enough to immerse yourself into the world. this game is a rough diamond that's constantly being polished and promises hours of fun.so... do i recommend this game? the short answer is yes, the long answer is ♥♥♥♥ the hell yes.10/10 would cleanse myself by accident with the stones again.

												Armello is a beautifully picturesque board game. From the thrilling battle exchanges, to the delightfully animated cards and intro sequence, to its storytale-like writing that paints a small saga for your character through your quests, this game is a treat for the eyes and a fun dice-rolling way to occupy about an hour. However, as Armello is primarily a board game, you may turned off by its randomness and its slower pace.For me, Armello's chief strength is the quality of its visuals. You can see this yourself, as a number of a YouTube gaming channels have recorded their playthroughs of it during Early Access, including: Northernlion; Stumpt; and Jesse Cox. There have been a number of changes to the game since it exited beta status, but what you can see from those channels is largely how Armello looks in its final state. You should also notice the ""talking woodland creatures with swords and magic"" theme, which can prove to be quite the nostalgic bonus for those of you read Redwall novels and Mouse Guard comics. Armello also features a ""dynamic sandbox"", which essentially means every game will have most of the terrain tiles on the board randomly generated, ensuring a different experience and requiring different tactics for every game.It must also be noted that Armello is quite friendly to new players. While the game starts off simply as your chosen avatar explores the land, a player can be swamped by the variety of cards and events he'll face. Fortunately, the game is very informative through its in-game guide (easily accessed from the main menu and during play) and is sufficiently detailed in its hover tips. This is especially the case with the cards, the major method you'll be using to interact with Armello's world. Each card comes with a short but clear description of their uses, so the player should never be left in doubt. Furthermore, the game has already seen two patches since its full release, and both patches have added new free content to the game including new items and cards. Details on these past updates can be found here at Armello's website[armello.com]. As is apparent, Armello has a dedicated development team behind it, one that fully intends to keep the game alive by bringing even more to it through future updates.Mind you, if you find yourself frustrated with the randomness and waiting of board-games, then Armello may similarly irritate you. While some strategy is possible, victory in Armello is greatly dependent on the luck of the draw and the luck of the roll (though this can also be an appealing spice for the adventurous). Also, every game of Armello requires 4 players, whether they be human or AI controlled. This means you'll find yourself sitting through quite a bit of downtime, watching other players go through their turns. In the game's options, you can opt to skip AI vs AI battles to lessen your waiting time, but you can't fast-forward all of it. You could leave the computer while AI turns play out, but watching other players' moves is also part of the game (i.e. planning your own moves based on where your opponents appear to be going or what they may be planning to do).All in all, Armello is a wonder for the eyes, and one round is a delightful way to spend half an hour to an hour. While PvP games online are completed in one go, offline player vs AI games can be saved and continued at a later date, making this game a fine option for a short spot of casual fun as well. If all this tickles your fancy for fantasy, delve deep into Armello and try for the Lion's throne.			"

												I've enjoyed this game thoroughly.Having followed it since it's infancy on Kickstarter, I can't help but revel at how much it's progressed from the beta stages to the current gaming incarnation. The storyline is rich and full of character (and characters). And while it seems simple; there is masterful amount of strategy to be had in something that feels so fluid. This truly is more than a simple turn based strategy. It's a game that has depth. And while every 20 round game feels as it will be too short to truly experience anything; I find myself drawn not only into the game world but to the storylines behind each avatar's play style. To this effect I woud recommend this game and I forsee expansion packs in the future.			"

												THIS whole game is massively beautiful and charming,but here is my oppinion for this game.1-Fun to play with anyone .2-Cute cartoon animal character designed .3-Game mechanic based on both player luck and RNG.(1)What the game needs right now is bases of player whom interest and wish to play .But buying this game won't satisfied you for long IF YOU don't have friend(s) to play with.The game itself don't have a chatroom for player or even type/chat;/whisper;/all. It replaced with natural spoke of  characters.The most annoyed problem for this game is multi-player matching mechanic. Good thing about the game that allowing player to play as single-player match while waiting to find a full party joining but you'll felt a shame left in to know that most people or players were no longer interested in online-play anymore.( Maybe the number game room with bar like (4/4) game might improved online play for this game. ) ;)<Break> It still a break time right? <Break/> (...)What it called again? Number gameroom no. 04? nahh I'm too stupid of these kind including my Language skill -3- (?)*DO IGNORE THIS MESSAGE right away~(2)Before playing Armello I already in loved with characters, and I mean all of them including Royal guard themself.The cutscenes giving the atmosphere of the game thus you played your type of character , you'll almost become one with a character in the game. Like you were them. ""It a board game with visual screen that showed no more than illusion of such an charismatic theme"". ( Hope you're not getting confused by last phrase, lol )(3)By all mean, like all board game, You need stregth of both mind and body to concentrate nevertheless this game can also mess your day up by number generate mechanic or what we called RNG thus 'Random number generate' .Luck can be mean in RNG but both of them were separate from each other when it come to Real time board game.TO see picture [ Luck<-- RNG --> RNG ]Not all that I've got in mind but thing need to be wrap up now.After reading of my criticized ( Mostly like "" In my oppinion ""), Please do know that I'm not professional to the game or any of judging.It may looks like a serious criticized but fun left, therefor the matter is up to you all now , Great hero.Will you recommend this game to others or maybe share the game to support their back. =)			"

The graphics are stylized in a really interesting way, but it isn't so cartoony that it feels ""cheap.""   The gameplay is fairly choice-driven, so no two games are the same. Flavor text & characters are on point. You actually find yourself rooting for the Rabbit Clan, or the Bear Clan, or (my favorite) the Mouse Clan. The flavor text has just enough silliness that it keeps things amusing while still immersing you in the role-playing.Cons: The multiplayer.  I know, I know.  This has been said a few times over, but it really does need a failsafe for when queues aren't hoppin' and people still want the multiplayer experience.  I've seen other reviews recommend a ""fill-with-AI"" option that still allows you to get chests & keys, assuming you aren't the only PC in the game.  I stand behind that.  There have been a few times that people have quit during character choosing, and that's really frustrating when you've been waiting 10+ minutes for a game. It often feels like you're playing alone.  The canned chat is actually pretty comprehensive, but it would be nice to have an option to chat freely if both players have it enabled.  I know it could encourage cheating for achievements, but it could also encourage dialogue about the game and make it feel less... lonely.All in all, enjoyable game + good graphics + good writing on the part of the devs leaves this game at a 7.5/10.

												Armello is a great looking digital adventure boardgame.  There's a lot to do and there are multiple paths to victory and opportunities to adjust your strategy during the game.  It feels a little random at first, but once you start learning the cards and strategies, you feel like you have more control.The continued support and last few updates have done a a lot to streamline the game (particularly the quick AI turns). Some of the design descions feel like they should have stayed in a board game ,ex. rolling actual dice, non-syncronous turns.  Multiplayer has a lot of down time between turns.  This isn't a game for impatient people.Overall, if you are patient and take the time to dig in, this is an interesting strategy gaming experience.  I initially disliked this game due to clunky UI and too much downtime in multiplayer. I feel the developers have sufficiently addressed this (although more can be done) and find myself willing to dig deeper.			"

												Armello is a digital board game that mixes strategy and luck, where you play as a hero and go for one of several victory options in order to become the new king of Armello. It is a fun and cunning game, where anything can happen at any time and where no one is ever counted out. Up until the last turn, you can easily pull off a victory despite having virtually nothing going for you -- but only if you can deal with your opponents accordingly! The game feels a bit like a mixture between a lot of Mario Party, a good dose of Civilization, and a touch of Skyrim. My only gripe is that turns aren't simultaneous, making it so that you watch your opponents play more than you play yourself.			"

The animations are very nice and the game concept is very well thought out, though the game can get dull at times when playing online.Each players turn can take a while and you will sometimes find yourself surfing the web while waiting for your turn.There are multiple win conditions and no game is typically the same.

												Armello is a mostly turn-based strategy game played with up to 4 players. Your ultimate goal is to overthrow the Mad King and restore peace to the land. Or rule over it with an iron paw; this game isn't about what comes after, but the hard-fought journey to it. It is a fresh take in the turn-based genre, where you don't simply go from point A to point B and finish first. You must use this strange land as a tool to build up and achieve victory through combat, magicks, or trickery (usually a combo of all three!). Each player chooses a hero each with their own passive ability and allocation of stat points. Afterwards, you choose a ring, granting an ability based on what clan they hail from. Then an amulet from a shared set that can boost a stat by 1 or make a particular victory condition slightly easier to obtain.Dice appear in combat and perils (traps that require the dice to match symbols), where you either hit, miss, or defend. Each shield blocks one hit, where misses are 33% likely, hits are 50% likely, and shields are merely 1/6 likely. Attacks are resolved at the same time, so mutual kills can often happen unless you were geared up defensively. I don't feel this is a flaw exactly, just a design that requires player understanding and adjusting accordingly. However, you can guarantee certain dice rolls by burning your cards, matching its symbol on the top-right.Card decks are used whenever you start your turn and draw new cards up to your Wits stat. You may choose from Items (healing, equipment, movement), Magic (stat buffs, teleportation, peril spells), and Trickery (traps, resource stealing, sabotage). While you are free to pick, your ideal choice lies with your character, position on the board, and time of day. Almost nightfall and you still have some magic? Draw a spell and use it up before you receive more for free. Have a lot of settlements under control? Draw trickery and take advantage of your discount per owned town.I say it is mostly a turn-based game, in that you can play cards during other player turns. You can equip items to prepare for a potential battle, use buffing magic cards, play perils on the board, even teleport off-turn. While you cannot use a spell directly onto a player currently moving, you can still place traps in their way. Overall, this is the best time to modify or cement the strategy to be used on your next turn, rather than always being bored waiting for the three other players.The ""rule of four numbers"" is a reoccurring theme in this game. There are four hero clans: Wolf, Rat, Bear, Rabbit; and you must always play with 4 players, even if the remainder is AI-controlled. There are four main stat points: Fight, Wit, Body, Spirit. There are four ""resources"": Gold, Magic, Prestige, Rot. There are four ways to win the game, and you must keep all of them in mind to hinder the other players' progress while slowly reaching your own under the radar.Each player starts in their Clan Grounds and have 3 movement points to use on the board, which itself is divided into different hexes. Each hex is a particular terrain type which may help or hurt you or your enemy from their current goal. This is an important distinction from other board games: CURRENT goal. Maybe you need to finish a quest to get another stat point, maybe you need a couple towns under your control for gold next dawn, maybe you're hunting a monster (Banes) or another player for more Prestige. None of these actions is a direct victory action; you are building tools and resources to aid you in reaching victory.The map is not very big, but the land of Armello is a dynamic, living entity that is randomly generated each match. During the match, perils, hazards, and enemies will move around or be added/removed by player actions and influence. As the King is slowly dying each day, there is a time-limit for the players to work. You may win by Prestige where you inherit the crown after the King passes. You may collect 4 Spirit Stones to banish him after you breach the palace grounds. Or you may throw down the gauntlet and use brute force to combat him directly. OR take to the dark side and show just how corrupt one can get before facing him.Your stats help you combat the hazards in the game. Body is the simplest stat; it is your max health. Fight almost always determines how many dice rolled in combat. Your Wit determines your maximum cards drawn at the start of your turn, your dice if Evading in defensive combat, and rolled dice in some perils. Your Spirit is how many magic points you are balanced to each nightfall and how far you may cast a spell from your character, and your dice against magical perils.The presentation of the game is fantastic. Every character model is sharp and inspired, with a colorful fairytale-esque aesthetic. Shadows cast across the land based on the time of day/night. Beautiful animated art is on every card in the game, even viewable in the gallery. The idle animations are done well for each hero and fit their personality. They play a ""boast"" animation on certain conditions, such as on killing their combat target or finishing a quest. Even Guards, Banes, and the King himself have subtle animations that follow these same rules!Armello is visually designed to feel alive during a match, and when everything comes together, I really get that feeling. Instead of a static board, it is a living world that we adventure in. The developers have invested a lot into polishing this game, and it shows. The music is excellent and further immerses one into its world, covering the right moments of atmosphere, tension, and drama. Hearing more about our heroes in the future would be great. However the lore is provided indirectly through guides and stories that won't immediately be visible during matches. Quest logs do explain what your character is going through to get the throne though.There is a good amount of randomness to the game, which may turn some players off, as they are expected to be strategic in a game where fate keeps dealing you the wrong cards or combat dice rolls came out poorly despite beating all your opponent's items and stats. Nonetheless, each player can manipulate the situation to best be on top. Try not to end your turn near a dungeon if night is coming and you cannot handle combat if a Bane were to randomly spawn from it. See if you can afford to go around a peril if you aren't prepared to (literally) roll with it. Don't always choose Risk on quest rewards. Don't make enemies too early just because you can. Ultimately, you are your own ally and alliances are temporary - Finding balance between risk and reward, and having a Plan B are key in this game.The developers are still looking towards future updates and game balance, and are occasionally tweaking different cards, items, and elements. It's a very polished, visually-pleasing game to play that takes 60-90 minutes once you know how to play. Deeper down, there is a lot of replayability to be had if given a chance. Even now, there are elements of counter-play involved when choosing a character. Playing against Thane, the sword-crazy wolf who can passively cause armor-piercing attacks? Play a spell-caster or Zosha who can Ambush at night. In a match with multiple spellcasters try a Witty character and focus on a non-combat victory while countering with Trickery. With four players, there is never a true counter-class to everything, meaning your best skill is improvisation and never surrendering even if you were killed and sent back on the final day.I have really enjoyed my experiences with the game and encourage others to give it a try. It mixes a board game formula with a very lively aesthetic and dynamic gameplay, pushing you to think ahead about What Ifs, threat priority, and resource management. Don't let the random elements be a turnoff, enjoy the potential the game has to offer, and ultimately play in your way that lets you have fun.			"

  ""Dovie'andi se tovya sagain.""  It's time to toss the dice. Being a lover of fantasy, roleplaying, anthropomorphism  No, I am not a Furry, trickery, and dumb luck, I decided to buy this game. I have not regretted it. I was a little lost starting off, but after a few matches I started to pick up all the intricacies of the game better, and now I only improve the more I play. In this game, you select a Hero or Heroine of one of the Five Clans: Wolf, Bear, Rabbit, Rat, and Bandit.  The four Bandit Clan characters are currently only available to startup backers, and will become accessible to the purchasers of a DLC that reportedly comes out in early 2017.  Your quest? Save the kingdom of Armello from the careless rule of a once-good King overcome by the Rot, an all-consuming corruption that has tragically driven him into spiraling madness. You must become the new King or Queen of Armello by  whatever means necessary,  be it alliance, betrayal, fame, daring acts of heroism, or, if you so choose, by becoming even more powerful in the Rot than the Mad King himself. Like I said, this game relies heavily on RNG, which is (as far as I know) essentially a technical term among RPGers for blind, dumb luck. Most of your strategy comes from leveling up certain stats, thereby increasing your ""luckiness"", and by playing cards to other players and to different tiles. You can win three different ways. The first is a Prestige Victory, where the Hero or Heroine with the most ""Prestige"" becomes the new ruler of Armello after the King perishes (he is slowly dying) by right of succession. The other two methods are much more direct: Kingslayer and Spirit Stone Victories. Kingslayer is exactly what it sounds like: you confront the Mad King and defeat him in combat. A Spirit Stone Victory is the trickiest, but I believe it is the most satisfying. You collect four of these objects called ""Spirit Stones"", holy objects of great power, that crystallize randomly at Stone Circle tiles across the board. You then confront the King and use their power to banish him. There is also a Rot Victory, though I consider it to be one and the same with a Kingslayer Victory, but of course with the added detail of your Rot exceeing that of the King.Getting into the Palace is usually the hardest part. Everyone has their eyes on it, so everyone wants to keep you from reaching it. I have yet to try Multiplayer in Armello, but from what I've heard, it is much more fun with friends than with strangers.So, if you like politcal intrigue, fantasy, animals, and tabletop RPGs, get this game. You may want to wait until a sale to purchase it, though. That's what I did.As for the DLCs, I have not yet purchased them, but I do plan on doing so. The added characters look fun to play as, and the aesthetic pack looks good, as well. But once again, you should probably wait for a sale.I give this game a 10/10.EDIT:I just bought Usurpers, and the characters seem pretty balanced.

												Armello is essentially a digital board game and a very good one at that. From turn one of this game, the player must make important, often risky, and game altering decisions that will shape the way they and other players progress to the end of the game. There are as many avenues for victory as there as there are players in a game which always leaves you with an opportunity for victory despite your circumstances. The small victories and defeats you experience will keep you engaged in the game up until the very end where the game's stakes rise as each player makes the final preparations for their win condition (though I concede that sometimes turns can take a little longer than I'd like). As with any multiplayer game, it is best played with friends as you will often find yourself deliberating and even deceiving them as you play. That said, I think this game would benefit from having a text chat to be able to better communicate with players in-game as the only option to do so right now is through pre-determined phrases (which have an element of humor in their own right I'll admit).

												Having recently found an interest in digital board and card games, I thought I would give Armello a try given the high ratings, and was not disappointed.  Though I am personally not a big fan of the whole ""whimsical animals"" theme, the game itself looks very nice and gameplay is quite engaging.  Though I'd recommend picking it up on sale if possible, it really is a unique blend of different game types (part rpg, part strategy, part card game).Offhand, it reminds me of a combination of Chaos Reborn and The Witcher Adventure Game, though there is much more to it.  If you enjoy such hybrid games, I highly recommend this title!  It is not overly difficult to learn, though it clearly takes some time to master.  Unlike some card-based game, one is not put in a situation where they find themselves having to purchase cards in-game, a very strong selling point for me.			"

												I love the flavor and the themes present in this game - the impending doom of a power vacuum and the trickery you can pull off with temporary alliances. It's all very lovely until you get into the center of the game: The dice.RNG is an important part of games because it keeps things interesting. It helps people in the back pull forwards and the leaders fall into more manageable positions. But it often times feels like you as a player are fighting RNG and not the players. It's less your strategy versus theirs and more like your fighting a coin flip.Nonetheless I recommend this game for how fun it is with friends and family. But as a warning: Do not expect to play this game like a multiplayer with progression. It's a board game where dice and random numbers decide what happens not you; so play it as such.			"

												Excellent boardgame style game. Characters are mostly all interesting to play with their own power. Graphics are really enjoyable even a medium graphic hardly access high quality of graphics. This point is quickly forget with the pleasure you can have to restart a new game, 'cause each game are differents and seldom repetitives. I would just give one dark point at this game 'cause I personnaly feel that one condition of victory is really too hard and too random (Rot victory), which remove a part of true strategy... it would be good if the studio dicrease just a little the difficulty of this victory mission.

												I don't play a lot of board games, card games, or tabletop dice games, so considering that Armello is a mix of all three, that should frighten me. However, I do love the premise of fantistical, swashbuckling, swords-and-magic adventure, and when you add animal characters to the pot it happily brings me back to the days I read Brian Jacques' Redwall novels.A complete Armello game normally takes about 60-75 minutes, and there are four main ways to win: doing the most ""good"" before the turns are up is the easiest, while the other three can be much more challenging to accomplish. Over time it may be discouraging to see time-out endings happen the most, but I think a player needs plenty of experience, a plan from the get-go, and modest luck to reliably go for the quicker, decisive wins. I'm not there yet...The artwork is lovely and so are the landscapes. All of the design resonates charm and liveliness and presents a convincing world with a broad range of characters - but only on the surface. It was a little disappointing to see a lot of this detail come only through the art. There aren't deep backstories of the playable heroes, or lore that permeates throughout the world. Events don't really happen on a timeline or connect to each other very deeply. It's like there's either ""good people or bad people"", ""named character approaches you, you do one of two choices on a quest and that's the last you'll hear of him until you replay"". The players write most of the action while fighting, betraying and sabotaging each other, but that story always resets when the game ends and another starts. Basically, don't look for a compelling narrative to be there in stone.But this takes nothing away from the core mechanics, which are pretty balanced. Each hero specializes at doing something with the three card types, whether it's suiting up in the best equipment, weapons and armor, casting spells and boosting themselves (or crippling others) for a while, or setting up traps and causing havoc to tip the scales in a different direction. Managing gold and magic to do all these things is a tricky task. Anything drastic needs the right cards in your hand and every decision to spend or save them is nerve-wracking and exciting. They're good defense most of the time, but for me they're the reason I keep getting wiped off the face of the earth by lightning when I walk out of tree cover.I think the biggest issue I have with this game is how easy it is to attack and how hard it is to defend. In most circumstances there's 3 sides of the die that grant strikes but only 1 side that provides a shield, nullifying a single attack; kind of unhelpful if strikes just outnumber everything anyway. So there's a lot of times where two battlers will just pointlessly tear each other to shreds, die, and get sent back to their homes in frustration. The game's tips do point out that combat is costly, which I guess kind of contradicts the thought that things should be settled on the battlefield. However, this ends up justifying the use of cards to do some of the fighting and keep the dice on hold.Overall, I think I'll get my money's worth out of Armello. It's not an exaggeration that this game sways in the balance of luck all the way up to the final turn and keeps things interesting and unpredictable. Armello is a worthy starting point in a genre I'm no longer unfamiliar with.			"

												ok, so one of my friends gifted me this... i normally don't care much for this type of game (i'm not into strategy that much) but WOW! this game is actually pretty sweet!the goal of the game is to become the new king. you can collect stones or kill him or something... i'm not much of a story guy... but it's pretty neat. there's dungeons spread around the world map that can give you items, spells or traps. Monsters spawn sometimes from the dungeons. guards troop the different areas. you can hide in forrests and a bunch of other things!now this review is pretty useless because i really don't know why i like it... but i guess i get to give it a thumbs up atleast... well... i'll make a quick pros and cons thing i guess (keep in mind i only have 2 hours in-game as of writing this)[PROS]- awesome music and sound effects- runs on a laptop that's literally a potato- it's the kind of game that is ""easy to learn, hard to master""[CONS]- when playing only against AI bots you can't skip over their turn and see the outcome right away. if you're not playing with friends this can be a bit annoying IMO.

												Armello has been aptly described as a ""virtual boardgame"". You play against other folks online or against computer opponents, on a rather small but artfully rendered map, with the goal of becoming leader of the kingdom in one of four ways. You increase your stats by completing quests, defeating other players (or evil critters known as banes) in battle, or by luck of the draw from a deck of cards. Cards can grant you bonuses, temporary or otherwise, or you can play disadventageous cards on your enemies. Cards can also be ""burned"" (exchanged for a sure roll on your dice) in battle.While strategy has a decided effect on the outcome of a game, sometimes there is nothing you can do against a bad run of luck, and that is my only real complaint - too much luck is involved in gameplay, what with the cards, the dice rolls, and the arbitrary appearance of the quests and perils. I won my very first game almost purely by luck, because I really had no idea what I was doing.Despite this, I find Armello enjoyable and well worth the cost. It will appeal mostly to people who enjoy board games, but others may find it engaging as well.			"

												I first got this game expecting it to be a weird, annoying, and complicated game but of course I was proven wrong. I love the game for its gameplay, creativity, and art style and I love how it allows us to build our own little story out of these characters. Me and my friends are hooked and I think we recently met a developer online! But there is still room for improvement! Some ideas me and my friends had is that when a game is finished we could save our quest journals so we can read them whenever we want! I also do think that the map tends to get a little cluttered and could use expansion (DLC possibly?). Speaking of DLC I looked at the prices for the new characters and such I do think that it is WAAAY overpriced... TEN WHOLE DOLLARS!?! SERIOUSLY!?! But yeah I hope maybe the devs take these ideas into consideration because I have a feeling this game may start to get a little dull soon... ;-)			"

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game. But I can't in good conscience recommend it.The Good: The game mechanics are well thought out, the characters and their abilities are also very balanced. Playing a game, you feel like you always have a chance to win it, even if there are setbacks. There is enough strategy to keep your brain in it, and enough luck that it doesn't get repetitive. Basically, the game itself is awesome.The Bad: It crashes. A lot. There have been days where I've had four games crash in a single day, due to reasons like someone quitting the game - more often than not, that locks up the game for all of the other players. This wouldn't be that bad, if it didn't happen afte you'd already invested 45 minutes into a multiplayer match. Don't take my word for it - go to the discusson forums and the Bug section. It's the same problem, hundreds of times. Every time, they ask for bug reports, but there's no solution. When I have reached out to the developers for assistance myself, they've said the same thing, asked for bug reports and game logs, which I've provided, on numerous occasions. Then nothing happens. The issues are never fixed.Even this wouldn't be that bad, except that they keep releasing DLC. It's like they're building additions onto a house with no foundation. Also, they're parting out cosmetics like they're trying to turn this $20 game into a $60 release. I get that no one has to buy extra dice or seasons, but it's infuriating that they seem to have the development time to push this stuff out, but not fix the very serious game breaking bugs that have been in here since the very beginning.I have about 250 hours in this game, so obviously there is a lot to enjoy. But I don't recommend you buy it until you start seeing posts here about these issues being resolved. It's absolutely infuriating, because this could be a truly great game, and instead it's something I come back to every few weeks, hoping will be better, and it never is.			"

  ""Dovie'andi se tovya sagain.""  It's time to toss the dice. Being a lover of fantasy, roleplaying, anthropomorphism  No, I am not a Furry, trickery, and dumb luck, I decided to buy this game. I have not regretted it. I was a little lost starting off, but after a few matches I started to pick up all the intricacies of the game better, and now I only improve the more I play. In this game, you select a Hero or Heroine of one of the Five Clans: Wolf, Bear, Rabbit, Rat, and Bandit.  The four Bandit Clan characters are currently only available to startup backers, and will become accessible to the purchasers of a DLC that reportedly comes out in early 2017.  Your quest? Save the kingdom of Armello from the careless rule of a once-good King overcome by the Rot, an all-consuming corruption that has tragically driven him into spiraling madness. You must become the new King or Queen of Armello by  whatever means necessary,  be it alliance, betrayal, fame, daring acts of heroism, or, if you so choose, by becoming even more powerful in the Rot than the Mad King himself. Like I said, this game relies heavily on RNG, which is (as far as I know) essentially a technical term among RPGers for blind, dumb luck. Most of your strategy comes from leveling up certain stats, thereby increasing your ""luckiness"", and by playing cards to other players and to different tiles. You can win three different ways. The first is a Prestige Victory, where the Hero or Heroine with the most ""Prestige"" becomes the new ruler of Armello after the King perishes (he is slowly dying) by right of succession. The other two methods are much more direct: Kingslayer and Spirit Stone Victories. Kingslayer is exactly what it sounds like: you confront the Mad King and defeat him in combat. A Spirit Stone Victory is the trickiest, but I believe it is the most satisfying. You collect four of these objects called ""Spirit Stones"", holy objects of great power, that crystallize randomly at Stone Circle tiles across the board. You then confront the King and use their power to banish him. There is also a Rot Victory, though I consider it to be one and the same with a Kingslayer Victory, but of course with the added detail of your Rot exceeing that of the King.Getting into the Palace is usually the hardest part. Everyone has their eyes on it, so everyone wants to keep you from reaching it. I have yet to try Multiplayer in Armello, but from what I've heard, it is much more fun with friends than with strangers.So, if you like politcal intrigue, fantasy, animals, and tabletop RPGs, get this game. You may want to wait until a sale to purchase it, though. That's what I did.As for the DLCs, I have not yet purchased them, but I do plan on doing so. The added characters look fun to play as, and the aesthetic pack looks good, as well. But once again, you should probably wait for a sale.I give this game a 10/10.EDIT:I just bought Usurpers, and the characters seem pretty balanced. I recommend getting it, but, again, wait until a sale. Now I just have to hold my breath for the Bandit Clan DLC...EDIT 2:Multiplayer and the community are great! I've played with both cutthroat and nice gamers, and the matches can get very intense and competitve.  A forewarning: some players have a highly developed sense of vengeance. Messing with them once may make you their nemesis for the remainder of the match. EDIT 3:Okay, I admit the games can run a little slow in multiplayer, but I still enjoy them. Just make sure you have an hour or two cleared--no one ever said tabletop gaming was quick.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

Fans of  Brian Jacques' 'Redwall' series, David Peterson's 'Mouse Guard' graphic novels, or the 'Mice & Mystics' board game will find Armello's aesthetics a delightful treat. It is a game begging for additional player characters (perhaps as DLC) as well as different maps, but one can hope such additions are already in the works. Two rabbit thumbs up!			"

I tried to get a win with each charcter. Nine games later, all but Barnaby, Twenty games later, all but Barnaby. 72 games later, all with Barnaby.I decided at this point I was versed enough for multiplayer. The first game I won on a random hero (Mercurio); presitge victory 24-6-3-2. I said, ""Damn I don't know what happened but I must be a god.""Then I suffered a prestige loss 10-9.After, I lost to a player sacrificing their 11 prestige to attack the king. The winning player won with 2 prestige.Then I lost, cornered in my own clan grounds as Amber by 2 banes, River, and Thane while I had 4 prestige versus a high of 8. I don't even remember who won. Nevermind, I did. With prestige. I'm still not sure how.Would buy again, 9/10.			"

												Armello tries to simulate a tabletop experience and does so pretty good.Think of it as Game of Thrones with animal characters.PRO:Different ways to obtain victoryDifferent Characters offer different play stylesPlaystyle can (and will need to) be adjusted in gameFeels like playing a tabletop gameCON:Some victory conditions are harder to meet (hello, rot victory)If the character you want to play gets picked by someone else you might have to change your playstyleFeels like playing a tabletop game (dice hate me ;) )Armello is a game about tactics and getting screwed over by dice and cards. Very often the player who is best at adapting to unplanned circumstances will win. Twists at the end are very common. The game is more deep on tactics than it looks and the random factor of dice and car draws help in getting that board game feel the game tries to achieve.All in all I'd say grab it while on sale, except you have a group of friends who will also get it.

												A very intriguing game, that combines the aspect of board and card games very well, although there are critical elements of randomness, it displays a strong risk and reward system. Decision making will ultimately drive the degree of which randomness affects the game , but sometimes it just sad to watch everything crumble in my eyes, but the game is still fun and I believe it makes the game much more rewarding when there is small parts of success.

												If you like board games, not boring old monopoly or life or whatever, but games with real choices and depth, get this game. It's everything a board game should be with all the things only a video game can add. The rules are simple, but provide many different strategies to win and claim the throne of Armello for yourself. The King of Armello has succumbed to the rot, a plague of darkness sweeping over the land. It weakens his body, and addles his mind. Each morning, he gets one step closer to death, and each night, he falls further into darkness. The throne is up for grabs, through one of four methods, Killing the king yourself, and surviving the fight. Gaining enough prestige throughout the land, and being crowned once the king dies of his rot (Or is killed and kills his attacker.) Finding four spirit stones, and using the magic of the Wyld to banish the king, or becoming even more corrupted than the king, and becoming the new dark lord of Armello. You and 3 other adventurers have stepped up to try and claim the throne.So explore Armello, finding treasure, ammasing wealth, growing stronger, anything to give you an edge. And once you think the time is right, storm the castle walls and take the throne. It's one of the better looking games I've seen, and yet isn't very hardware intensive (It runs perfectly fine on my crappy laptop that can't even run TF2 anymore). Goes to show how well stylized graphics can make a game shine.Currently has 8 characters, (But more are coming soon). falling into a few different archetypes, and various amulets and rings to fine-tune your character, and a crate/key systen similar to tf2 with dice skins instead of hats. No need to buy keys though, they drop as well as the crates.Overall, a very fun game that's great to play with friends, or just when you want to play a round or two.			"

												As a big fan of board games, I have never really enjoyed any video game version of a board game. Too many board games that make their transition to PC seem to stay too faithful to their source material, and don't realy take full advantage of what they can do with the medium. Armello is able to avoid this issue by being built from the ground up as a video game in the style of a tabletop board game. It utilizes mechanics like stealth which would be unfeasible as an actual board game, and wraps everything in beautiful visuals that really bring the game to life. Yet as a video game, Armello hits all the right notes as a board game.			"

												I love the flavor and the themes present in this game - the impending doom of a power vacuum and the trickery you can pull off with temporary alliances. It's all very lovely until you get into the center of the game: The dice.RNG is an important part of games because it keeps things interesting. It helps people in the back pull forwards and the leaders fall into more manageable positions. But it often times feels like you as a player are fighting RNG and not the players. It's less your strategy versus theirs and more like your fighting a coin flip.Nonetheless I recommend this game for how fun it is with friends and family. But as a warning: Do not expect to play this game like a multiplayer with progression. It's a board game where dice and random numbers decide what happens not you; so play it as such.			"

												I don't play a lot of board games, card games, or tabletop dice games, so considering that Armello is a mix of all three, that should frighten me. However, I do love the premise of fantistical, swashbuckling, swords-and-magic adventure, and when you add animal characters to the pot it happily brings me back to the days I read Brian Jacques' Redwall novels.A complete Armello game normally takes about 60-75 minutes, and there are four main ways to win: doing the most ""good"" before the turns are up is the easiest, while the other three can be much more challenging to accomplish. Over time it may be discouraging to see time-out endings happen the most, but I think a player needs plenty of experience, a plan from the get-go, and modest luck to reliably go for the quicker, decisive wins. I'm not there yet...The artwork is lovely and so are the landscapes. All of the design resonates charm and liveliness and presents a convincing world with a broad range of characters - but only on the surface. It was a little disappointing to see a lot of this detail come only through the art. There aren't deep backstories of the playable heroes, or lore that permeates throughout the world. Events don't really happen on a timeline or connect to each other very deeply. It's like there's either ""good people or bad people"", ""named character approaches you, you do one of two choices on a quest and that's the last you'll hear of him until you replay"". The players write most of the action while fighting, betraying and sabotaging each other, but that story always resets when the game ends and another starts. Basically, don't look for a compelling narrative to be there in stone.But this takes nothing away from the core mechanics, which are pretty balanced. Each hero specializes at doing something with the three card types, whether it's suiting up in the best equipment, weapons and armor, casting spells and boosting themselves (or crippling others) for a while, or setting up traps and causing havoc to tip the scales in a different direction. Managing gold and magic to do all these things is a tricky task. Anything drastic needs the right cards in your hand and every decision to spend or save them is nerve-wracking and exciting. They're good defense most of the time, but for me they're the reason I keep getting wiped off the face of the earth by lightning when I walk out of tree cover.I think the biggest issue I have with this game is how easy it is to attack and how hard it is to defend. In most circumstances there's 3 sides of the die that grant strikes but only 1 side that provides a shield, nullifying a single attack; kind of unhelpful if strikes just outnumber everything anyway. So there's a lot of times where two battlers will just pointlessly tear each other to shreds, die, and get sent back to their homes in frustration. The game's tips do point out that combat is costly, which I guess kind of contradicts the thought that things should be settled on the battlefield. However, this ends up justifying the use of cards to do some of the fighting and keep the dice on hold.Overall, I think I'll get my money's worth out of Armello. It's not an exaggeration that this game sways in the balance of luck all the way up to the final turn and keeps things interesting and unpredictable. Armello is a worthy starting point in a genre I'm no longer unfamiliar with.			"

Graphics are really enjoyable even a medium graphic hardly access high quality of graphics. This point is quickly forget with the pleasure you can have to restart a new game, 'cause each game are differents and seldom repetitives. I would just give one dark point at this game 'cause I personnaly feel that one condition of victory is really too hard and too random (Rot victory), which remove a part of true strategy... it would be good if the studio dicrease just a little the difficulty of this victory mission.

												It's a fun little jaunt and experiment into how a virtual board game would work. It has some clever mechanics and is overall quite fun. Be warned, though, that playing with other people (as opposed to just playing the AI) will make the game substantially longer. If you can get together and play with some friends online, you'll probably all have a lot of fun. If you're just playing with randoms, you'll probably have a bad time as you wait what feels like an eternity for your turn to come back around.			"

												I first got this game expecting it to be a weird, annoying, and complicated game but of course I was proven wrong. I love the game for its gameplay, creativity, and art style and I love how it allows us to build our own little story out of these characters. Me and my friends are hooked and I think we recently met a developer online! But there is still room for improvement! Some ideas me and my friends had is that when a game is finished we could save our quest journals so we can read them whenever we want! I also do think that the map tends to get a little cluttered and could use expansion (DLC possibly?). Speaking of DLC I looked at the prices for the new characters and such I do think that it is WAAAY overpriced... TEN WHOLE DOLLARS!?! SERIOUSLY!?! But yeah I hope maybe the devs take these ideas into consideration because I have a feeling this game may start to get a little dull soon... ;-)			"

												Armello is a great looking digital adventure boardgame.  There's a lot to do and there are multiple paths to victory and opportunities to adjust your strategy during the game.  It feels a little random at first, but once you start learning the cards and strategies, you feel like you have more control.The continued support and last few updates have done a a lot to streamline the game (particularly the quick AI turns). Some of the design descions feel like they should have stayed in a board game ,ex. rolling actual dice, non-syncronous turns.  Multiplayer has a lot of down time between turns.  This isn't a game for impatient people.Overall, if you are patient and take the time to dig in, this is an interesting strategy gaming experience.  I initially disliked this game due to clunky UI and too much downtime in multiplayer. I feel the developers have sufficiently addressed this (although more can be done) and find myself willing to dig deeper.			"

												The art style and presentation is excellent; this is very much a digital board game, and has the look and feel to match. The gameplay is simple to grasp: move around the play area completing quests and the like to reach one of 4 win conditions. Variety, depth, and replayability comes from the 8 characters; unlockable buffs; and a large number of cards to reveal. I played through the tutorial just to get an idea of how the game plays, and I was instantly hooked. I have only played through 1 full game but will definitely replay as it is very fun and compelling to play. I've two main gripes with Armello.The first is that there can be a lot of down-time between turns while the AI/other players decide what to do, which would be fine in a table top game, here it leads to boredom. You can speed up AI turns, but I imagine that when playing with 3 other people will lead to very long games.My second gripe is that there is not a lot of interraction between players. You can lay traps (You've activated my trap card!) and cast spells on them, but a lot of the time the only way to sabotage someone's plan is to out-and-out attack them (if you can get to them, movement is slow enough) or to pip them to the post and win faster than them/complete an objective faster than them.I would recommend this if you like board games, but maybe put on a show to watch when it's not your turn, or have voice chat to allow witty reparte and the lively back and forths that you get with IRL board games.

I highly recommend you join the discord which is on the armello reddit, the players there will teach you so much and help you learn about the complexities and nuances of the decisions you make. They will celebrate your successes and comfort you on your failures, all whilst teaching you. Moreover, this is a boardgame at heart. Playing it with stranger to whom you can't talk is not the way it was designed to be played. I beseech you to try this game, put the time in to learn its strategies and allow yourself to be swept away in the wonderful and blissful land of Armello.NOTE: I'm aware this game is not for everyone. It requires a lot of patience at first, and does involve a large amount of RNG.			"

												Backed this game on Kickstarter, it's really come a long way. Armello is an absolute gem of a game. A digital board game featuring lovable animal characters trying to dethrone a corrupted king and claim the throne for their clan. Mechanics are well thought out, and the game is regularly updated with new and improved systems to add additional depth while not making the game overly complex or confusing. There are multiple ways to win, which helps keep a single person from dominating the match, though the game is quite RNG-based, relying on dice rolling for battles, card drawing, procedurally generated board, semi-randomized quests, and a few other mechanics. Sometimes even with excellent strategy, the luck of the draw can't be overcome.Still, an excellent game I never get bored of. Game length: 1-2 hoursPros:+ Beautiful and unique style and graphics featuring anthropomorphic animals+ Great soundtrack+ Procedurally generated board means every game will be different+ Multiple ways to claim victory, to stop a single player from dominating and blocking others from winning+ Interesting and unique systems for combat, bounties, and 'traps'+ Each character has a unique hero power that makes them different from other heroes+ Each hero can be further customized to your playstyle with a selection of rings (exclusive to clans) and amulets (available to all heros)+ 'Microtransactions' handled very well and very positively for everyone. Dice skins can be found in chests and traded or sold on the Steam market, which the Devs get a cut of when an item sells on the market.+ Updated fairly regularly with new and enhanced systems+ Devs are very attentive to bugs and glitches and do their best to solve them as soon as they can+ Promotes public play with a chest and key system, in which both chests AND keys drop+ Custom rule settings for private games+ Can play a single-player match while waiting for a game (though queues are rarely very long), tab on taskbar will flash when you find a game while queued is you don't want to play singleplayerCons:- RNG-based, sometimes too much- Some hero's powers are almost useless, while others are very powerful- Private play doesn't give you keys or chests, making those who prefer to play only with friends unrewarded and left out (though the keys and chests only contain cosmetic dice skins, so it's not a mechanical disadvantage)- Currently a set of 4 exclusive Kickstarter heroes, though anyone playing in a private game with someone who owns them can use them, they can only be used in private games, and the Devs have stated they will be released as DLC for anyone to purchase eventually- Only way to communicate is through a set of 'commands', such as Hello, Good-bye, etc. No voice or text chat.- DLC is a little pricey, especially in comparison to the full game (the set of 4 DLC heroes is $10, 2 board skins are $5).

 BASICALLY ITS REDWALL IN VIRTUAL TABLETOP RPG FORM. Both the 8 year old and the 18 year old in me are giddy with joy! So to start I'll sum up what is generally not well liked by pretty much everyone and get that out of the way. Firstly, nearly everything in this game is in some way randomly generated. I could explain the systems and what I think were the design choices that led to the extreme amount of RNG in this game but it really isn't worth the time. Suffice to say that the one consistent element in the game is the number of tile you can move on a given turn. There have also been what I see as contradictory complaints about the game being too long to be fun and too short to be playable. I fundamentally disagree with both of these assessments on the grounds that A) I have only had difficulty achieving one play style after less that a days worth of play and B) a game will last you less than an hour to complete when something like irl Dungeons and Dragons will take like three just to get from town to town and a grand strategy game like any of the Civ games can take multiple days to finish on lengthier settings. And to be clear, I mean the game will take less that an hour because the game has what is effectively countdown clock built into the game with the way that the king (the victory condition in this game) works. Basically, the game ends when he dies and he is already on the way out the door by the time the game starts. Secondly, There is, at this time, not exactly a wealth of content available. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU WILL PLAY THE GAME ONCE AND BE DONE WITH IT. What it means is that there is effectively one game mood and one map. What keeps the game fresh, in my opinion, is the very randomness that some people seem to distain. From what I have seen on the forums accessed from within the game, they are still actively working on bring more playable characters into the game and genuinely seem interested in improving the game with time. As for maps and game modes, I haven't seen any developments of note. In my personal opinion, the game is well worth its price as is but that is a very personal evaluation I leave up to you. If these are concerns for you, you may wish to avoid this game, at least for the time being.Otherwise, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS AN ABSOLUTE JOY.The art is lovely in a way that I won't even attempt to describe. It manages to be both whimsical (prob mispelled) and sufficiently, well not exactly bleak but fitting for the sort of dark fantasy game that they were going for. The RPG elements, which I admit are a tad simplistic, are very rewarding if you take the time to read the in game text, consider you actions through the lens of you character, and put in the smallest effort to care about what your doing. In short, use your imagination for 5 seconds. Its good for you. There is some RPG style progression and a wealth of collectables of extremely high quality (such as animated cards that you unlock for viewing after being played) and trinkets to change the way each kingdoms champions play after you have used them multiple times. I personally love the gameplay. Note that I say this as someone that plays Dungeons and Dragons semi-regularly and has absolutely no problem waiting for 15 minutes while Sir Mixalot (actual name of friend's character) makes a decision as to what song he is going to play and then roles like thirty dice just to see if it all amounts to anything meaningful. Yes, it is undoubtably slow as a result of there being no way to skip the AI's turns and it is most certainly very random. However, it is not the total cluster that some of the negative reviews might lead you to think. Each character has certains stats at which he or she is better equiped to use. If you pay attention, you might even pick up on the fact that each of the 4 kingdoms is designed to be better at a certain type of victory condition, of which there are 4. And when I say might have noticed, I mean play throught he tutorial up until the point where the game literally tells you which victory each of the AI players are going for and which you should aim for. If that wasn't a big enough clue, maybe just put on your thinking cap an realize that trying to win a game by killing a lion as a rabbit is probably not the best course of action. It's a lot like rock, paper, scissors except this time with ""fatal"" consequences.Also, not that this is the biggest thing to note, but the music is very pleasent. I'm not talking like Bastion levels of amazing or even Skyrim levels of IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU. It's more subtle and relaxed in a sort of ""what if Game of Thrones didn't make you have an minor heart attack everytime you watch"" sort of way (note that I do realize that a great deal of GoT is just people talking at each other and not all that eventful). ONE LAST WORD OF CAUTION: I do think that a large part of my personal enjoyment of this particular game comes from the theme and setting. When I was a younger, I read a great deal of the ""Redwall"" series by Brian Jacques that I mentioned at the beginning of this review. It is in no way an understatement to say that these book made me love to read. I can really explain what it was about them as a whole that I responded to but I know that, by shear virtue of the easy parallels between the books and this game, that Armello stirred within me many of the emotions and affections that struck me as a child while reading the collective works of Mr. Jacques. If you, like me have any fondness for those book I highly recommend giving this game at least a cursory glance before passing it up. If you don't then go read any book from the Redwall series right now, or at the very least keep them in mind if your looking for something to gift to an 8 to 12 year old. I say all of this as an admission of bias. Please do take it into consideration.So to sum this whole thing up, if the idea of midieval furry simulator 2015 sounds the least bit interesting to you, give this a chance.Forgive any spelling or grammar error you might find in this thing. I wrote it at 1 in the morning.			"

												Here's my two cents on this game: - Really beautiful graphics, great gameplay. - 8 characters to play from, all with unique abilities and differing stats but even the weakest can be the strongest.- Win in 4 different ways or be like me: Kill king's guards cause they're standing on my quest (._.)- Sabotage your opponents and laugh like a maniacal mastermind. (Even better when they're so close to winning) - Then get sabotaged in return (Sucks when you're so close to winning) - Dice rolls, mhmmm, don't even let me start on that. Unique but still partially dependent on your luck xD (RNG !@!%@!)Additional stuff:- I do get this weird rough-ish sort of sound in game and sometimes it gets a little annoying (not that it affects the entire gameplay anyway). - Game might be still a little buggish (or maybe it's just my PC's issue x.x) but developers are quick to respond xD.TLDR; Great game, should try getting it if it's on discount if you feel the price is a bit eheh. Not that type of game which you can play for 5 hours straight, a game or two a day with friends makes it all the better xD. If you're not the board game type of person, might not be entirely worth it to get it at full price but it's a great way to spend time with friends, so do give it a try :D9/10-ish. Hopefully the developers add a little more content (maybe expand the map and add more winning conditions or allow more players?), but it's still a job well done xD.			"

												Love this game to death with a nice community and a lovely game. There are some quirks to it but that's quickly overshadowed by all the fun you have playing the game. For starters:This is a turned based game that has a lot of cool mechanics which are and are not limited to:Mana usage - Cast spells on opponents during your turn and on someone elses turn (can't target players that is taking their turn)Money usage - Funds the perils and trickery cards which turn the battle for Armello in your favorPerils which are traps Different character types and abilities for each of the clans united by the KingA generator map that is different everytime you play it.This game is really fun but the core of the game is how you're suppose to win. There are 4 ways of winning the game. 1. Win by Prestige. Most common winning method by my experience. You pretty much do good deeds and kill enemy heroes and banes. You can also complete the quests.2. Win by King Kill. Go into the Palace and kill the king to win the game!3. Win by Spirit Stone. After stepping into the Palace, you can win instantly by exiling the king.4. Win by Rot. Compete against the King to whoever is the most corrupted. You gain additonal die for having a higher rot score.There are different ways of playing the game, but why don't you buy it and try it yourself? It's 20 bucks and well worth the amount of money being put into the game.  "

												I would like to start by saying that I really enjoy playing this game. If you are a fan of strategy board games this is definitely the game for you. There is a ton of variation so no two games are alike. If there was one thing I wish I could change is that there should be the ability to choose the amount of days the game lasts. Specifically, to have the option of lenthening the amount of days in a game. Right now there is a set limit which can be frustrating when you are invested in a game and than it just ends after the 9th day.			"

												Great strategy board game. Sometimes feels a tad slow because theres so much content in the game. Mixes card playing aspects nicely for battle mechanics. Haven't been able to play online (keep getting bumped) but not sure if mac and pc matchmaking exists, as I've been playing on the go on a macbook, not on my main PC. Props on the art style, as it's super well done. Character animations for battle scenes can get somewhat repetitive, but it's more about the journey towards being the king and killing everyone/thing in your path. The AI is fairly good, so don't assume you'll always win. It's a slow burn to win, but enjoyable none the less. Multiplayer against friends is probably even more fun. Worth checking out if you're into strategy/board/card playing games.			"

												Armello is an incredibly original and refreshing experience.Combining boardgame strategy with roleplay mechanics in a fairy tale ambiance, the game has this unique aura that won't leave you indifferent.There are a few different characters, each having its own features and specificities, and four different ways to win the game that will require you to adapt to the unpredictable events happening on the board. Even after hours spent playing, I still haven't unlocked everything and I just can't stop launching new games because this is just too much fun.You should definitely make a stop by this enchanted kingdom. Not sure you'll manage to leave though.			"

												Armello is better than most boardgames brought to pc.  It is a unique hybrid that has elements of board games and strictly PC RPGs.   It is not a couch party game (at least not yet) -- not sure if it would work or not since it has a stealth element.  Controller support in-game is nice for SteamOS (though you can't  navigate menu yet).  I think it is a better version of Wizwar or Talisman (more stratedy and ways to win) though there is still some luck/badluck that can frustrate or make you jump for joy.Overall, I have tried many Early Access games and many seem to progress very slow.  I would put Armello at the top of the list for customer support, updates, dev team, ect.  (alongside Brawlhalla); I am thoroughly impressed.UPDATE: 7/15 -- Developers have continually patched multiplayer performance and added new cards and events to the game as free content and work on balancing the cost/values/stats of cards.  The game continues to get better and they are planning to add more heroes to play (free or not, I'd pay for more champs and diversity).			"

												Armello Is a charming fun game that reminds me of a game called Culdcept that I enjoyed alot. But Like Culdcept this game will cost you freindships >8) Pros Good Music fun Balanced gameplay its a fun easy going game.cons. themultiplayer system the queu finder and allthat are broken as heck. I mean seriously broken.  and the online play is not smooth many times  the game drops in the middle of combat. The second con is the reward system.  you get a key or a chest at random to get the cool collectable dice. But withthe online system as busted as it is its hard to win theses rare itesm or you get liek 10 chests and no keys.  this likely on purpouse siince unscupulous companies like to gouge players for money.  considering my only other greif is one of the characters that i personally think is Broken ( i am looking at you Brun ) this game is pretty worth the money.  it had lovely music  cute characters gorgous animations.  just a preey great game all in all.

The devs are very active and it is just fun.  Sure, it has little issues here and there (would love multiplayer matches to form a bit faster for example) but this is a rare game indeed.  Victory is never guaranteed, you can help other players or stab them in the back.  Become an epic hero in battle or out-wit everyone without swinging your blade.

I'm not talking like Bastion levels of amazing or even Skyrim levels of IS THIS EPIC ENOUGH FOR YOU. It's more subtle and relaxed in a sort of ""what if Game of Thrones didn't make you have an minor heart attack everytime you watch"" sort of way (note that I do realize that a great deal of GoT is just people talking at each other and not all that eventful). ONE LAST WORD OF CAUTION: I do think that a large part of my personal enjoyment of this particular game comes from the theme and setting. When I was a younger, I read a great deal of the ""Redwall"" series by Brian Jacques that I mentioned at the beginning of this review. It is in no way an understatement to say that these book made me love to read. I can really explain what it was about them as a whole that I responded to but I know that, by shear virtue of the easy parallels between the books and this game, that Armello stirred within me many of the emotions and affections that struck me as a child while reading the collective works of Mr. Jacques. If you, like me have any fondness for those book I highly recommend giving this game at least a cursory glance before passing it up. If you don't then go read any book from the Redwall series right now, or at the very least keep them in mind if your looking for something to gift to an 8 to 12 year old. I say all of this as an admission of bias. Please do take it into consideration.So to sum this whole thing up, if the idea of midieval furry simulator 2015 sounds the least bit interesting to you, give this a chance.Forgive any spelling or grammar error you might find in this thing. I wrote it at 1 in the morning.			"

												I always feel a bit of secret relief when the results of a Kickstarter project finally makes it into my hands. Kickstarter is both a great tool for people to gain funding for, and put forward ideas for, projects they are passionate about. It’s also a recipe for disaster. Projects often over-promise and under-deliver, much like the last decade for Peter Molyneux. And there’s no guarantee that the people behind the projects have any concept of how to manage a small business, which is essentially what kickstarter is enabling.Fortunately, the Kickstarter that is Armello did not over-promise and ended up resulting in a great game. League of Geeks, backed by Screen Australia and Film Victoria, have developed a digital board game, and one of the first that I know of that isn’t an adaptation of an actual board game. What makes Armello a great game is its use of the digital medium. It does things that most other board games couldn’t. There are several different game systems which make this a complex game, but complexity is fine in this medium. When you move into forests at night, you become invisible, something you couldn’t do with a hardcopy game. It also allows the NPCs to be a force of nature in themselves. The king and his guards have their own agenda, the banes that spawn out of the rot also act individually. But the best thing about having a digital board game is that there’s added character and personality in the game. The guard dogs sniff the air as they stand to attention. Some of the cards have animations. Day and night is actually day and night. You have a little advisor which pops up when you need to choose a new quest.I’m yet to play with other humans, which will definitely provide a stronger challenge than playing with AI (one difficulty setting), and I’m looking forward to it.For full review, visit: http://icarusreviews.net/2015/10/12/armello/ "

												I primarily game as a single player, so it made reviewing Armello difficult because a lot of the magic of Armello is found in Multiplayer with the community. Luckily, the community is healthy, supported, and talented. Here's a couple reasons why:1. Developer Dedication - The LoG crew streams 3 times a week, providing answers to questions, insight to new developments, and generally being a stand-up crew. It's well past launch, and the developers continue to be a positive presence in the community. 2. Player Community - On both the forums and in the streams, you'll find dedicated players willing to answer questions, consider strategies, and talk about the future of the game. Games online maintain a friendly but competitive atmosphere. Because at its core, Armello is a digital boardgame, with all the pros and cons of one.A number of reviews have brought up the pace, the danger of battles, and the tendency for Prestige victories to be more common. These are all true, but they're part of what make Armello great. For pacing, you wouldn't rush through a board game, you want to take the time to consider your actions. Plus, you can also play a lot of cards while it isn't your turn. This is where the strategy of Armello really shines.The battles, I've found the battles are very dangerous because the rewards are significant. Especially when there is a bounty on the player's head, or you're fighting the Prestige leader, or you're clearing a bane from a settlement. All of these can generate +2 relative prestige, which is an enormous boost. With careful maneuvering, you can easily go from underdog to leader, if you roll well.Finally, yes. I've won a ton more as Prestige Leader than any other. That's what develops the tension. From the very beginning of the game, every player is working toward Prestige victory. That's the long term goal, but sometimes when you are coming up short. That's when you can invoke some of the others such as Spirit or Kingslayer to steal a victory from the Prestige leader. Being flexible and adjusting to changing game conditions is part of the fun of Armello.There are numerous other critiques players have brought up, which I've considered, and I've now come to terms with. A lot of them are part of what makes Armello great and provides the challenge in the game. I don't think this game is for everyone, it isn't an RPG where you grow stronger and unstoppable. Nor it is a strategy game where consistent good decisions will insulate you from doom. Instead, Armello is a dynamic game full of life and capable of catching you by surprise. And that's why I recommend Armello.  "

												I picked this game up in the early access stages and was very impressed from the get go. I don't play it as often as I would like as it's one of those games I prefer to play with friends rather than with random strangers, but when we do manage to get a few games in we always have a lot of fun. Armello is a board game brought to life in virtual form and it is done beautifully which is a credit to the developers as board games rarely convert well to a video game format. The game is set in a mythical fantasy kingdom of medieval animal characters, initially of which four were selectable but another four have been added since. There are four factions that represent different species, rats, rabbits, wolves and bears. The rat faction is home to charismatic sneaky types who suit the player that values cleverness and cunning (I always play as Mercurio for this reason) the rabbit faction is home to nobility who fare best at exploring and unearthing valuable artifacts, the wolf faction consists of brave warriors, suitable for players who value honour and battle and the bear faction consists of druids who suit players that prefer to use magic. All four factions and the characters who represent them are well balanced and give the game a good amount of variety in it's functionality. The object of the game is to dethrone the corrupted King (who naturally is a Lion) and usurp the throne for your own faction. The land has been swept by an arcane sickness that has brought about large ravens that leave death and destruction in their wake, the corruption they spread is a blight that darkens the souls of creatures it touches, which is why the King must be dethroned. The game takes place across a day and night cycle which alternate every turn, each night the King takes a point of corruption which weakens his health but makes his ability to fight more devestating. There are four ways to win in Armello, you can kill the King yourself thus dethroning him in person, you can opt to be a little more guileful and gather prestige so that you are selected to be heir should the King die due to corruption rather than player intervention, you can collect four spirit stones that can be used to cure the King of corruption so he can be banished or you can gain as much corruption as possible through evil deeds which will give you a better chance at killing the King. As the game plays out you move freely around the board as many spaces each turn as your character abilities allow for, you collect cards that come in various forms that affect yourself, other players and the board in various ways. You can also opt to go on quests that come with their own rewards and add a good deal of role playing and flavour to the game. Should you come across an opposing player you can opt to battle them and if you do you get given the opportunity to burn any cards you don't want and each card will be converted into a dice that represents whatever burn ability the card had alongside it's own ability, this can come in the form of combat and various other things that will affect how the battles play out. There are honestly so many unique functions and things to do in this game that to go into all of them would take too much time, but for a game that lasts around an hour per session it really manages to suck you in and offer you a great deal of things to do without ever seeming too rules heavy or complex, which really gives it great appeal to both hardcore board game players and newcomers alike.I really, really like Armello, it's a beautiful game with fantastic artwork, design and enough tactical depth to keep you coming back for more. I play a number of board games with friends and Armello has outstayed many of them, which is quite the feat for a virtual board game. If you have any interest in board style games at all or were just looking for something to play with friends and family I highly recommend Armello, it's quickly become one of my favourites.			"

												Just like Dota and similar takes the RTS genre and removes the entire military concept and puts bigger emphasis on hero movement, this game removes most major bigger things like armies from the 4X turn based games.This game is kind of like a board game where you collect cards that give you bonuses and then fight using dice on the game board.Goal? Stop the king from ruining and corrupting the world, by either going corrupt yourself or doing many other ways like using doplomacy, violence, or magic.			"

												Armello brings the charm of board games into the digital world, and does it better than a simple port might.A lot of digital board games simple replicate a board game with a screen and buttons. This can be fun, but one thing that sets Armello apart is that they actually take advantage of the medium and do things that would actually be impossible in a real-life board game, but yet they never take away from that dice-rolling, peice-moving wistfulness that comes from playing a good board game. The game looks and sounds fantastic, with battle animations and background music, all while rolling dice and drawing cards. It's a very nice balance of a board game and a video game, without sacrificing the charm of either one.As for the game itself, you pick a anthropomorphic animal hero, then move around the board to try and overthrow the kind before one of your three opponents do. There's combat, and spells, and stragedy, and many options for how to win. Not a whole lot to say here, except that if you like turn-based, board game combat with some stragety and thinking but also some luck, you'll like this game. To anyone who likes board games and video games, this is an excellent example of how to properly merge the two genres.			"

												Armello is a fun turn based strategy game with furry animals vying to take control of their Kingdom from an evil Monarch. The game was fairly easy to pick up, and with different victory conditions available, and RNG equipables, each game is a new experience.			"

												Armello is a very good implementation of an electronic board game.  The game is colorful, and I feel the champions abilities definitely give each character a distinct play style.  Combine that with the items, and no game really plays quite the same.  However, due to the winning conditions, yes the end game will appear on the surface to be the same, but how you got there, and the actual board situation can differ significantly from game to game.How you build your character and what items you get into play are very important.  Taking items that provide additional dice, will typically give you a better attack, but they leave you vulnerable in defense.  If you take defensive items, you tend to get guaranteed die rolls (shields), but you give up some attack potential to do so.  However, you need to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing.  If they are building defensively, and they have higher base health than you, going defensive is not your best option.  If they are going for a high attack, it might be best for you to rely on subterfuge and obstacles to achieve your aims.  I highly recommend this game, but having a liking for boardgames definitely enhances the enjoyment.			"

												This game is incredible. The attention to to detail and the amount of re-playablity is impressive in and of itself. There is quite a selection of heros to choose from, as well as amazing cards that are all well made. The game is often updated to add new content in, and this content makes the game better in a variety of ways. The devs are very responsive to any bugs or problems that may arise in the game, and I honestly haven't seen that many anyway. The only issues is that one of the win conditions in the game, is incredably difficult to achieve and that making a custom game will not allow you to progress to unlock new stuff. This game is truly great, and will entertain you for hours and hours on end. Now get out there and claim the throne Armellians!			"

												The best digital board game i've ever played. Might be a little bit random at times but if you learn how to play the cards and how to use them to your advantage togehter with what to do and what not to do in a match its perfectly fine to win over the 'randomness'. Cool heroes to choose from and lots of unlucks to work towards. The graphics are also nice, they are cartoonish and nice to look at. The music is also fine, nothing special though. The multiplayer is were this game shines the most. The MP matches can be really nerve wrecking and suspensfull when the game nears the end and. Overall a total recommend from my part. Get it if you like strategy and boardgames.			"

												JUST ONE MORE GAME AND I'LL WRITE A REVIEW! JUST ONE MORE...!That's what I've been saying ever since I bought this game, and I can't stop playing. Armello is a gorgeous virtual board game with a surprising amount of depth to it, and like all dice-based board games, a surprising amount of frustration. However, trust me when I say that once you figure it all out, this game becomes incredibly fun to play. So, here's my pros and cons for the game:PROS:+Aesthetic, artwork, art style--everything about this game is gorgeous!+Simple to learn, decently difficult to master+It's a virtual board game that's actually goodCONS:-Frustrating amount of luck required at times (I just spent 4 hours trying to get ONE Rot victory, and currently, it's nearly impossible to do)-The AI's difficulty spikes in opposite directions, at times (I've had one become king of the world by turn 5, only to be destroyed by a weak Bane; other times, they've been so easy to get past that it took me less than 10 turns to secure my victory)I had to work hard to find those two gripes, and since the game's getting frequent patches, I'm certain that they're going to be fixed within the next few months. Seriously, though, if you're a giant nerd like I am and you have spent several hundred or thousand dollars on board games, Armello is probably right up your alley! I don't score games with numbers, because I don't think it's possible to quantify an opinion into a number, but instead I use a scale of: ""Buy it now, wait for a sale, wait for a massive sale, or DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"" This game gets a solid 'Buy it now' from me, ESPECIALLY if you're a board game fan like myself!It's $20, and while I've had some frustrating matches, I understand that that's going to happen in a game like this. The dice might decide, ""Oh hey, you know how you need a shield? I'm going to slow on that side, look like I'm going to stop, AND THEN I'M A MOON SUCKA! AHAHAHA!"" or you might draw 6 cards in a row that are completely useless to you, but that actually makes it more appealing to me. You have to learn to adapt to any situation that the game throws at you.Anyway, thanks for reading the review, and I'll see ya next time!			"

My only comlpaints are that the servers can be wonky.  I don't appreciate dropping forty minutes into a game just for everyone to get booted at the end.  And the new heroes are released very slowly.  Regular DLC for cards and characters would breath life back into the game on a regular basis.  Those cons aside the game is a hoot and visually pleasing.			"

												Great game for fans of turn based strategy games done in a single sitting.Here are my first thoughts after 50 hours.  About 5 hours single player and 45 multiplayer, so I'm definitely focusing on the PvP aspect, though I suppose some might even enjoy single player.Pros:+ Great graphics+ Original and fun gameplay mechanics+ Pretty good gameplay balance+ Healthy multiplayer community (rarely more than 30 seconds of queue time)+ Good loot drop system, especially if you enjoy the Steam marketplaceCons:- No replay system (probably the most obvious oversight), especially being a turn-based strategy game)- No option for a full overhead view, which would be extremely helpful.- No campaign besides the tutorial- Very little voice acting- Technical issues with sound (certain sounds consistently come in crackly, perhaps poor recording?)- Lots of waiting for your opponent(s) (=overly long matches)- Some bugs/unexpected behavior with card effects- RNG + long match time = anti-fun (see below)I didn't mention RNG itself as a pro or a con, because I think it can go either way depending on the player's taste.  There is too much RNG to bank on being able to pull off a particular strategy each game, but that can be viewed as a good thing since it forces a player to cosider all options at all times.  However, the problem here is that your match usually comes down to a single dice roll (attacking the king), which can be very frustrating at times.  You can outplay your opponents the entire match and go into that dice roll and fail miserably (lose the game), which would be fine with an RNG-type game like this if it weren't for the fact that you spent 45-90 min leading up to it.IMO, the game should have been made with a slightly smaller board with only 3 players (instead of 4).  This would take the average game down down to something more managable like 30 min.Despite all of the cons, the fact is that this game a lot of fun, even for an RNG-hater like me.			"

												Despite mostly positive reviews, I have to admit I wasn't too sure about buying the game at first. Most people that reviewed the game negatively, seemed to dislike the apparent long waiting times in matches (and as such long matches) and the general randomness. It put me off a little. I did put the game on my wishlist and I noticed I kept checking it out every day. So what the heck, I took the plunge.After getting a few games under my belt I can safely say: I do not regret buying it.The game looks great and plays exactly like a tabletop game should play. Not entirely sure how to explain it, but it has that feel to it. The amount of time you spend waiting for other players is very manageable; I never felt like I wanted to do something else while waiting. Matches take about an hour or so, give or take, which to me is perfect. And the randomness, well.. it's a dice-game.. It seems silly to complain about it (you don't complain about a RL game of Risk, or similar, I'd imagine) and there are plenty of ways to build your character as well as influence the game and other players by your actions. There's luck, and there's bad luck, but I always felt ""in control"".The lack of a regular chat system seemed odd at first, and at times I do miss it still, but the preset phrases you can hurl at eachother seem to cover most bases, and I can see the point in that it keeps things friendly. No salt or toxic nerdrage to feast your eyes upon. Being thick-skinned, a mute button would have been enough for me, but we have what we have, and it's fine.There's the odd quitter here and there, and it's difficult to determine if they quit intentionally or by accident. I've had one game lock up on me after 3 people subsequently dropped. Not sure what happened there, but it seems to be something that's around for a while already. I really hope it's not a too common occurrence; I don't mind losing a game, but getting a big ""nope! - you just wasted nearly an hour of your time"" simply sucks.All in all, solid 8,5/10 for the game, well done! If you're on the fence for the same reasons as me, don't hesitate to give the game a try.			"

I never write reviews, ever, but this game deserves it.Armello has done the impossible, digitalized the tabletop strategy board game while mantaining the feel of rolling dice with your friends.  What's more, the digital platform has allowed for beautiful gameplay, and new and creative stretches to the genre.  It looks great, feels authentic, and tantalizingly hints at a deep and rich mythology that the devs are slowly revealing via updates and dlc.Some people have complained about the gameplay mechanics, I haven't found them at all random, I mean,  no more than you would want with a game of its type.  The game is incredibly complex but easy to learn, and the devs are always releasing new tweaks, they really listen to feedback, and their patches and updates help, I particulary like the +1 body to all heroes, not to mention the slew of new content that is coming up.The game is ground breaking. If you ever wanted an easier, more streamlimned way to play Avalon Hill type games without sacrificing the deep strategy, this it it.  Cannot recommend it enough.			"

												Game's great, all the art elements, complexity yet simplicity(in controls at least) in gameplay come to a beautiful fruition in this fantasy board game. Total killer experience for multiplayer platform and enchanting prologue for single player. One feature I think it lacks though - Hotseat mode - otherwise this game will advertise itself without any excessive help.			"

												Armello: Haphazard RegicideEver wanted to kill a king? No? Oh… Well, ugh, this is significantly more awkward, isn’t’ it? I guess– er, you know, forget I said anything.So…Do you like anthropomorphic animals? Yes? Cool! Well… Remember that murder thing I mentioned…?Armello is a pretty rad indie game that simulates a stellar board game experience. One that mixes elements from Table-Top, Pen and Paper RPGs, and a bit of MtG to make for a very unique experience. Armello is pretty simple to play once you get the hang of the game’s systems. But it’s fairly complex to explain… Despite a bit of a learning curve, this game is definitely worth the initial hump of “What the hell am I doing?”.Before we get into the nitty gritty, the main goal of Armello is to become the new Monarch. The current King has been stricken with an evil disease called ‘The Rot’. And as you would expect, he’s not doing so hot. Every night his condition worsens, and every day he inches closer to death. The Rot also affects his mind, sending him into madness. I feel bad for the guy.Now, how does this relate to the player? Well, every win condition involves usurping him, either by waiting for him to die and taking his place. Or taking the throne through force. Heck, even the condition that involves purifying the King of his Rot kills him. So you need to get comfortable with the idea of regicide. Despite it’s appearance, Armello is a pretty dark and rough game.The death of the King is the impetus, and the final goal, of your actions. Almost everything you do will revolve around this end goal. But the King is more of a passive piece on the board. He looms over the game, and carries out evil machinations, but never poses an immediate threat. What you have to look out for is the three other people all actively scheming, and advancing their own plots. You’ll be put in situations very regularly that involve you prolonging the King’s life in order to ensure you’re the one to end it. The enemy of my enemy and all that.There are a lot of moving pieces in Armello. Four players all working towards a similar goal. With alliances and rivalries beginning and ending on a turn by turn bases. What might appear like help from another player is really just them protecting themselves. I’ll help you this turn to back stab you next turn.Everything might be going exceptionally well on turn three, but by turn four the entire board state has changed and you must re-assess. It pays to think ahead, and have a plan, but it is invaluable to be able to adapt. There were many occasions where I was one turn away from winning, only to have it slip away from me when the AI pulled a total dark horse victory out of thin air.How is this possible? Well, every player has a wide array of abilities that can, when used creatively, be applied to completely ruin another player’s day. There are pieces of equipment that increase your prowess in battle– making it easier to kill the King… or anything else. There are magic spells that give nasty status effects, such as: ending your turn prematurely, move you across the board, or possibly even killing you. And my personal favorite, traps. These can be anything from poison, killing companions, stealing their cards or gold, negating their equipment.. the list goes on. If you think through your actions, and use everything at your disposal, you can send someone in the lead into last place with one turn.The order you do things in, and how long you wait to do it are incredibly important. On your turn you, usually, have three action points that allow you to do the various things at your disposal. Some take more than others… Simply moving three spaces can wreck havoc on another player. Scattered around the game’s map are little villages. If you move your character through them they will pay tribute to you in the form of gold. Without gold you can’t perform certain actions. Having three turns worth of set up be ruined because you’re short one gold is incredibly disheartening.The swings in Armello are fast and hard. I’ve gone from first to last and back more than once over the course of a game. It’s never dull, and never boring. The pressure is almost always on. And the games are fast enough that you can play one over a lunch break.Aside from killing the other players, there are also quests you can embark on that give various rewards. Sometimes the rewards can be game winning. Other times they can be a massive disappointment. But you’ll always walk away with some kind of a bonus, like an increase in your stats and Prestige. If the King dies of his Rot, the player with the highest prestige is the winner by default.Armello really requires you to think, and demands a good bit a strategy. The games go by quick so your plans need to come to fruition sooner, rather than later. I find myself planning for the end game on turn one. “I want to win via killing the king”. And adapting my play towards whatever will actively further that goal.It’s a good mix of long term and short term planning at the exact same moment. If you realize that things aren’t going your way, you need to adjust your strategy or risk losing. By the time you realize “things are bad” it’s almost too late. It’s as much about furthering your own ends, as it is interfering with everyone else’s. Because everyone’s position is so precarious, just a small bit of interference is enough to make someone target you the rest of the game… “If I can kill the bear this turn, I’ll lower their prestige enough that when the king dies two turns from now I can win.”  Or even better “Well… If I can’t win, you’re definitely not winning either.”Armello is a very mentally stimulating experience… And I’ve only played with the AI. So I can’t speak for playing with humans. I have to imagine it’s a hundred times better. But, that’s one of the best parts of Armello. The AI is actually very good! Now, once I got really acquainted with the game I was able to out play the AI fairly easily. But they’re still definitely capable of einschrauben mich über, hardcore.And on top of everything else I’ve mentioned here. The game has some seriously great artwork. It has a great storybook style to it that is simultaneously both lighthearted, and very dark.Watching a cute little rat solemnly hand over money to the king’s guards as they terrorize the townsfolk hits way harder than you’d expect. He’s not happy about it… but it has to be done.Armello is awesome. It’s worth every penny. Seriously, support the Devs. If you like strategy, check it out. If you have friends, and want something to play together that doesn’t require a large time investment– Armello’s your game.Buy it. I highly doubt you’ll regret it.If you liked this review, check out 100HourSave.com for more.			"

												Armello.....So I've been on a slight little board game kick here recently, and Armello seemed like it might be interesting. Picked it up on sale and man have I been blown away by the depth avalable in this little game! What really strikes me is the multiplayer is actually a lot of fun, and while I feel in the current build that Spirit Stone victory is a little too easy to acheive, give it time and this will be one of the better time wasters out there. 7 out of 10			"

												I read some reviews before buying this game that were a bit misleading, so mostly I'm writing this to clear up some misconceptions you may have about this game. (I haven't touched multiplayer yet, so I'll be leaving that out)First off, this game is awesome. Fairly simple, easy to get into, and from what I've seen of the dev's website, continually updated. A single game on the default settings usually take 30-45 minutes to complete. You have the choice of eight different characters to play as and two different maps. You also have the option to equip one ring and one accessory that up different stats from the beginning of a game. You never know what's going to happen in a game, and you may even set out to win in one way, but end up on a different path later on. The card system adds a very deep layer to the gameplay, especially since you can play cards during other players' turns. Maps do seem small, but the way the map is used with quests and different terrains makes it feel a whole lot bigger.If you like turn-based games, get this. If you like card games, get this. If you like RPGs, get this. This game has all that and more for the very reasonable price of $20. Just buy it man, it's awesome.			"

												The base game is a really cool board game, with enough video games and win conditions to feel like it took some inspiration form the Civalization series of games. Although your outcomes will feel incredibly dependant on random chance, there's a ton of fun little stories each time you play. Combat against other players makes you sometimes care less about winning and more about making the guy that killed you twice lose, and that's a really cool experience in this game.Over all, the game feels like its designed to be played with your friends, being able to hang out and talk crap over some VOIP for an hour while using the game as a facilitator to do something. But I also have a huge blast playing against 4 random strangers online and just enjoying the game. The run time can get a little up there, as certain turns may end up taking forever with repeated bad rolls of events, but when those turns are yours they are these wonderful nail-biting heartaches.The only real concern I would have is that there is a little too much focus on cosmetics, having a DLC just being reskins of the board, and recently skins for the characters. However, the game itself doesn't need any of them. Heck, you can get by and enjoy the game without touching the DLC character pack. Its just an opprotunity to send the devs a little more love, which they have easily earned from me!			"

												This game is pretty well built for a board game and has a ton of interesting features for gameplay! I love the animations and everything seems pretty streamline. I think there are still a few kinks to work out of course, but overall this is a pretty polisdhed product. Sometimes the game will hiccup, and I noticed multiple sound files would glitch and the right channel would go dead. Other than that, everything ran smooth. This may be due to hardware, but I have a relatively good setup and it should have no issues.The only cons I can say about this game is that it isn't really friendly to new players. The AI can get sort of ruthless, and you can definitely tell the computer has a plan, and will stick to it till you fail. There was a time where I took over a city, and the bear character attacked me three times in a row. It's possible, except for the fact that I destroyed him the first two times, (thanks to the lucky dice rolls, which is another problem I would like to get into) and on the last, the computer had enough and just killed me. As mentioned, this game is mostly chance. The only skill that is required of you is map movement, everything else is chance. Whether it be random♥♥♥♥♥spawning of enemies, or the cursed dice doing their thing. I sort of whish it was something more skill based than chance base. Sure, you can enforce strategies into the game, but they are so built on the chance factor (which often seems to be a 75% lodr 25% win ratio most times) that the strategies often fall apart. TL;DRGreat game, with some minor polishing that needs to be done, and gameplay relies too much on chance.			"

												If you are a board game junky, and like P v P/ P v E, and games like ""Risk""; then you're probably an Armello fan and just don't know it. Armello is a turn based, table-top video game. The objective: Become the king of Armello. Armello is currently ruled by a tyrannical king simply known as ""The King."" He is consumed by ""Rot,"" and no longer acts on the behalf of his fellow country men (animals?). Take control of members of the Bear, Wolf, Rabbit, and Rat clan and seek to overturn his rule. You can win via four paths: Collecting 4 spirit stones and breaching the castle walls to banish the King, gathering so much rot of your own that you can kill the King at his own game (players roll several die to attack and defend, and if you have more rot than an opponent you get their rot number in additional dice), simply retain the King's favour via ""prestiege"" (Prestiege is earned by completing your own personal quests, claiming burning settlements as your own, and of course killing enemy players. This is where the P v P comes into play full-force), and lastly you can win by simply breaching the kingdom walls and just killing the King the old fashioned way in head-to-head combat.I typed this out and it still doesn't explain the game well enough. The strategy nerd in me can't even convey this properly. Just buy it, man. If you are even thinking about it; do it. Quests, items, badass animal characters, a whole Kingdom to explore, and a fun way to mess with your buddies. You won't know the sensation of breaking an alliance in the very last minute of a game by killing your friend with a spell card and taking their place in the throne room as the new king of Armello. Not if you don't buy it.			"

												A simplistic yet fun game that feels something like a tabletop RPG distilled into a classic boardgame format. Really fun game to just pick up when there's nothing else you feel like doing.			"

												Armello is a great board game expirience and I recommend it, however I have also expirienced multiplayer disconnections seemingly due to the briefest Internet hiccups, with no chance to reconnect. This is incredibly frustrating, sticking to the single player for now.			"

												If you've ever played a tabletop game and thought to yourself, ""This needs automation,"" you're familiar with the general mechanical play of Armello.The graphics, animation, and characterization are charming, and multiplayer makes for an entertaining occasional diversion.			"

												This game is pretty well built for a board game and has a ton of interesting features for gameplay! I love the animations and everything seems pretty streamline. I think there are still a few kinks to work out of course, but overall this is a pretty polisdhed product. Sometimes the game will hiccup, and I noticed multiple sound files would glitch and the right channel would go dead. Other than that, everything ran smooth. This may be due to hardware, but I have a relatively good setup and it should have no issues.The only cons I can say about this game is that it isn't really friendly to new players. The AI can get sort of ruthless, and you can definitely tell the computer has a plan, and will stick to it till you fail. There was a time where I took over a city, and the bear character attacked me three times in a row. It's possible, except for the fact that I destroyed him the first two times, (thanks to the lucky dice rolls, which is another problem I would like to get into) and on the last, the computer had enough and just killed me. As mentioned, this game is mostly chance. The only skill that is required of you is map movement, everything else is chance. Whether it be random♥♥♥♥♥spawning of enemies, or the cursed dice doing their thing. I sort of whish it was something more skill based than chance base. Sure, you can enforce strategies into the game, but they are so built on the chance factor (which often seems to be a 75% lodr 25% win ratio most times) that the strategies often fall apart. TL;DRGreat game, with some minor polishing that needs to be done, and gameplay relies too much on chance.			"

												If you are a board game junky, and like P v P/ P v E, and games like ""Risk""; then you're probably an Armello fan and just don't know it. Armello is a turn based, table-top video game. The objective: Become the king of Armello. Armello is currently ruled by a tyrannical king simply known as ""The King."" He is consumed by ""Rot,"" and no longer acts on the behalf of his fellow country men (animals?). Take control of members of the Bear, Wolf, Rabbit, and Rat clan and seek to overturn his rule. You can win via four paths: Collecting 4 spirit stones and breaching the castle walls to banish the King, gathering so much rot of your own that you can kill the King at his own game (players roll several die to attack and defend, and if you have more rot than an opponent you get their rot number in additional dice), simply retain the King's favour via ""prestiege"" (Prestiege is earned by completing your own personal quests, claiming burning settlements as your own, and of course killing enemy players. This is where the P v P comes into play full-force), and lastly you can win by simply breaching the kingdom walls and just killing the King the old fashioned way in head-to-head combat.I typed this out and it still doesn't explain the game well enough. The strategy nerd in me can't even convey this properly. Just buy it, man. If you are even thinking about it; do it. Quests, items, badass animal characters, a whole Kingdom to explore, and a fun way to mess with your buddies. You won't know the sensation of breaking an alliance in the very last minute of a game by killing your friend with a spell card and taking their place in the throne room as the new king of Armello. Not if you don't buy it.			"

												This is a digital conversion of a charming board-game. All the busywork has been taken out, allowing casual players to pick up a game for an hour. I normally don't do a lot of multiplayer due to min/max metagamers of nerdy rage; but this game was meant to be played with humans. Just like any game worth its salt, you can learn through loosing and win through experimentation and luck.Once you have the mechanics of the game down, it's time to learn the cards and characters. Then you can formulate your strategy. Some players give a negative review of the game due to ""too many attack dice"" being used- they just didn't pray hard enough to the RNGod is all. Dice are random, and you have to be able to take your losses if you want to play this game.If your friends never have time to get together in person, this is an activity you can easily fit schedules together with. Plug into Teamspeak, and it's like it's the 1990's again- you know, before the internet when we used to socialize over the tabletop.			"

												I love the game. It's a table top game with graphic animation. it has a good mix of Strategy, luck and role playing game.Each character is unique and have different play style. the Sana is more magic base and defense. River is balance character with a bit of stealth and magic. etc.Pros- the game is dynamic. every play through is different even if you play the same character. - the game is unpredictable. you might be winning the game in turn 8 but things can go horribly wrong in turn 12.- different ways to win but achieve the different win condition is hard. 90% of the time i usually end up winning prestige. - Beautiful art . the cards are beautiful , the graphics in general is beautifulcons- maticilious , you cannot pass forward the animations . - Need more cards!!! - there are a lot of permutation combination... that's the fun part of the game for me. seeing the different equipment/followers/magic combinations.  - bigger map. if i play Sana sometimes i end up adjacent to all fighter characer.. which pretty much ruin my strategy. I endup working around it.			"

												Beautiful game with an interesting cast of characters to choose from. The game reminds me somewhat of a game of Risk but while having it's own set of rules, gameplay elements and identity.I am not a huge fan of these type of games but playing Armello in short bites ( 1 or 2 games depending on how long the matches are ) really makes want to comeback the next day and play another match or 2.All of the designs are lovely and feels alive with the little animations on the cards and in combat. Music is fantastic as well.With the devs actively looking for feed back and with more content on the way, i can safely say that Armello is a game worth to be explored.			"

												The game is a beautiful mix of gameplay, emmersion, incredible art styles, and flawless replay value (especially if done with friends). The game is still young so one cannot be too harsh on some very minor flaws in my opinion. The game play is like a nice mix of the Lord of The Rings story with Studio Ghibli art stylings and themes with a D&D twist thrown in with it's relative form based gameplay (just everybody makes thier own story). All in all, a great game.			"

												RNG will always be a cruel, unforgiving force. I absolutely adore this game's atmosphere and visuals, and games are short, tense and enjoyable. Even still, I've lost count of how many times I've let out some sort of gargled raspy noise as I failed -another- skill check. 70% chance to win? Nah, son. You failed. Meanwhile your opponents are winning every roll they ever make.Still, I really enjoy the games I get out of this. My last victory was so nail-bitingly close I don't think I have fingernails anymore.			"

												Although the gameplay looks rather complex once you actually play it, it becomes easy and super fun! I love how it combines the use of cards with the realistic world. I love how the story is set up and how even if you played the game six million times before it never gets boring because each round is never the same as the last! Even though the map isn't rather large the gameplay last for at least an hour, an hour of fun that is! Anyway if your interested in this sort of game I recommend it to you! so far the best game I bought on steam!			"

												It is an interesting game and concept. Much much more could be done with the platform and I hope that LoG takes advantage of this more and more, with more quests, more cards, different game modes (maybe with alternate map for coop campaign roleplayey thing?), more house rules, more characters, some sort of faction system to do 2v2, LAN multiplayer (The GoG version has or used to have a 4 digit number for each private room that you had to give to your friends to join and it works on LAN, while the multiplayer of this version is solely through Steam (you need Steam Overlay activated or it is a complete no go). --Here are some things that dont click too well with me or suggestions:-I noticed that the quests are generally the same, you can expect the same three for your first quest and so on. Combat is fine, with some ok armor and weapon any character can be an ok fighter. -But I do have a little bit of an issue with questing being the sole way so far to increase your stats permanently, there is no real benefit to killing banes or heroes other than the rot, prestige or healing bonuses, and there is no real benefit in defeating perils unless you have a bard follower. Also some perils could make use of different stats, facing a band of mercenaries should be ""fight"" instead of ""wits"" and dealing with a magical peril should be ""spirit"" and not ""wits"". -As a suggestion I think you should have some bonus to fighting infected or corrupted heroes (and banes) if you have collected the necessary spirit stones, you are even glowing magestically, yet corrupted heroes (and banes) are unphased by this (and you can still take rot points like usual).-Also, I would like to be able to start my games with a completely empty hand so I can draw what we would like to start with, seems pretty sensible, but that's just me (get OK gear, then worry about other things).-And finally characters characters characters, the more the better!---As for the praise:-Visuals are amazing, you will not be dissappointed. And the Steam version seems to be well polished, I havent experienced a single crash with it, and there are some minor bugs but they will not impede gameplay (that I have seen so far). -It provides a pretty satisfactory multiplayer experience.-It also appears well optimized, which is a surprise to me nowdays since I run on an outdated system (aka, a pentium 4 with an old 6200GS and DDR1 ram, WinXP SP3 32bit) and it runs surprisingly well. I just hope that this doesnt change with upcomming updates like other games I played *cough* Starbound *cough* sorry.  -Soundtrack is absolutely excellent, you should get it, I should get it, everyone should get it.And that's all. If the game changes enough, I may update this.			"

												Edit: This game breaking glitch has now occured for me 3 times in a row tonight. It's no longer occasional for me, it's damn near every match. TL;DR Unfortunately, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS BUG IS FIXED. $20 wasted.It's a great online board game, however, there is one critical game-breaking glitch at this time: If a player leaves the game early, the AI that takes them over can at times fail to do or end their turn. This requires all players quit the current lobby and suffer a loss and a timer pentalty on their next matchmaking game. If it happens several games in a row the queue can be locked.  Additionally, the mechanic when rolling in Perils should get reworked. The roll dice should be a button and not a drag and drop mechanic. Several times I've gone to burn a card, and have had to drag the card over 3-4 times. The timers are short so it's critical it needs to work the first time. Occassionally, when you do this, it will glitch and toss the dice instead. They need to make one or the other (Peril or cards burning) a click button and not a drag/drop mechanic. It doesn't work when they're both so close if you have like 7 cards to play.   Aside from buggy Peril and AI mechanics, the game itself is fun and worth the $20. If the AI glitch happens to you, hit escape and in the top right click the bug icon. You can submit a bug report there. Maybe it will help them patch it faster.			"

												M'Armello. M-m-m, such an excellent game. Cute animals, seeking for nice quests, you guess? Indeed, but what for? For power, for ultimate rule! They are ready for everything! There will be killing each other with any possible, greed, fast alliances and bounty on any who seems to do better.The only problem with that game, is that you can't play it with you friends. Yes, technically you can invite 3 buddies, but when match starts, this buddies just become body on you way, that need to be slaughtered in a moust crull way possible.So, if you want to rot good before you PC/console and ruin any relationships with your firends, you defenetly need to buy this game and gift some copies to persons, wich you want to make cry and hate thee.But, beware. Nothing is clear im Armello, maybe it is you who will be cry in hatred. You don't wanna to? So go an force others in a ultiamte dirty and savage battle for the Throne.Ah, that fluffy this are so cute, eh...			"

Early Access Review
								Let be known the review is still for the Early Access release of Armello (who knows what 6 months will change!) - but so far I'm really enjoying it. From the music at character selection to the card animations, there's a lot of aesthetic pleasers in this game. Each game has ran about 40-60 minutes for me so far (single player) and it was a bit of a curve to get familiar with everything (like most board games, though). I really do enjoy almost everything about the game so far. I feel like so far it's been fairly difficult to win, unless by means of prestige. If I find myself behind in prestige about half-way through the game, I almost know that there's no way to catch up and kind of already consider myself having failed which kind of burns my gameplay morale - but besides that! This is an amazing game so far and I can't wait to see what comes out in the full release in 6 months. So excited!			"

												Let me start by saying i really love the game itself, and have lots of fun playing it. i see why some people would criticize it for iots gameplay but i personally dont mind the random chance(thats board games) and long matches. And i honestly dont even mind putting in paid cosmetic dlc......what i DO mind is the developers pushing paid cosmetic dlc and focusing on in-game charges INSTEAD of putting out more interesting characters. or delivering the ones they ALREADY finished to people to buy yet(the backers on kickstarter got them for free, i get that,ill gladly pay...but why has been MONTHS since they were said to be coming out?).as much fun as it is unless you get it for a CRAZY sale, i wouldnt recommend it until the devs start caring again and focus on improving the game and not on trying to cash in quick with overpriced cosmetics . i understand devs need money too but majorly overpriced cosmetic skins that arent much different than base are NOT the way too do it. Focus on getting GAMEPLAY dlc and gameplay fixes out first, but with each ""delay"" on the bandit clan and focusing on cosmetics before the game itself make me weary of this games future. ill Leave it ""recommended"" for now but ill adjust accordingly "

												If you want to play the perfect board game. dont buy this game. buy chess(or warhammer regicide its the same).because more complex is the game, more difficult will be to keep it balanced.I love everithing about this game. Every part of the game is well polished. the graphic is awesome. the cards are colorfull and animated. I wont explain what the game is. find a wiki. is the best. but is very easy to understand and very difficult to master.People usually don't like the fact you will die easly on combat. because is easy to kill than survive. some times you kill and survive only if the enemy is unfarmed (because you can actually develop your stats during the game), but most of the time if you dont have many armors it will end up in a spar.But you know that? I like that part. I feel  that part gives a realistic gameplay. I don't even care because most of the time I play Sana(wich actually lame in battle but is a good spellcaster).Other pain in the neck is the ROT. rot is the darkside of armello. it will poison you and hurts you. But you can choose the difficult part and try to slay the king as corrupted. When you do that, you actually learned to play armello for good.			"

Combat is fine, with some ok armor and weapon any character can be an ok fighter. -But I do have a little bit of an issue with questing being the sole way so far to increase your stats permanently, there is no real benefit to killing banes or heroes other than the rot, prestige or healing bonuses, and there is no real benefit in defeating perils unless you have a bard follower. Also some perils could make use of different stats, facing a band of mercenaries should be ""fight"" instead of ""wits"" and dealing with a magical peril should be ""spirit"" and not ""wits"". -As a suggestion I think you should have some bonus to fighting infected or corrupted heroes (and banes) if you have collected the necessary spirit stones, you are even glowing magestically, yet corrupted heroes (and banes) are unphased by this (and you can still take rot points like usual).-Also, I would like to be able to start my games with a completely empty hand so I can draw what we would like to start with, seems pretty sensible, but that's just me (get OK gear, then worry about other things).-And finally characters characters characters, the more the better!---As for the praise:-Visuals are amazing, you will not be dissappointed. And the Steam version seems to be well polished, I havent experienced a single crash with it, and there are some minor bugs but they will not impede gameplay (that I have seen so far). -It provides a pretty satisfactory multiplayer experience.-It also appears well optimized, which is a surprise to me nowdays since I run on an outdated system (aka, a pentium 4 with an old 6200GS and DDR1 ram, WinXP SP3 32bit) and it runs surprisingly well. I just hope that this doesnt change with upcomming updates like other games I played *cough* Starbound *cough* sorry.  -Soundtrack is absolutely excellent, you should get it, I should get it, everyone should get it.And that's all. If the game changes enough, I may update this.			"

												I bought this game expecting something on the lines of Civilization and Endless Legend but wow, as a RPG/Board Games lover, I got so much more. The tabletop element makes every part of it interesting and I got surprised on how you can turn the tables and win a match that since the beggining you had given up hope on. It's a thrill!The best of all is that a match doesn't last forever to finish, so it's not easy to get sick of this game. The (kinda) short duration makes every move on your turn precious giving you a nice immersive feeling.The art is beautiful and I'm eager to see the new features that are coming.			"

								Early Access Review-If you enjoy the concept of any of the Settlers of Catan games, and light RPG mechanics in any way, don't mind card games of any kind being used in a board game then Armerllo is a decent buy right now.The fact that later on we get 4 more hero's (doubling the number of current playable characters) just makes this more interesting, seeing as the other characters are more opposite of the 'Clan' they have currently. Looks good, runs well on my slightly older system, and is VERY immersive. My biggest gripe?I CANT BEAT THE KING VIA THE CORRUPTED VICTORY. It is a tad wonky there, but that is it.10/10, will regicide again in the future.			"

												Dude, I recommend Armello for so many reasons... -The OST dude, the OST is great! When the last turns are coming or some hero reach the castle, the music gets intense and you feel like agony for be the one to sit in that shiny throne!! The one who defeated the king!! -The art of the cards and the game, oh dude, they have passion and heart put in them... Really beautiful and greatly genius, the animations, the description, everything!...-The strategy is the key to succes, they are so many ways, ignore the people who get bored easyly, they don't know that you can change the rules and make everything more intense or easy... -I got an extreme wish to complete all the cards in the library and to have my dice collection... I love dices and it's the first time SOMETHING makes me buy and get desperate for a digital dice-You can make earthquakes!!  Also... not always you can play a boardgame with other people irl...I mean... This boardgame has an online feature! It helps so much when you're lonely... Still... I'm the only one in my friend list who plays this... ;-;  "

												I purchased this game along with the newly released DLC the day it came out together. It totalled around £18.99 (ish)So no, I have not owned the game for long. Despite this, my love for the game has made me create a group for it (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ArmelloArmada) and I have spent money on the market buying keys / chests. Pros- Multiple win conditions leading to various people taking various routes to win the game- Quest system which creates a story for your character as you progress through the game you are in- Varied clans with diversity in its classes- The game itself looks very good - Possibly my favourite factor is the cards. I am a huge fan of Hearthstone and every card in Armello has an animation which looks gorgeous. They are so good I had to make them as a seperate point from the game looking good- The game itself has good AI compared to other games - Games are just long enough- Easy to play, hard to master- Each tile has a name and the maps are not the same each game- After game loot which allow for more dice in gameCons- No in chat feature outside premade emotes making telling people what you plan on doing eg. in an alliance- Really nitpicking here but no form of campaign other than the prologueOverall 9.5/10Pretty much a must buy			"

Early Access Review
								Short yet fun Board Game for the computer.  That's currently the best way to describe this game right now.  I've played a few times, won a few games, lost a few (even against the a.i. which was a fun suprise, usually the a.i. in games arnt challenging enough).  However the game lacks the long term strategy aspect that most games like it thrive off of and prestige victory seems to be the most viable option for a game lasting only about 20 turns/10 days. the upside to this is it gives you a game where you can sit down and play a game in 40 minutes without worrying about saving.The game is ideal for playing with your friends and for those days where you need something to do for the next 30-45min.Is it worth the price?  So far for me...  $25/6.3hrs of play=$3.96/hr  for me that is worth it as I know that price will drop as I play more.Overall rating- 7.1/10  -  The game has alot to offer at an early stage.  But a game speed option should be added to fit the needs and wants of the average strategy gamer because lets face it, failing all of my quests at 40-60% is just pure bad luck and there's no way to bounce back from wasting 15 turns on failed quests in a 20 turn game.  But thats just how the dice roll sometimes.Yes for anything 7.0 and up thats what i always say.  What's the point if i only enjoyed %50 of the game			"

Games take not so much time (30-40 min) which is great. A lot of achievemnts to unlock so it is interesting to play again and again.3. Multiplayer. Mega interesting but takes up to 2 hours.4. DLC. Game itself is rather expensive so DLC looks even more expensive. Not sure if I will buy it.Anyway, the game is highly recommended to all board/card games fans.			"

A simple way to destroy friendships really...The dice based conflict resolution is similar to that of RISK, except that both parties get attack and defence dice, and either party can gain an edge by sacrificing cards add attack or defence dice. Iz nice.Some things that'd be cool to see in the future:A visual turn counter/orderIn-game character audio - more audio from the characters! The voices in my head aren't enough!Clan-bonuses?More MapsMod-support!Graphical setting customization (fullscreen windowed mode would be stupendous! also...less clouds?)The ability to rotate the mapAn optional or toggle-able mini-map. Maybe even just to be capable to zoom out more?8-player support! MADNESS!!10/10 would buy again. Very likely to buy copies come Christmas.			"

												OKAY.WHEW, where did the time go?So I've got 22 hours of gameplay under my belt at the time of this review and here's what I can say....WOW. This game is wonderful.People talk about luck when it comes to this game. Well, isn't real life a game of luck? We all have to deal with what cards we're dealt in life. And that's what it all comes down to, how smart, how strategic can you be with the cards you are dealt?And can you accept how the die roll? That's LIFE PEOPLE, LIFEEEEE.Anyways, enough life talk, let's talk about the game.This game is not entirely down to luck, you can be smart about what you're given. Sometimes, you really will be cornered. But the thing is, everyone starts each game at square one. No one is OP, (at first) and the game can change in your favor or anyone elses. You can sabotage others and they can sabotage you. To me, that's very fair.The die in this game are not pre animated, they physically roll as they should in real life, and they are completely random because of this. To me that's as fair as it gets.If you're the type of person who cannot accept the fact that sometimes things don't go your way, then this game may not be for you. If you like the thrill of the risk, the fun that can be had by the fact anything could happen at anytime and you just might have the resources to counter anything against you, then this is for you.The graphics are great, the music is great, it's easy to pick up and learn if you just play through the tutorial and try one single player game, you'll have a grasp of the whole thing.This is highly recommended by me, it's incredibly fun, quite tactical and just plain good.As an Early Access game, there are bugs. They don't happen often at all. But there were only 2 instances where 2 of my friends couldn't finish their games. All other times have been good. There's also a terrific built in bug reporting system for these instances as well. So yeah!GET THIS GAME. Sale or not.			"

												    First of all, I'm just gonna spoil my review of this game RIGHT OFF THE BAT.  This game gets an honest 10/10 from me, it is one of the best games of this year; and it will not be forgotten in my grand book at all.   Secondly, I want the Official board game to this game right now!  Who cares if it's $40.99, I'll buy it.   Thirdly, I think this game is highly under priced; it's worthy of a $30.00 price range on the steam market.   Alright, now that I got that all out of the way, it's time to get on with the actual review.  This is an actual board game on the pc, that's all it is but that's also part of the charm.  This game feels like a more gritty darker sequel to the story of RedWall.  If you are a fan of Redwall, you understand what I'm getting at.  This game has a fantastic card system that adds personal items, spells, tricks and/or treats and companions that can either be implimented to your inventory or played on the map to either other players or locations.  This game's combat is also fantastic, it has a dice rolling sim that you can either roll with on just chance alone, or influence by burning some of your cards you keep on hand.  Despite this game being E+10 rated, it feels more like a mature game that doesn't throw kiddy humor in your face at all; it respects you and it's honest with you, and in return you admire it (kind of builds a relationship between the player and the game itself).  You have a selection of 8 unique characters to choose from that you can play with right off the bat.  There are four different ways to win the game, and all but one of them are valid; I won't spoil the fourth way to win the game.  This game has a beautiful art direction and set of animations in both the 3D world you play in, and the cards you pick up; it heightens the mood and setting you play in.    That's all I really have to say for this game, it's all absolutely solid and I can't seem to find any problems with this game.  I haven't run into any bugs yet, and it seems the devs are constantly updating it to make sure it looks even better than its' original launch state.  I fully support this game, and once again I'm just gonna say, it gets a 10/10 from me.  There is one thing I want to say to the devs right now, just from me personally; I don't speak for the other fans of this game.  PLEASE, make an expansion!  I'll buy it, the other fans might buy it; I'm spreading the word about this game as much as I can.  Thank you			"

												Armello reminds me of board / card games like Settlers of Catan or Dominion, except it's a little bit more complicated.  I've wondered whether it would be possible to play as a physical boardgame, but I think it is too complex.  On the computer it's fantastic.  The pacing is great, there are a lot of possible victory conditions and different strategies to pursue.Love the game.  Art and setting is fantastic.  That said, like a board game, buy this if you have friends to play with.  Single player is fun, but the AI isn't that great, and I think it would get old quickly.			"

Mostly your 4x strategy games.I skipped the tutorial and did a quick AI game to get the basics. Had some questions about dice and some cards. Quit game about 4 minutes in, and skimmed just a few rules. The rules are very nicely organized on the main menu. My second game I had alot of fun. There needs to be an actual tabletop version of this. I'm very suprised there isnt one yet. Solid 8.5/10 in my book.			"

												I've never felt compelled to write a postitive review about a game before, however Armello exceeded my expectations for a turn-based strategy game. In essence, Armello appears to be a unique blend between Monopoly and the Heroes of Might and Magic Series. However, Armello trumps both through its multiple win conditions that lead to relatively short, 17 to 20 turn games (from my experience).Armello's focus on both random and non-random events to determine the winner of a game reminds me heavily of how Hearthstone can be played. In certain cases with Hearthstone, an individual card draw may win the game. However, there is always the aspect of deck building and card play order which can provide the stronger influence. Armello's strength by contrast, lies in the building of your hero's stats, equipment and buff usage throughout the game. As a result, Armello avoids the pay to win mentality of Hearthstone.An argument I disagree with is that Armello can be criticised over its choice of unlockable perks for playing the game, which can potentially disadvantage newer players in the multiplayer environment. Firstly, a new player in multiplayer is far more at a disadvantage for lack of knowledge about the game mechanics than anything else. If a person plays a game without a strategy as to how they are going to win, they are very unlikely to do so. Secondly, the unlockable perks can be so minor in their impact, that they will not affect gameplay anywhere near as much as strategy or a good random draw.TLDR: Armello is an excellent cross between Monopoly and Heroes of Might and Magic. The games are relatively short. It's not pay to win like Hearthstone. A good strategy is the most likely way you will win a game.			"

												A very fun board game. The art is great, the characters are very well animated, and the weapons are very original.In short, take turns with the three other heros and pick 1 of the 4 different ways to win the game. The game play does not take that long. Normally by dawn 8 or 9 the game, (this being the longest). If you can kill the king sooner, then it will be even quicker. If you are going for a prestige victory then you are keeping the other heros away from the king. Which again, turn 8 or 9 depending on events. Time wise I'd say the game takes 40 - 60 minutes. Either way, time flies with this game. Really happy with this game! Up to this point I have played strictly solo, maybe I'll try the multiplayer in the future.			"

												Armello is a beutifull, well thought out game. It's a little like dungeons and dragon's, where the randomness factor comes into play during combat and cave exploration. Anyway, the world itself is gorgeous. at the start of the game you can go through a tutorial (which  highly recommend you do) and it will run you through the main characters, and their passive's and perks, e,g, river, from wolf clan, she carries a bow and arrow with her, if YOU attack anything, she will fire her bow and deal 1 damage before attacking, making her an excellent asassin. The end goal of the game depends on how you play, and play as/with. You can win either by, killing the king, and not duying during the combat, waiting for the king to die and (if you were well renound throughout the kingdom) take his place automatically, or you can bring 4 spirit stones to him, cleansing him of his corrupt ways. Thats just the main point's of the game.As soon as i understood how the game mechanics worked, i  was immedietly captured by it.Now this game is good, and kept me busy for a couple of rounds in a row, but after a while, you have to walk away, now thats not a bad thing, EVERY TIME, its a new quest,journey,story and experience, you can and probably will come back to it over and over again, the fact that you can come so close to winning and to lose it all in  an instant, is just great, for once it feels good to NEARLY win, still getting xp for that clan and for your self, it's just great.anyway,ill leave it here, yes without a doubt, recommend this game, no faults with it, it's in good committed hands ( i think) and i hope more branches of this game. love it.

												This is such a delightful game.It's like a board game with most of its mechanics, having multiple win conditions, random dice rolls and card draws.Each game takes only about an hour or so to play and there's a handful of unlockables to encourage playing multiple games against the AI.The art style is beautiful and I'd really like to see more games or stories within the realms of Armello.Definitely one to encourage my friends to get, if only to see how it plays with real people.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review-If you enjoy the concept of any of the Settlers of Catan games, and light RPG mechanics in any way, don't mind card games of any kind being used in a board game then Armerllo is a decent buy right now.The fact that later on we get 4 more hero's (doubling the number of current playable characters) just makes this more interesting, seeing as the other characters are more opposite of the 'Clan' they have currently. Looks good, runs well on my slightly older system, and is VERY immersive. My biggest gripe?I CANT BEAT THE KING VIA THE CORRUPTED VICTORY. It is a tad wonky there, but that is it.10/10, will regicide again in the future.			"

												Dude, I recommend Armello for so many reasons... -The OST dude, the OST is great! When the last turns are coming or some hero reach the castle, the music gets intense and you feel like agony for be the one to sit in that shiny throne!! The one who defeated the king!! -The art of the cards and the game, oh dude, they have passion and heart put in them... Really beautiful and greatly genius, the animations, the description, everything!...-The strategy is the key to succes, they are so many ways, ignore the people who get bored easyly, they don't know that you can change the rules and make everything more intense or easy... -I got an extreme wish to complete all the cards in the library and to have my dice collection... I love dices and it's the first time SOMETHING makes me buy and get desperate for a digital dice-You can make earthquakes!!  Also... not always you can play a boardgame with other people irl...I mean... This boardgame has an online feature! It helps so much when you're lonely... Still... I'm the only one in my friend list who plays this... ;-;  "

												RNG-EEZUS! I absolutely adore this game! I cannot wait to see what more is to come. Traps! Ambushes! MURDER! A race to become the RULER! A simple way to destroy friendships really...The dice based conflict resolution is similar to that of RISK, except that both parties get attack and defence dice, and either party can gain an edge by sacrificing cards add attack or defence dice. Iz nice.Some things that'd be cool to see in the future:A visual turn counter/orderIn-game character audio - more audio from the characters! The voices in my head aren't enough!Clan-bonuses?More MapsMod-support!Graphical setting customization (fullscreen windowed mode would be stupendous! also...less clouds?)The ability to rotate the mapAn optional or toggle-able mini-map. Maybe even just to be capable to zoom out more?8-player support! MADNESS!!10/10 would buy again. Very likely to buy copies come Christmas.			"

												I purchased this game along with the newly released DLC the day it came out together. It totalled around £18.99 (ish)So no, I have not owned the game for long. Despite this, my love for the game has made me create a group for it (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ArmelloArmada) and I have spent money on the market buying keys / chests. Pros- Multiple win conditions leading to various people taking various routes to win the game- Quest system which creates a story for your character as you progress through the game you are in- Varied clans with diversity in its classes- The game itself looks very good - Possibly my favourite factor is the cards. I am a huge fan of Hearthstone and every card in Armello has an animation which looks gorgeous. They are so good I had to make them as a seperate point from the game looking good- The game itself has good AI compared to other games - Games are just long enough- Easy to play, hard to master- Each tile has a name and the maps are not the same each game- After game loot which allow for more dice in gameCons- No in chat feature outside premade emotes making telling people what you plan on doing eg. in an alliance- Really nitpicking here but no form of campaign other than the prologueOverall 9.5/10Pretty much a must buy			"

Early Access Review
								Short yet fun Board Game for the computer.  That's currently the best way to describe this game right now.  I've played a few times, won a few games, lost a few (even against the a.i. which was a fun suprise, usually the a.i. in games arnt challenging enough).  However the game lacks the long term strategy aspect that most games like it thrive off of and prestige victory seems to be the most viable option for a game lasting only about 20 turns/10 days. the upside to this is it gives you a game where you can sit down and play a game in 40 minutes without worrying about saving.The game is ideal for playing with your friends and for those days where you need something to do for the next 30-45min.Is it worth the price?  So far for me...  $25/6.3hrs of play=$3.96/hr  for me that is worth it as I know that price will drop as I play more.Overall rating- 7.1/10  -  The game has alot to offer at an early stage.  But a game speed option should be added to fit the needs and wants of the average strategy gamer because lets face it, failing all of my quests at 40-60% is just pure bad luck and there's no way to bounce back from wasting 15 turns on failed quests in a 20 turn game.  But thats just how the dice roll sometimes.Yes for anything 7.0 and up thats what i always say.  What's the point if i only enjoyed %50 of the game			"

Games take not so much time (30-40 min) which is great. A lot of achievemnts to unlock so it is interesting to play again and again.3. Multiplayer. Mega interesting but takes up to 2 hours.4. DLC. Game itself is rather expensive so DLC looks even more expensive. Not sure if I will buy it.Anyway, the game is highly recommended to all board/card games fans.			"

Every game feels abundant for different possibilities, especially with a full compliment of human players, but lacks distinct map variety. Despite that particular limitation, the aesthetic is very evocative of Armello's interesting setting and theme, which the tutorial does a fantastic job of setting the scene for. The quality of experience is well worth the asking price.			"

The graphics are very nice, and the background music gives the game a special feeling. There's lots of cards and options to do while playing. You should though consider that you would need to play the game online with friends to take the fun to the next level. If you and your friends look for a fantasy turn based board game, then this is for you.This is not for people who are looking for a single player game. It has no campaign mode or story mode.			"

The single player ends up being a bit dull and not as lively as one would expect. The table-top, card game, dice game, board game is an excellent way a game like this can play.I'd give this an 8/10. While the game art and sound effects is fantastic, the best experience would be through Multiplayer. Also I would wish that the boards would be much larger than they are. Be able to add additional players. Ontop of that, for a game like this, there needs to be a Demo option to download to get the most of what kind of game this is like to the player. The Prologue, Thane's prologue at least, would be a welcoming Demo to be played. Learn how the game is played before being an ideal buy for someone's interest.			"

								Admittedly I have only played this for a few hours, though I feel that says more about the depth of the game at the moment. As of 0.3.8 ,  the game itself is artistically amazing. The animations are very well done and the gameplay is actually quite fun. I am quite surprised that a game that at max only gave me so few options offered me quite some amount of enjoyment. The cons being the game only has one mode at the moment with 4 classes: in other words not a lot to do after the first few plays.If I had to say if I recommend this game, you can try it but it doesn't feel like a $25 game. Not for two hours. I will say I will watch this game as it has the ability to become something great. Just.... wait for a sale.... unlike me. "

												Really fun game especially with friends.Each character is unique and fits a different play style.The game runs steady on just about anything and still manages to look good because of the art style.I've only experienced glitches in the multyplayer twice in my time playing and one of the times it fixed itself quickly.None of the DLC or purchaseable items are required to have fun, despite what some negetive reviews would have you believe.As for the reviews saying that the devs hav gotten greedy because they are releasing ""over priced"" skins as a way to make money and in turn make more content for the game....Really? have you see what a skin goes for in a game like League of Legends? the cheap ones are around $7 after you get enough cash shop currency and thats on the low end, they can cost like over $20 for the really fancy ones.Why is this any different?Overall a great game though this is quite a bit of anger in the community for the new faction that's getting close to a year overdue.

												The artwork is beautiful, the gameplay is easy to learn (but not easy to master by any stretch of the imagination) and the dice mechanic is more fun than just rolling regular numbers.4 different ways to win: Collect 4 Spirit Stones, kill the King, kill the king while your Rot is higher than his, or have the highest prestige.8 characters: Two rats (a manipulator and an assassin), two rabbits (a tinker and explorer), two bears (a warrior and a druid) and two wolves (one melee, one ranged) with multiple playstyles depending on which amulets you pick at the start of the game.The only downside is no chat function other than the preprogrammed phrases. Not going to be either, according to the devs (they don't want to have to moderate, etc). It's also a -little- slow paced, but that's good if you like a relaxing strategy game for a couple of hours a game.			"

												This is a very polished indie game that has a lot of potential to go further. It plays very much like a board game. The game, to me, draws much inspiriation from the board game Small World with different victory conditions almost like a Civ game. There is a lot of charming character to the presentation of the game, the music and art direction are fantastic and the game mechanics are fun and polished. The balancing is pretty solid too, the only real criticism is that the game can tend to favour a Prestiege victory over many other types and defending is much harder than attacking.			"

Should be able to pay to get rid of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Some spells are not very useful ... some items a bit too strong. Gotta go for physical and combat heroes as the game is not perfectly balanced yet.Even with those flaws that can make games boring, its a must have.

												This game is quite the challenge as every game is faced with obstacles old and new. Every player has a different playstyle and with a fairly large roster of characters youre never deprived of a great experience. The beautifully designed graphics mixed with the solid rpg elements make the fight for the throne pretty awesome. If youve got an hour or two to clash with friends or random players and you enjoy a game that challenges your every decision, this is the game for you. :)			"

												Excellent board/strategy game set on a deeply involving fantasy setting. This ain't your grandma's fairyland. While not as dark as an original Grimm, it's also definitely not olden Disney fare. If anything, the universe is a western take on the Miyasaki universe... But i digress; what truly matters here is that every detail was clearly painstakingly crafted to be as fresh and fun on your 50th game as it was on your first. The learning curve isn't too bad, and the tutorial competent. And every charscter that you play as, or every new card you discover offer a new flavor to the formula... Beautiful animation, 2D and 3D alike are complemented by a top notch score. Superbly realized, and lots of hours of fun.			"

												Not only do I highly recommend this game to those who love tabletop board games, I recommend it to RPG lovers as well.  Not because it's an RPG but because the feel of the world will be familiar and fun to them.  Furthermore the community isabsolutely fantastic.  Bless everyone one of those early flag wavers who got my attention to this game. I missed out on some of the early stuff but they kept my eye on this thing and since I've played it...I love it. Bless you, you magnificient ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. This game is no cakewalk but always fulfilling. Clever ploys, careful strategy, and sheer stubborness collide every game.  Great with friends, especially when the betrayals start. Behind Armello's almost Disney-esque asthetic is the beating heart of a powerful fantasy world. The art, music, every detail is there to make for a great experince. So the real question isn't if it's a good game, it's why you aren't playing already?			"

												I've played 5 or 6 games and have won against the AI twice, each in a different way.  To me, a casual gamer, that's a decent but not imposing learning curve and yields a nice reward.  Also, I like the variety of the 8 (at this time) characters, so I can test my skills with different strategies.  A game on a reasonably swift computer takes about an hour, which is awesome for someone who can't spend all night gaming.  My first game or two were on my laptop, which had either not enough RAM or a poor video card (likely both) and a game took me 3 hours and I couldn't burn cards in battles, since the computer lagged.  So, play on a decent PC! Really enjoying the game and if I want something more challenging, I know multiplayer is lurking, waiting with practiced players and longer game time.			"

												What a gem!With a fantastic art style and gorgeous visuals, Armello is a simple to learn, tricky to master and consistently challenging.With a number of different routes to victory, this is a game that rewards agile tactics that can respond to ever changing conditions. Indeed, succesful players are going to be those who are able to think on their feet rather than those attempting to execute a long term strategy.The map is small, yet difficult to cross, with numerous obstacles and choke points barring the way. Players can win this game ""on the board"" by holding strategic positions, through playing cards that provide various spells, buff/debuffs, by setting traps to disrupt other players, or by defeating the corrupt King of Armello. Players can achieve political victory by accumulating prestige, military victory by defeating the king, magical victory by destroying the rot infesting the land and inflicting the king, or by becoming rotten themselves. A number of resources and skills are available to the player including gold, wit, magic, prestige and rot, and all provide advantages or can be spent in battle or in general play.Combat is conducted via die roll where players attempt to gain an advantage by equiping various items, and by becoming more experienced and applying various spell to themselves and their enemies. Terrain and the use thereof can also provide significant in combat, be it through stealth or defensive bonuses for fortifying oneself in mountains or settlements.Games take about an hour to complete, and each will provide a new challenge. This is a genuinely innovative game that all lovers of board games should support. Definitely worth a purchase at full price, and a no brainer while on sale.			"

												An amazing blend of tabletop dice rolling with real-time strategy from a top-down view, Armello represents a culmination of unique replayability with difficult-to-earn achievements and great community involvement from the developers.  Rolling is very chance-related, but can be swayed in favor by burning cards for specifically desired icons and equipping items or casting spells.  Play from eight characters and four clans, each one with unique rings and amulet combinations to power up your characters.Easily one of my favorite games.			"

												Armello's is a digital board game whose theme is a cocktail of DarkSouls and Game of Thrones, all of it presented with a gorgeous artstyle. Although not especially deep at the moment, it's fun and hasgreat potential for future patches.---Pros: * Art - The art style in this game is absolutely beautiful. The cardsare lovely with their subtle animations and the 2D character art lendsthe heroes a lot of personality. Sound effects and music areappropriate and lovely. I'm looking forward to the DLC at least asmuch for new art and cinematics as I am for new mechanical content. * Fun and Balance - Hard to quantify rigorously, but the game feelsfun - it rewards being thoughtful without demanding that every actionis supremely calculated. Characters feel pretty well balanced giventhe recent release, although not perfectly so. Mechanics likecorruption and the special abilities of followers mean that a singlecard can be applied in different, interesting ways.Cons: * Arbitrary - Serious board game fans should realize that Armello hasa fair amount of luck involved: Drawing the right cards is importantand the outcome of almost all conflicts is dice based (although youmay burn cards to reduce the factor of luck here). However the realelement of luck is in the placement of random events, quests, andperils around the map. You may lose a game due to an unluckypositioning of an early quest or win one because of a timely spiritstone spawn. To win, the rewards from the 'risky' option of quests arevery important, but you'll often have about a 40%-60% chance to failthese, taking an expensive penalty instead. This is particularlynoticeable when two players are both close to victory and thedetermination may hinge on one being a single turn ahead or having alucky/unlucky teleport. It's all fine for a video game, but playersexpecting a more rigorous experience like mageknight or agricola maybe frustrated. * UX Issues - The game permits you to play effects during anopponent's turn, but doesn't offer a good way to pause or an interruptsystem like Magic's. The result is an imperfect blend of real-time andturn-based feels that is jarring at times.  I also experienced are someminor issues in the game such as UI elements disappearing or the soundfailing during certain effects. None of it threatened stability, however.---As for a sense of how the game plays, you spend your turns travelling around the map, preparing yourself through items and quest rewards to face the King, while trying to prevent the other players from doing the same. Usually there are several objectives you could pursue at once (is it worth taking an extra turn to reach my quest if I explore a dungeon first? What about one less turn if I take damage by going through a swamp?) to keep the mind sufficiently tickled. The game has a stronger emphasis on inter-player conflict than board games like Dominion so many of these decisions may involve whether to spend resources pulling yourself up or pushing someone else down.Time factors into all of this. There are a very limited number of turns before the King dies. This introduces conflict between the players pursuing different victory conditions: As the King grows physically weaker over time, a player planning the regicide victory may wish to wait till late to face an easier battle. But if they wait too long and the King dies 'naturally' from his advancing corruption, the current prestige leader will win a diplomatic victory as heir.Overall if you want a beautiful, clever game and don't mind a bit of bad luck, you'll probably like Armello. If nothing else, your eyes will thank you.			"

												Beautiful and engaging pc boardgame experience. Best played with friends (since the AI lacks that edge and ability to cooperate which makes the game that much more entertaining). Armello was originally prototyped as a physical game, and that feel carries through into the digital version, from the dice physics to the card decks, without requiring the mental chore to keep track of all the math / board counters / other variables that would bog things down in real life.Each space on the board has different terrain and variables -- towns give gold when claimed, forests give stealth in the cover of night, druid circles heal anyone who enters, and dungeons have the option of offering treasures or waking monsters. Players are given quests to travel across the kingdom and commit deeds of heroism that strengthen them for their eventual confrontation with the mad king at the center of the board. Equipment cards affect the number and types of dice you have to roll when facing tests and combats, and there are various spells, items, and traps that can be played to  terrain and/or players that can help or hinder them. Combat and perils are challenged with dice rolls -- you gain dice by equipping items and using spells to tip the odds in your favor.There are currently 8 different characters (with more planned), each with different skills to complement different playstyles, from magic-using tank to sneaky hit-and-run thief, to item-hoarding situational card-swapper. The flow of each game requires players to be able to adjust their strategies for victory or be left at the mercy of more ambitious opponents. Either challenge the king directly or work to sabotage the plans of others and grab a win through trickery and amassing personal prestige. Literally stack your dice with clever use of your cards and abilities, and make a grab for Armello's throne before someone else does.If you are a fan of tabletop and card games, then Armello is definitely worth a try. :)Cons: No auto-reconnect if a player acidentally disconnects, no ingame chat (voicechat improves the boardgame experience feel, imo)			"

												Having followed Armello from the Kickstarter campaign, I can say wholeheartedly that the final product is something that the crew at League of Geeks should be incredibly proud of. Armello is a unique and fantastically executed blend of RPG, tabletop game, card game, and turn-based-strategy. The world and characters are brought to life by the sublime art and sound team, and Armello is brimming with character. Gameplay is easy to pick up, but has enough nuances and options to keep players hooked and learning more and more each match. Matches tend to take an hour to complete roughly, but in Single Player the autosave function guarantees you can drop out and back into the action at any time. If you're even remotely curious or interested in this game, I'd certainly recommend you purchase it!			"

												Wonderful, beautiful game. The sound qualities are superb. One thing that should be said. This is a type of game you would want to play with friends and other people. The single player ends up being a bit dull and not as lively as one would expect. The table-top, card game, dice game, board game is an excellent way a game like this can play.I'd give this an 8/10. While the game art and sound effects is fantastic, the best experience would be through Multiplayer. Also I would wish that the boards would be much larger than they are. Be able to add additional players. Ontop of that, for a game like this, there needs to be a Demo option to download to get the most of what kind of game this is like to the player. The Prologue, Thane's prologue at least, would be a welcoming Demo to be played. Learn how the game is played before being an ideal buy for someone's interest.			"

												My first STEAM Review is on this game because it it WORTH it! The game has beautiful visuals and is a fun digital board game. There are four win scenarios with 8 characters and 4 clans. Each character has unlockable upgrades and special abilities unique to them and their clan. Most critique comes from the chance based system and ""randomness"" nature of the game, but it is a board game. Most board games have that random factor (especially dice games), but Armello has strategy behind it. It is also a hell lot of fun (especially with friends) and has online! I definitely recommend the game and if you still feel on the fence about it, wait for it to go on sale! You'll have fun!!!			"

								+Very nice looking gameFun, unique charactersCombat is really well done using diceCards are fun to use with well designed art-4 ways to win, more like 1 way to win (via most prestige)Game are deceptively short, maximum of 50 minutes each (more if online)From what ive played, you have a big advantage if you favour combatOverall the negatives are me attempting to find flaws with the game, which doesn't really make the game much worse. Definitely worth playing!			"

												Simply put, this game is the best ""digital board game"" I've had the pleasure of playing so far. Game mechanics are at a very satisfying level of complexity. The story, characters and visual representation of the game elements are all very appealing and overall the game seems masterfully executed. This is basically a must have title in my opinion.			"

												A very fun board game. The art is great, the characters are very well animated, and the weapons are very original.In short, take turns with the three other heros and pick 1 of the 4 different ways to win the game. The game play does not take that long. Normally by dawn 8 or 9 the game, (this being the longest). If you can kill the king sooner, then it will be even quicker. If you are going for a prestige victory then you are keeping the other heros away from the king. Which again, turn 8 or 9 depending on events. Time wise I'd say the game takes 40 - 60 minutes. Either way, time flies with this game. Really happy with this game! Up to this point I have played strictly solo, maybe I'll try the multiplayer in the future.			"

Armello is like that place you've always wanted to visit, because you somehow know that once you're finally there it will feel like home - it will fill a medieval bear sized void in your heart.Before I bought this game I was sceptical for various reasons. I've read most of the reviews on Steam and elsewhere, but  even though it's praised for the incredible visuals (obviously), little is said about the actual gameplay - specifically after the early access release. Also, some of the reviews make it seem like the gameplay is only enjoyable when playing multiplayer.Having now spent the best part of a Sunday playing single player mode I really feel happy about the game. The single player experience is great.The only real story time in the game is a brief tutorial (acting as a prologue) that introduces you to the 4 main characters and the surprisingly easy gameplay mechanics. You *will* find yourself wishing for more, and that's okay, but this is where Armello stays true to being a digital boardgame - you have to make your own story. Brutal deathThe first time a little critter died I was pretty shocked, but then it respawned and all was well with the world. Needless to say you get used to dying... a lot.Again, this game is bloody gorgeousApart from the awesome cut scenes (that's no doubt the thing that caught your attention in the first place), there are over 100 collectable item | spell | trickery cards that are beautifully animated. As you play the game over and over again you discover more and more cards and it becomes quite a challenge to find new ones.LoreThis is a world akin to Brian Jacques' Redwall. It has also been compared to Game of Thrones for some reason... it's probably all the dying and the creepy king. But really this is something quite unique. The collectible cards mentioned before really help to flesh out the world of Armello.According to the developer forum they are planning and actively working on content for the game, like a Bandit Clan DLC that will introduce a new clan of 4 heroes and more story missions - Scheduled to release Q2 2017.http://leagueofgeeks.com/forums/index.php?topic=3037.msg20613#msg20613ConclusionBuy the game. Be patient. Enjoy the small things.This is the beginning of an epic story, one that would be better left to unravel at it's own pace.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated Aug. 7th, 2015 Review Additions:Over the past few months, I can honestly say this game has made leaps and bounds from where I hopped on. The community continues to grow, the game continues to get better, and I can only imagine what amazing things are in store from its actual release and onward.LoG and the rest of the Armello community are some of the best people I've gotten to know, and every dime spent on this project was well used. I can say with a surety that this game is well worth your money, and that this game is ten-times as good as it was in its Early EA.If you're still unsure about whether or not this game will interest you, I suggest keeping an eye on LoG's twitch channel, and watching the weekly community vs devs games (they're a hoot!).~~~Edited Original Review:So, even after my first match with AI, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. The TLC that LoG constantly states they've given this game is quite evident, even from the main menu and first few turns. Literally everything in this game works together to create quite a triumphant and easily enjoyed experience that does not disappoint. The art work, fabulous. The music, fantastic. The gameplay, classic, yet new.Performance:I have helped LoG (and continue to help them) squash as many bugs as possible, and I can honestly say that they are rather fast and efficient at getting rid of game bugs. Thankfully this game runs rather well on my lower-mid level laptop. Not to mention that it has a rather low space footprint for a game of this kind.Aesthetics:This game is very pleasing to look at and to listen to. If you don't believe me, you obviously haven't watched the trailers. The trailers alone send shivers down the spine, and leave a considerable amount of chilling goosebumps upon one's person. I sincerely hope that the OST will at some point be available, because it would be an easy buy, even if you don't play the game, for the music, too, plays an integral part in sweeping you away to the magical land that is Armello.Gameplay:Armello is designed to play a lot like a table-top RPG/Card/Board game. Each of the 4 base characters have initial stats and a unique ability, and receive bonuses based on a ring and amulet of the player's choosing. The characters play a large part in how the outcome of the game can be achieved by catering to different playstyles, making the character choice a rather important one - though, not necessarily game-defining. While one can achieve different types of victories with the same character, some conditions are easier met by certain characters.Each turn can easily be a game changer, as players are constantly in a close struggle to gain prestige, gold, magic, or treasure all necessary things to taking the throne, the ultimate objective of the match. There is seldom a point in the game where one can relax, because someone else is almost always on your heels in terms of strength, or physical/magical gains.Experience:This game is rather easy to jump into and enjoy, however, it is highly recommended to look into the game guide here on Steam. Even with its current, early mechanics, this game is easily replayable. Each match and turn is able to bring quite a different experience, and only gets better in a game against other humans. The characters and other pre-match choices can make a large difference based on who's playing who, so the strategizing happens from the get-go.I chose to buy in because this game interested me, and I know that being an Indie Dev is far from easy, and every dollar counts. However, I do again, sincerely hope that this first project doesn't leave a bad taste in the gaming community's mouth because of a mistake made in their infancy (the KickStarter incident, which as since been cleared up!).Pseudo TL;DR -This game is a rather specific purchase...If this is a game you're looking for, I can personally recommend it.For those of you sitting on the fence: Trust me, this game is well worth it, and the community is truthfully one of a kind.

												Really amazing and fun game! Im huge fan of board games and this is totally my kind of game! I actually wish this game had board game version, it would be so good to play with friends away from pc. The story is not too deep, and it can get a bit repetetive after some time... but if you dont mind it and you love challenges, then its great. Multiplayer give it totally new fresh feeling and its great while playing with friends! <3 For me it was worth it!			"

												Edit: If you want to see the game in action, I strongly suggest you check out the League of Geeks Twitch channel[www.twitch.tv] Sundays at 6:00pm Pacific time for their weekly Devs vs. Community game. It's a good time and a great place to ask any questions you might have and actually get them answered.Since I bought it back in November, Armello has become one of my all-time favorite multiplayer games (still narrowly beat out by Timesplitters, but what can you do?).Each match is a 4-player free-for-all power grab to rule the land. There are multiple ways to accomplish this: Combat: Break into the Palace and kill the King in single combat.Prestige: Having the most renown when the King dies naturally (he loses 1 health every other turn) or if another players kills him, but dies themselves in the attampt.Spirit Stones Collecting 4 spirit stones that may be found in dungeons, rewarded from quests, or randomly spawned on the map then breaking into the Palace and use them to banish the corruption from the king (which, conveniently, also kills him).Rot: The corrupting force in the game that has infected the king and spurred the heroes into action against him. Though it very difficult to pull off, a player can achieve a higher Rot value than the King and then Break into the Palace and kill the King in combat. This is very similar to a Combat Victory, but when 2 opponents both have Rot, the one with the higher count gains the lower's count as bonus dice. Against the King (who is for the most part a stronger combatant than any of the heroes), this is both a great advantage and hinderance (You roll more dice but for every die you roll that doesn't get matched to attack or defence goes to the King to roll against you). Basically, pulling off a Rot Victory is mostly for bragging rights.My favorite part of this game has to be that, even if the whole game is going against you, the other players attack you, banes attack you, your card draw is terrible, etc. etc. etc, it is still possible to sometimes go for the last-ditch-effort break into the palace and attack the king. At worst, you'll die killing him and give the game to the Prestige leader (or just die, granting the king 1 more health and extending the game for 2 more turns), but there's always the chance that you can kill him and win, turning around a game that had been going against you the whole time, and snatching victory for yourself. These are the wins that are always the most memorable because steamrolling your opponents is only fun so many times. The best victories are a struggle.After every (online/non-private) match, you are given a chance at either a key or chest that, once you have one of both, you can use to unlock new dice skins. Winning has no apparent effect on the drop rates, though keys do seems to be somewhat less common than chests (despite which one you get being represented by a coin flip). The keys, chests, and skins can all be traded/sold on the Steam marketplace.The biggest (non bug related) complaint I have is that, since the map is randomized for every match, sometimes you just get completely screwed on the placements of settlements, dungeons, mountains and swamps (either for too much or not enough of any of them near your spawn grounds).The biggest bug related problem is that sometimes, when a player disconnects, the whole match will feeze and everyone will be forced to quit out, negating the end-of-the-match reward. This seems to be more likely if it happens while someone is in combat, and is definitely the biggest bug/glitch problem the game has.One other point of irritation is, since you can sell the rewards from the end of a match, I occassionally run into bots/scummers that pass every turn (some contend that it is almost literally every match, but I think they're just especially bitter people in general). The especially awful ones spam the emotes constantly. Having one less player usually makes the game significantly less interesting and fun. Furtunately, you can report these wastes of air through the in-game bug report feature.At first it might seem like everything's random so you're success or failure is based solely on RNG, but as a long time player of XCOM (new and original), your success or failure is based more on how you operate with the options you're given, rather than the options themselves.TL;DR: If you think games that rely on RNG don't take any skill, go ahead and skip this one. You'll only wind up bitter.			"

												I love Armello, I really do love it, both the gameplay and mechanics it has to offer and the characters's designs with their unique abilities. The skins are a good implementation (though I haven't gotten any of the character things, and I'll explain why later) and the random events that form part of your adventure's development are one of the things I love the most from this game.I like that you can wear different types of rings and amulets at the start to have a bit of your own customization, and that you can act with 3 types of decks, get followers that aid you, etc.The music is nothing too original or anything like that, but it's not annoying and it fits well regardless.I like that you can have multiple ways of winning a match, some more risky than others, but all of them are interesting to try if you like finding your own way to victory through different paths.I can say that this game is worth buying and playing, if a friend is recommending this to you so you can play with him/her, do it. Hell, if you have more than 3 or 4 friends who have this game and who would like to play it with you, then buy it. This game is great when it comes to multiplayers.Now, since this is a game meant for multiplayer, here are some flaws that you HAVE to consider if you really want this game:-First, sometimes people will ragequit and MAY make you or another player be stuck where they are, forcing all of you to leave the game, this can anger some people but it's not something that will happen 100% of the times, since when someone disconects, they are replaced by an AI. (I personally haven't found this too bad of a flaw and it just happens like 5% of all the matches I've had)-The game rewards you for playing online, giving you keys or chests at the end of a match, this is a great concept that unfortunately is affected by the first flaw, so I wanted to mention that this bug will mean that the match will be stuck and that no one will earn the rewards that you use to get skins, this can be bad but as I said before, don't think it's something that is going to happen that often.Now... this is my biggesst complain, I was really thinking on relunctanctly not recommending this game, that's how bad it is but it's not really the game's fault:-This game has a growing community, meaning that most of the time there's going to be around 190 people playing and you will most likely not find anyone joining, like I do. I really want to play this game, but during this month all the times I've tried playing online have resulted in me not finding absolutely anybody. Maybe this game has region blocking or something and that's why it's harder for me to find people (that's my guess at least), but I really CAN'T FIND ANYBODY ONLINE, meaning that I can't play the most enjoyable thing about this game anymore cuz I can't find people online that easily.I used to just click to play online and I wouldn't wait too much before entering a match, now it looks 97% impossible to find someone, in fact, after looking for people for the 9th time I've opened this game, NOW I just found someone online, JUST ONE person... they left 10 seconds later... ♥♥♥♥ you if you are that person, by the way.I do recommend this game cuz it's fun to play with friends, wich is why I said before that if you got people who play it or who would like to play it with you, thn it's worth buying, the more people you got that play armello the better the possibilities you'll enjoy this game, but if you have no friends who play this game then MAYBE you'll have a harder time getting to find people online.However, if you get this game, you do help the community to keep growing and in time it'll be easier to find people online to play with, THAT was the only reason I changed my mind from not recommending to recommending this game.So yeah, with nothing else to say, buy it so this game keeps growing and specially if you got friends who have this, it's a great game but the lack of people keeps it from being one of my favourite games.

												A turn-based digital board game set in a disney's Robin Hood like world where anphropomorphic animals rule the land. Whether playing single player or multiplayer; the game consists of 4 heroes vying for the future of the throne. The game is easy to learn but difficult to master. The board is randomly generated (except starting points and the palace) with each terrain having a different effect on the game and your hero. Settlements generate gold, mountains require double the movement, swamps cost health to traverse, forests provide stealth at night, stone circles heal the uncorrupted and dungeons can help or hinder you. Time is limited by the king's decaying health and turns alternate between dawn and dusk each providing different benefits.Not finished, work in progress.			"

												This is a pretty fun game. The problems that have stopped me from playing are the lobby times to play with other people, and the way to rot victory is painfully difficult. In order to get corrupted you more or less have to hope you die to banes to increase your rot because getting cards that give you rot are few and very far between. I think they need to add more rot cards into the decks. 9 times out of 10 the win condition is either kingslayer or prestige and it takes away from the game when there is so little chance for other paths to be taken. This includes spirit stone victories as well, but I can understand how that condition is a little more random.			"

												For all of it's flaws, Armello is a game that overflows with character. The animations of the various cards make every card feel unique and adds to the flair of playing the cards. The designs of the characters all look great, and the colorful atmosphere and antropomorphic chracters initally make this seem like a high fantasy setting. However, the cards, quest descriptions, and general point of the game all hammer home that for all the color and style, this is basiclly Game of Thrones meets Redwall, minus the sex and with lots more evil. You can even give into the dark side, known as the Rot, and win by killing the King while being even more evil then said insane king.9/10, would become a dark lord bear again			"

												Fantastic gem of a game. The board/card/dice gameplay is extremely solid and I find it personally addictive. The replay value is very, very high. The art and music and animation are utterly top notch. They suck you into this beautiful fairy tale world that's both dark and bright.But the best part are definitely the characters. Each one has unique stats and abilities and there are 8 of them with more planned. They are lovingly breathed to life and add a richness to the world that the developers have crafted.Highly recommended.			"

												This is a pretty fun game. The problems that have stopped me from playing are the lobby times to play with other people, and the way to rot victory is painfully difficult. In order to get corrupted you more or less have to hope you die to banes to increase your rot because getting cards that give you rot are few and very far between. I think they need to add more rot cards into the decks. 9 times out of 10 the win condition is either kingslayer or prestige and it takes away from the game when there is so little chance for other paths to be taken. This includes spirit stone victories as well, but I can understand how that condition is a little more random.			"

												I thoroughly enjoy this game.  There is plenty of strategic decisions that you have to make over the course of a game.  There is a fair amount of randomness and luck that comes into play, but I haven't played many board games that do not have those elements present.If you don't want to pay 7 bucks for skins guess what?

Definately worth it if you have some friends to play with.My only complaint is that the AI seems to suicide into the late game and try for an impossible win 9 times out of ten, resulting in your victory. Great for wins, but cheap and doesnt feel earned.			"

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW: In an attempt to summarize, I will try to keep this short. I've put about 4 hours into the game thus far into this early access title and overall, I've enjoyed it. The game has a great card game/board game hybrid feel to it and there are some distinct ""Game of Thrones"" vibes to the game that I really enjoy. That being said, I do feel after a few hours that the game is slightly repetitive at this early access stage and sometimes I find the AI to just generally not be the brightest. Do not misundertstand, this game feels very polished- particularly for a title in ""Early Access"", but it does not yet feel complete at this stage. I think there is a really great game buried here, but I don't believe it's reached that point yet. I hope League of Geeks will continue to flesh out the game and push this game farther along. They could have a really great game on their hands with some additional content and mechanic tweaking. IN SUMMARY: Despite some flaws and repetition, I would still recommend this game as a ""Buy"" as I'm confident the final product will be very solid and you can definitely have some fun with the game ""as-is"". I will follow-up on this review as the game continues to develop.			"

												Just played a few games and I love it to bits. Yes there's a few niggles graphically (The -massive- DoF effect when zooming out is somewhat irksome, and sometimes clouds literally block my vision when zoomed in) but besides that, the presentation is great, the art style inspiring, and to be frank it reminds me a lot of Redwall. Which is a good thing.It's basically Talisman, except your movement isn't restricted by dice and the world is drop dead beautiful, and there's more than one way to win. The overall 'rules' are relatively simple and easy to grasp, but there's enough tactical depth to keep things interesting.			"

												Being an avid board game and video game player I was excited to try out Armello. The first thing you will discover when playing the game is that the designers put a lot of work into creating the game. The artwork is fantastic and the game does a great job building an interesting environment. While Armello does take some time to adjust to, the gameplay is quite interesting and provides for plenty of opportunities for strategy. With four different paths to victory no two games will ever be the same. Armello does a great job combining elements of RPGs, card games, and other tabletop mechanics. While my playtime is currently kind of low, Armello is not the type of game where I would play multiple games in a row but it is the type of game that I plan on playing every so often. If the concept behind the game interests you and you like board games in addition to video games, I think you will really enjoy Armello.Note: I received a free review copy of Armello. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review and receiving the review copy had no impact on the content of this review. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] "

												Quite good and quite fun, once you get the hang of it after a game or two is once it stops being so frustrating and you actually know what you're doing, though even after that if the RNG feels like cursing you and everything's going sideways for you there's not much fun to be had for you that round unless you just deliberately troll other players by getting in their way... kinda like real politics, in a sense.Oh, and it's much better with actual people. The AI operates on a unique logic that I have yet to pinpoint, but seems to generally trend towards running around in circles, falling in traps that they themselves placed, or when you're clearly about to win and they totally have a chance to stop you, they instead attack the guy in last place who's off picking berries in a nearby forest or something... I KNOW he's a wolf and that rabbit over there looks tasty, but I'm about to banish Simba to another dimension with my 4 magic rocks and win the game... notice me, senpai!EDIT- Also as a rabbit I killed a bloodhound, a bear and a wolf in one turn and then Simba the very next turn, all without taking any damage.

“There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a sword or spear and send him forth to war, the beast stirs.” ― George R.R. Martin, A Storm of Swords This beautifully created world of beasts and other furry creatures has stollen my heart. It’s a well thought out casual, yet challenging game of strategy, luck and gentle humor. That is, when you enter the game with an understanding of what you’re about to embark on in this quest of art and mind. When stresses of life and the insanity of other games I enjoy tend to wear me thin, this is the game I always run back to with my arms wide open. The visuals are soothing. The gameplay is perfect for someone that just wants to relax after a long stressful day of getting scolded from their bosses or hearing the screaming of impatient children. Grab a glass of your beverage of choice, make those nachos you have been craving all week and sit down and enjoy the bliss and relaxation as you laugh along with others when you are riddled with bad luck or good fortune. The series of set phrases that you will have in this game, used to communicate with others in multiplayer, bring a special roleplaying aspect that makes it very hard to get angry. (That is, unless you’re just angry by trait) Having a sense of humor will take you a long way; here in this game and in life. I encourage everyone to pick this game up for themselves, friends or their kids (Great for all ages because the chat between everyone is talentedly limited) and have a great adventure of mind and visuals. Armello is one of the best relaxed yet, challenging turn-based strategy board like games I’ve come across. And, oh! I am so glad I did.			"

												Fun game, but was completely unaware there was no singleplayer campaign to speak of. Read they have no plans on implementing one, that's a bummer.The art is very impressive with a unique style, it's something I'd expect from a blockbuster game. The 2D and 3D art meshes very well and the animations(both 2D and 3D, again) are top notch. Props to whoever the artists are!The gameplay itself is interesting, but I haven't played enough to really comment on it as I'm still learning it.Overall, I'd recommend it if you're aware that it's not really meant to be a singleplayer game. I don't regret buying it despite not researching it first, I'll probably play it with friends from time to time.Also, it works flawlessly on Linux which is always a plus for me.			"

												My first complaint would be the lack of communication that the game lets you have with your fellow players. You have a small set of pre-written messages that you can say, but that's it. For a strategy game, that makes it very limited.My next complaint would be the lack of replayability the game offers. There is only one map size and shape, and the only thing that changes are the different biomes/tiles, which there aren't very many of the start with. Once you play 10-15 games in it, it'll get old, and you will see every move your opponents make coming. It gets rather boring after awhile.Another thing that gets a bit old is the unbalanced nature of many items and clans/characters. There are a few very powerful characters that everybody rushes to at the start of the game, and the player(s) that get it(them) have a large advantage. In addition, if you get unlucky and roll a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥items/spells, you can kiss that victory goodbye. Or the other way around, if you get some top-grade gear, the game is pretty much over, unless someone else can manage to get it aswell. Which is very unlikely to begin with.Last but surely not least, the small size of the map and pure chance of most events happening can lead to players getting ahold of very powerful equipment that makes them unbeatable to the other players. This in itself is not bad, but since the players in this game seem keen on holding grudges for the smallest of things, ""Capture The Throne"" can turn into ""Free For All Deathmatch"" very quickly, the objective of the game lost. And as mentioned before, since the map is quite small, a stronger player could simply spawnkill another player they happen to not like. Refer back to the previous point about unbalanced items and characters.The game was fun for a little bit. I really tried to like it, I did, but I can't.EDIT: Upon the continued playing of the game, I've found that this experience wasn't just a fluke. Quite a few times now, especially at the beginning of battles in multiplayer, the game just stops working. You have no choice but to sit there for hours and wait for the game to do nothing, or to leave, which you are punished for. I have high speed internet and this never happens with any of my other games, so it is not on my side.			"

Early Access Review
								Originally posted at: http://caffeinecrew.com/2015/06/10/loading-not-yet-ready-armello/The King of the land lets out a mighty roar and decrees that this morning all of the land’s Heroes must pay taxes worth of 2 gold. I cringe and hand over my money—I braved the depths of the local dungeon and potential face-off with a Bane to obtain it. There are but a few days left of the King’s life, and I’m incredibly close to obtaining the means to cure him and save the land from devastation. I am now forced to decide between trying to cure him (which may be impossible in the allotted remaining time), or attempt another approach.This is but one playthrough of League Of Geeks’s first title, Armello—a high fantasy digital board game. Currently in Early Access, Armello sports a unique design centered around 4 players (Human or AI controlled) attempting to either overturn the beleaguered King, or to save him against a mysterious plague known as The Rot. Armello also maintains a somewhat procedural design, in which map tiles are randomly placed each game in order to create unique playthroughs each time. It’s with this design in mind that it makes sense the Armello game board is so small, but at the same time it often feels a bit too cramped.Armello’s 54 tiled design makes for fast paced sessions, coupled with the ability to move up to 3 spaces per turn (or 2 if you intend to cross a mountain), accessing a lot of the board’s missions and special objectives seems quite easy. Or so I initially thought. Attempting any of Armello’s 3 possible game endings means staying heavily focused on a series of gameplay elements at all times and more often than not (unless you get insanely lucky), you will find yourself abandoning your current ending goal for the most common: Prestige (more on that later). But at the same time you will likely be bumping into one of the other 3 Heroes, the King’s Guard, or the terrifying Banes. Sometimes this can get in the way of gameplay and feels somewhat oppressive, albeit understandable.Personally I would love to see larger board sizes incorporated into later builds of Armello so I can further customize the experience for longer and more in-depth sessions. This, however, leads into Armello’s fairly short session time thanks to each playthrough lasting a maximum of 18 rounds (9 Day/9Night turns). Not having an option for more turns really puts the squeeze on the game’s potential win outcomes. Rounds are managed by the King’s health, which drops by 1 after every Night turn passes (1 day/1 night). Day turns are the safer of the two as Banes deal far less damage and appear less frequently, while night-time makes them stronger, and occasionally spawn from dungeons. Some Heroes, such as Thane, gain benefits at night like an extra attack die.Armello uses Gold and Magic Points as currency for using their myriad card selection ranging from equippable combat effects, to direct player sabotage. You can also take your cards and burn them during dice rolls to guarantee specific dice outcomes; this removes a number of dice equal to the number of cards burned, but can potentially guarantee winning or overcoming a trap.Armello’s other form of “currency” is Prestige, a form of positive notoriety that is earned from killing Banes, other Heroes, finishing Quests, or from cards. The player with the most Prestige gets to pick the King’s daily decree each Day Turn, and will win should the King die (end of turn 18) via a Prestige Win. This type of win is the most common from the games I played, and is the easiest to obtain. After 3 times of getting a Prestige win I found the mechanic a bit unbalanced and boring. The other possible ways to win are: Killing the King and surviving, and curing the King via Spirit Stones. Both options require intense player building with the latter needing a focus on good timing and Quest management.All of this in mind, Armello sports some of the most amazing art and music I’ve seen in an Early Access product. The character models, the animations, and even the cards themselves are all beautifully crafted to bring the game to life. It has this undeniable charm that pervades every aspect of the game, from the Heroes both majestic and shifty, to the Banes—unearthly Rot creatures—who maintain an air of danger and threat. There are a few minor hitches such as the King’s Declaration graphic staying on-screen for far too long and obstructing any action taking place during that event. The music as well is moody and ethereal, creating a mystical atmosphere throughout each playthrough. However, when browsing cards on the Main Menu there are no sound effects when clicking on cards.It’s still very soon in Early Access, but Armello is definitely one of the more tightly designed digital board games I’ve played as of late, and its future developments could prove quite interesting. I suggest keeping your eye on it if you’re on the fence. If you really enjoy digital board games, though, grab this and run with it along the development process.			"

								(Here is a video you can watch for the ones who see this and think TLDR {LINK REMOVED}http://goo.gl/jWz3j8)           This game is one of the best games i've come across in a long time (If you like things in the vien of D&D meets Fire Emblem with furries)            Artisticaly it's the most beautiful game i've seen in the last 2 years. Gameplay wise? As i said above if you like the sound of that then you are in for one hell of a fun time.             But let me go into a bit more detail. Everything (for the most part) in Armello is decided by Dice and Cards. Cards -Spells-Equipment-Trickey-followers- will allow you to either lay traps and challenges for your foes (trickery cards) Buff your rolls in combat and trickeries (Equipment and Followers) Or just cause a ruckus and make people not have a very good day (Spells). If anything listed above interests you, then this just might be the game for you.  "

												I'd like to point out that I've only had this game for two days. I've given this game many chances to captivate me, however it hasn't. I do not think this game is bad, it just doesn't appeal to me and it might not appeal to people similar to me. I haven't tried multiplayer but honestly I do not think that would make me change my mind. I can only imagine what people would do to me in multiplayer.Honestly, I feel like I should've listened to what people were saying. This game is NOT a bad game. It's just that this game functions like a traditional board game with a dice. You can play smart and have some sort of stategy but it also comes down to the dice. But that doesn't mean you can play like an idiot and win. Regardless if you increase your chances of success there's still ways the game can screw you over.From my experiences it's always like being on the losing side of a dice based board game. Which wouldn't be bad if I could have fun in some way while losing but personally I did not enjoy this. But hey I tried something new.			"

												First, let me say that I like the game. It's a great game, with good potential, but I don't recommend it for 2 reasons:1) The AI is very bad. Once you understand how to play you will win every single-player game you have. 2) This means if you want any kind of challenge you will need to play multiplayer. Unfortunately there is no in-game chat, absolutely no repercussions for leavers (and I have not had a game where someone hasn't rage quit), and the random board can be horrifically unbalanced against you.If you have 3 friends who want to buy and play this game with you then you will have fun, otherwise don't buy.If the multiplayer is fixed I will absolutely change my recommendation.

												At first I really liked this game! The graphics are top notch and it also has a very intriguing story. But OH MY GOD the RNG (random number generator) system is just completely broken. I can't tell you how many games I've lost just because I can't get past that damned wits check before the castle. The RNG system basically just throws all your hard work and planning out the window and tell you ""Nope we're not going to let you win...Instead...This guy that did nothing all game can win!""If you really don't mind the RNG system then go ahead. By all means. But I tried giving it a shot and I've decided that the RNG system just takes the fun out of the game.			"

Review A board game with tactical card play, RPG and strategy elements.The (Lion) king is dying and you need to defeat him and take his place before the other players do.On your way to take his place you can (and should) complete quests, earn prestige and become stronger.You'll fight or avoid, as much as you can depending on your hero, fighting other players, watch out for threats, summon powerful spells, get weapons, followers and make traps for your opponents.Choose your hero/clan, each one with different stats and skills.Currently the game has 8 heroes but there is a DLC with another 4 heroes coming.It looks like online gameplay is the focus of this game.The AI turn takes too much of your time. First thing you must do is to turn the ""Quick AI Encounters"" options on.You'll die, but that doesn't mean the end of the game. You'll restart on your clan base again and the only thing you'll lose is prestige, which is a very important stat to win the game.This an easy to play and hard to master game. There are so many gameplay details that it's impossible to talk about all of them on the review. But you'll learn about them on the Prologue/Tutorial and also on the guides you'll find on the community guides.Pros:  Beautiful art. Not only the map, the heroes and the other characters, but also the cards. There are a lot of them with really beautiful animations.Tutorial/Prologue is well done. Not only it teaches you how to play the game, but also introduces you to the (short) story.Different ways to win the game/defeat the king.Different characters and skills.Random generated maps.Dozens of different cards. Cons:  Lack of content. There's only one map. On my second run I beat the game as Thane. The only incentive to play the singleplayer game again is to get the remaining achievements.Instead of releasing new maps/story, the devs are focusing on releasing new heroes.There is an annoying bug that has been already related to the devs but they haven't fix yet and that prevents you to end your turn. The workaround that worked for me was to change the screen resolution in-game so I could see the ""End turn"" button.The animanted scenes that you see on the trailers you won't see in the game.You can't collect items on singleplayer, just on multiplayer.

												Tl;dr: Gorgeous graphics, garbage gameplayOK, I have played this game 4 times through now (5 if you include the tutorial). I enjoyed the tutorial. The graphics are lovely. There is a potentially deep, intelligent, strategic game under here. So here's why I feel like I wasted my money:1.) The AI is terrible. I ""won"" my first game vs. the AI because they killed the king while I was prestige leader. There is absolutely no reason for them to do this - it was a move which ensured a victory for me which I could not have secured for myself for many turns.2.) A game will last somewhere between 25-40 turns as a guess, but is generally decided within the first 3-4. It is very, very easy to get into a position where either A.) one player is so far ahead their victory is certain, but won't happen for another 3/4 of the game B.) you can't win because you lost a few early battles to the RNG and now can't hope to get back on your feet.3.) The battles are a snooze-fest and you are forced to watch *every single one*. I don't mean every one you are involved in - I mean battles between two characters who aren't even opponents of yours (essentially NPCs) on the other side of the map which have 0 bearing on your strategy etc. Battles you do not care about. Battles that last around a minute and consist of randomly thrown dice.4.) There is some small element of strategy involved in dice throwing -you can trade your cards to lock dice into position - but god knows why you'd want to when a dice roll can and will randomly reroll itself giving you extra victory points/defence/etc if it lands on the ""right"" side. Why would you trade the possibility of this potentially infinite loop for anything else?5.) I think the game is supposed to be primarily multiplayer - but the same problems of it being essentially a dice rolling sim persist. What's more the ""chat"" system is restricted to a handful of clickable speech buttons which don't actually even say the thing that's on them (""oops"" becomes ""well, that could have gone better"" etc.). Also see the game being won/lost in a few turns yet lasting so much longer than that it's literally painful.I played for less than 5 hours I know, and I would say at least 2 of those were me giving it extra play time so i could be sure I was being fair. I do not understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this game. If it was £3-£5 or still in early access I would give it a break but as it stands this is a real waste of your time and money. Finally: everyone who disagrees with this review, please, please, please explain why I am wrong. Like many of the other negative reviews say I desperately *want* to love this game but I could get the same gameplay value rolling a dice and trying to get the same number 5 times in a row. If there is something I am missing that makes this game amazing despite my reservations, please point it out!			"

												This game had potential, but unfortunately, while the general concept is good - it just doesn't live up to what it COULD be.Went into this game thinking ""Oh hey, it's based on tabletop RPGs - I've played those before and they can be entertaining, going through dungeons in a group, questing, etc. Sure, I'll give it a shot!"" but alas, it wasn't meant to be...There is absolutely nothing in this game that ""sucks you in"" in terms of gameplay. The ENTIRE time you're playing, you're staring at a tiny little map broken up into hexes, with giant figures featuring you, the three opponent ""player"" AI, and various other AI representing the King's guards, Rot enemies, etc. all moving around....but that's it in terms of gameplay. Want to quest in a dungeon - just step on a dungeon hex! But that's all you end up doing - after that your reward is randomly generated or you could trigger one of the Rot NPCs....you don't get to go through an actual dungeon, quest, deal with monsters, find treasure, etc. like you would in a tabletop RPG. Nope, you just step on a tile and the system randomly rewards (or penalizes) you.Want to explore a town, maybe do a quest? Yeaaah....no. Not gonna happen. Once again, step on a tile, a quest pops up - you gotta roll dice or burn cards with symbols on them (seriously?) to somehow ""win"" the quest. Fail - penalized, win - oh boy, you get a few coins or maybe a card...Want to buy equipment or upgrade your pre-existing? Nope - you gotta somehow hope that you pick an item card (when that finally happens in the game) that fits what your need, if not, you're stuck with a card for a piece of equipment you don't want.No, the entire time you're playing this game, you're staring at a hex map. Want to start a party - maybe quest some? Nope, not here. A ""party"" are basically npcs you win through questing - and we've already talked about questing. They're basically cards that hardly ever interact (if at all) with you and just provide a modicum of points/benefits (if any) for you.This entire game is nothing more than numbers chasing - you're trying to become the Prestige leader for every turn, trying to acquire 4 soul stones to MAYBE heal the Lion King, trying to gain enough corruption/hit points to take ON the King in combat, etc. Meantime, the other npc players are trying to handicap you at every turn, laying traps, stealing your money, attacking you, etc.Needless to say, this got boring FAST.Listen, this game is basically eye-candy and even then - not much else. Plotwise - it's got about as much depth as a kiddie pool with a half-inch of water in it. The storyline is the barest boned I've seen in a LONG time. You never really explore this world - you just wander through it, trying to get your character high enough before the game times out or is won by someone else. Game mechanics are pretty much luck based, and if there's something along the lines of actual strategy involved - I've yet to see that.This game had the potential to be SO much more. Given the types of similar ""anthropomorphized animals in a medieval/magic-based setting"" content out there - such as the Autumnlands and Mouse Guard comics, plus pre-existing RPG games that follow D&D mechanics, such as Might & Magic, this game could've been more immersive, more plot driven, so much more INTERESTING than it currently is! Where are the quests to try and find out more about ""The Rot""? Where are the quests to explore the history of this land? Where are the quests to explore the land, PERIOD!?!? I'd have loved to be able to put together a party of npc characters or even multiplayer friends, and just QUEST in a dungeon or explore the wilds of this kingdom, fighting monsters, doing quests, etc. instead of running around like crazy people, from one end of the map to the other, trying to perform what comes down to as MEANINGLESS quests, all in an effort to numberchase against AI opponents...This isn't entertainment, it's very pretty annoyance and monotony. And yes, much like everybody else, I find it appalling that there's FURTHER in-game purchases for what is nothing more than variations of the same eyecandy skins that already comes with the game, and very little of anything else. The fact that they charge almost (if not more) for the ""upgrades"" than the game itself make me scratch my head in wonder as WHY someone would continue to fork out money for a game to look remotely prettier if the game mechanics are (at the end of the day) still pretty damn boring.My recommendation - Avoid Like the PLAGUE!

Early Access Review
								At this point in the development i already feel that Armello has set a standard for digital boardgames. The 4 characters introduced with the initial early access build each play up different strengths and weaknesses exposing distinct strategies, while still allowing for a variety of general strategies. With the different game winning conditions, as long as players are active a couple setbacks do not feel game ending. The prime example of what feels like an out of the box come back is the rot win, allowing death to be the means forwards. I've had a great time playing the game and look forward to the new cards, additional heroes and an expanded community of players.			"

								Still early days at the time of writing this, but I feel the game has only upwards to go. It's a very solid game to begin with, and the artwork is bloody lovely (liking the animations on the cards).With more character types and further improvement in the AI I can see this game being a firm favourite when I'm in need of something similar to a classic board game :)Would be much more impressed if we could get local multiplayer as a function (few friends round, beers at the read, and much back stabbing for fun).

												Pros: Runs very smoothly!  Very interesting win conditions and very diverse heroes makes amazing strategy experience. Everything is pleasant to look at Quick AI movement option makes a comfortable single player experience.Cons: Could take very long against human opponent (just played a 2 hour game long. But maybe that's because I'm still at the bottom of the matchmaking ranks.)Overall:I'd recommend Armello because its a great and fun experience despite few flaw. My laptop struggle to play other game with graphics as nice as this, but not with Armello, this is a big plus to me. People complains about unbalanced win condition but I think that still depend on each player's playstyle. If improvements are made to multiplayer experience this game would be even better. "

												Want more players in multiplayer? Multiplayer is regional block by Steam. To change region, go to Steam -> Settings -> Download -> Download RegionEurope has a big fan base, my favourite region is UK London. I notice that multiplayer's strategy changes base on region.This is a tabletop games, takes 10-20 hours to unlock all rings and amulets. Then the only thing left to do is multiplayer. You don't have to put much time into this game to be powerful, don't have to worry that you can't catch up with others after leaving the game once a while. Just play with people whenever you want. You need skills and luck to win, neither devotion nor pay to win.Move three cells each turn, draw a number of cards base on wit. Cards can be equipments, useable items, spells, traps, etc. Finish quests to gain more stats and rewards. Three ways to kill king, or win with prestige. Every character has their own special ability. Each clan has their unique rings. As a result, strategy is diverse. You can speed up AI in option, and push . button, to speed up AI further, too. In multiplayer, people uses strategies that you never see with AI. I learned a lot in multiplayer.For those who complains about randomness. I have played so many turn-based strategy games, a few notable are heroes series, Xcom series, talisman, Elder Sign, Hard West, King’s Bounty, etc. I tend to play on highest difficulty and get boring because it is too easy. In Armello, I win 70-80% against AI because of randomness and I enjoy it. I won’t play this game if I know how to win 100% every time.Multiplayer is where the real challenge begins. Where you feel anxious and tense, the intense pleasure, a kind of addiction. The stimulation is too good...You don’t want to go back to single player anymore.Conclusion: A Hidden gem. Must play.			"

Where you feel anxious and tense, the intense pleasure, a kind of addiction. The stimulation is too good...You don’t want to go back to single player anymore.Conclusion: A Hidden gem. Must play.			"

												Great board game that takes advantage of the fact that it is on the PC. The look and feel of the art was very appealing, and the sound quality was good. Thorough tutorial as well. It is a fun experience, where characters can become invisible at night, and the AI is pretty good. Each class does play differently. If you like board games that have strategy and dice, you will likely have fun with this game.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're a fan of board games and RPGs, this is a must try, especially mage knight the board game, if you ever played that one, then this game has a lot of elements from it, but obviously simplified for everyone to get into.Everything from looks to art is great, except a minor thing which is the animations in battle seem a bit wonky/awkward, but that's just a preference.Now I understand they decided to limit a lot of deep elements of the genre to attract more people, but I do believe a few things need to be considered for the final release:1) A leveling system: Be it in game for the characters, they gain exp for killing enemies/heroes and when they level up they get to pick some character specific skills which they can use once per round etc.  Account level up to show progress of some sort and rewards such as skins or whatever, rather than just earning rings and whatnot.2) A better variety of enemies more than just a crow/ the option to be able to attack kings guards without the need for the kings orders to allow it.3) Introduce elements such as Fire shield or Ice attack which count as 2 swords and needs 2 blocks to block 1 ice attack and such, this might be a little too complex for the general public though.4) More maps, hopefully this is already being thought of/implemented.5) Like someone has suggested, even though the game has 4 routes to take to win the game, everyone ends up going for the prestige route because its the easiest and more beneficial way, they need to somehow balance to improve variety.6) Different game modes, cooperation between 4 players to fight against the map and conquer castles or such and the trickery spells etc could be used by the enemy minions, another one would be a two on two sort of match with the same elements.7) Allow us to buy recruits at cities or settlements with coins or magic depending on their type, seeing as leaving it to RNG doesn't really have a fun feeling to it.Overall this game is great and I'm quite excited to see it in its final form, but for now I think I'll give it a  rest until it's finished. Great job guys, unique experience.			"

												I found this game while just skimming over sales, and I am glad I stoped clicked on this one. If you are a fan of board games, rpgs, or mtg, then this game will be right up your alley. The gameplay is well refined and balance (unlike most games these days), which gives every player, no matter how nooby, an equal chance to win the game. Now I must adress that there is RNG elements in this game, its based off of drawing cards and rolling dice, many people are against RNG in games but do feel that it plays very nicely into the game and makes the game more enjoyable! Overall I definitly recommend this game to whoever seems the slightest interested, the Devs and Community is very open and wil help you with any questions. P.S. Make sure to join their Discord, its great for new players or when you are just looking to make some new friends, https://discord.gg/0hTFOpFGL1qAedPp "

												Excellent electronic board game beautifully crafted and animated. The premise being you are one of many animal characters with their own backstory and play style attempting to bring down the corrupted king within a certain amount of time. While you explore this painting of a board you compete not only against the corrupt king himself but three other heroic animals wanting the same thing. Purchased this on a whim and play it when I want something calming to play (which doesn't involve blowing things up or find unlockable secrets), well worth a look in, thumbs up!			"

												Armello is a charming board game brought to life for us pc users. It is beautiful to look at and challenging to play, but don't get discouraged by it's mechanics. It is very much the type of game that the more you play, the better you are at it!! Oh and the people that make it are so awesome, humble and funny to watch on Twitch!Thank you League of Geeks for making such an amazing game that my husband and I love playing together! I can hardly wait to see what is next for Armello!! "

												TL;DR A pretty fun game with some preformance and balance issues, but worth picking up if on sale.Pros:+ Beautiful environment+ good soundtrack+ fun strategy Cons:+ Unabalnced; certain characters are substantially easier to win with+ unnecessarily graphics heavy+ various bugs/errorsArmello is a lovely, strategy table top game where there are several ways to win. The game is fun and definitely has some interesting strategies you can use to win, however, it suffers from unabalanced gameplay and bugs. As a Mac user (I know, screw mac - you're a fanboy - buy a pc - blah blah blah) the game unfortunately is so graphic/animation heavy that it causes a little bit of lag on my Macbook Pro 2016. My primary gripe with this game is the unbalance. While there is always something to be said for champions, hero's, classes (whatever you want to call it) that are easy to play, the ""easy to play"" hero in this game is also unfortunately much easier to win with as well. This makes the game a bit less tactical and a bit more hero specific. All-in-all, I definitely reccomend this game as a fun, engaging, and well packaged table top game that's just priced a bit too high for the quality. I'd recommend picking this up at around $10 or less.Happy gaming!			"

												""RED-WALL!!!"" ""EULALIA!!!"" ""BLOOD 'N' VINEGAR!!!""""WINTER IS COMING!""Ahem... anyway...The introduction video is pretty self explanatory. Four players with unique heroes navigate a perilous hexagon tiled board in their quest to succeed the Rotten Lion King.There are three ways to win as of Aug 30 2016; have the most Prestige when the King dies, slay the King and survive the battle, or collect four Spirit Stones and engage the King to use them. A ""fourth"" option is to have collected a higher Rot count than the King and slay him in battle.Every day in the game is two turns, Day and Night. Each turrn you draw cards, your Wit stat determines your total cards in hand. The game is played by spending Gold, Magic etc on these cards to affect yourself, other players and the tiles of the board. Battle uses dice to determine hits and misses. They are six sided but use symbols unique to Armello. The effects upon your characters determine the number of die you cast and buffs and penalties to your rolls.All in all a fun and addictting board game.I like it because you can be helped or destroyed by chance at almost anytime. I've been in last place and won the game in one turn more than once... and vice versa.Perfect game to play when you want to eat too.... Now playing it makes me hungry...			"

												**Slightly outdated review, will update eventually**The game is just too short. I don't really mean that each game session is too short but the overall experience is too short. After a few times of playing you feel like you have experienced all that Armello has to offer. I really think that there needs to be more content in this game to make it worth 20 dollars. Here is my reasoning:Heroes:There needs to be more heroes to play to make each session more interesting. There are only 8 heroes so you see a lot of the same things over and over again. Also, you get all the heroes right off the bat with no effort needed. Instead they should have made more heroes and required the player to unlock the heroes through gameplay. This would have extended gaming time for the players.Cards:All the cards are offered right from the beginning. Similar to the hero section, there should be more cards in the game to add customization and also offer more content to the game. Similar to hearthstone, Armello could have required the player to earn new cards through gameplay. Then the player could have set up decks for each of the heroes that they had unlocked. Map:The map is okay. The tiles do change from game to game which leads to more replayability. However, the map has the same shape every single game. It would be more interesting if the map took on different shapes, which would require different strategies for the player to deploy to win. Also, a wider variety of tiles would increase replayability and alter player strategies on the fly. Conclusion:Really the game just needs more content and variety to make it worthy of 20 dollars. Maybe I value higher levels of game time and content more than the next gamer, but I still feel Armello is on the lean side of those categories. When I buy a game I expect to sink a decent amount of my time in it. Armello just didn't do that for me.			"

												I never really liked or even cared for tabletop strategy games, but a handful of my friends had Armello and insisted that it was super fun, so I decided to get it anyway. And I'm honestly glad that I did! Once I got used to all the game mechanics and learned all the rules and characters and such, I was hooked. Even after all these hours played, I still have a blast both online and offline, trying to get powerful items and followers while either avoiding or killing enemies, perils and other players in a race to defeat the corrupted king and become the new ruler of Armello. And the graphics, artstyle and effects are nothing short of gorgeous.As fun as I consider this game though, it's not without its faults. For example, at times it feels like it's just far too luck based. You're constantly at the mercy of an unforgiving RNG, whether it be something like fighting another enemy or player, or just trying to complete a quest. Should the RNG decide that it hates you, you're in for a rough time, whether it be failing a quest and not getting items that you want, or dying constantly and having to start from your clan grounds over and over. There's also this really annoying bug that happens every now and then. Sometimes when a player ragequits, the game will pause and lock up, making the game unable to continue and forcing you to start a new game (hopefully that will be fixed though).But still, despite these flaws I still think that Armello is a really nice and well-made game. Definately a great game to play solo, or with friends to either encounter shenanigans together or to annoy the heck out of them. 4.0/5.0			"

												Edit: Originally not recommended, it was borderline. After many plays, the game is in fact a lot of fun to play and the characters add a lot of variety. My gripes with the game still stand though, some crazy RNG, user interface issues, lack of options, easy AI, slow pace with no current way to disable animations.Here are the selling points from the store page and my breakdown of said features.◘ Easy to Play but Hard to Master - Armello is an intuitive game, easy to pick up and experience but with deep and emergent strategy. Full release will include a tutorial mode.Emergent strategy basically means that there is no long term strategy, things change from turn to turn, a new card draw with less than stellar cards means you may have to try and burn them off rather than continuing to your quest marker so maybe you'll get a better draw next time. The card draw is one of my biggest gripes in the game. There are a lot of different cards in the deck, so you can never really plan on what you want to do with your character based on equipment and spell cards, you just have to develop a new plan based on each draw. I wish the game gave you a little more control over the card draw.◘ Fast & Thoughtful - Adventuring in Armello is fast-paced fun but filled with deadly tactical and politically complex decisions requiring careful forethought and planning. The pace is simply not fast, you have to wait for your opponents to finish their turn and it takes forever. You can occasionally play some cards off turn, but it's rare. Planning is thrashed by card RNG, if it works against you, your opponents will quickly outpace you in stats and equipment. Poltical descisions are not complex at all and you basically choose between a or b, prestige in the game is relatively easy to get.◘ Multiple Playable Heroes - Full release will include 8 playable Heroes. Each unique Hero possess a special power, stat line and Ai personality. Also heroes can be customised with Amulet and Signet Ring load-outs to match your play style or counter an opponents strategy.Fair enough.  Edit: I didn't elaborate, but characters are all very different and require different tactics. My favorite to play at the moment is Amber (dungeon RNG reducer) . Upcoming Bandit Clan DLC will also add to the variety with new characters and different buffs.◘ Dynamic Sandbox - Armello features a gorgeous dynamic world which procedurally generates a new map each and every game, complete with a dynamic quest system ensuring no two games of Armello are ever the same. I don't feel like the quest system was very well fleshed out. Pick the stat you want, travel to get it, a random dice roll risk if you want a little extra. Random map generation does not really help replayability because of the small map size and a small handful of different tiles, I feel a larger map with increased action points and more tile variety would have been more immersive. I feel like I travel the same tiles, and take the same route over and over.◘ Turn-Based Day & Night Cycle - Armello features a fuzzy turn-based system, cycling between Day and Night phases. The fuzzy turns allow you to still play cards and do certain actions when its not your turn, and when it is you use Action Points to move around the hex board. I wish there was more to do when it's not your turn, this is less of a problem late game though as players begin to rush the palace.◘ World Class Music & Audio - By Michael Allen, internationally acclaimed artist Lisa Gerrard, Stephan Schutze and Jacek Tuschewski. The audio is outstanding.◘ Animated Cards - Armello will feature over a 120+ beautifully animated in-game Cards, from artists all over the world. They do look nice. No complaints.Edit: The game is truly gorgeous to look at, I mentioned it in my ea review, but didn't mention it here,  the all around atmosphere of Armello is near perfection for a game, I don't think there are many games in my library that come close.◘True Tabletop Feel - We spent months making sure we cherry-picked the best parts of the tabletop experience, like our custom physics-based dice!There are some things that are not consistent with a tabletop feel.  During a King's decree, the camera locks and I can't even scroll the board. I want to look at my card descriptions while trying to figure out a quest, nope, not happening. The devs have reduced the fog in the game for better visibility, but I just want to zoom out more and see the whole board at once, but the devs are obsessed with the artistic atmosphere and zoom is nerfed. Multiplayer makes the game a little more fun, as the AI is not great and makes some puzzling decisions, but the pace slows even more and it's agony if you've fallen behind.For me, Armello could have had some more strategic choices (especially card draw mechanics) and less battling with the RNG.  I do play quite a bit because RNG games have a place in my library. I will also continue to play in the hope of seeing some improvements, but I'm afraid this is the devs final vision (except for some tweaking) and it's not gonna change much.			"

												You play one charakter with unique abilites like a first strike or getting more money from villages etc. From then on you try to win the game by either killing the king, curing him or let him die by himself and be choosen as the next king by reputation.Which way you choose depends on your playstyle but also on your cards which you draw at the start of your round. By completing personal quests you get items, gold and other usefull stuff to beat all other players. But beware of them trying to interrupt you.It is pretty much RNG at many times - too much for many guys. But it is a board game with dices - so there have to be RNG. However it's much more about how you take adventage of your luck and make your way to victory not too obvious. I really enjoy this game.It's pure fun and beautiful.			"

												I love this game to pieces.The characters are awesome, the strategy of each is easy to understand and yet you still have to hone your skills to perfection. This does not mean that you do not have to adapt to the situation at hand - choose your ring and necklace wisely or you may end up being camped for prestige.It is good that the randomness of dice can be alternatively conquered by using your cards, but it will still be hard to have the right cards at the correct moment - so remember that this is a board game and it would take from the flair if it were otherwise.

								As someone who rarely purchases games, I am very pleased that I decided to invest in Armello.The whole game oozes charm and elegance with lovely graphics and a flowing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the mood of the moment. It features some old ideas but executes them so that they feel new and original.The game can be played straight from the box but, as the player gets more involved, the various strategies and mechanics become clearer. Do you strive for strength in close combat or opt for tiptoeing around the world, searching for spirit stones, and using long-range tactics to shatter your opponents?I love the way this game has been designed. It has the power to immerse and captivate you with plenty of variation and scope for future expansion. Each of the heroes provide a different approach to winning the game and can be further defined by completing quests and obtaining a wide range of useful objects like armour, spells and follower companions. The element of luck and random outcomes makes every game different and entertaining.If you enjoy employing your brain, I think you'll really like Armello!			"

												I didn't want to like this game. It looked a little too cutsie, almost like a dolled up girl's version settlers of Cataan. Well, my board game buddy bought a copy for me and I played the introduction. I was hooked. I love Civilization, I love Endless Legend. I loved this game. It was easy to learn. It has a lot of variety. The graphics are really nice. Actually, I want to have an actual board game version of this. The dice are quite fun. They way your character levels up is great. When I lose, I have fun. When I win, I have fun. I'm having a lot of fun playing this game and I didn't think I would. But I did, and I do and I will.If you have room in your library for a relaxing 30-45 minute strategy turned based multiplayer boardgame style game. GET THIS ONE.			"

								Let me give you the TL;DR first for those of you wanting a quick review.Excellent game, beautiful graphics, challenging and fun. The price tag is acceptable for the gameplay presented (and I'm incredibly picky about price vs. quality). Oh, and I ran this on a painfully bad laptop and it still looked and ran flawlessly.Cons: for those who button mash, jump blindly into things or have no patience, you're going to have a steep learning curve ahead of you because the game requires strategy. No compendium of spells/items/trickeries for review and future planning (though this does give the game an element of think-on-your-feet strategy).Final ruling: Worth buying, especially for the multiplayer.Now, let me go into a bit of a lengthier review, I'm reviewing this game while it is in-dev, and while I usually don't leave a review, I feel that I should definitely give this game some credit and accolades. First off, beautiful game, as I said before. I ran this game on a computer that failed to meet two of the specs in the initial screen and it still ran without a single hitch and lag so minor that it  maybe  added on 10 seconds to my overall game. What I'm getting at here is that the game is incredibly user friendly.In playing the game through with each of the characters once, their traits are balanced so that you have a fair chance to win with each character, though you still have to win with strategy, as blindly rushing the king will more than likely help your opponent achieve victory. Took me a second to realize that to activate cards I had to drag and hold, but after I realized this I also came to the conclusion that whoever made this mechanic is a lovely person who didn't want us to have to click yes in an 'Are you sure you want to do this?' popup box hundreds of times.I'll give further review as the game develops and adds in new features, but for an in-dev and early access game, it already has me quite happy and eagerly awaiting further releases.

Early Access Review
								I've always been a board game fan, and had both high expectations and trepidation walking into Armello. Would the RPG element be complete enough? Would the game be deep enough in a one hour play through? Would it be exciting enough to get me to play it over and over?  More importantly, would I ever choose to play Armello when I could otherwise play Settlers of Catan or Dominion on my kitchen table? The answer is YES, to all of these questions. The RPG element is too downplayed to really be called ""RPG"". It is more ""inspired by"" RPG. The closest thing I can think of to it is Munchkin—the RPG parody. Yes, you go around and get treasures and equip weapons, but the real reason for doing this is to get a strategic advantage, not just to make yourself more badass. The advantages are sufficient that you are encouraged to quest not because the quest is interesting (it's not) but because if you can complete it, you'll be one step farther than your opponents to achieving late game dominance.In terms of game mechanics and win conditions, the latest update, Engines of Fate, has greatly improved the chances that trying for another victory condition other than a prestige (points) victory could nab you the win. Better, even if they don't, trying for another victory condition could give you the advantage you need in the late game to lock down a prestige victory as a fall back. It is this full-game strategy that makes Armello worth playing. Once the full version is released, I expect that this to be an extremely replayable game, and a refreshing change from most turn-based video games like Civilization that take most of a day or longer to play.

								I've played Armello for about 5 hours now almost exclusively in multiplayer and I've had a lot of fun with it so far. The gameplay is very good and well structured, although it does require some more balancing. It's much much easier to win by prestige amount than any other way. As soon as that's balanced a little more, this game is a pearl among rocks I would recommend to everyone.Technically I've only had issues with the game not registering my graphics card correctly and thereby forcing me to play in lowest quality, but as it's on an Early Access state, that's more than understandable at this point.I've had great experiences with this so far and can't wait to see what's in store for the final version. Keep up the good work!			"

You want to play with friends? Prepare to watch your relationships crumble as they poison, strip naked, slaughter, and steal from you to get that sweet victory. You'll hate them just as much as you would in a game of Monopoly, if not way worse depnding on how hard they ♥♥♥♥ you over.The games can take forever too, so make sure you have 1-2 hours of free time if you're gonna play multiplayer.

												Ok, I had my doubts about this game from the start but it is crazy addictive. The claim that it is an adorable version of Game of Thrones is accurate, and I like the general mechanics of the game. I would reccomend a few things:- Maps with special twists not just reskins, I know that this can be hard as it may inately slant the balance toward more heroes.- A rebalance of a few heroes inparticular. I know I am not exactly a veteran of this game but I have played enough to see that there are a few heroes that are simply above the point of balance. First: I have never won a game against a River and I have never lost with her, and no, RNGesus was not always on her side. Her passive plus a defensive gear build absouloutly ANNIHILATES. Also it can kill the king AND give her the kingslayer victory, I mean what is with that!?Second: Magna, while I like her playstyle, seems too potent to be considered a ""tank"", provided the RNG is the same, she is basically a better version of Brun.There are numerous tweaks i would like to see made, but the game, for all intents and purposes is young. I have seen games with far worse balance issues.Overall, great game, most addictive one I have played since ARK: Survival Evolved.			"

												A very well executed board game, made to be a beautiful video game. The visual presentation draws you in and the mechanics compels you to stay and explorer more of it.The only weakness I feel is worth mentioning, is that if you try and stringently pursue a certain victory condition, the game will slap your hand and throw a myriad of random events at you, which might screw up your plan. The trick then is to be able to revise your plans immediately and go for a new victory condition, if that one seems more plausible than your old one. Also, sadly, a lot of online games I've playe so far are marred by people disconnecting. But that's a problem with the player base. The game is very enjoyable in single player as well, which is a rare quality in a virtual board game.			"

Early Access Review
								There are already plenty of reviews stating what this game is, so I'll skip that part. The real question is, is it enjoyable, and the answer is a resounding yes. Is it worth 25 USD? Well...Being early access there are still a few kinks I feel the game needs to work out, but the developers are constantly tweaking the game to make it as fair for all players and strategies as possible. New characters can currently be previewed in game and on the forums, so the current four are certainly not the end all, and more content and game modes are still being worked on. Multiplayer is operating, though it's currently easier to schedule a time with friends than wait for a public match. Single player is still a hoot though, and will keep you busy for hours as you try and achieve the different win conditions for in-game rewards that can be used in multiplayer matches. Artwork and design is also stunningly beautiful. For what's there, 25 may seem a little steep, but for what's promised, 25 is well worth it.			"

												Wonderful strategy game.  The love and care put into the ""digital board game feel"" is absoutley outstanding.  I love the design of the game and the heartpounding finales to each round.  Music is wonderful, and the animated cards bring the game to life.  It's the perfect game to play at the end of the day and kick back to, but once you begin to scheme new ways to play and win it's incredibly addicting.  Rounds are perfect lengths too, only about 30-40 minutes a piece.  I've been playing many rounds on my PS4, and then rounds on campus whenever I have a spare half-hour.  A few visual hiccups and audio balancing issues aside, this is my new strategy game addiction!			"

Posted: September 9, 2015
												Nice game.I like it.  A very good product of a designed based on hybridizing board/dice/card games with RPG / 4x-esque games.  It might be a bit too oversimplified, but deeper strategies do exist.My favorite part about the game (and the part in which I think it does the best) is its job of developing and presenting the theme.  The artwork, the lore, the presentation of the entire story (which is unforutnatly a bit short) was very well done.  The win conditions are all very fitting, from slaying the king in direct combat to submitt oneself to the corrupting Rot, it all goes with the lore very nicely.  At the end of each game you can pretty much imagine a tale written about what happened in the past 1 or 2 hour of gameplay, as the mechanic of the game trasnlates into a story smoothly.  Now the gameplay in itself is not bad at all.  People say it is too luck dependent, but really it's just a factor you stratgize around.  The actual range of risk analysis isn't so big.  Sure, rollin 4 dice might sometime beat someone who is rolling 6, but that should be in your consideration of margin of risk and possiblity.  Engagment with dice differentiation of 4 or more is rarely unexpected.  Furthermore, the overall health of all the character is relatively low in comparsion too all the things that can kill you.  It's more often than not that both combatants just die from fighting than one guy winning purely due to chance.  The only thing that is bit too chancy is quests and spirit stones.  Although they normally don't change the outcome too much, it's a weird mechanic of odds with a payoff that doens't really makes much sense.In other words, the game has set a very good premise on this hybrid genre.  It has a good base, a great art form, phenomonial theme and lore.  All it needs is to expand on the mechanics, extend compaign story, rework the chance mechanics a little.  I hope they can pack a lot of more good content in a DLC or something, because otheriwse there would be little incentive to keep working on the same game.8/10 for novelty.  10/10 if you are big on thematic and artistic elements.

Only one game mode except tutorial. With the mechanism and all the set-ups they should be able to come up with more.2. Poor multiplayer experience. No communication at all. That is killing a boardgame! 3. Not balanced. The winning conditions and the characters are not well balanced.4. Extremly random. Luck decides everything.5. Tends to snowball.

""One of the resounding impressions one gets when playing Armello is that this is a polished product – one that has been developed with love and care – not something that has been stamped out to make a quick buck. This is something I always look for in a game, and rarely find, to be honest. However, Armello hits the spot for me, in more ways than one.With a great aesthetic, a solid soundtrack, intuitive gameplay, fun concepts, and charm by the bucketload, Armello is a game I am happy to recommend to anyone from the most casual of gamers all the way through to the hardcore.""Read the full review here...http://thenarrativewithinnnbc.blogspot.com.au/2015/09/sagrannus-gaming-armello.html "

												Armello is a great game for anyone who enjoys elements of the RPG and Strategy genres. It's essentially a turn based board game which supports up to four players at once, with players attempting to win the game in one of the four ways to win. Each player selects a character and each character has different starting stats and a unique ability. Each player will begin the game and select a quest out of a few different alternatives. The quest will boost a stat and give a chance to win gear. Gear is great in this game and I've seen most games come down to gear loadouts and, of course, dice rolls. Oh yes, a public service announcement: anyone who doesn't like dice mechanics should probably bypass this title as it is ALL dice!There is also the rot game mechanic. Rot is a stat that is basically like evil corruption. I mention this separately, just in case there are any players, like me, that like to take the left hand path and play evil. Armello indeed has the low road and it takes the form of rot. Get to a higher level of rot than the King (the villain) and you will get a huge bonus. Plus, I have rarely seen other players use that route, increasing its novelty with multiplayer.Now here are some things I dislike about Armello. I think that there are some balancing issues, especially for Corrupt characters (ie. very rare corruption cards) and a complete lack of aesthetic customization to characters. I'd love to take my evil bear priest and trick her out.Again, if you like strategy, board games or RPG's, pick up this title. Armello is one of my new favorites and with multiplayer matches only lasting just above an hour or so, I'm not sinking a whole afternoon into it. "

												Its sad I cant share my actual Armello stories. Some of them have been pretty good.Pick one of 8 heroes, each from one of four clans. Wolf, Bear, Rat, or Rabbit. Chose the ring and amulet that will give them special, clan specific, bonuses. On top of the heroes unique ability. Then begin the quest to become King or Queen of Armello. The king will succumb to the Rot a little after a week. Depending on certain choices made before day 9. Or the king defeats a few would be heroes.Chose cards based on three types. Trickery, that may require gold, or prestiege. Magic, wich requires the magic resource to use. Or Items, requiring gold. Each type may also cause corruption. Corrupted weapons, magic, and trickery will cause the user to contract Rot. Becoming corrupted has its own benefits and drawbacks. And is one of the four ways to claim the throne. You could also win by being prestige leader. By combat. Or by spirit stone, and banish the king. Its never clear how you will win each game. Or who will ultimately become the next ruler of Armello.Positives:+ Nice artstyle+ Neat game and dice mechanics+ 4 different ways to win+ No two games play exactly alike+ Immersive music+ Procedurally generated maps, no two maps are exactly the same+ Interesting and animated cards+ Addicting, reminds me of hearthstone in a way+ Can still use cards, even if it isnt your turn+/- Luck plays a big part in some games, epic underdog wins happen.Negatives- Only 8 characters currently, the amount of heroes feels small- Maps only have one size & cannot be changed, currently- Games are short, only four-ish quests can be done before the king dies- No animation skips, you have to watch the AI's turns.- No team game modes. A Clan Vs. Clan would be fun, like the Rabbit Clan versus the Rat Clan.After playing for a few hours, I dont mind losing, the adventure, challenges, choices, chances, and rewards in each playthrough keep me hooked. Each game tells a story it feels like. And the music and art can get pretty immersive. And Im used to playing bloody metal shooters like Killing Floor2. Another good game, if you are wondering.Armello is great,Buy It/10			"

												Armello is the best virtual board game I have played to date. It does a great job of feeling like a board game while taking advantage of a lot of things that are only possible in virtual space (ie hidden things that only certain players can see). There are several very different play styles for different win conditions and with each patch, gameplay gets more and more dynamic. This is one of the few games that has lived up to its initial hype (and it's not even done yet as I write this!). A must-have game for any board-game enthusiast and an excellent game regardless.Watch gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9pi5wJBFo_WUegKuWro60Q2 "

												In short: This is a charming game. It's fun, it's replayable, and it's nice to look at. But if you like reading longer reviews -Armello is a turn-based strategy roleplay game, built much like one would build a board game. In fact, I would go as far as to call this a, 'Virtual Boardgame'. The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from that: Rolling dice, moving tiles, drawing cards, and collecting stuff, until you can claim victory, or the timer runs out. Gameplay is a bit repetitive, but you certainly don't play Monopoly because of the ways you can innovate. There are several ways to aquire victory; some of which are somewhat hard, and there are playstyles that show through that.

It's very moving, and flowing, and keeps a light-hearted tone until the grim of battle finds you for the first time.Overall, I have to give the game a 8/10, marred only by the steep pricetag, and a lack of a campaign.

												What can I tell you that hasn't been said already and isn't immediately apparent from looking at screen shots and videos? It's a great pick up and play, relaxing, and oh so clever. It feels like playing a table top board game but with elements from rpgs, adventure games, and card games like Magic, and Gwent. After the initial learning curve of how to play, it's very easy to hop in to a game and just get to playing it. Armello doesn't bog it's self down in complexity, yet there is still many layers to it and many ways to go about playing and attaining a victory in game. Highly recommend!			"

												I play a variety of board games weekly, which is what attracted me to Armello. I can sum this up quickly:It's pretty. It's somewhere between simple to moderate in complexity. It has a consistent theme. It involves a good deal of luck. It doesn't take long to play. End of summary. If you're looking for something to do in an hour, that's easy on the eyes and somewhat challenging, Armello is a nice option. If you're looking for a rich strategy game, this isn't for you.  "

												If you enjoy playing boardgames, then you simply cannot pass on this little gem. The art is drop dead gorgeous, and the game a ton of fun to play, especially in multiplayer. A special mention to the cards which are all animated and look quite stunning for the most part. It is a game where each turn brings new surprises that you must adapt to with what you have in hand. While there is a strong element of randomness in how fate affects you, you can do a fair bit to mitigate it and adapt to circumstances. The pacing of the game is perfect, there is very little down time. Armello rocks!			"

												A very well executed board game, made to be a beautiful video game. The visual presentation draws you in and the mechanics compels you to stay and explorer more of it.The only weakness I feel is worth mentioning, is that if you try and stringently pursue a certain victory condition, the game will slap your hand and throw a myriad of random events at you, which might screw up your plan. The trick then is to be able to revise your plans immediately and go for a new victory condition, if that one seems more plausible than your old one. Also, sadly, a lot of online games I've playe so far are marred by people disconnecting. But that's a problem with the player base. The game is very enjoyable in single player as well, which is a rare quality in a virtual board game.			"

Early Access Review
								There are already plenty of reviews stating what this game is, so I'll skip that part. The real question is, is it enjoyable, and the answer is a resounding yes. Is it worth 25 USD? Well...Being early access there are still a few kinks I feel the game needs to work out, but the developers are constantly tweaking the game to make it as fair for all players and strategies as possible. New characters can currently be previewed in game and on the forums, so the current four are certainly not the end all, and more content and game modes are still being worked on. Multiplayer is operating, though it's currently easier to schedule a time with friends than wait for a public match. Single player is still a hoot though, and will keep you busy for hours as you try and achieve the different win conditions for in-game rewards that can be used in multiplayer matches. Artwork and design is also stunningly beautiful. For what's there, 25 may seem a little steep, but for what's promised, 25 is well worth it.			"

												Wonderful strategy game.  The love and care put into the ""digital board game feel"" is absoutley outstanding.  I love the design of the game and the heartpounding finales to each round.  Music is wonderful, and the animated cards bring the game to life.  It's the perfect game to play at the end of the day and kick back to, but once you begin to scheme new ways to play and win it's incredibly addicting.  Rounds are perfect lengths too, only about 30-40 minutes a piece.  I've been playing many rounds on my PS4, and then rounds on campus whenever I have a spare half-hour.  A few visual hiccups and audio balancing issues aside, this is my new strategy game addiction!			"

Posted: September 9, 2015
												Nice game.I like it.  A very good product of a designed based on hybridizing board/dice/card games with RPG / 4x-esque games.  It might be a bit too oversimplified, but deeper strategies do exist.My favorite part about the game (and the part in which I think it does the best) is its job of developing and presenting the theme.  The artwork, the lore, the presentation of the entire story (which is unforutnatly a bit short) was very well done.  The win conditions are all very fitting, from slaying the king in direct combat to submitt oneself to the corrupting Rot, it all goes with the lore very nicely.  At the end of each game you can pretty much imagine a tale written about what happened in the past 1 or 2 hour of gameplay, as the mechanic of the game trasnlates into a story smoothly.  Now the gameplay in itself is not bad at all.  People say it is too luck dependent, but really it's just a factor you stratgize around.  The actual range of risk analysis isn't so big.  Sure, rollin 4 dice might sometime beat someone who is rolling 6, but that should be in your consideration of margin of risk and possiblity.  Engagment with dice differentiation of 4 or more is rarely unexpected.  Furthermore, the overall health of all the character is relatively low in comparsion too all the things that can kill you.  It's more often than not that both combatants just die from fighting than one guy winning purely due to chance.  The only thing that is bit too chancy is quests and spirit stones.  Although they normally don't change the outcome too much, it's a weird mechanic of odds with a payoff that doens't really makes much sense.In other words, the game has set a very good premise on this hybrid genre.  It has a good base, a great art form, phenomonial theme and lore.  All it needs is to expand on the mechanics, extend compaign story, rework the chance mechanics a little.  I hope they can pack a lot of more good content in a DLC or something, because otheriwse there would be little incentive to keep working on the same game.8/10 for novelty.  10/10 if you are big on thematic and artistic elements.

												At first glance, the game is all I want. Fantasy, boardgame, nice graphic, etc. However, the truth is the game can't really go far after I try it out.1. Lack of game content. Only one game mode except tutorial. With the mechanism and all the set-ups they should be able to come up with more.2. Poor multiplayer experience. No communication at all. That is killing a boardgame! 3. Not balanced. The winning conditions and the characters are not well balanced.4. Extremly random. Luck decides everything.5. Tends to snowball. A 50%-chance bad start may totally destroy you whole game, not leaving you any chance if others not stupid.If the game is like a $10 small product I would like it much better.			"

												For all the people who hate Early Access, Armello is a game that proves it can be used well.  The devs were remarkably on-point with updates for content, AI, and game play issues.  I am just floored by the experience of watching this game grow.As for the game itself? It has a small community right now, but even the single player creates amazing scenarios and so many moments of nail biting tension that you will love and hate and get to experience every time you play. It is probably one of the best uses of a digital platform for a board game design I've ever seen, up there and perhaps beating Civilization.  It feels like a board game that simplifies what would be an immense amount of complexity and a game box the size of a Cathode Ray Tube TV into background programming. The negatives are there, of course. The graphics can suffer at high res, the mouse sensitivity has cost me a few games (mostly from a card not burning in time, or being played to the wrong hero) and the Rot victory is incredibly difficult to get if you don't base your entire game around it, but it is so, so satisfying when it works that I cannot truly fault it for that.  The first two issues are likely because of the game being also developed for mobile, and the last feels a bit more like the game designers discouraging you from being totally evil the entire game.  All in all, I recommend this game very much so to all the folks looking for a game that's fun, gorgeous, and will leave you sweating until the king's crown has fallen down.			"

Early Access Review
								A computer version of a board game, that doesn't exist.I really like this game. For an early access, it is VERY polished. The ONLY bug I have had is that it crashes whenever I exit the game. Every single time. Not a big deal, since it only happens when I am finished playing and quitting anyway. The early access doesn't have any tutorial, so I had to do some digging on the forums and youtube videos to figure out how to play. But once you figure it out, it is alot of fun to play.I haven't had a chance to play online yet. It seems no one else is wanting to play multiplayer whenever I try to... I hope more folks get the game so that this wont' be an issue when it goes v.1 live. The AI is pretty good, but I do see it make some stupid mistakes sometimes.Great game. I can't wait to see what all they add as time goes on.			"

												after seeing the game and the style, plus the playable characters, i immediately fell in love to this game. the world is so wonderfully made, gameplay is very good and the story itself is so well done. it might be a huge challenge with bots time to time, but if you think carefully your moves before you act, you might have a chance to win them. but if you play alogng friends, this game become so fun. even with just one friend this is fun to play, knowing that you two pair up and work together helping each other in a way. but also compete who wins. both with certain winning goal and you help each other same time. 50/50 chances of seeing which one of you wins. and more better makes the winning routes. it does not have just one specific win, it has 4 different with their own challenges. i highly recommend getting this game and give it a go. i know you won't be disappointed when you start to play. ^^			"

The gameplay is really solid except for one major thing. The AI is absolutely attrocious. I played a game where one of the AI literally handed me the victory by reducing their own prestige and making me leader the turn before the king died of rot. I still reccomend it, but from now on I'm probably gonna be sticking to multiplayer.			"

												Something about this game just feels magical, it reminds me of movies like Secret of Nimh and Robin Hood! I normally don't really care for card games or turn based games but this game is just special. The animated cards, the characters and world; so much about this game that I love and want more of. If you have just a little interest in any of the genres this game covers, check this game out or at least do yourself a favor and watch their animated trailers!Some things I hope for later would be maybe a more campaign driven singleplayer, like now on how it feels each play through is your own personal story but just more in depth (picking different responses, meeting new characters, learning how the king got infected or maybe some one organized it to dethrone the king, etc) Also, I can't help but want a map that's more diverse, where the trees are mix together, some towns are huge or harbers over lakes, rivers running through, huge forts to sway a duke to your favor. Either way, this game is amazing and worth a buy in my opinion!			"

												If you enjoy board games (not Monopoly or Risk, but real board games), you'll enjoy Armello. It reminds me a bit of a simplified Mage Knight (board game) or Runebound. It's addictive good fun, so long as you don't mind random elements like card draws and dice rolls. If you go into the game appreciating it for what it is, and not expecting every element to be skill based, you'll have a blast. I don't think it's fare to give the game negative reviews simply because you didn't know what it was going into it.While there are random elements to the game you have no control over, there is still a large amount of strategy and skill. From hex movement and board control, to skillful usage of card playing and 'burning' cards in combat, to equipping your character before and during the game... there is a lot to it.The animated 2D art is absolutely fantastic - the cards and the (too few) cut scenes are beautiful, the 3D board itself is fairly meh. The character designs are great (I'm especially fond of River's design and Sana's design), and their implimentation in 3D is the best aspect of the 3D elements of the game.I would recommend the game to anyone that enjoys colourful art, doesn't mind spending an hour or an hour and a half playing a game based roughly 50/50 on skill and chance, and that likes board games.

												Ermagersh! Fun!Watership Down.  Secret of NIHM... it's got it all.  Think tactically, observe operationally; win strategically.The numerous paths to victory all use very similar mechanics (so they are easy to recognize as you play) - but, they have such wildly different means of arriving at victory; that the game is quite exciting at every play - even against the AI!My only complaint: if somehow you can't manage to take a shot at the king before the last turn - whoever does get there has WAY too easy-of-a-time (the king drops to 1 HP at the end of the game, which basically means ""did you score a hit? great - you win."")

												I like it+ A mix of Talisman and Catan+ Art style is great+ Simple rules+ Games will end in a set period of time+ Fun with friendsDownsides- Game is cpu heavy. Don't be decieved because it's a ""board game"". If you have an old computer that struggles to run Civilization 5 then you will run into the same problems- Turns feel really long.- Feels incomplete. I feel that it's missing some features that it should have like the options to fine tune graphics or gameplay features. I'm sure these features will come in time.- No hot seat gaming.Now some people complain about the RNG. I don't think it's a problem because it actually averages out. For example, if you have a character with 6 dice rolls. You have a 1/2 chance of getting 1 point of attack per roll. That means on average you should only get about 3 attack rolls. You might get more or less but point is you are very unlikely to score all 6 dice rolls as attacks. If you take this in mind rather than hoping to getting ""double sixes"" then it will be a much more pleasant experiance.It's a board game so expect to lose some games because you were not lucky enough.Overall I'd definitly buy it if you enjoy board games and can get 3-4 friend to play with.

												For all the people who hate Early Access, Armello is a game that proves it can be used well.  The devs were remarkably on-point with updates for content, AI, and game play issues.  I am just floored by the experience of watching this game grow.As for the game itself? It has a small community right now, but even the single player creates amazing scenarios and so many moments of nail biting tension that you will love and hate and get to experience every time you play. It is probably one of the best uses of a digital platform for a board game design I've ever seen, up there and perhaps beating Civilization.  It feels like a board game that simplifies what would be an immense amount of complexity and a game box the size of a Cathode Ray Tube TV into background programming. The negatives are there, of course. The graphics can suffer at high res, the mouse sensitivity has cost me a few games (mostly from a card not burning in time, or being played to the wrong hero) and the Rot victory is incredibly difficult to get if you don't base your entire game around it, but it is so, so satisfying when it works that I cannot truly fault it for that.  The first two issues are likely because of the game being also developed for mobile, and the last feels a bit more like the game designers discouraging you from being totally evil the entire game.  All in all, I recommend this game very much so to all the folks looking for a game that's fun, gorgeous, and will leave you sweating until the king's crown has fallen down.			"

												Armello is the best virtual board game I have played to date. It does a great job of feeling like a board game while taking advantage of a lot of things that are only possible in virtual space (ie hidden things that only certain players can see). There are several very different play styles for different win conditions and with each patch, gameplay gets more and more dynamic. This is one of the few games that has lived up to its initial hype (and it's not even done yet as I write this!). A must-have game for any board-game enthusiast and an excellent game regardless.Watch gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL5JEFvVpx9pi5wJBFo_WUegKuWro60Q2 "

												A very well executed board game, made to be a beautiful video game. The visual presentation draws you in and the mechanics compels you to stay and explorer more of it.The only weakness I feel is worth mentioning, is that if you try and stringently pursue a certain victory condition, the game will slap your hand and throw a myriad of random events at you, which might screw up your plan. The trick then is to be able to revise your plans immediately and go for a new victory condition, if that one seems more plausible than your old one. Also, sadly, a lot of online games I've playe so far are marred by people disconnecting. But that's a problem with the player base. The game is very enjoyable in single player as well, which is a rare quality in a virtual board game.			"

It feels like playing a table top board game but with elements from rpgs, adventure games, and card games like Magic, and Gwent. After the initial learning curve of how to play, it's very easy to hop in to a game and just get to playing it. Armello doesn't bog it's self down in complexity, yet there is still many layers to it and many ways to go about playing and attaining a victory in game. Highly recommend!			"

												I play a variety of board games weekly, which is what attracted me to Armello. I can sum this up quickly:It's pretty. It's somewhere between simple to moderate in complexity. It has a consistent theme. It involves a good deal of luck. It doesn't take long to play. End of summary. If you're looking for something to do in an hour, that's easy on the eyes and somewhat challenging, Armello is a nice option. If you're looking for a rich strategy game, this isn't for you.  "

												If you enjoy playing boardgames, then you simply cannot pass on this little gem. The art is drop dead gorgeous, and the game a ton of fun to play, especially in multiplayer. A special mention to the cards which are all animated and look quite stunning for the most part. It is a game where each turn brings new surprises that you must adapt to with what you have in hand. While there is a strong element of randomness in how fate affects you, you can do a fair bit to mitigate it and adapt to circumstances. The pacing of the game is perfect, there is very little down time. Armello rocks!			"

												Its sad I cant share my actual Armello stories. Some of them have been pretty good.Pick one of 8 heroes, each from one of four clans. Wolf, Bear, Rat, or Rabbit. Chose the ring and amulet that will give them special, clan specific, bonuses. On top of the heroes unique ability. Then begin the quest to become King or Queen of Armello. The king will succumb to the Rot a little after a week. Depending on certain choices made before day 9. Or the king defeats a few would be heroes.Chose cards based on three types. Trickery, that may require gold, or prestiege. Magic, wich requires the magic resource to use. Or Items, requiring gold. Each type may also cause corruption. Corrupted weapons, magic, and trickery will cause the user to contract Rot. Becoming corrupted has its own benefits and drawbacks. And is one of the four ways to claim the throne. You could also win by being prestige leader. By combat. Or by spirit stone, and banish the king. Its never clear how you will win each game. Or who will ultimately become the next ruler of Armello.Positives:+ Nice artstyle+ Neat game and dice mechanics+ 4 different ways to win+ No two games play exactly alike+ Immersive music+ Procedurally generated maps, no two maps are exactly the same+ Interesting and animated cards+ Addicting, reminds me of hearthstone in a way+ Can still use cards, even if it isnt your turn+/- Luck plays a big part in some games, epic underdog wins happen.Negatives- Only 8 characters currently, the amount of heroes feels small- Maps only have one size & cannot be changed, currently- Games are short, only four-ish quests can be done before the king dies- No animation skips, you have to watch the AI's turns.- No team game modes. A Clan Vs. Clan would be fun, like the Rabbit Clan versus the Rat Clan.After playing for a few hours, I dont mind losing, the adventure, challenges, choices, chances, and rewards in each playthrough keep me hooked. Each game tells a story it feels like. And the music and art can get pretty immersive. And Im used to playing bloody metal shooters like Killing Floor2. Another good game, if you are wondering.Armello is great,Buy It/10			"

												Armelo is a trap. Like many games it's looks like there's a lot of possibilities. But that'S not true. The dice decide the game. That's it.  Everything else is luck. So my advice is...don't try too hard, you'r efforts are not rewarded.Go for the cheap victoryGot more prestige than anyone? it's the endgame soon? just go hide in clangrounds and you'll be untargetable. Go out to cast spell and return before your turn end.Cheap victory nobody has fun everyone hates you.  BUT HEY YOU WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "

If you do, you will find yourself grouped up on during the majority of your games, leaving you with nothing but boredom and frustration.It's too bad as this game IS a fun and great game, but playing against only the AI becomes lackluster quickly and the multiplayer community is fully of groups who work together to pick apart solo players.

												Hmmm... How do I explain this.. Armello is a beautiful and creative game based apon slaying the king and taking the throne. Filled with Dark creatures, dungeons, and clever enemies. Armello is honestly a great game. I do however have a few problems with it. I suppose my view on this game is slightly altered since I havent played with friends. And this game is and isnt my taste. 1. I suppose I didnt look enough into the gameplay, For I thought there were different maps. Yeah the map is randomized for what landscape goes where. But I feel that the map is a bit too small and bland for what this game costs and is styled with. Of course, This game IS styled as a BOARD game.2. This game is almost exactly like an actual board game. Therefor there isnt really any story to it (Prologue was actually pretty cool in my opinion)Of course, there are plenty of things I found cool, Such as rewards for winning with ____ race or winning in a certain fashion.If you arent looking for this type of game, and are looking for a more conquesty game. Check out Heroes of might and Magic ( I dont mean to advertise... sorry )			"

												As an avid board gamer, I was very excited to buy Armello. And after playing through six games of it, I'm ready to give it a resounding.....meh? It's pretty, with a nice soundtrack, but the actual game is surprisingly boring. I feel like I'm playing some kind of really well skinned yahtzee clone. It reminds me of talisman, with a faster ending. If you like that game, you'll probably enjoy this a lot.For anyone expecting a game with any level of strategic thinking.....prepare to be disappointed. "

												I really wanted to be able to write a positive review and recommend this game, but I just can't. It has fantastic artwork, and *some* fun game mechanics, but its flaws in sum are crippling, and in the end cause more frustration than enjoyment. The game suffers from a combination of excessive luck, snowball effect, and too long average game sessions accordingly. Far too often, within the first 2-3 turns, it's already obvious which one or two players will actually have a chance at winning, while the other two or three players got screwed by RNG. This would be OK, in a game that takes an average of 30 minutes. But to have zero chance of winning over half the time due to bad luck just ten minutes into a one-hour game is just not my idea of fun or enjoyable. For this game to be what it could be, they need to find a way to drastically cut down on the snowball effect, or give players more control over their fate. One idea I can think of is to add a deck-building component, where players can choose which cards will be available to them, so as to be more likely to draw cards that work together and help a specific build; think MTG.

												This is a furry game, yes I have to break it to you, this is totally a furry game, so much furry. But to sound the all-clear, this is not a furry-fandome game, be blessed by the gods not a furry-fandome game. Because that way everyone can enjoy it.I actually never thought it would be that furry but it just fits the tone nicely, the fairy tale tone. Okay it is still a furry fairytale. But anyway let's come to the actual review. This game is Amazing for board game lovers. This is rather a computer board game than a videogame. It seems much like civilization but instead of heaving a length lice settler of catan or monopoly it is not a to long one. a game against the AI only eats about an hour, for a match with other people it can eat up to 90 minutes. The length reminds me at Company of Heroes or the regular shooters but is a bit longer. Also the game is not to complicate to learn and there are many victory options, it is possible just to win as the underdog in the last few rounds. That is great!. And many board games I've plead lack this. Even computer games, only company of heroes seems to have a similar chance for a come back but games like civilization especially against the AI are so predictable that this annoys the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you, especially since they are long as all hell.But another big selling point is the theme and it also is reflected in the game mechanics, for example if you get slaughters by a roten beast or bane as it is called in this game you will suffer the rot and become more well rotten. But once you are more rotten than the beast you will only rot via a victory over the less rotten. I love that touch, also the stone circles that heal you a bit every time you enter them will kill you instantly after you are rotten to the core. There are many other little details which make the whole game so more enjoyable. Also there is a little theme with the visitor. While he seems very annoying at first he become pretty enjoyable when you get that there is a bit story hidden in the game. Another great aspect for me was that you eventually will kill the damn lion! Man I hate lions! They aren't royal they are just a disease, and luckily you can kill them. Whoever told the story of the pure Hearted lion was full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ look at them they look like dirty scam politicians! I say only a dead lion is a good lion!.So please, play this game and enjoy it, and always remember dead all lions, those damns tyrants!.			"

												Is this game fun? Well yes.The reason I'm down voting this game is the slimy practices of the company after gathering a fanbase. DLC City, this is something I would expect from EA or Activision but not from a indie company. So I bought the game before the DLC swarm started, it was fun it was quick and the Devs seem to care about the customer.Since the last update, the Dev have slowed up on the release of new characters that were promised (The backer faction if I remember correctly.) and every new release is a poor reskin of a character or new dice. The dice are nice but effectively boring after first roll.This practice leaves a bad taste in my mouth and pretty much ruined my enjoyment of this game. The game still has a ton of bugs when it comes to multiplayer so thats a thing that is barely addressed in favor of more skins. I will never buy another game this company puts out after my experiences, fool me once I guess.TL;DR The company made it's money so ♥♥♥♥ the people who invested early and wanted more cards/features instead of pallet swapped skins that cost almost half as much as the original game. Save your money and get another game, it's only going down hill from here.			"

												Very fun game. Using the story with animals gives it a nice Mice & Mystics feel. I love the confined map forcing you to interact and battle. The touches of animation and effects are awesome and I wish more turn based games showed these little touches. For, example some of the cards have ongoing animation in them while they sit on your board. The smoke and clouds over the lands add a nice touch as well.You can tell these developers love their universe and game. Good job and I would highly recommend.			"

												If the beautiful art-style and magical atmosphere isn't enough to win you over, the fact that it's a board game that takes advantage of its digital platform should.The online multiplayer is serviceable enough, but private games with friends who like cards and dice whom you can f over with said cards and dice is definetly the best way to play.An enthusiastic dev team that releases rather frequent updates and bug fixes certainly helps, too.All in all, unless you're turned off by some randomness and a bug here or there, this game's got your back on a boring day.Seal of approval!

												Diverse, deep enough, with a great presentation, this is a must for fans of board games. The only criticism I have is that it's designed so that you can't play it with others in the same PC, taking turns in ""hotseat"" mode. That would have made it the perfect game for me. But well, I understand that acting on other players' turns is important for the flow of the game as it was designed.I can't wait to play it with friends online!			"

												Is this game fun? Well yes.The reason I'm down voting this game is the slimy practices of the company after gathering a fanbase. DLC City, this is something I would expect from EA or Activision but not from a indie company. So I bought the game before the DLC swarm started, it was fun it was quick and the Devs seem to care about the customer.Since the last update, the Dev have slowed up on the release of new characters that were promised (The backer faction if I remember correctly.) and every new release is a poor reskin of a character or new dice. The dice are nice but effectively boring after first roll.This practice leaves a bad taste in my mouth and pretty much ruined my enjoyment of this game. The game still has a ton of bugs when it comes to multiplayer so thats a thing that is barely addressed in favor of more skins. I will never buy another game this company puts out after my experiences, fool me once I guess.TL;DR The company made it's money so ♥♥♥♥ the people who invested early and wanted more cards/features instead of pallet swapped skins that cost almost half as much as the original game. Save your money and get another game, it's only going down hill from here.			"

												I really really believe the game needs to let everyone take their turn at once, then put up the timer, as opposed to one at a time, with timer after 2 minutes.One, less waiting. 3/4 of the game time is spent not touching your controler, and watching everyone else play their turn. 75% downtime. It would reduce idleness and be far more intense if you know either of you can make a move at eachother, actually race to an objective, or all end up having a big brawl at once.Most things are very straight forward in the sense of ""action, counter"" and as such can completely screw you over if you dont have a hard counter.The most advanced combo you'll really see is stacking of a few spells that dont directly work together but the buffs just add up. Some things like Rot can completely ruin the game, and some games are over for you in as little as 4 turns.Some people have the money to burn and thats fine, but 7 dollars per skin, not even for a pack is absurd, especially since they are small models and half the game is spent not looking at your person, again, 75% downtime. If you play with 4 friends, all the time, every time, maybe. But staring at paint drying is fun with good friends, so I don't let that be an excuse for any game.			"

												Have fallen in love with this game!  It is my current go-to game at night to wind down and relax with a lot of fun.  At first I thought this would be a fairly simple game that I would get tired of easily.  However, it has turned out to be one of those true gems that are easy to learn but have much to master.  If you decide to do so, there is so much to learn and strategize within the game.  If, you do not wish to get bogged by complex strategies, you can simply have a ton of fun with the basics.Armello has been the best ""pleasant surprise"" I have had all year.  So happy that Steam put it in one of my discover queues!			"

								When I 1st saw this game I thought it would be a strategic turn based strategy game. Once I bought the game, I mainly forgot about that. Things I like about the game. 1. The art is AMAZING2. I enjoy how the map is based3. I enjoy plot Things I dont like.1. How small that maps are 2. How strong the king is. 3. The price I think that is is only worth around 15$ currently Things you should aprove1. Add in a weapon that you can use like the rings and the amulets2. YOU NEED TO make it so you can save and load games3. Please allow steam friends to play toogether. Overall this game I would recommend to others.			"

												It is an interesting enough game and honestly i suck at it.Besides that match makeing is the slowest bloody thing ever! sometimes takes over an hour to find a match. I started it up and sat there doing something else while i waited. the games can be just as slow as the match making but that is expected in a turn based game.  the long slow paced games along with the long slow paced match making just ruined the whole thing for me. On top of that every time i picked a character it gave me a completly random one while the other players all got their choices. in short lost of wasted time on a game that isnt interesting enough			"

												I must say, I really do enjoy this game.The visual style is, of course, stunning, with the nice blend between the cartoon animated characters in the fight screens and the 3d models in the world emphasizing the uniqueness of each character, and the backgrounds being quite easy on the eyes as well. The battle system is very quite enjoyable as well, with a nice random element in the dice rolling that is curbed by the card burning mechanic, in which you can sacrifice a card from your hand in order to get a precise dice roll. For example, if you burn a card with a shield symbol, you will lose the card, and one of your dice will become a guaranteed block.The reason I'm giving it a negative review, however, is the fact that player interaction in this game is completly crippled. All conversation is limited to a range of preset emotes, just like in Hearthstone. While that may work in a card game like Hearthstone, where only limited messages need to be sent across to the other player, in a strategy game such as this, free chat is vital. There are basic emotes such as ""Let's form a truce."" and ""Let's attack X character."", but these emotes completly simplify and dehuminize the message. You can't ask to form a truce personally, negotiating terms such as ""I'll get rid of your bounty if you form a truce with me."" And endeer yourself to the partner in the truce, therefor making them less likely to break it, you can't play any psychological power games with the other players, you can't even ask someone to move from your quest tile, as you'd rather not fight them. In strategy games free chat is a vital element, and removing it like this makes you draw no disctinction between the players and AI, and makes it impossible to form relationships. All and all this game is still very very enjoyable just because of it's mechanics and style, however I could not recomend it to anyone who's looking for an in depth tactical expirience, unless the developers decide to add free chat as a house rule, then I could recomend this game to everyone.

												The premise and art style are neat, I'll give it that.The actual game mechanics, though...I think the best word I can use to describe the game is ""erratic"". There are multiple win criteria and multiple characters who are better suited for different victory paths than others. There's a big problem with that when you combine it with typical tempo/flow issues in games of chance along with some characters being vastly superior or inferior to others.  Example: as of the time I write this, there is a character who can win instantly in the last turn of the game, with this requiring little more than being prepared to take it. Another example is being prepared to win one way, and getting cards that won't help in that direction at all. This results in a highly unsatisfactory experience.The erratic nature of the game can also be seen easily if you get poor cards at the start of the game, or if you get targeted by a player with decent cards. You will get dropped to the back of the pack faster than getting hit by a Blue Shell in Mario Kart, and just like Mario Kart, once you're at that end, there's really very little chance of getting ahead short of someone making a critical mistake or disconnecting and being replaced by the sketchy AI. Also regarding the winning criteria, of them, one is essentially not possible to achieve in multiplayer.On top of all of this, there's also another hurdle in the game's progression rewards. Seasoned players have rewards that can be used to give them more of an advantage over newer players. While the bridge can be crossed with relative ease as these unlocks thankfully aren't based on wins but just games played, it just makes for a more frustrating and imbalanced experience than it needs to be.I think this is a case of a game that can be fixed over time with patching and tweaks, but none of that matters when the game isn't fun right now.

												An addictive digital board game that will usurp the dwindling hours of the night that, foolishly, you thought you could spare. Play til 10pm, because of work the next morning? Why not, instead, zone out and play until it is 3am and lazily muffle a curse out of your lethargic lips when you realise you sacrificed a good nights sleep for a few hours of strategic maneuvers under the fate of a dice roll. Then, whilst you prepare to sleep, you can debate the role and function of free will and determinism, or just god damn luck based compatibilism. However your argument pans out, be sure as you're going to be grumpy in the morning, that at least Armello was saved from a King ridden with Rot. Until you play again. But of course, only until 10pm. The mechanics of the game work seamlessly, and the fluid deck building dynamic adds individuality into each game ensuring a reasonable element of uniqueness for each session of kingdom saving joy. The writers have clearly gone into great length into writing stories for the optional (and recommended) quests that you perform each game, but I fear that those poor scribes have worked in vain, for it is not a story dependent game (however, I for one found it extremely charming, and appreciate the effort - it's just that it is not integral to the actual joy of the game. If you are to take my opinion on this matter, you must take in stock that I have read most, if not all, of the in-game books from the Elder Scrolls series, Morrowind and up. What am I doing with my life? God knows, but ‘He basically read meta-fiction in games and enjoyed manly solitary one-handed pleasures’ wouldn't be the most untruthful epitaph I'd have scribed on the marble above me)I would say it is a short lived novelty game, and I don't think I'd be completely wrong. I have stacked up 50 hours on this sucker in a short amount of time though, and that is due to the relatively small time you need to invest into any single game. It is by this virtue that makes it a remarkable digital board game. Hell, if you were of the creatively productive type, you could fashion tiles out of cardboard, make painted clay figurines, print out cards, make some dice, and successfully play this with offline friends (there was a time in humanity where we socialised amongst fleshy alterations of ourselves, believe me or not. Back then, we just called those people 'friends'. But they became tiresome and didn't have numbers or pop cultural references in their monikers, and their avatars were what we called 'faces'). Basically, you choose between four different species (Bear, Wolf, Rabbit, Rat), who in turn, have two variations that centre on their particular strengths and abilities (Wizard, Warrior, Diplomat, Rogue). With that, you choose stat perks and bonuses. Then you're thrown into the game. You compete with three other souls to try focus on one of the game victory conditions. It's not too difficult to grasp, but would be redundant to type here as it is explained competently in the game description and the developers website (which is charming in itself, I implore you to explore it yourself). Either way, cracking game in its simplicity and its uniqueness. Go have at it.Or don't. I'd rather you did though. Needs more players active for multiplayer, and I don't have the time and energy to replicate a physical board game, nor acquire friends. Enjoy, you magnificent people. For Armello.  "

												I love table-top games, from pen and paper RPG's, to miniatures like WarHammer 40k, Star Wars: X-Wing, and even Armada. I also like board games. So Armello has got me hooked. The games don't take very long and the map almost alway looks the same, but majority of the time in most board games and table top games, the board, maps, or layouts do, as well.I haven't really encountered any bugs, except for one time I accidentally hit the speed up button and it sped up so fast that it literally got itself stuck and wouldn't progress any further. An opponent (A.I. at the time), just stood there, waiting for it's animation to end and it never did. Wasn't a loss, though. I literally quit the game and restarted it, chose ""Continue"" and it continued from where it left off as.Anyway, this is a much better game than No Man's Sky and anything Valve has released in the last 5 years.

												A freshly unique take on a digital boardgame that is centered around the kingdom of Armello and the war between the clans to take the throne from the corrupt and dying king.  It offers several ways to win and sports several unique and interesting characters that allow for different playstyle options.  Some characters favor cunning and wits, some spiritual magic, and others just favor brute force or fighting talent.  The card  and character artwork is fantastic and the character design is unique and creative.  I enjoy loading this up every so often to play a game or two.  If you enjoy boardgames, fantasy settings, and variable gameplay then you will surely like this as well.			"

												At first glance, Armello appears to be a game about strategy, tactics, forethought, and planning, with the ultimate victory going to the most clever player who also has a bit of luck on their side. If you play this game thinking this, it will be the most frustrating experience you can have. The true fun of the game comes when you realize that it's all about winging it from turn one, going with the random things you do or don't get, and spending the game attempting to build up to victory with half your effort, and being an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥to a player whose face you don't like with the other two-thirds of your effort. (Yes, that's a total of 116.6% of your effort, but you'll figure it out. Using the in-game character speech buttons helps.)In general, Armello is a more structured Mario Party without minigame and with furry characters, so if you can play a game and find your own way to enjoy it without necessarily completing the stated objectives, get some friends and play this game so that you can be absolutely gobsmacked when they get the Baneblade that you just failed to win as a quest reward by stepping on a random dungeon for the first time in the game. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll find a great game you can tell stories to your friends about. Like the time I got the Bully Mammoth achievement and the person that was my target won the game by Prestige. Play Armello and determine your real-life Luck stat.			"

												I played arguably the worst game ever. (The game itself was fantastic, my luck was atrocious)-I was plagued or poisoned for half of it-I teleported to a quest area and immediately died-had a bunch of cards but no money or spirit to use them-rolls were NEVER in my favor (thane got a 6 overkill on me)-all the guardsmen and banes actively hunted me- had next to no items and maybe completed 2 questsI won because all the other characters killed themselves so I had the highest prestige10/10 would play again			"

												This game is fun, but the time waiting for other characters to play is painful (especially 1p, where you're waiting for AI). I'd highly recommend an update from the developpers allowing players to skip the AI turns or speed forward through them....Get the game on sale and you might put enough hours into it to make it worth it. I do like the game mechanic and how it plays like a board game, and I think it'll shine with local multiplayer as a party game. I also LOVE that all the characters come with versions for both genders. <3			"

It's a fun game even alone you can enjoy it, however it's a bit glitchy at times I had some weird audio issues while playing, online does suffer a bit too. The ways you can win are pretty unbalanced, it's much easier to win certain ways making the rest tedious for no reason. The characters are generally fun to play they have their own perks and play style, I would not recommend buying something else than the extra characters and that is if you really enjoy the game, the rest is cosmetic and not really worth the money in my opinion.

												I was introduced to this game by a friend and I fell in love with it from the moment I started playing it. It is a tale of a kingdom's tragic spiral into chaos and the fight to end a king slowly dying upon his throne, sick and twisted by a foul corruption, The story made me feel sorrow and pity towards the denizens of the kingdom because I felt like I could connect to that conflict. ""No matter who wins the struggle for power, the strength of the kingdom is still lost as the bond of those who formed it disipates into the fires of war"".As for the gameplay, it brought back the enthusiasm I had in tabletop RPGs long ago. Everything is easy to understand for beginners, but still provides a challenge to long time players. The choice of characters and their traits actually makes me feel like I could play as any of them with ease and no matter how south things go in a game, there's a way to turn it around thanks to there being multiple ways to win. The constant threat of royal guards, perils set by the king, and corruption kept things interesting every game. Get some friends together and the chaos will ensue as the game gets more intense as the days pass.I know this isn't much to say about the game considering that I love it, but Armello is my go to game when I need to get my mind off of things or when I just feel like playing a game. The story connects to my heart and the gameplay reminds me of the joys back when I played D&D when I was younger. I'm getting everything for this game because the devs definatly deserve the support.			"

Extra Credits had recommended it simply as a ""game you might not have tried""; meaning that it may not be perfect or even GOOD at times, but it does something interesting and at least tries to be enjoyable.Described simply as Game of Thrones with animal characters, I've enjoyed it so far. (even if that so far isn't all that far!) The RNG may hamper some people, but I'm used to Darkest Dungeon, so when the game decides to take a dump on me, I'm not too surprised. Just gotta play through it. There may be some balancing issues here, and more playable characters are always a plus. I'm looking forward to see what Multiplayer brings to the table.			"

												Armello is a great game if you enjoy the mechanics of turn-based strategy without it being too lengthy per game such as Civ V or Endless Legends.  It's also great if you enjoy tabletop RPGs that utilize dice-rolling or card drawing.  In addition, if you fancy the idea of playing as adorable animals, this game is perfect for you!Pros:- Variety of heroes and clans (4 Clans, 8 Heroes- 2 Heroes per Clan)- Each hero has unique power - Four different victories to claim the throne- Dice and Card System allows for battle, dungeon, and peril events to be interesting (has mix of luck and strategy)- Quests allow for chance at rare items while also guaranteeing stat upgrades- Random events implemented- Interesting plot - Nice soundtrackCons:- Way too easy to get a prestige victory compared to other victories (I've played four consecutive games and won all of them with a prestige victory even while trying to get a different victory)- Standard games are the only way to gain achievements (which means if you're trying to aim for other victories instead of prestige, it's more difficult to do so in nine turns)- Each game is a little short (about an hour per game)I'd give this about an 8/10.  It's a great game in terms of cost with beautiful visuals and music.  Not to mention the gameplay is fun!  However, I'm personally not a fan of how you have a time limit to achieve a certain victory with limited resources (like action points per turn).  Whether you try to kill the king or not, he'll either kick off from rot or by being killed at low health by a hero.  This makes the game not only short but also limiting in which victories to pursue.  Overall, I enjoy it and would recommend playing custom games with friends if you want a greater challenge.			"

The true fun of the game comes when you realize that it's all about winging it from turn one, going with the random things you do or don't get, and spending the game attempting to build up to victory with half your effort, and being an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥to a player whose face you don't like with the other two-thirds of your effort. (Yes, that's a total of 116.6% of your effort, but you'll figure it out. Using the in-game character speech buttons helps.)In general, Armello is a more structured Mario Party without minigame and with furry characters, so if you can play a game and find your own way to enjoy it without necessarily completing the stated objectives, get some friends and play this game so that you can be absolutely gobsmacked when they get the Baneblade that you just failed to win as a quest reward by stepping on a random dungeon for the first time in the game. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll find a great game you can tell stories to your friends about. Like the time I got the Bully Mammoth achievement and the person that was my target won the game by Prestige. Play Armello and determine your real-life Luck stat.			"

												I played arguably the worst game ever. (The game itself was fantastic, my luck was atrocious)-I was plagued or poisoned for half of it-I teleported to a quest area and immediately died-had a bunch of cards but no money or spirit to use them-rolls were NEVER in my favor (thane got a 6 overkill on me)-all the guardsmen and banes actively hunted me- had next to no items and maybe completed 2 questsI won because all the other characters killed themselves so I had the highest prestige10/10 would play again			"

Early Access Review
								I used to adore this game and everything about it; Art style, story, music, etc. It was a masterpiece.Unfortunately, the devs' decisions over the years have been growing worse and worse, going down the greed road and completely disconnecting from their playerbase. They used to listen to their community, but now they just shut down any backlash by acting like our complaints are irrelevent to the ongoing success of the game. Arguments are always met with stubborn replies that only justify their choices by claiming they know better, with no data to back said claims.To make things worse, the game still has some of the same game-breaking issues it's had since early access. Their excuse to this (And almost everything else) is that they are a small team. But i've seen plenty of smaller teams fix bigger problems. It just doesn't feel acceptable anymore, not after so much time.			"

1.7 Brings Bandits. At last.Disregarding most of the issues concerning the developers behaviour (such as disregarding data from their testing group, their asinine pricing of hero skins, and assorted other misdemeanours that would likely hit the word limit of the review if I went into them in depth) the release of the Bandits FINALLY means I can now thumbs up the game as everyone has ""Hero parity"".You can now, some year after the intended due date for delivery, get your hands on the Bandits, something League of Geeks assured us would happen back when the initial kerfuffle happened. This means you now have access to all the heroes that the KS backers have, and there is now less of a divide between backers and non backers.I did notice a slightly acerbic tone there Mr. Tiger, something I should know?I emphasise the ""less"" bit.Backers are treated by LoG as a class above the proletariat, and that will always remain the case (unless they pull what one specific backer did, in which case LoG throws them under the bus.)With full hero parity, I now fully recommend people buy the game.Not the ludicrously overpriced skins though. These developers don't deserve *that* much of your money. If you need to see what I'm getting at, take a look at WordSlices responses in the thread below, recommend you pick up a good cheese to go with the whine.			"

												Armello is a beautiful game. I love beauty, I love board games. I really wanted to love Armello.And I kind of did. I enjoyed playing it. At first, it's fun, it's pretty. But the game also made me feel somewhat... betrayed?I won't talk about the gameplay itself, as you can find a lot of info about it in other reviews. You may or may not like it, it's personal preference. I found it.. decent.Let's go over a few things I didn't like about the game. The Art and Story	The game is beautiful, yes. But the trailers oversell it. It shows animated scenes, stories. None of that is in the actual board game. You won't see any of it in a game. Look at the screenshots of a game being played, and this is what you get. No animated cut scenes, no story, nothing like that. The UI	It's just bad, and clunky. The game isn't Early Access, it should be polished. Navigating the map is annoying. The Price	I think that's my biggest issue with the game, and why I felt 'betrayed'.The game is fun, yes. However, I don't think it's worth that price. Yes, yes, a lot of work has been put into it, no doubt.But I feel like the devs are just milking us for money. Yeah, they're friendly, they host little games on twitch among themselves in which you can watch them play, and hear them discuss the game and future updates.But instead of releasing good content (that the game REALLY needs to justify this pricetag), or having awesome promotions to get a bigger player base (that this game also REALLY needs, by the way), I've seen lots of things like trying to get their fans to pay an extra $5 to subscribe to them on twitch, just to have a cool colored die.Or releasing extra content that you have to pay for, on top of the big price tag the base game already has. It feels like they're milking their small group of loyal fans' money instead of making the game grow and getting new fans After all, who wants to pay that price just to try a board game? There was one free weekend, which was a decent start, but that's it.But they should really be making the base game MUCH cheaper (free, even), and then creating more dice and character skins, even emotes or whatever, as DLC material. I think that would be a much better recipe for success than having an expensive base game AND releasing costly DLCs.The game needs WAY more content - right now, you get tired of it fast (at least I did). New maps, new cards, new characters - and I don't think we should be paying extra for that... we already don't get enough for the base price. Just release more base content that players don't have to pay extra for, and the game will be way more interesting.Then release skins and extra cosmetics, people will definitely pay for it if the game grows. Conclusion / TLDR	I feel like there's not enough content to justify the price tag.The game is beautiful while also being clunky.There aren't that many people playing it, it's sometimes hard to find a game, and I feel it will just die down. A lot of it, I believe, has to do with the business model of it.			"

												Warning (my first 2 hours): single map game, your tactic is to limit the completely randomness of the game.This is a fancy graphic card game style which you move around and draw cards/ roll dice until you meet a condition for victory of the match. This will likely take very long and you will give up before that time comes, so don't try.This is like a mix between Chinese checkers and any card game. Not an RPG. "

												Armello is a nice looking game, though that's where the positive notes end. I've played about 5 or 6 games I think, and they've all been dreadfully slow paced and most times quite dull. The supposed intrigue between players doesn't really happen, and in my experience there really aren't any big incentives to interact with them at all, except maybe kill them if they venture too close to your settlements. The game is easiest won by grinding, amassing gear and waiting for the king to get to about 3 health, then move in for the kill. Gathering stones is not gonna win you the game unless you get extremely lucky with stone spawning, since moving around the board takes forever and will probably see you perish to the many dangers along the way. I've not tried for a rot victory, but it seems underwhelmning since you're probably going to be weak health wise due to attrition (fellow players have gone for Rot victory about 3 times and not succeded once). All in all a pretty game, but I would rather play another boardgame irl. This is a slow affair with little few tactical options that loses it's novelty very fast. After the first session of Armello, I found myself constantly alt-tabbing and reading the news instead.			"

												Armello is okay.  The game play is pretty interesting, even pretty good at times, aesthetically the game looks and sounds good, and the prolouge chapters do a good job of explaining the rules.However, the pace of the game is tedious.  Even with the fast AI turns setting turned on, the time between turns can be grueling.  You could easily double the pace of play without feeling like things are going too fast, and the AI is often pretty poor. I have played multiple games with AIs starting fights they can't win and feeding other AIs.  If this is intentional, to make the game harder for the player, there have to be better ways to increase the challenge. If it is not intentional then the programming is poor. In either case it's frustating to sit through.Most of my gripes about Armello boil down to things that are really related to the game play itself.  As a board game Armello would be very fun, but as a video game it's clunky, slow, and tedious.  If you can get past all of that then give it a try, but otherwise I would avoid spending more than $5 on it.			"

												While a beautiful game with some interesting game mechanics, overall I found the experience weighted against me so heavily as to be unfun.  Every choice and strategy I tried to implement was meaningless because the dice never came up my way, and while I appreciate the desire to force the player to change their strategy due to circumstances it became very tedious when it happened all the time.This was all from the singleplayer experience, I didn't try multiplayer.  I can't imagine anything would have gone differently though.Perhaps a decent game for a luckier person, but if you're the sort who rolls poorly this game is just going to be a lesson in frustration.

												I'm sad to say this, but this game disapointed me. At first it looks and feel like digital gameboard game with great artwork and story in awesome fairy-tale climate, and it really is - it makes an impression of traditional boardgame, it has really great artwork (especially on cards, I really love it) and convenction of some animal clans fighting for throne of dying lion king is such a great idea.But there is the problem: the game has nothing more than this. It's even worst - game will not let you enjoy those elements unless you like totally random gameplay where your choices hardly mean something. I have played a few games of Armello - all of them ended with my win or lose only to some lucky or unlucky dice rolls. You can play a game where you will win all your quests, spawned at your base or a game where you won't even go to your first quest as it will be placed on other side of map, and thankfully to RNG some enemies will permanently block your way. There are mechanics that should help you with RNG but they just don't work, the game is still 90% of luck and I felt like I have no influence on my game, its just a hour of dice rolling and you can be lucky or not. Also bad interface and not clear enough tutorial will makes your first games a quite unpleasent experience.			"

												Here are my main two gripes with the game:1. Excessive reliance on RNG. RNG itself isn't bad, but when its an overwhelming factor that takes more importance than strategizing or good tactics, it just feels like you're playing a more complicated version of Monopoly in the end. There's thankfully some strategizing in how you choose to play certain characters and highlight their strengths, but it still feels somewhat limiting as their seems to be one dominant playstyle for a character. There's also a pretty strong snowballing effect, so when you're consistently dying / not hitting your quests due to random luck, you just feel sort of screwed.2. Lack of chat. The developers have chosen not to implement chat due to concern regarding 'safe spaces'. I don't particularly understand the concept of playing multiplayer without being able to chat with each others (and no, pre-set voice commands don't count as chat), let alone playing a board game / table top game without being able to communicate. The entire fun in a board game is communication. Furthermore, Armello games take roughly 1-2 hours to complete and you'll be waiting 5~ minutes for other players to finish their turns at sometimes. Not having chat to kill the time while waiting is a pretty awful decision. You can get around this by playing with others and there is an online community, but if you're looking for a quick game you might end up waiting for a while.Conceptually, the game is interesting, but I think the gameplay could use some tuning to be less luck-oriented and more skill-oriented, while the chat thing is just absolutely silly.

												I really really love this game, it's look it's feel and it's gameplay are all fantastic, but I honestly can't reccomend it while the NMA bug is going around. What this bug does is causes the dice not to roll during combat freezing you in the combat screen and locking the game up. If this happens the devs want you to send a bug report to them, but there's no workaround or fix making the mp session unable to be completed. Until it's fixed it's impossible to play through a whole game with friends, kinda killing the appeal. buyer beware until a fix is released!			"

												I would like to start out by saying that the games advertising is pretty misleading about what this game is and is not.  I watched the trailer video which makes the game look like you choose a character and as you play the game you get to go on quest and possibly advance though multiple adventures.  Defeat different AI bosses and maps, possibly carry over card/equipment onto other adventure and so on.  Then I read that they are marketing this game as a ""table top game""(printed on their own web page)  which I am a huge fan of and have been playing for many decades.  The only way I have ever played table top games... is with other players.. usually in the same room.. usually at the same table.. ""sigh"".  Now this is where the very misleading part comes into play...  This game has no table top functionality in regards to being able to play with other players as you would with a ""table top game"".Okay so maybe they shipped the game early and they are going to add the ""table top"" into the ""game"" with a patch or update.  Nope they said they did not design their ""table top"" game to be ""table top"" friendly.  ""Sigh""So back to the trailer video...  In the video watching example play is actually the into series to the game.  So as you watch the trailer and expect to go on different adventures on different boards.. with different characters and win conditions.. different bosses.. randomized turn orders etc etc... what you get is...Set player turns, players vs AI player 1 will always go first.. the three other AI characters will go after you and they will always capture you cities on the night turn before dawn.  If you play the game you will soon realize how unbalanced that is.Computer AI will use cards against you as the player even if the same card played against an AI player is either (A) in the lead or (B) more dangerous to them geographically speaking on the map.*Example : computer AI plays a card that does -2 health spell, there are two possible targets.  (A) player that has 4 health 2 squares away on a tile of no importance, or (B) computer AI with 2 health 2 squares away, on their own quest location, and has killed the card player previous 3 times.*What happened:  {Comp playerX} plays spell on {playerY} does (-2) hps (4-2=2hps left), {Comp playerX} moves 2 squares and attacks {Comp playerZ} that is sitting on his quest tile, CompX has 4 hps, CompZ has 2 hps.  CompX has far superior cards and kills CompX by a land slide.  If CompX played his spell vs the other AI on his quest tile he would of been able to complete his quest and not die.  It is as if the AI was programmed to use all hostile cards VS the player first regardless of who best the card should be played in their personal interest.Okay so the AI is terrible... Who needs AI when you can play with friends so no problem.. wait.. oh I forgot you can not play with you're friends.Well you can play with some people.. over the Internet at least.. so lets hit that que button...  30 minutes later you are still in que.So that does not really work either.So what does work...  The into the game works.  You can load it up... get introduced to four of the characters one by one in their own mini adventures.. and well.. It is actually really good.  In fact its so refreshing you think, If they made the whole game this way,  The money spent would have actually been for what you were expecting.The upside to this game is the art.  If you want to play something for a couple hours.. get lost in its ambiance, get some steam achievements and then uninstall it once you realize that theres literally nothing left in the game you haven't seen or done then this games for you.I got it on sale and for the couple hours played it was similar to going to a summer movie... Not a lot story, shiny bits in between, and after its over you kinda wished you waited to see it on TV and kept the money in you're pocket.Maybe if they make the game into what it was marketed as It will be worth it in the future, but ""as is"" I regrettably have to say its an unistall waiting to happen.

												Bought this game so I would have something to play with my autistic, furry friend. It's okay... it's like a furry board game or something. I won the first game I ever played with a backstabbing, rat thief. Purchased on sale for 30% off and it still feels a little expensive for what you get, given that you still have to pay for character DLC. As I undestand it, the furries that kickstarted the game voted to allow non-backers to get the backer-exculsive characters as DLC sometime in the future. Good on you, furries; I would never have bought this game if I felt like I would always be missing exclusive content.As far as gameplay goes, It definitely feels like the AI gangs up on you. There is a lot of randomness to the game (dice rolls) but I like RNG in these type of games. The maps are randomly generated (good) but feel really small (bad). Game could definitely use bigger maps and maybe online with more people? Eight players would be a good maximum on a bigger map, and you could even do teams of two or something to help the game feel more varied.Great game if you are a furry; okay game if you just want something to play with your mentally-ill friends.

												The otter was exclusive for the kickstarter backers.  I'm trying to get a refund :/But seriously, that is the main reason I'm trying to refund this game.  Although, there are some other major problems.  The map is too zoomed it.  You can't zoom out far enough.  This game would greatly benefit from being able to look at a tactical view like you can in a game like Civ 5.  Furthermore, actions move at a snail's pace even when I have on fast AI turns.  I get the need for cool aesthetics, but not when they sacrifice the game's speed.Don't make backer-exclusive content.  It makes me upset when I realize I didn't buy the full game - especially when I bought it for to play as an awesome otter character.			"

												I am discusted with this game. While the game seem very fun and ive played single player a few times the reason I am upset is because I cannot connect into games via skirmish OR private games with friends. I bought this to play agaisnt other people not an AI. I cannot connect into games at all it lets me into a lobby but I cannot click ready up or when i can then the lobby disconects. I have tried the fourms for this and recieved no real help as well as emailed league of geeks quality assistance several times even giving them my logs as the devs told me to do so on the fourms and weeks of waiting recived NO reply back. The game is awesome I love the concept but support at least for me is bad and the connection is bad it seems. I can play league ark rust dota2 minecraft starcraft warcraft hearthstone all fine without any problems but this game refuses to let me play online.			"

												I've tried to play and like this game, however, I am kinda disapointed in the game.First of all, I find the game verry repetitive since all you do in this game is play a big board game with only a verry little difference between each game.Secondly, the game doesn't have a single player campain, and I think it would have been a very nice addition to the game, since the actual contenant of the game is just the same board game with the only deference being who control the oppoents (an A.I. or another player).Finally, the game is mostly bassed on luck rather than strategy.I admit that the game also have few positives points (It very original, and the actual board game isn't that bad,), but since I was hopping for a game with more divercity and contenent than this, I will leave a negative evaluation as a warring to anyone who would like to buy this game.

												This game is should be labeled as turned-based luck game. Very shallow in the strategy department and the card playing mechanics quickly become stale. Most of the games will end just as the game starts becoming exciting which leaves a terribly empty feeling.			"

												First Of All This Game İs Great And Will Tell You some of This Games Mechanics  of them i dont wanna make this review long so you can read it and buy it dx So        Story: The story is about a Brown bear,Rat,Wolf And A Bunny. These Characters are realesed to the Armello  with a couple of villages,magical temples,etc. these animals are advanturing it and find resources and fighting for the victory. And There is a Lion King On A Castle protected by guards roaming the every part of the castle. you can get Prestige by capturing villages The Prestige Leader can Do Some Events At Dawn  And The Graphics. Graphics are neat and designed for the game i dont really mind graphics but it does look great for a kind of game like this..   i would give this game a 9.90/10 i would reccomend you to buy it  its a fun game in my opinion. And A Short Note: this game's Multiplayer is TIME EATER in a good way for me. it just took my 3 hours on this games beatiful multiplayer game. if you want your 3 hours to be on a multiplayer too. Just Buy İt Peace Everyone love you!			"

												I honestly think this should have been implemented as a boardgame rather than an actual video game.  Give the King more usability and one person can play the King, the guards, and bane. The other (1-3) players could then seek out the throne.Note: 2.9 hours = Tutorial and 1 game..It's a very long process.Sidenote: If you thought Monopoly was long, drawn out, and boring after a while, just wait until you play Armello!

												Game is dope as hell. Probably the best tutorial to what otherwise is a very confusing game. Sells the tone and characters of the world really well. The tutorial itself is a promising experience and I don't think I've thought that about any game ever.The game is really everything that's promised on the back of the box. The paths to victory are satisfyingly Machiavellian. The card mechanics run deep. I am over the moon for this game, very happily surprised.A few things do feel ""missing"". This game is far from incomplete, it's all there and it's good - but there are a few things I couldn't help noticing are just not there:1. A mini-map. While the board looks lovely and you can zoom out a fair distance, I found myself constantly scanning through the environment trying to find my own character. It's impossible to see at-a-glance where other players or where important map features are.2. Prestige should pass over or at least account for fugitive status. As I was attacking the king to kill him, he turned to me as the prestige leader to make the new decree. It was an odd moment between us. Thematically it just doesn't make sense. Might seem nitpicky but I need a mini-map for this game. The game itself alreaady plays on something like a cupcake compared to Civ or even Starcraft, but I need an even smaller version of that.			"

												Originally I backed this project as soon as I heard of it with much excitement well over a year ago,  and now that I've gotten to play it, I must say it simply feels unfinished, or entirely disappointing for what it was promised to be, in some ways.The art is.. alright, and the sound is less than what I expected it to be. The gameplay is fun and charming in a niche way the first, second, and third time around - and then it gets to be repetitive and extremely predictable. The games in my opinion feel rushed and offers a very low skillcap, with much of your progress based on luck. I hope sincerely that content patches bring this game forward by leaps and bounds because as it stands now, it is not worth what I paid for it I'm sorry to say. From the gamebreaking multiplayer bugs, lackluster texture work and general underwhelming game size, this feels more like a free to play title.I can't wholeheartedly recommend buying the game, because it's simply asking too much to pay $20 for what feels like a game that took two or three months to make (And I have the developer experience to know what work goes into these things.)

												This game is Awesome graphics wise, and it has an awesome idea! But it dose have some draw backs. For one I beat the game in an hour or less. Personally I would have liked it if the game was a bit more like a cross between Game of Thrones and civilization. I feel like if I had been conquering cities and building armies to try and take the central city it would have been far more intense and a lot more satisfying. With that I would like to point out that battles between the heroes very underwhelming. It did not seem very punishing when you lost a fight with another hero, and in return it wasnt as fufilling when you beat the other heroes, because they just came back.So basically this game has massive potential and has a lot of good things going for it, but I feel like it is falling a bit short.

												I absolutely hate this, but I can not recomend this wonderful fun game. Game breaking bugs online after all this time should not be normal. I have had multiple times where the game would get to the next to last turn and now it is stuck on card selection for one of the players. You can't do anything. You just waisted an hour and a half of your time only to be so disapointed when you or a friend was likely to win and intstead no one wins. All 4 players just sit there emoting each other for 20 minutes until people start exiting that are tired of trying to wait it out. This is the most game breaking bug I have hit. I have also had problems with lag where sometimes it will take a full 1 to 2 minutes on battle screens before cards show up and someone is allowed to do anything and I had a time where the end of turn buttons disapeared for everyone. Again...I love playing this game...but it needs fixxed. These bugs need fixxed before more overly expensive cosmetic dlcs are put on the store heh.			"

												I wanted to love this, because the concept is one I appreciate. I bought it for myself and family members so we could play something interactive online together while chatting on coms. The graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, if limited in the variety it offers. If you ever wanted an interactive 3D board game (think Jumanji, minus actual tropical diseases) this is what Armello aspires to be. Sadly there's a bug that resets all the items you unlock (vital to competitive gameplay and achievements) that happens to Mac users. Customer support seemed unmotivated to address this problem, though they're aware of it. Despite having multiple complains issued with proof (logs and unlocked achievements) that it exists, they're not actively working on a solution. I'd love to support further expansions, but the lackluster support is disheartening.			"

												If you want a pretty game that's a charming diversion you can (possibly) play with friends, you might like it.If you like board games, but don't care too much about balance or attention to design details, you might like it.If you like the idea that there's an absolute limit to the number of turns possible in one game, you might like it.I do not fit into any of these categories, so I find it horribly frustrating. I gave it SO MANY chances to keep me interested (hence a played time that I now find rather depressing), but I've finally realized that this will never be a game that I'm happy to be playing.(Also regarding that played time: Many of those hours were spent trying to obtain random dice drops, yet another supremely annoying feature that I now despise. Believe me when I tell you that those were not hours of enjoyment, but rather hours of tedium spent trying to obtain something that I'm not even sure why I ever wanted in the first place.)The game will never be balanced, as there are a couple of ridiculously overpowered paths you can take that may not absolutely guarantee victory, but they will definitely boost your chances. This is a problem to such an extent that some players will quit a multiplayer game if someone else takes the overpowered hero(es) before they get a chance to grab the one they want.The luck factor doesn't bother me as much as it does some people, but it is pretty strong, so if you hate games that are often decided by random events, you'll want to steer well clear of this one.One of the worst design problems is the ""rich get richer"" effect that plagues so many games created by amateur developers. What may start out as a small gap in power will invariably spiral out of control as the more powerful character just gets more and more bonuses while the one who suffered a bit of bad luck at first will simply never catch up. If you happen to be that unlucky player, the rest of the game becomes a demoralizing torture session.The game was fine for a while, I suppose, and I'm glad I got to play it and see what it's like. But at this point, I'm just so sick of it all, it hard to imagine ever wanting to play it again. Maybe I can recoup the cost of the game by selling all these stupid dice.			"

What has me giving it a thumbs down is the disconnects.  To play a 30 minute game to just for it to break.  Or to be 3 moves from winning and to find out that the game has locked on you is just frustrating and game breaking form where I stand.  No point in putting time in a game that can just freeze at any moment.  Until they fix it my review is going tostay negative.			"

												The basic game design is fun, more's the pity because it's sunk by several flaws and mind boggling design decisions.So the AI is terrible, which would be fine, because it's meant to be a tabletop game.  The kind you pull out and play with your friends on a Friday night, but unless you have a ton of friends who own the game you will be playing with strangers...strangers you can't talk to...because the designers think that if they implement in game chat it would need to be moderated.  So great, playing a table top with tons of strangers that I can't even talk to, besides saying one of about 12 preset phrases.Theoretically, you can get around this by adding people as your steam freinds, but if you want to carry on a converstation you will have to alt-tab out of the game constantly to use steam chat.  Imagine having to put your tabletop game back into it's box every time you want to say something other than one of the 12 things the game developers thought of for you.  To make a titanically poor decision even worse, the responses are ""personalized"" to the characters, so something like ""well played"" or *laughs* can come off kind of snarky depending on who you're using.  Think one of the other players in the game is nice, or skilled or fun to play with despite the fact that you can barely communicate with them?  Well, hope you memorized their name and they know who you are, because there's no in game friend requesting.  So basically you have the choice between playing with the mind-numblingly bad AI or waiting 5 minuites for your turn to come around while playing with a much more intellegent human, who serves as a proxy for a better AI because you can't really interact with them.  If that's not enough to put you in a straight jacket, the game ends with a summary of your accomplishments using cute little badges for things you accomplished in game.  ""What things?"" You might ask.  Nobody knows; they aren't described anywhere inside the game or any of it's accompanying material, but since they are just for bragging rights, and there's no bragging (due to the lack of a chat function and the fact that when you finish you get dumped into the lobby with a new batch of strangers) I guess it kind of makes a perverse sort of sense, it just makes me completely indifferent to earning these things, since I have no idea what they are.  To be fair you can kind of guess at some of them, but others are completely opaque, still with no background it's never like, ""Wow so and so captured 8 cities!"" it's more like, ""We all captured cities but so and so edged us out maybe, I can't really tell here, but it kind of sounds like it.  He might as well be an ultra slow AI and I'll never see him again anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.""The final critique I have of the game is that the king will mostly die on his own before you can fight him.  This makes the ending extremely anticlimatic.  Even if it ends in a battle, it will be more like an epic hero bulling a 1-3 hp enemy.  I wish you could turn off the constant life drain, at least in the house rules, but alas another opportunity missed.Sadly, Armello is a solid game with good mechanics and a clever use of the digital board game format.  If I was sitting in the development studio working out the bugs, or playing in a focus group with three other people I would be having a blast, but sitting in my room throwing canned responses into the ether or alt tabbing out and slowing the game down for everyone so I can carry on a conversation completley kills the fun.  It feels kind of like playing Settlers of Catan with a house rule that anyone who speaks has to discard all their sheep.			"

												In all honesty, i have a neutral stand on Armello. Pros: Great way to bond, through co-op/trucesPretty aesthetic, kinda has a civ vibe to itFurries, rats are my personal faveBrings in profit through transmoging diceGood time waster, if neededRNG, some people are gamblersCons: Limited speech, im aware that its to keep down toxicity and whatnot, but imo more options are neededRNG, some people are screwed over by itBad patching/support service, usually when theres an issue, the dev(s) or other community members tell you to do the same thing over and over, even if it doesnt help the issueA tad overpriced dlc, $10 for 4heros and 2 good-ish ringsThe key-to-chest ratio isnt even, and most dont know how its determinedQueueing is a pain, a lot of people decline, or dont pick a hero, and after 1-5 minutes of waiting, most want to just go play something else			"

												Gonna have to say is mostly good game, I have never been so mad as a result of rng screwing me over, every game is so random, you build a stratagy, but it rarely will matter because something will go wrong, even a few rounds before the match ends, it is still very unclear who will win regardless of how well anyone played, on player maybe favored but is still unclear who will win. Communists making videos, not cool. My parents grandpapa didn't fight in 'nam for this. He fought for games that take skill like call of duty, lol jk he fought for Halo. <insert overly sensitive child into the comments>.Jokes aside the RNG does not add fun for me, only takes away from it, probs would be fun w/ fri3nds, but I don't have those, going back LOL to trigger some trash adc by feeding.

												Tried it and returned it. The game take way too ling for what it is. You spend most of the time ""Playing"" waiting for it to be your turn. And they way the dice work in the game make it way too random. I really wanted to like this game. And I playing the tutorial got me really excited for the full game. But needless to say I did not make it through on full game and I was issuesd a refund.			"

												Gorgeous aesthetics & cool premise can't conceal the fact that this is, at heart, a hollow Random Number Generator. Strategy? Planning? Risk? Forget about those -- it all comes down to that RNG. And you can pretty much count on one hand the number of times it will favor you over the AI. I literally had one quest i could not complete because no matter how many times I attempted it (at last count it was ~40 attempts) the die always came up in the computer's favor. Even when I burned as many of the ""right"" dice as I could find. Add to that a cluttered interface, vague instructions/directions, and the fact that enemy turns take FOREVER while your own can go by in 30 seconds*... Well, I'd say this is a game to miss. It's a shame because, again, the art and music are GORGEOUS and the premise is downright nifty, but this probably should have been an RPG or a deeper, more skill/strategy-based RTS of some sort. As it stands, it just feels like a wasted opportunity and a case of serious ""style over substance.""*At the end of one turn, for instance, I left, took a shower, changed into new clothes, fed the cat, and came back to find that it was ALMOST my turn again. Seriously.			"

												Never before have I seen a game so wholly devoted to frustrating you.The good things about this game? It's pretty, the system seems very inviting, and the game makes it seem as though there are a number of different strategies and paths to victory.But here's the thing. There's no difficulty setting. The AI will always prioritize attacking and interfering with you over choices that would win them the game. And no matter how many dice you have, what sort of cards and equipment you use, and what path you take, you are 100% at the mercy of RNG. The truth is that the only semi-reliable way to win is through prestige. Using Spirit Stones is possible, especially if you boost your AP and get lucky with your quests or dungeon searching. Slaying the king? No matter what you try, there's a crazy amount of RNG needed to even come close; if you die, you lose, and if you deal just too little damage, you'll also lose.And do not get me started on the Rot victory. I've tried for more than ten hours purely attempting to get it, and it's almost impossible. How amusing they lock the only tiny piece of help for that victory path behind the requirement that you have gotten that victory path first.Long story short, no matter how experienced, strategic, or lucky you may be, this game is entirely RNG. Maybe this'd be better in multiplayer where people behave rationally, but it's highly unlikely given the imbalance between victory methods. So unless you're looking for a game with a similar amount of control and personal influence as LIFE or Sorry!, this is not your game.			"

												I saw great promise in Armello when it was first launched on Kickstarter--so much so, that I became an immediate backer of the project. I actively followed its development and, as an early backer, was able to have hands-on time with the early access versions of the game before its launch. Armello has now been released as a completed product for the masses, but despite really wanting to like Armello, I must be honest and say that I feel lukewarm overall.As a note, I am a fan of Euro-style board games (IE: Catan, Carcassonne, Terra Mystica, etc.) where strategy plays a larger role in determining victory. Player tactics in these sorts of board games are what make them more involving, although, sometimes at the cost of a higher learning curve. Armello falls closer towards the opposite end of the spectrum and positions itself as a more casual and family friendly style of board gaming (IE: Risk, Monopoly, LIFE, etc.) where luck plays in tandem with a light layer of strategy.Armello, however, leans its gameplay tactics a bit too much on luck. Randomization and dice rolls are a significant portion of the games mechanics and include: Randomized card draws Randomized quest locations Randomized outcomes for quest items Randomized dungeon exploration outcomes Randomized spawning of banes and spirit stones Dice rolls for battle outcomes Dice rolls for peril outcomesAs a result, whatever semblance of strategy a player attempts in Armello is unfortunately negated a great majority of the time. The most well laid of plans will be foiled due to mere chance, not an opponent's cunning. I hope that subsequent updates can improve and address the strategic involvement, but as it stands, Armello is currently only good for the occasional, light-hearted game. I have a feeling it will resonate with those who are expecting it to be as such, but for those players expecting a board game that involves deep strategization and tactics, I recommend looking elsewhere or sticking to the tried and true classics.Edit: I have replayed this recently after multiple patches. Armello remains more of a luck-based board game rather than a strategy-based board game. To be clear, this is not to say that Armello does not have strategic elements. It does, but it is in rather light doses. Most of the action involves mitigating uncontrollable circumstances arising from luck. Again, if you are more fond of Euro-style board games like I am, then this is not the game for you. However, it is perfect fun as a casual board game.			"

												I don't know if the RNG in this game is really bad, or if I am just getting really unlucky. I have played four games so far and all but one of them were aweful. The first one wasn't to bad since I just thought I didn't know what I was doing. The second one, I lost every single combat encounter I had. I thougt that it was because I was playing a less combat focused charater, so I switched to one in the third game.In the third game, I still lost every single combat encounter. On top of that, the quests give you two options when you get to them. Take the stat bonus and prestige from the quest, or go for an item on top of that at the risk of loosing health. Three times the game said I had a 50/50 chance, and every single time I lost.In my fourth, and final, game I chose the most combat centric character possible. In the first few turns I failed to kill a character with three health, failed a quest that I had a 70% chance of getting the bonus from, then was promptly killed by the three health character. The thing that made this even more painful was the fact that I rolled seven dice each time that I fought that character, my opponent only rolled four, I had two guaranteed attacks, and I had six health at the time due to a spell I played the previous turn.Again, this could just be me having terrible luck, but I feel like after four games in a row it has to be the RNG.

												Very pretty and visually stunning. But I'm left bored and wanting more after only a few games. It's very slow paced yet quickly gets tiring waiting for your turn to finally roll around after watching everyone else make their moves across the board. Meanwhile you struggle to play your cards because either you can't afford them until a few turns later or because the camera is moving and darting around so much that it won't let you, and you can't even zoom out to see where everyone else is in relation to you because the board is covered in thick fog. I rushed into buying this thinking there would be a 'story' or at least some sort of a plot, voice acting and a few cut scenes, but alas there isn't any of that at all, and that's what I dislike the most about this game.

What id like is for those races to be released to the public even if its a form of DLC like Sylas and Twissall in all it s a decent game but dont waste money on anything else. any game to refuses to release full content to people who buy it and pander to donaters isnt really a game worth sinking extra money into.

												TLDR.:Imagine what you would want from a game that costs 20 euros. You wont get that.This game is average at best. Graphics don't sell a game for me. So why did I buy it. My friends said it was ""fun"".(its not)Pros:-It has a nice look/atmosphere and character design.-On off-turn(when its not your turn) you can still play cards. Which gives you a chance to zone opponents and secure your position with scouting cards etc.Cons.:-It's slow af.-20 euros. For basicly one gamemode.-RANDOM not in a good way. Cards you get, buffs you get, dices you get. This wouldn't be bad if the gameplay wasnt so slow!- The only thing thats certain is spells.-Solo game might as well be multi player. Rounds don't become faster or more fun.-There is no chat so your interaction with other players is limited to pre-written messages.(so again might as well play bot games)-It doesnt compete with other games/genre. In ANY aspect I can think of.Explanation:-Planning on buying with friends? Get teamspeak or skype.(but then AGAIN you might as well just play any other coop game on steam and use skype while doing it)-You want a board game? Buy The Settlers of Catan. Its an actual boardgame with solid game design elements that doesnt make 80% of the game an RNG fest. Not to mention the actual fun you guys can have while hanging out(in real life)-Want an adventure game?Choose any... ANY from steam's libary.-Want a strategy game?Im pretty sure steam has you covered with that as well.Lets compare two games that both cost 20 euros.Rocket League: gameplay: A beautiful learning curve where its easy to get started with, but hard to master. Next to skillful play you need on the spot strategic analysis to position better.Gamemodes: has multiple gamemodes(of ranked and casual) and several training types to help you get better.Quite a number of cars with each a bunch of customisation options. And flags.Im pretty sure i left some things out but you get the idea.Armello:tutorial: an annoying♥♥♥♥♥point and cilck tutorial. its just text and click where we tell you nowhere else.(horrible design) you wanna know what would have been better pm me.gameplay: get cards, do quests or collect stones or kill oponents or kill wraiths. for these things you get points(except for stone collecting) and if the king dies from the curse(so non player interaction) the game ends. guy with most points win. or if you slay the king you win.. mediocre afgamemodes: story mode that is as annoying as the tutorial so you can assume i didnt finnish.The rest is just the boardgame(randomly generated...must have been hard to program)you get 8 characters 2 per clan so 4 clans. but the game is so random it doesnt matter which one you pick. pick bears. get hp and ""spell fuel"" and you're set..You're paying for average game design, a bunch of gorgeous 3D sprites and card artwork.I know its an unfair comparrison but hey. Life is unfair and theyre both 20 euros so deal with it.This is an average boardgame. but hey.. HAS NICE GRAPHICS!!!Im pretty sure if you skype with your friends it might be a fun game. But as of now, this is as meh as it gets.. 5/10ps.: buy it if you want to play as a sweet little bunny..			"

												First, I am terrible at writing. Most of my reviews are not very well written, so don't expect J.R.R. Tolkinesk embelishments. I have been playing this game since it came out quite some time ago and have lavishly enjoyed playing it! I have a fondness of games with animals in them and this is no exception. In fact, it has been a joy to engage in this fun little computerized board game. I really like the ""Disney"" quality animation with the charaters and the beautiful set up of the ""board"" landscape. It is very intuitive and you can easily learn the game play very quickly! Especially when you start it with playing the ""Prologue"" which helps teach you the movements and plays from the point of each of the four main characters. To sum Armello up, it's exactly what I mentioned above; a board game. Not a RPG like The Elder Scrolls games or World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy game series, eventhough it has some RPG-like game play. The character you play is a computer animated game peice you play. It moves a certain amount of board spaces and interacts with whatever is in that board space it lands in. Addition, like a boardgame, it is random. It gives you a random set of cards and a random set of plays and no two plays are alike. You have dice that you roll for your battles or for removing ""Perils"" that you enter into. The cards, also, give you some leverage if you have the right cards in your hand. The type of cards that you recieve are by chance and you can never tell what types (in the three tiers that you can select) of cards you will be given when you pick them. If you get to challenge the King you have three types of victories you can perform. They are ""Battle,""""Spirit,"" and ""Rot."" There is one more type of victory you can obtain without challenging the King and that is a ""Prestige"" victory. As far as I have played this game, a Prestige victory is the easiest to obtain, while the Rot victory is the hardest. With that, the game is awesome a lot of fun to play. The AI of the ""Heros"" that you don't play is (in my opinion) astounding. They act as if they are run by an individual person because their moves are so unpredictable. They can attack or choose what to do as if they had a true mind and conciousness of their own! The board's artwork is stunningly gorgious and the changes of the day and seasons are nice additions. The UI is, also, very intuitive and can easily be manuvered. So far, I have not found a ""con"" I can think of that I can even mention against Armello. For those with families, the game is definitely very family friendly. No blood or gore in the game at all. Which is a nice reprieve from games that do.All in all I find this game a real treasure and hope that the company can make it even better and, hopefully they can create a sequil. The game creators have been working very hard to add new features to the game. The DLC ""The Usurpers"" is out now and is actully a fine add-on to the game with four new characters to choose to play as well as some additional items. This game will definitely end up a classic!

												It's a pretty game, but for the price you get more content out of Undertale and more of a story. Once you play threw everything there isn't even a map change. It's the same game over and over again. It seams like it's lacking a good old fashion story mode. And if it has one it shouldn't be hidden. :/Seriously for the money- go buy Undertale you'll get much more time and playthrew for less money.			"

												The art for this game is beautiful and inspired.  That being said, the game quickly becomes repetitive for me.  Do not buy this game expecting to be introduced to a whole new fantasy world.  It is more of a board game.  That might be fine for you, but I regret the purchase.			"

												Rabbits, Rats, Wolves and Bears battling against each other to kill the King!! Armello takes place in a beautiful fantasy setting with wonderful weather and lighting effects. It truly is a wonder to behold. I won’t mention so much about the graphics in this game as it is plain to see from videos and screenshots that only a fool would dispute how especially nice this game looks!


YouTube™ Video: Armello 

			Views: 227		

			Last few minutes of a multiplayer game (One AI player due to bad loser!)		

Armello is far from style over substance. The games mechanics, whilst they may take some time to digest fully, are as beautiful as the game looks. Don’t be fooled by the fairy-tale appearance, its gameplay is far more sinister! Players will be poisoning, stabbing, stealing from, reaping revenge and a whole list of other mischievous acts upon their opponents.The acts are carried out by the cards in a player’s hand, or they can be played to hexes on the board or you can just outright attack another player. The Kings guard can also attack players if they upset the King and monsters (Banes) roam the land attacking nearby players.As I mentioned before the objective is to kill the King and the first person to do this wins, if no one manages it before the King dies (I forgot to mention that he isn’t very well!) then the “prestige” leader wins. Prestige is accumulated in a variety of ways including killing other players, the Banes, etc.I’m not going to go in depth into the rules here. The game offers a tutorial, which I found helped a little but going in blind I was quite confused by the end. On the main menu there is also a “Game Guide” that is worth reading as well. Hopefully after that things should be a bit clearer. I gave up twice trying to learn the game due to not understanding the tutorial, then a friend played a game with me using VOIP and it all became clear!I am so glad I persevered. I must say that I haven’t met any example of a board game, either physical or digital that encapsulates so much. If you have any interest at all in turn-based games or even better board games specifically, Armello could become your new obsession! Heed that as a warning if anything!Player numbers are pretty good, you can usually find an online four player game within a couple of minutes. Sometimes it may take a little longer, which isn’t bad considering each match will take around 60-90 minutes.The developers decided to not include in-game chat which I think is a bad decision. Their reasoning behind this is because a few people will troll and insult others. Yes, this is a sad fact of the world and especially the internet but that’s what mute buttons were invented for (well maybe not originally!). The lack of chat means learning the intricacies of the game will take a bit longer and developing friendships with other Armello players may never happen from within the game. Which I think is a shame.Anyhow, that’s enough time away from Armello typing this review up! I’m gonna go find myself another match and hope I can be the one to topple the king this time!!			"

												I bought this game quite a while ago, and decided to try it again recently. I don't know what the problem is, but 3 out of my last 6 games the game has just stopped - as though it's waiting for something to happen before any further moves can be made, often on an AI's turn. since the games take as long as 20 minutes, this is extremely annoying, and I although I enjoy the game immensely until this all-too common bug is resolved I can't reccomend buying it.

												This may be an excellent game for many different people, but it's definitely not for me.It's really a tabletop board game with almost everything decided by dice rolls and RNG.  Too much of the game is decided by RNG and 50/50 coin flips.The positives of the game can be found in many other reviews, although I feel like I got suckered in when I read there was a great background story.  The tutorial is sufficient and includes some background, but there's not much of any true story.			"

												The setting is interesting, and it looks nice, but.... this is a short game that's incredibly luck based, which makes it extremely frustrating.  Drawing cards and rolling dice determine most of the game and the results are completely random--you could get some really amazing gear, or some really useless spells (or visa versa)The problem is the randomness,  It doesn't make the game fair, it makes it frustrating, and you end up having a pretty huge chance of failing most of the quests unless you pass on having rewards for half the game.Its almost a really good game, but it needs some tweaking to improve the player agency.  Definitely feels like a visually polished board game, but the frustration level is too high.			"

												Waste is the first word I think about when talking about Armello. Graphics are amazing, some ideas are great, and I really love the char design and the differents characters. But the game is almost entirely based upon luck. And the worse kind of luck, the one that comes after you thought you strategy and messes up everything you've prepared. All in all, it's not a bad game for those who love RNGesus. If you're more of a Risk or a Monopoly player, Armello is for you. But if for you the perfect boardgame are Diplomacy or Caelus, don't waste your time.			"

												I played this game for one hour, and I didn't even finish the tutorial. The gameplay was too slow for me, and I enjoy turn based strategy games like King's Bounty and XCOM. It was my fault for buying the game without looking at gameplay videos first. The intro video and the game description had everything I was looking for, yet I still didn't enjoy it because it didn't capture my interest during the first hour of gameplay. I hear it is a lot more fun in multiplayer, but then again almost all games are more fun in multiplayer. Anyways, hope others enjoy it more than I did.			"

												I don't know how to contact the developers, so I'm writing this review. I'm going to focus on the interface and presentation. IMPORTANT: The netplay is terrible. If you disconnect AT ALL from a game, even a private one, ther's no way to re-enter, and you're replaced with a CPU immediately. As far as I know, there's no suspend save for single player or turn-a-day type options for multiplayer, or a hot-seat mode. Some people might expect this kind of stuff from digital board games, but you won't get it here.tldr: Is this game bad or good? I don't know. But it gives me eye strain. If the logistics on getting a refund for a 4-pack weren't so complicated, I'd ask for a refund in a heartbeat.Edit: I've played a few games now. It passes the time. It's hard to recommend at a 20 dollar price, though. It feels even more random than Betraryal in the House on the Hill or something, and the pace is glacial. That's not a good combo.Text is very small and in a hard to read, cheesy fantasy font. In particular, the log at the bottom of the screen is piteously small. The default view on the board is sooo zoomed in (I can't find a way to zoom out), but visual elements like the log, gamepieces, and dialogue boxes are TINY! I don't understand it. You can only see about 2-4 whole hexagonal spaces around your character on a huge map.Gamepieces for resources aren't differentiated dramatically enough by color to be immediately recognizable (blue-indigo and purple-blue for two of your main resources at night? really?), and the iconography is weak (hard to differentiate at a glance: squire, body, and fame pieces, in that order, are like a gradient of shape similarity; the silhouettes for most all resources are overly complex).The way things like skill rolls and dice rolls are presented are very weak. They're not very satisfying; the animations move in an unexpressive, constant rate, and the sound effects are soft and unimpactful. Skill rolls show each success and failure result by arranging 10 game pieces in a circle. Each piece fades rapidly until one is left. There is no anticipation; it happens waaaaaay too fast, and the rate of disappearance is constant, even up to the last result. Oh, and dice rolls. It's like they're being thrown in anti-gravity. And the sounds... ugh. So soft and muffled. It's like if you dropped dice onto a stiff pillow. The smallest windowed resolution is too big to even be functional for the highest recommended fullscreen resolution; seemingly, a huge oversight. This is because many important buttons and a lot of game information are at the very bottom and corners of the screen, and these are inaccessible and blocked from view with a Windows 10 taskbar in front of them. It's impossible to play this game in a window with a monitor under ~1600x900.And the graphics are... they have this very fun, colorful, emotionally impacting animated intro in the trailer. The card art is great. Why does the game itself have soft lighting and eye-burningly low color contrast? Seriously, at night, the only two colors that exist are dark blue and dark green-blue. It's ridiculous. On top of making it hard to see, there are many more expressive ways to express night-time through color. Even though the resolution I'm playing at is the exact resolution of my monitor, the board looks all blurry. It's hideous. Not everything benefits from low-grade bloom lighting! To compare this game's visuals outside of card-art to a Ghibli film is a massive insult to Ghibli.So yeah, even though it has pretty art assets, it fails on most ways a board game can fail in visual design.

												So What can I say about this game so I'll just start with my issues with the games 'features'-Easy to play, hard to master: Which is just another way of saying luck decides the winner. No matter how hard you try and outwit your enemy no matter how far you're in the lead one bad dice roll at a critical moment and you lose the game just like that. There really is only 2 valid strategies for each character which in turn is just different executions of the same two win conditions, either kill the king or drag the game out in what is in all essence winning by default or through cowardice( getting an early prestige lead and play keep away until someones low on health). The third win condition which is to clense the king is PURE luck that you get 4 stones before he dies of rot.-It's so called fast and thoughtful gameplay is lacking in both departments. With the amount of luck that the game is based on a 'thoughtful' strategy could just be crossing your fingers and hope the king doesn't B.S. his way into killing you. The game is no way fast-paced with 4 players each getting two turns a day before the king loses 1 health, if by fast paced they ment you constantly get killed because many things are out of control( which is why strategy is weak).-Multiply playable Heroes: but you don't get all the playable heroes unless you kickstarted the game $55, I would've been fine if the Heroes were just alternate skins of the 8 your given, but they aren't they are unique heroes just like the base ones, which is absolutely infuriating when they plan to add the 4 later as payed dlc. To put this in perspective its the same as a fighting game releasing with 12 characters, but 4 are only accessible if you preorder for twice the price of the game and they become dlc later in the year, but were on disc at the launch so you're just being baited into paying more for the rest of the game.Their physics-based dice look nice at first but like actual dice they will fall off the play area and you only know about the reroll at the last minute.The world of the board game is bland which makes sense for a board game, but when people try to call this an rpg, and a turn-based strategy it's like getting slapped in the face.In the long and narrow of this review: if they can actually make the game develop into something where luck isn't the omni-present factor to the game. I might get a second look at the game.			"

												Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely LOVE the concept of the game.  It's a table top trading card game that also utilizes turn-based real time strategy.  What's not to love if you're into that sort of thing?Here's why I gave the game a no:The complete random chance.You can have a game going perfectly.  Everything is in your favor down to a T.  And then one player will draw 2-3 spell cards, spam you down and you lose with no hope of ever recovering.Or even better, you play a character such as Zosha who has a very low base health and make it to your first quest in the game halffway through.There's virtually no flow to the game.  You either get extremely lucky or you are bombarded by asinine amounts of bad luck.  You can barely commit to any of the four victory options, as the chances of succeeding at three of the four is dictated by chance. The music is good.  Sound effects?  Great.  The general balance of mechanics?  Awesome.  But the insane potential to have any amount of work you do, especially in one hour or longer PvP games undone by simple RNG is too frustrating to take this game seriously.			"

												Great idea, but filled with quite a few bugs. The most annoying is the audio bug where the game audio will completely turn off randomly, and won't come back until you restart the game. It's been reported several times from several people but so far they have not acknowledged it.The dev team's refusal to correct the zoomed out display is really odd. The view is zoomed in too far to see what is happening around you, and many spells will have ranges far outside of that view. When you try to zoom out, it only goes out a little bit, and lays a fog layer over the entire screen so you can't actually see what is happening. This is something that people complained about during development and since release, and the dev response was they didn't want people to play in that view, and something about 'meta-gaming'. This is a board game, you should be able to see the entire board at once. All of the information is available at default view if you manually scroll around the board, so this makes no sense.. keeping this UI limit in place only serves to irritate some players. There is absolutely no meta-gaming that can happen from changing this, because any player can see everything on the board if they manually scroll the map.			"

												My boyfriend has never allowed me to play board games at home, as he doesn’t want me to touch his precious ‘mint condition’ collection. However when I saw Armello, I decided to take a chance and buy it (goodbye savings account!). Once I learnt how to play, the clacking sound of rolling die has enabled me to experience REAL LIFE BOARD GAMING SCENARIOS through MY COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!   I can happily say that this game has satisfied all my urges to play board games. My boyfriend is not pleased with Armello as he believes it stops me from making him sandwiches on a day to day basis, but in the words of River, “HAH!” He should have let me play his board games in the first place.

												Gorgeous looking game and artwork. However, I find its gameplay not intuitive, at all. The lack of an ingame tutorial is really frustrating and left me confused at how or what to do in the first place, as the game threw me right in. Hence it was more fumbling, trying and failing than reallyplaying it. And no, I don't want or have to need to read a whole game's wiki or ingame game guide to understand the gameplay and the basic mechanics of it. That is not good design, imo and why the devs left out a (skippable) tutorial will always be a mystery to me. The slow pace of the game turns isn't helping here as well. Making one turn takes a minute for yourself, but afterwards you are reduced to watch the other AI players, guards and banes for a couple of minutes, which is really NOT fun at all, I have played it for almost two hours now and yet have not reached the round of the king dying due to everyone and their uncle on the board making their turns in real time. This is not only slow, but already reaching into the tedious category.   I might return to this game to a later time since I love its design and general idea, but for now this first impression has left a too bad taste in my mouth to continue playing it.			"

												At first i liked the game, funny game. But still i do have to not suggest it to other players. It is TO much luck based. Sometimes bad rolling is no problem, but after 4 games of utter bad dice rolling (12 vs 4 dice losing frequently), it felt like just a luck game. Tactics are a bit important, but eventually it's to much luck.Luck on the cards you get, Luck on the encounters, Luck on the dice rolling.So if you like casino games, this game is for you. If you like a bit more tacticsgame you should pass this tittle.			"

												This is a very clever, very pretty game. The problem is, it's not actually much fun to play.Armello is essentially a computer moderated board game, in the style of a card-driven-narrative game, like Arkham Horror. And like many games in this style, you just kind of fumble through a story, without having much control over it, or without an over-arching plot coming together.The story of Armello is supposed to be a race for the throne among four contendors. But what you actually do as you play is run from quest to quest, with each quest (and all the other action in the game) being settled by randomization elements which feel barely more strategic than a coin flip. All the rich details the game designers poured so much time into have little outcome on the game, or your tactical decisions as you play.			"

												Like the concept of this game, but the gameplay is bad.  Too much randomness for a strategy game.  You can't zoom out to see the board (this is like playing chess and only being able to see 1/4 of the board at a time!).  Do not recommend purchasing.  I wish I could get my money back.			"

												I'm putting a 'no' in the reccomendation for this game, even though I like it very much.The reason for that is I feel like the game as it stands at release feels like an easy-mode, or intro-difficulty map, and that there should be more maps to progress into.As others have said before, many of this game's aspects are top notch: the music, the card art, the production value of taking each action, and the list goes on.  Even with all of that though, the gameplay experience is so similar each time you play that it gets too repetitive far too fast.Most games have easy maps/levels to start out with, and progress into larger, more complex, and more immersive worlds to play around in as you get farther and gain more experience on how to formulate strats to win.  Sadly, Armello has but one map, and it feels pretty homogenous each playthrough.I could see potential though through DLC expansions or future content additions.  I believe a key to making this a truly great game would be larger maps with a wider variety of tiles and an increased number of action points.  Different maps could have different sets of win conditions, and different events at the start of day and night.   A wider tile variety would be something that could be done with each map, as different areas would have their own tiles unique to that map, and that along with map variation (either choose the map or play one at random) could give players a chance to better customize which type of experience they want each game, and give each playthough a fresh feel.  I know this sounds like a tall order, and maybe even a project for Armello 2 instead of add-ons here, but the point I'm trying to make is that this game has the potential to be great.  Wheather it acheives that potential is up to the developers, and us in helping to fund them.			"

												Way too luck based, simple as that. I understand it's a board game essentially, with cards and dice. However the element of strategy is too small, there are times when people get 4 spirit stones literally by turn 4 based on nothing but pure chance, then manage to enter the palance on their first try based again on pure chance. That is an example of how now matter how good you are at the game it's ultimatley pure RNG to the max.			"

												I was so excited when I'd first seen promotional materials for Armello a long time ago. The art is beautiful, and the characters are lots of fun. Unfortunately, the mechanics themselves are just layer and layer of random draws. The cards you draw have symbols that may or may not be what you need to match Perils you encounter. The dice rolls don't add up, so there's no interesting bell curve. The AI feels pretty random as well.In the end it feels like there's not a lot of strategy you can bring to bear (heh); it's just riding the luck train and seeing what happens to you.			"

												The game has a strong snowball effect - where the ones that do good do even better, so if someone has a good start they are hard to stop. Additionally the randomness of cards/exploring is pretty high and you can't plan a lot.In my opinion it's better to spend that cash on a real board game.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased this game because I love table-top games, and the world that this game looked like it was a rich. I was very disappointed. This is not a good game at this point in development.First, it just is not very much fun. The quests are just checks on your character stats. Each has the possibility of an extra reward, but it only comes down to luck if you get that reward or not. But it's not like there is some sort of minigame that you have to win in order to beat the quest or get the extra reward.Throughout the game you will encounter other players, but again, there is no skill here except for die rolling. You don't have any way of knowing what weapons and armor the other player possess to help you determine if you are likely to win the battle or not. The ony strategy I saw in this was to attack players low on health.There is no plot. One of the reviews said it was like game of Game of Thrones. Perhaps this would be the case if Game of Thrones was a coloring book. The animations make it look like there is a story here, like when the frog gets kinnapped or the mouse pays the soldier buringing the town. But these animations are illustrations of these mindless ""quests"", which take only a few seconds to stat check.Maybe this game will look better when it is finished, but at this point, I regret the purchase. I downloaded it, played it 4 times thinking I was missing something each time. What I miss is the money I paid for this disappointing game.			"

												I sort of felt like I was playing an overly complicated version of Candyland. Maybe with friends this could be a lot of fun, but it's pretty shallow as a solo experience. Another gripe is that the developers didn't take nearly enough advantage that this is a video game. Everything's handled by dice rolls and card draws. I'm really struggling to recall a real gameplay element that couldn't be replicated in a physical game. The art direction is nice and really pretty for the most part, but the bloom effects were sometimes a little jarring, and I was wondering what the point of the blue fog occasionally blocking my entire vision of the map was. Also, certain animated cards move way too rapidly and are very annoying and distracting on the side of your screen! Why don't they stop moving when you're not hovering over them?!?! I hate to be cruel to something so cute, but these beautiful character designs would fit better elsewhere.			"

												From the trailer and how the game begins, I had the impression that this would be a suspenseful story-driven game, but it isn't. It feels very limited in what you can do, and it became quite boring after a considerably short time. Due to the inability to turn on fast NPC-turns in the prologue, at the end of the prologue I was sitting there and playing on my smartphone while waiting for ever and ever while the wolf and the rat fought against each other again and again... And after the prologue I had to realize that this is the game - there isn't much more to it. So effectively, the prologue just stalled me long enough, so I couldn't get a refund. Also, Steam says that there is full controller support, but the game does not respond to my controller at all.			"

												(This is not exactly a negative review, but more of a ""Meh"" review. This game can be nice for you, and i liked it for quite a while. But if you don't like losing in a game, even if you did very well... then this is not a game for you... and so is Mario Kart. Also, I am not talking about every aspect of the game, just about something that has been bothering me)The fact that each player takes their turn one after the other ruins some of the fun for me. At the beginning of the game it is decided who gets to play their turn first each day/night, for the rest of the game. To me, being first gives you quite a list of advantages that outweights the advantages someone might have, that is last.Here are a couple of scenarios where this bothers me: (Note that to win the game, all you can really do is trying to shift the chances to your favor) - You can win the game by having the most prestige of all players. If there is a tie, the person that got this amount of prestige first, wins. Being first to take your turn generally gives you a better chance at getting this prestige first, giving you a better chance at winning like this in general. - You can win the game by collecting enough spirit-stones and then entering the castle. Spirit-stones will spawn each night in one of the stone-circles. The first person to take the stone gets and keeps the stone, no matter what. If the game decides that you are first overall, you have a better chance at grabbing a spirit stone, since noone else can take their turn before you do.  - The two other ways to win the game need you to kill the king. This is where it doesn't bother me just as much, but it still bothers me. Getting into the castle and killing the king is hard, but once you are inside the caste, it is always possible to kill the king. If you go inside the castle and fail to kill the king, maybe even lowering his health, this leaves a gap that everyone else can use to easily get inside the castle. First off: Being first gives you the chance to kill the king first. And it is ALWAYS possible to do so, even if not very plausible. Second off: If the first person fails to kill the king, the second person now has a good chance at entering the castle. So if you are last, you need to wait for the your turn to use this gap. Given that it takes a full day or night until they can actually enter the castle, you can only really use the gap, if someone else kills the person that's trying to get inside the castle... which can definitely happen. It's just the idea that the odds are against you there that bothers me, but it's not a big problem overall, which is why it doesn't bother me that much.Overall, Armello is really not a game that you should play with the intend to win. The odds can be against you really badly, which wouldn't bother me if a game wouldn't last ~1hour!This game is unfair, and skill won't help you out that much.This only really started bothering be after ~40h of gameplay, and it is still fun to play with friends... especially if you like torturing people. But if you play a game to win it, this is nothing for you.The pure existance of a ""ranked"" gamemode in Armello is just a joke.			"

								Not typically in to strategy games, but Armello totally changed the way I look at them. The art looks fantastic, I love the animated cards (complete with artists names), and the unique playing styles you can choose from. Love what I've played so far and looking forward to what the devs will do with this game. Can't wait!			"

												Like others have said - visually a beautiful game, just not enough else there to keep me interested.  Add in the wait times on other players, lack of non-AI players in multiplayer, and RNG foibles, just not a game for me.  If you're okay with those, then you'll probably like it.I really hate Steam's yes/no rating system - if this were Yelp, I'l give it a decent rating, but this game is too frustrating for me and won't be playing further.

												This game looks amazing. But that's about all it has going for it. The tutorials are pretty much pointless as you can easily grasp the game mechanics just through regular play, however, even with a good understanding of the game mechanics this game is entirely RNG based to the point where it feels like the AI is flat out cheating. The game is horribly slow paced as well, even with ""fast AI battles"" enabled you were still better off just watching the fights so you weren't put to sleep from the mellow music and the soft look of the game.

This game could have been simple with a rich story and simple but addicting gameplay. This is not D&D developer, people do not wanna memorize a million things just to play. If i wanted that i would play a D&D game with friends around a table and be able to have a conversation to break up the dull parts.

								Armello definitely wears its board game lineage on its sleeve, but I would not say it borrows from good board games unfortunately. It's a passable single player affair, moving about the land, gradually growing more powerful, and being largely at the whims of chance. However, I really odn't understand the multiplayer focus of this title. This game has such little player interaction, particularly meaningful player interaction, that it doesn't seem like it'd be a good use of time. I would stay away.On the plus side, this game's production values are quite high. The art and music are wonderful throughout. There are a few UI qualms but for an Early Access title this is a remarkably polished game. I just think it has some fundamental design flaws, unfortunately.			"

												This game is fun and all, rng on the cards, banes, and dice can really screw you over no matter how much thinking and planning you do. I've had a lot of fun hours in this game waiting for them to release the character I've been waiting for, but today found out she was a kickstarter limited reward only... Waiting for them to add Scarlet to the game was what made me put up with the bad gameplay elements, but today all my effort and putting up with the game was ruined. I can't recommend this game now sense they aren't going to release the other characters to those who didn't know about this game until later. They didn't have a pre-buy on steam otherwise I would have months before release, so due to this games buggy multiplayer with it DCing some people at game startup then never starting the first round, the rng almost as bad as hearthstone's crappy card draw rng system, the high chance to get screwed over suddenly by a few bad dungeon explore coin flips, and how often when you have way more dice then the enemy, yet you get no swords or shields then they get all their small dice to land... So in short, don't play this game if you don't want to deal with all those negitives.			"

No options menu to speak of, so you can't run it windowed, can't define graphics options other than a nebulous quality level setting, the sound messes up consistently where it cuts off and alternates speakers, and there's no way to reconnect to a multiplayer game if you crash or disconnect, both of which will happen often. Wait for a steep sale and / or for those issues to be fixed.			"

								I ended up returning the game for refund. It was very beautiful but it didn't really satisfy me on any level. It wasn't a long and immersive enough game to be like Talisman and it also wasn't fast-paced and exciting enough for a video game. I just felt very limited, not only by the smallness of the map but also by the limited options I had to interact with it. I also felt like all my efforts to improve my character were a total waste when another player just stormed the castle and won. When are the spirit stones ever supposed to help you win the game? There seems to be something unbalanced there. I also found a lot of the cards I was getting to not be very useful, and was just holding on to them to burn through later, which just wasn't very fun and left some of my turns totally useless.Maybe the final product will address some of these issues, but what was presented to me currently wasn't worth the price and mostly just made me want to play Talisman with friends and family rather than this.

I didn't purchase any, but they've made every little add on ever imaginable as paid DLC. They also made the Armello community forums just for owners of the game, allowing an echo chamber and hive mind. Potentional customers aren't able to visit and make a thread asking questions to experienced players in order to better decide if the game is for them or not.  "

I know what you're thinking: ""Of course it's random that's part of the fun of boardgames!"", but I really mean it. You don't do much and gameplay doesn't feel at all engaging. As for the ""sandbox"" aspect don't be fooled by thinking this will entertain you for hours on end. Granted you can start with different clans and what not stuff such as terrain is limited giving for a repetitive and overall boring experience. Of course main pro for this game is the pretty graphics but that alone isn't a great reason to buy. 4/10; with more content updates in the future adding diversity I may change my review.			"

								I think it should be made clear to all potential purchasers of this game that 4 heroes are permanently unavailable to anyone who did not back the kickstarter. That's 33% of all heroes that are planned to be added to the game. Personally, I think that's completely ridiculous. This is not the complete game and there seem to be no plans to ever make the complete game available for purchase. If you're okay with paying money for a deliberately inferior product then be my guest.Also the AI is too suicidal to be fun or challenging.Edit: I'm sorry, it's actually 8 heroes that are unavailable to non-backers. So that's 66% of the heroes that will ever be in the game. I have no idea why anyone would find this acceptable. At least release them as DLC or something.Edit2: Apparently the developers are aware that there is a problem and it's not out of the question that will be resolved at a later date. More words than action on their part imo. I still think this information should be made obvious to anyone considering purchasing the game and it's incredibly misleading to have such important information not mentioned on the store page and nothing but positive reviews. If the AI is fixed and the majority of heroes weren't locked away from second-class consumers I would absolutely recommend this game. As is, I don't.			"

								While boardgames are my thing, I do not think this particular one is worth the investment.  After playing a couple of games I cannot imagine even the complete game being worth the 23EUR (or whatever currency you use). The game itself is nice and well though-out, but gets old rather easily. The 4 victory conditions do not really make a difference, you will just go for whichever one is best suited to you after a few turns. The heros do not play differently enough. In the end you battle the same way, you just use a different stat to your advantage, While there is some shuffling on the map, some new ones would be nice as well.The nice artwork is a pro though.Overall, I would not have regretted skipping this game.

								Overall I'd recommend the game.... except that its not worth the current cost so I'm voting NO for the game right now. For a $5 game its awesome, for $25 it won't keep my interest long enough.The game has some interesting mechanics as many people have mentioned. The cards are not as awesome as I expected, the followers I've only seen a few of, and there aren't as many cool effects as I'd like most are just a single modifier in combat.  My biggest complaint is that it seems insanely hard to get into the castle to achive any but the easiest win condition. You must roll on 4 dice (unless you add modifiers or play (burn) cards to ""set"" the results)  4 specific types. If you do not, your turn ends and you must try again the next day. I spent a whole game trying to do that from the start, with +3 dice modifier and failed to do so before the game ended. This fustrates me since I don't see it being multiplayer competitive due to that reason.Battles are very short, a single dice roll and usually end with one or both players dying - defense is so much more important than offense, although the death penalty is very small, just -1 prestige. It adds an interesting element. The map is small, something I didn't realize when browsing through the game before I bought it. All in all, the game has some fun graphics, cool with the heroes being random animals, and a fairly unique game. Once again if it weren't for the cost, I'd recommend it, however it won't keep you interested for a huge amount of time. A nice indie game, not the new CoD.			"

								It looks like a decent 4 player competitive boardgame, but the actual playing experience is obnoxious.There aren't configurable settings for timers in this game. Drawing cards has an unacceptably short timer, especially if you're trying to read the cards and determine if you want to switch the type you're drawing. Trying to determine if you want to burn cards or roll dice with perils has an unacceptably short timer, and it doesn't auto-roll for you when time runs out, even though it ought to. That seems to be by developers design, and I don't really care how they feel the game should be played. If I'm playing with only friends, I want timers off, period. If I'm playing with strangers, as the game host I at least want to be able to configure the timers from fast to slow. This is a very basic screw-up here.The game lasts 18 turns, and ends otherwise. It's a race, no matter how it's presented. Some people like race games. Others HATE THEM. Unless you want to put up with a stressful and very fast paced race disguised as a board game, avoid this. Without this time limit, the random murderous NPCs traveling the board would be fine. With it, it's unacceptable.Rot is an interesting mechanic, implemented badly. It forces you to take a damage each morning turn, and there are exceedingly few ways to get rid of rot.The battle system is poorly explained. The different icons have different effects at different times, and it wouldn't kill them to display what effect each card would have at the current combat. Cards can take the place of dice, and that's not made very clear. Maybe the singleplayer tutorial covers it, but there should at least be an optional tooltip in multiplayer. Except combat has a timer, so there's no time for that anyway. Again, options to turn off timers.The UI design in this is pathetic. From burning icons, to oddities with dragging and using cards, to unclear rolling buttons, it's kind of an unholy mess.Even if they decide to patch these particular issues later, I recommend you stay away from this game and others by these developers.

												The rules and game strategy are basically unexplained in the tutorial. I have no idea what my goal is, how I might achieve that goal, or whether my basically-random choices will help or hurt my chances. Maybe that sounds fun to you, but to me, it's just annoying and incomplete.Maybe it could be a good game if it came with some actual instructions, and maybe someday I'll find and download a user-written explanation of how to play it, but as it is, it's just a frustrating waste of time. At least it was cheap.			"

								I love board games, so I was thrilled to read the great reviews for Armello. After a couple of games I am a bit disappointed. I thought it had a lot more depth, and would be very much fun to play, but it's just not my thing. Walking around is hard, because of all the mobs, mountains, etc. It's over in a blink, and then it's waiting for other players / mob's to do their things. Killing the king is very hard too, the Perils are very tough and it's easy to get killed when attacking the king.And it can be super annoying sometimes, e.g. you are almost near your quest, a Bane pops up in the night and kills you because you have one rot, he has much more, so he has so many dice it's impossible to win.In the end I had fun the first 1-2 games, but then it was just boring / annoying.

								I enjoyed the concept of Armello, but it was way too fast paced for what I was excepting. I personally would have preferred a slower take on the game working your way towards becoming ruler of the kingdom. If there was time to truly grow your character, ability to roll your stats, armor slots, and better quests. The ""story"" reminds me of Endless Legend where the whole ""story"" is driven by script quests, and no gain of knowledge or depth. At this point Armello feels like a good start, but needs refinement. Armello feels too niche too be effective. My thought would be to remove the novice feeling card system, and apply a skill, and equipment system. Graphics are beautiful and breath a breath of fresh air.6/10			"

								The game rules are quite confusing and a lot of stuff just doesn't get explained. How does testing an attribute work? Why am I losing health on random occasions?The large amount of mechanics don't really mix into a clever bundle of strategic options. You're just clicking around on the map for whatever opportunities you can directly take, there is no real long term plan to be made. The game will also always default to a prestige victory, because you are just not able to collect the resources needed to go after the king for any of the other victory types. Buyers remorse sets in really hard here once you realize that behind the stylish visuals, there is no refined gameplay that would keep you coming back for more board game style matches. The lack of explanation and the arbitrary mechanics don't leave a good impression of Armello.			"

												This game is a strait piece of garbage in my eyes and little can make me change my thinking. I regualarly play this game with my girlfriend and I see the system that this game has, it doesn't simply run on RNG, but also a favoriting system. She would win countless games back to back just cause of her fantastic good roles on dice, while my rolls would fail completely and wouldn't even dare work in my favor. She wins several RNG quests while I sit here failing to even win one. My cards I roll are garbage and mean nothing to me, while she rolls the best gear possible. I seem to get the stranger, a follower good and bad, but only when I'm going for a corruption victory. While doing so I was killed by the stranger 3 times in a row as he ran me right into stone circles, instant killing me from my corruption. I had a 1/6 chance of running into a stone circle every time, and it seems its 100% of the time. The game looks nice and plays very nicely, but with this horrible favoriting system I can't even bother to open the game up and play it again, knowning my next game will be even worse the more I play. My girlfriend fails to understand half the mechanics in the game, yet she goes on to win every single game, with little to no thought. I have AI's ruining my day every single game, while she runs around the board with little to no thought. Now if you have the RNG of a god you will find this game fantastic as it is made very well, but it's system of full RNG I cannot recommend at all. Now onto one quote from one of the developers. I heard once on the forums somewhat recently that they claimed that some people are a bit rude and don't appricate the free content. Funny thing, there has only been one, count it, one, free dlc. Patches don't count as dlc. One of the dlc was soundtrack, one was just a graphic season change, and one is adding 4 characters, and the last is the old group of characters you get from supporting ages back. I don't know much about the dev team but if that's the attitude for the entire team then it doesn't seem they care to much to the community. Now the post was on a rant from someone, but none the less, it was strait up rude, as there has only been one free dlc.Now, would I recommend it... no unless you want to sometimes bash your head into a wall every so often from the game taking a twist on everything. I would get it if it was on sale, as I said it is a good game, just poorly designed RNG mechanic.			"

								As a kickstarter backer I'll not do a review because I stopped playing the game when LoG decided to screw the backers in order to win additional sales from the Steam buyers.  For those who do not know the story, this game was made possible by the use of Kickstarter.  One of the perks for backing at a high level was a pack of heroes that only the backers would get.  It wasn't cheap.  However after some steam users (And I mean some) found out they decided that it wasn't fair that they didn't get the world handed to them so they ♥♥♥♥♥ed.  LoG took a look at the numbers and relaized that they were not getting any more money from the Backers so they held a fake vote to get permission from the backers to give into the steam users.  Why do I call it fake...simple....if you were holding a vote that by it's very nature took something away from someone who paid for it...you'd think they'd limit the vote to only those peope....no LoG decided to allow anyone and everyone to vote regardless if it effected them or not.  By that very nature the vote was rigged and unfair.  We backers got screwed and LoG is now able to make more money.  Only bright side is LoG will NEVER be able to run a  kickstarter again, that bridge is burned down, smashed, dropped in a deep hole and will never see the light of day again.Because I cannot do business with a company that breaks it's promises for money and lies about the full details I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I stopped playing it as soon as they announced the farce of a decision and will never reinstall it again.  So feel free to take my 'Review' how you will.  I should also point out that I'll delete any flame replies from Steam Children.			"

												Armello is set in a fantastical medieval world where animals rule, and dark magic is at works to corrupt the inhabitants of the kingdom, starting with the king.I love this game, simply put. Its a strategic and backstabbing tabletop game in videogame format. I highly recommend playing with friends over voicechat to listen to their sweet sweet rage. Would you chose to play against the AI, the AI will provide a few enjoyable games until you learn the game and understand how the AI works. The graphical astryle is beautiful, the music is fitting and easy on the ears. The story bits weaved into the game itself are enjoyable to discover and the game is fluid to play, interface works amazingly well and provides all information that you need.There are a few issues to adress. Most importantly some balancing issues, albeit very slight ones but things that I am hoping the developer will adress in the future perhaps. As it stands, combat is the way to go in this game, especially against AI or online players, when you don't have that dimension of talking directly to your opponents/friends and messing with them. Additionally, ocassional sound tearing/repeating appears for me, and I think it has to do with alt tabbing. Thankfully nothing too problematic. I have not encountered any bugs or similiar. Lastly, I think this game needs to grow its player base. While you can find games with patience, you sadly can't log in any time and hope to get a game in a minute.If you're a fan of either strategy, boardgames, animals, backstabbing, fantasy settings or fun, I highly recommend this game.1.2 update: The developer has adressed quite a few of the issues I have mentioned, and is actively working on balancing the game out, as well as adding additional free content. I am glad to see this game didn't just get launched and abandoned!			"

												I love this game. It's so much fun. It's like a board game you can play with friends or strangers. It's seriously got to be the best game in this price range. .... but it's unplayable. Literally half the games you play will bug out. Someone will end their turn and the game will just stop responding until someone quits the game. Lookat the r/armello subreddit or the community hub- this has been going on since launch, and has never been fixed. If it is fixed, I will gladly change this to a positive review. But as of 3/10/2017, the issue persists, and I can't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Armello is a strategy and tactics game played on a tile set. However the game although on computer plays very much like a board game where players have tangible stats, move on the board and play and draw cards. This is what gives Armello such a classic feel, you feel very much like you are sitting around the kitchen table playing a board game with friends. That feeling is so unique, I highly recommend.

												Armello is certainly an interesting game, to say the least.We'll start with the story:Armello is a land plague by The Rot, a corruption that feeds on life force. Playing through the prologue gives you a wonderful tutorial, as well as the enjoyable story itself.Gameplay:The game itself is unique, differing from turn-based stragetgy games like Sid Meier's Civilization by adding a dice system. Players can burn cards to ensure they get a roll they like for single dice, and roll the rest, randomly getting fighting results. In addition, you can customize your battles and dice rolls with Equipment cards, and your Party cards.While turns can take a little while, you do have the ability to play cards from your hand during anybody's turn, dealing damage, laying traps, or buffing your own hero. The game generally has a dusk/dawn system, with the game generally ending at the 10th Dawn. Each player acts during the dawn phase, then the time rolls over to dusk, where turns reset, granting new advantages between day and night cycles. The game gets a little repetitive after several games, with only 8 heros to choose from. The tile-randomization on the map is helpful, as well as the starting trinkets you choose to buff your character, but unless new heros are added soon, you might quickly find yourself bored. Multiplayer can provide a different challenge from the story mode AI, and is generally similar to Civ V in that respect. It's fun, but may not be for everybody.Graphics and Sound:The soundtrack is beautiful to listen to, and is relaxing to listen to. The sounds that play during character animations are pleasant as well, and very suiting, especially with the game's art style. The artwork of the game is beautiful. Cards have animated graphics, Heros and NPCs alike have unique animations. The cartoony and furry-esque themed style is adorable, and can easily captivate those who find fluffy creatures cute.OVERALL, I'd recommend getting this game, especially when it's on sale, although I feel the $20 pricing is justified. The game is fun, but it does need a tad more content -- namely, a few more cards and heroes would be nice.			"

												A game that on the surface seems complex but once learned the game is just fun. The game's art is amazing from the 3d board to the 2d battle scene to the cards. Machinic wise the game plays well and with 4 ways to win the game and the different combination of rings and amulets and cards; finding ways to win to a fun challenge. I have put 4 hours of the game on the PS4 and about 7 on the pc and have enjoyed every minute.My issues with the game is mainly with the multiplayer. The lack of local multiplayer is a bit dissapointing, especially with the release of the steam box coming, I feel like this being able to have friends over and playing would be awesome. Also this game has great potential for cross platforming, but that is strictly my opinion. For 20 dollars (US) its a great buy and I would highly suggest this game to board game lovers.			"

												Do you like board games? Do you like computer games? (obviously, you're reading this :))  If so, you owe it to yourself to give armello a try.The game mechanics are incredibly well put together. The various avenues to win require different engaging strategies. And the luck of the dice yield the same rage/glee enducing moments you love about board games.And the little details are not to be forgotten.  From the graphics of the beautiful ""board"" to the fluid and visually pleasing animation of the 'cards' - the artwork is top-notch.			"

												This is a fantastic game and I'm following any supplementary material that gets released in the future.Pros: -Every game has enough variety so it never gets old-The game is fluid enough that it's possible to change your entire strategy before endgame if needed-Well-balanced characters-Good balance of luck and strategy-Fantastic art and fluid animation-Original world building. While there's a clear Redwall influence, it's definitely its own unique universeCons:/-Inability to view the entire map- scrolling around to find your quest is frustrating-Have to buy four copies to play multiplayer with friends-No free form chat. All the chat options are preselected, making clear communication in multiplayer almost impossible.Comments:-There's a significant amount of luck involved, but with a fertile mind you can turn even strokes of bad luck to your advantage. Apparently there's official backstories, but I can't find the sources online so if anyone knows where to find them, please drop me a line.			"

												Nice implementation of board game with good balance, easy to lern but hard to master rules, and absolutely adorable art. You can play offline with bots or online with 3 other real players, which is much more interesting. Average game takes 40-60 minutes; waiting for party takes 1 to 15 minutes. Devs are actively working on new content; they recently introduced the possibility to play with house rules.All in all, it's a ""definitely buy"" for people who like board games, and ""possibly buy"" for people who just like turn-based strategies. If it's on sale, it's ""definitely buy"" for both.			"

												I have picked this game up in a sale, because it looked like a great game. When I first started it up I was very excited. The music and the artwork were amazing. The animations were smooth and looked nice and the characters were diverse and looked unique.After a few games though I started noticing a rather agitating patern. Almost every game I played ended the same way, a prestige victory. The game is so chance based, in both the rolls and cards that it is incredibly difficult to get enough good gear and stats to defeat the king. Not just that, but try to go for the spirit stone or rot victory and it becomes even harder since you need to collect even more stuff.The dice roll mechanic looks like a fun idea, but with a 1/2 chance of getting an attack and 1/6 chance of getting a defence, with the possibility of getting infinite attacks with the dice-explosion, it becomes incredibly difficult to stay alive. Even with 8 dice you can still easily see yourself losing against 4, which can be infuriating.The world looks amazing and I love the characters, but with every aspect of the game being affected by chance takes away part of the fun. It's a real shame, because the game looks amazing and the music is great. If it wasn't so heavily influenced by chance it would be a way better game than it is now.			"

												Armello is a STRATEGY GAME, if it's not your cup of tea, don't drink it.Now, for the review: This is a great blend of tabletop RPG, Card games and tactical turn-based RPGs.The Art is amazing, the game is easely addicting and, besides it's long matches, it's got a SAVE SYSTEM.So you'll never have to forfeit challenges (like the Rot Victory, geez), and this game should have a 4-packversion. The AI is good, but this game is clearly meant to be played by humans: Decisions, bad calls,devilish political manipulation. Only a table with 4 humans would make alliances against a pretige leaderwhereas bots wouldnt even think of it.A short match with bots is around one hour long, but again: Save system. Player matches could go up to 2 or 3.TL;DR:Furry Game of Thrones, this pretty, this fun, for this price?It's a steal, a giveaway, specially if you play with friends! "

												I really enjoy this game, and I plan on playing it ALOT more after I put this review online. When you pick up the game without playing the prologue (Didn't even try that just jumped into it) its a bit disorientating at first, but you learn pretty quickly how to play the game and strengthen your character. What is really nice is that there is a way for everyone's playstyle to win. For the Fighters you can just fight the king (Very tough in the early game) For the Questers you can always go after spirit stones or just gain Prestige. The Cunning or Ruthless theres a Rot battle with the king or just making sure that when the king and his oppenent die you're the one that gets the crown hehe. What I think needs improvement is the amount of characters you can select from, or the power to create your own. Combat is enjoyable though, its really D&D style with the roll of the dice. Overall its a really great game with wonderful animation and artistic style and great gameplay. A good game to play with friends. 9 out of 10 Spirit Stones :3			"

												TLDR: Recommended ONLY if it is on sale for 50% or so, or if you are a fan of playing board games with family/friends. Very pretty game that can be quite engaging the first times you play it. However, stay clear if you are not a fan of ""luck based"" games, if you just want to singleplay to play it everyday AND if you expect to win every session. That won't happen. Full review:It can be horribly unfair, or it can be downright cake walk, like a lot of board games out there this game will really test your luck. Sometimes you may start out with a lot of gold, thus you then would base your play method on playing a lot of trick cards to troll the other Heroes while you focus on getting prestige or something else. Other times you may get a very rare and strong equipment cards, to the point where (as it happened to me on one session) in a few turns you could get a combo that gives you 9 shields at the start of every battle, making you pretty much unkillable in that way (they can still kill you with spells/traps/etc however). And other times... well, you may get killed before the next dawn over and over. Traps, unlucky dice rolls, getting quest objectives that are on the other side of the map of where you are... and maybe then the King and his ""favorite"" Hero will decide on next turn to strip you off all your cards or gold! Fun times indeed.No single game session is the same, which is actually a good thing since it won't feel repetitive too fast gameplay-wise, and the game uses a card system for your items and spells, and they all come with animated pictures which are overall beautiful to look at. Overall, the art and design of this game is its best aspect in my opinion.Unfortunately, it does get repetitive on other areas. For example, the game is really lacking on type of ""tiles"" for the map (maybe something like water tiles which take 2 AP but make you immune to spells? or maybe something like a Dungeon-Fort that awards you with an item/card if you manage to defeat a strong enemy in it? just a few examples out of my mind right now), and on map diversity as well, with there only being 2 map types (normal and winter, which are only for asthetic porpuses), it really gets dull fast and it really feels like more could have been done with these aspects.Length of each session is what I believe ""enough"". The game has a sort of turn limit since each day the King will get weaker and weaker until his health is depleted which ends the game session unless someone kills/banishes the king before that. This usually takes about 20 turns or so and overall each session tends to last about 2-3 hours depending on how fast players play their turns. After playing it for a while (say, 7-8 full game sessions) it will probably become too repetitive on its visuals, but gameplay should still feel fun and fresh every time you play, especially if you play with other people rather than the AI.Nice game with evident flaws, but nothing that cannot be polished on future updates. And even if they aren't, its still a good game to play once every now and then especially with other people as you would with any board game.			"

												Armello is certainly an interesting game, to say the least.We'll start with the story:Armello is a land plague by The Rot, a corruption that feeds on life force. Playing through the prologue gives you a wonderful tutorial, as well as the enjoyable story itself.Gameplay:The game itself is unique, differing from turn-based stragetgy games like Sid Meier's Civilization by adding a dice system. Players can burn cards to ensure they get a roll they like for single dice, and roll the rest, randomly getting fighting results. In addition, you can customize your battles and dice rolls with Equipment cards, and your Party cards.While turns can take a little while, you do have the ability to play cards from your hand during anybody's turn, dealing damage, laying traps, or buffing your own hero. The game generally has a dusk/dawn system, with the game generally ending at the 10th Dawn. Each player acts during the dawn phase, then the time rolls over to dusk, where turns reset, granting new advantages between day and night cycles. The game gets a little repetitive after several games, with only 8 heros to choose from. The tile-randomization on the map is helpful, as well as the starting trinkets you choose to buff your character, but unless new heros are added soon, you might quickly find yourself bored. Multiplayer can provide a different challenge from the story mode AI, and is generally similar to Civ V in that respect. It's fun, but may not be for everybody.Graphics and Sound:The soundtrack is beautiful to listen to, and is relaxing to listen to. The sounds that play during character animations are pleasant as well, and very suiting, especially with the game's art style. The artwork of the game is beautiful. Cards have animated graphics, Heros and NPCs alike have unique animations. The cartoony and furry-esque themed style is adorable, and can easily captivate those who find fluffy creatures cute.OVERALL, I'd recommend getting this game, especially when it's on sale, although I feel the $20 pricing is justified. The game is fun, but it does need a tad more content -- namely, a few more cards and heroes would be nice.			"

												Armello's greatest strength is that it is a creative, artistic, and inspiring game that keeps those who love it coming back for more. It's greatest weakness is that not everyone loves it. As obvious as this might sound, it's important to remember that almost every critisism that can be made against this video game is a direct result of the fact that it's not really a video game. It's a board game taking clever advantage of those aspects that make a video game appealing (gorgeous art style, beautiful music, engaging role-play). If you don't like board games, and need to be blowing things up and mowing enemies down in order to enjoy yourself (which is fine) then Armello is not the game for you.Not to say that this game has no action, though; far from it. The wonderful animations and clever and strategic use of dice and cards make every moment of combat a thrill, providing you like games that inspire creativity and tactical thinking. The politics, sabotage and subterfuge of Armello create an atmosphere of cunning and conniving that incite excitement every game. Playing with friends takes things a step further, as you finally find out what it's like to battle so-called friends for the crown of a wonderous but dangerous fantasy world.In short, if you like creativity, board game-style strategy, or political fantasy, Armello will be a sure and certain gaming treat. If not, that's a pity.			"

												This is a really thematic, enjoyable game to play.  There are three (though the devs say four) different ways to win, combined with eight playable characters (minus the Bandit Clan), which makes for a nice variety of strategy and playstyle options.  If playing against the AI the game is on the easy side (I've only ever lost to the AI once), so at least for me, the challenge comes not from winning but figuring out the best way to maximize my winning potential with the setup I choose.  The randomly generated environments are another nice touch for interesting gameplay and almost infinite replay value.  Visually the game looks beautiful and fits the theme very well, and the music is good, providing a nice audio background.  It's not too exciting but it gets the job done.  Games last about an hour, which is just right for this kind of game; not too short, but not so long it gets burdensome, and if you don't have enough time to get a round in you can save and pick it up later.The game isn't perfect, though.  While I am a big fan of board games in general and this is great for a video board game, it's just the nature of video board games that you're going to spend a lot of time waiting for the other players to take their turn.  It doesn't help that again, if you're playing against AI, even if you're set to fast AI turns and watching the dice roll during battles, the AI players' turns can be boring and take a long time to resolve.  As for multiplayer, the lack of local hotseat multiplayer is a big let-down.   The last potential negative I see is something I don't mind, given that I do like these kinds of games, but others may be annoyed by it:  you do have stats that you build and quests you go on to increase them, but luck remains a sizeable factor in the outcome of the game:  dice are rolled and cards are drawn, and while you can increase your maximum hand of cards or number of dice you have in battle or during trap tests, if the dice don't roll your way or someone else gets the awesome card you're looking for, you may still potentially lose the game.  Part of the strategy and fun for me is figuring out ways to work around that, and it's not too hard to do so and still win, but it can get frustrating when you're trying to win in a certain way in order to unlock a ring or amulet.This game is already great fun, and I would definitely recommend it, though I do see great potential for expanisions in the future to make it even better, adding characters, cards and/or different mechanics and scenarios.  If they do add more expansions (I know there is the Bandit Clan but I don't have it) I'm definitely going to pick it up!  Here's hoping for more in the future!			"

												I have yet to win  a rot battle...and a few of the characters just plain suck i.m.o, so limited in their abilities and rarely get stronger before getting killed a bunch of times first or towards the end of the game when it doesn't really matter.  Overall I find the game to be very random, maybe some skill involved but it is mostly luck and chance.  Like you actually have some decent cards for a change and some other player pulls a card that demands all players to relinquish all the cards they have...and just like that. You've got a handful of crap cards. I've won games that I clearly should have lost. I've had games with 8 or 10 prestige and still lost. It's just random and that is what I don't like about it.As said by others, the art is beautiful, the idea is really cool and I will still play it. But, it still need some work I think in the combat situations. I recommend it only if it's on sale.			"

												Sometimes, you really just want more of the same—as long as it's also different each time. It's why people keep playing chess, for instance. Armello is not chess, to be sure, but like that timeless game, it's easy to learn—thanks to a thoughtfully implemented tutorial—and offers seemingly endless variation. I've not tried the multiplayer yet mind you, and that's largely due to the extremely engaging SP mode. The game's visuals are simply beautiful. Unless anything less sombre-looking than Diablo (I & II) is garish to you, the cute anthropomorphic animals that populate Armello's virtual game board and the charmingly animated playing cards (that's right, the cards are animated, and each one features a unique flavor text to boot) will bring a smile to your face. The hex-based landscape on which your quest for the throne plays out varies with the seasons and features a day/night cycle (with gorgeous sunset/rise) that also affects certain aspects of gameplay. But what makes Armello such a joy is the interesting way all its moving parts come together in your pursuit of victory. Set traps for your rivals, mess with their stats, steal cards and followers from them, fight, sneak, backstab—or become more corrupted than the mad king you're all trying to replace. Of all the titles I've tried that emulate a board game, Armello is easily the most fun and lovingly designed.			"

												In single mode, after a few hours, this game is unplayable. It takes you 30 seconds to play your turn, then minutes for the AI to play. Most of your time is spent staring at the computer screen.*UPDATE*: The ability to fully skip AI turns changes things for me. I'm mostly interested in single-player fun, and I'm happy to say Armello becomes an option again. To the devs, thanks for being so gracious about criticism, taking it in stride, and continuing to improve. It makes all the difference.			"

												Armello is set in a fantastical medieval world where animals rule, and dark magic is at works to corrupt the inhabitants of the kingdom, starting with the king.I love this game, simply put. Its a strategic and backstabbing tabletop game in videogame format. I highly recommend playing with friends over voicechat to listen to their sweet sweet rage. Would you chose to play against the AI, the AI will provide a few enjoyable games until you learn the game and understand how the AI works. The graphical astryle is beautiful, the music is fitting and easy on the ears. The story bits weaved into the game itself are enjoyable to discover and the game is fluid to play, interface works amazingly well and provides all information that you need.There are a few issues to adress. Most importantly some balancing issues, albeit very slight ones but things that I am hoping the developer will adress in the future perhaps. As it stands, combat is the way to go in this game, especially against AI or online players, when you don't have that dimension of talking directly to your opponents/friends and messing with them. Additionally, ocassional sound tearing/repeating appears for me, and I think it has to do with alt tabbing. Thankfully nothing too problematic. I have not encountered any bugs or similiar. Lastly, I think this game needs to grow its player base. While you can find games with patience, you sadly can't log in any time and hope to get a game in a minute.If you're a fan of either strategy, boardgames, animals, backstabbing, fantasy settings or fun, I highly recommend this game.1.2 update: The developer has adressed quite a few of the issues I have mentioned, and is actively working on balancing the game out, as well as adding additional free content. I am glad to see this game didn't just get launched and abandoned!			"

Hope there's more to be developed for official story and characters as it's all very bare beyond what you yourself imagine. Otherwise, very fun game overall.			"

												I love this game! I started playing before it was released and it's been endlessly entertaining. I always loved the Redwall books and this is a loving tribute. The characters are cute and interesting and so far I love all the updates. This feels like a crew that cares about their players.			"

												This is a phenomenal game.  A lot of the mechanics feel like Mage Knight, but it takes a lot less time and there's quite a bit different.  I would say it's a mix between Mage Knight, Talisman, and the World of Warcraft boardgame.It's fun with just AI, but it can really shine if you get some friends together to play.  Either way, I highly recommend it!			"

												Edit: With the recent updates, the RNG no longer burns people left and right because now it doesn't seem to favor the AI's over all others. I'm changing to recommended, though I will leave the original review here as historical information. All the comments from May 16 and older are pre-patching.While I am recommending it.. it's still far from perfect, but at least it's fair now and the freezing bug on the king's death seems to have been resolved.--- Original Review --Play at your own risk. Went into a ruins, with 4 AP trying to get past it to get the last spirit stone before confronting the king and what happens? bane-bane-bane-bane. (going around wasn't an option as that would have gone either into king's territory or into that damned wolf hero...)+2 prestige, +1 corruption, +3 pretige for killing the first three but the last one hit me with on a single wild die, bane-bane-bane-bane-bane.... enough that the last guy alone could have one shotted me.THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR IS BROKEN folks, You play at your own risk,			"

If you've done 24 hours of play or more (or over 200!!! for some whiny little...) and your still complaining... maybe you should have just watched a DVD.

												Rarely will you find such a magnificent translation of a board game into the video game format. Armello streamlines a lot of the usual rules-crunching required for in-depth board game play, leaving the players of this 4-player king-of-the-hill skirmish with only the task of figuring out the best way to achieve one of the many victory states before the other players do.Wrapped in the aesthetic of what amounts to Game Of Thrones crossed with Disney's Robin Hood, Armello makes for a wonderful competitive 4-player experience. WIth a variety of player characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and challenges, there's something in this game for every kind of player. Whether you choose the combat-centered wolf clan or the sneaky, backstabbing rat clan, there's no doubt that your playstyle will be catered to by the numerous options available to every character.Whether it's with friends, with strangers online or even on your own, the game is easy enough to dive into for single hour sessions at a time, and there are a lot of unlockable trinkets that spice up the gameplay to be earned the more matches you play. (Not win... just play!)About the only criticism I personally have with the game is that sometimes victory can often be decided by a single roll of the dice, negating a whole game's worth of effort in one turn. Luckily this is a two-way streak, as I've often won rounds of this game completely unintentionally simply by sitting idly by and watching the dice toll out defeat for my rivals for me.You'll be hard pressed to find very many more video games that pull off what Armello is trying to do: bringing the multiplayer board game experience into the versatile mutiplayer landscape of Steam and online gaming! Don't miss it!			"

												Very nice, very niche game, gameplay is a solid RPG-flavored turn-based strategy board game with an emphasis on dice rolling, card/hand management, item collecting and adapting your playstyle on the fly since there is a heavy amount of RNG; how the map is laid out, what quests you get, what items you get, what spawns where, etc. While there isn't much of a story, the setting is immensely thought out, and the art style of the game is undeniably charming and amazingly detailed. I would pay a lot of money for a graphic novel or animated film set in this world.Online multiplayer is somewhat barren, but it's easier to find a game than you might think and if you can convince three friends to buy it for private games, it will last you quite a few - thought, admittedly, the gameplay can get somewhat repetitive as the roster is small and the overall structure of the game is fairly simplistic. Definitely worth it if you're into strategy and/or RPG games, and like multiplayer.  Or if you have an unhealthy obsession with anthro designs.  "

												Amello is an enchanting game and I definitely recommend it.The characters and clans are extremely well thought out and fit their roles nicely. The RNG plays an important role, but is balanced to make you take risks for big rewards. Items and followers are used to gear toward the style you want play.Multiplayer is rewarding and fun, especially with the Lock & Key update. They've made incredible progress with the games' updates. The pace is relaxing enough that you won't feel stressed, but will still be on the edge of your seat when big plays are made.For the price, Armello is definitely worth it. Especially if you enjoy board-like games with lots of replayability.			"

Recommended: A boardgame with solid mechanics; however, not recommended if playing as a single-player game due to current lack of content.Oh Armello, you have good mechanics that could lend themselves to a solid game experience, but your ""board"" limits your content. To all those thinking about purchasing this game, I would recommend that you consider if you will be playing multiplayer with friends. If not, then it might not be worth it for you -- unless it is on sale. Here's why:Armello gives you several solid character mechanics, a questing system, multiple victory objectives and a good, quick combat system. The problem is that the board and the rules regarding the king often do not vary enough to make individual games feel ""unique"" when playing against the somewhat passive AI. When playing the game in single player, you will feel as if you have seen just about all content near the 5-6 hour mark, with only token attempts by the AI to kill you. If you are aiming for a strategy to win the game within 6 or 7 turns, the AI will be entirely helpless and you will win the game easily. In order to vary up the game, I think that a different board design, with some additional rules that are unique to board-types would go a long way.			"

												Armello not only creates a great board game in the digital space but expands on it in a way that should become the standard of how to take advantage of being digital and not tied down to physical board game restrictions. This great looking board game quickly takes the throne not only in the digital board game place but rivals the physical board game kingdom in many ways. The story is Game of Thrones with animals is the best way I heard it explained and I have to mostly agree with that has some fairy tale elements that help with the story’s background. The story is that the once great king (Who is a Lion of course) has become corrupted from the “rot” that has started plaguing the land. This leaves our heroes from different clans (from rabbits or bears, oh my!) to rise and either fight, sway, or take on the rot itself to become the new king. The graphics are the first thing to grab you and they never let go. From the opening video to the end wrap-up screen, this game is gorgeous. Everywhere from the menus, the board and the cute and deadly creatures hopping and running around. This game is just amazing visually. Even the cards are beautiful and have animations that are capitating. This to me is up there even with Rise of the Tomb Raider or The Division for art direction.The music is well done while there isn’t much in regards to sound effects or voice work. Does it need them? Not really, and honestly depending on how the voices would be handled could of been a negative. There is no doubt the graphics are where the effort was put in with this small studio and I’m quite happy with what has been done with it so far.The gameplay is very solid. It was everything a good board game has plus a few extras that a physical board game would have trouble pulling off well, that is handled flawlessly in this game like the guards and banes actions between day and night rounds. The game starts with you choosing a character that each has their own different abilities and stats. Some share some passive abilities depending on if they are members of the Day or Night clans. They all have a different feel and have you approach things differently during the game. After choosing some rings that give you different bonuses, that are unlocked from playing games and reaching achievements like wins and playing different characters, you with three other players or AI opponents are placed in one of the four starting places on the board. On you turn you have three action points that relate to movement and attacking while also playing cards as equipment, spells, or trickery/diplomatic schemes to pull ahead of the competition. The way you win is mostly two fold with some variations to the situation that you can push your luck to get to a bit quicker. You either defeat the king in combat, and survive, or you gain the most prestige points before the King dies. There is a spirit stone victory that skips the fighting if you have collected four spirt stones that will instantly win you the game or win against the King while having more rot than he does (this seems to be more of a challenge victory type than a practical one). You can improve the ability to get to the king and defeat him by completing quest that require you to reach a place on the board and have a dice roll based on your character’s stats in a given category. These will give you an item and stats increase if you succeed that will help you on your way; but the main reason to complete them is it allows you into the castle to face the King without completing a high risk and difficult event. The game plays well with everything being well explained and straight forward. The multiplayer right now seems a little buggy as I have had disconnects on most of the games I have played and also requires four human opponents (It would be nice to have the AI jump in if needed). There is quite a bit of down time and with the Hearthstone chat feature where you can select predetermined quotes from the characters, you can feel a little lonely waiting for you turn. I would suggest if playing with friends to use Skype or another third-party chat program to help pass the time.In conclusion this is a must buy if you enjoy board games and want something on the PC or home console. It offers good gameplay with a fantastic visual presentation that you will never get tired of, I have put in over fifteen hours into it so far and keep wanting to play more. It is also great the developers continue adding features and content along with community events. I like how more and more developers are using the online space to office this dynamic content to keep their games fresh. Story/Theme – Outstanding fantasy theme with cute animals with a little bit of an edge.Graphics – Currently the best looking digital board game but also on of the best visual designs in games.Sound/Music – Good music not much elseGameplay – Good solid board game mechanics with good use of being digitalPros – Theme/Gameplay/GraphicsCons – not many sound effects and online still could use a little workShould you buy it? – Yes, for anyone that enjoys board games or great looking strategy games.

Quite interesting way to make a game, I enjoy it very much. I am a fan of tactics games, so this applied to me. Though this isn't so much a tactics game, as it is a RNG with some tactics for questing and positioning. Multiplayer is something I'll be looking to get into asap, to make full use of this game.

												Armello is a fun, relaxed strategy game, one of those whose rules are relatively simple to grasp, but that allows for a number of viable strategies to emerge. I like it because a multiplayer game takes from 45 minutes to an hour or so to play, making it a good way to relax at the end of a workday or when downtime presents itself. Each of the heroes feels fairly well balanced; although some dominant strategies have emerged in multiplayer games, smart players have multiple ways to disrupt one another's pursuit of the throne. In single player games, the AI is competent, and it's a good way to experiment with different streategies, although the true meat of the game is multiplayer. The art is fantastic and the music quite nice.If you can't stand losing a strategy game due to the luck of the die or the draw of the card, this one might not be for you. Because of these random elements, it's difficult to come into a game with a solid strategy, and adapatability is required. If you could customize your card deck, a more reliable strategy might be possible. For me, these elements are not a problem. Another downnside to the game at this point (Jan 2015) is that it can be difficult at times to find partners for a skirmish match. It would be nice to be able to fill out a random group with an AI player or two as you can in private games.I hope in the near future we'll see ranked multiplayer, bringing a sense of progress to multiplayer games. In the meantime, Armello remains a great way to realx with a lite but challenging turn-based strategy game.			"

												This is a really thematic, enjoyable game to play.  There are three (though the devs say four) different ways to win, combined with eight playable characters (minus the Bandit Clan), which makes for a nice variety of strategy and playstyle options.  If playing against the AI the game is on the easy side (I've only ever lost to the AI once), so at least for me, the challenge comes not from winning but figuring out the best way to maximize my winning potential with the setup I choose.  The randomly generated environments are another nice touch for interesting gameplay and almost infinite replay value.  Visually the game looks beautiful and fits the theme very well, and the music is good, providing a nice audio background.  It's not too exciting but it gets the job done.  Games last about an hour, which is just right for this kind of game; not too short, but not so long it gets burdensome, and if you don't have enough time to get a round in you can save and pick it up later.The game isn't perfect, though.  While I am a big fan of board games in general and this is great for a video board game, it's just the nature of video board games that you're going to spend a lot of time waiting for the other players to take their turn.  It doesn't help that again, if you're playing against AI, even if you're set to fast AI turns and watching the dice roll during battles, the AI players' turns can be boring and take a long time to resolve.  As for multiplayer, the lack of local hotseat multiplayer is a big let-down.   The last potential negative I see is something I don't mind, given that I do like these kinds of games, but others may be annoyed by it:  you do have stats that you build and quests you go on to increase them, but luck remains a sizeable factor in the outcome of the game:  dice are rolled and cards are drawn, and while you can increase your maximum hand of cards or number of dice you have in battle or during trap tests, if the dice don't roll your way or someone else gets the awesome card you're looking for, you may still potentially lose the game.  Part of the strategy and fun for me is figuring out ways to work around that, and it's not too hard to do so and still win, but it can get frustrating when you're trying to win in a certain way in order to unlock a ring or amulet.This game is already great fun, and I would definitely recommend it, though I do see great potential for expanisions in the future to make it even better, adding characters, cards and/or different mechanics and scenarios.  If they do add more expansions (I know there is the Bandit Clan but I don't have it) I'm definitely going to pick it up!  Here's hoping for more in the future!			"

												This game may or may not be to your tastes, but if this is the sort of thing you're into you'll have a blast.  The artwork and music are beautiful, and they lend a lot of weight to the world and characters (although the lore really is just a flavorful backdrop; don't expect to get sucked in by the story or anything.)  It's a digital board game with some light RPG elements, where your goal is to succeed the current king of Armello, who is suffering from a magical corruption that is driving him mad and slowly killing him.  There are multiple paths to victory, which means there's usually a way for you to pursue victory even if your first choice doesn't work out.  It's not enough to go after the king, though.  You need to be laying traps, making opportunistic attacks, and generally just screwing over the other players as much as possible.Combat in the game is extremely lethal, and there is a heavy element of randomness to the whole game, both of which can cause some frustration; both of those factors do make the game more exciting, though.  Think of it like the board game that it is, not a competitive esport - sometimes victory just goes to whoever rolls best, and that's okay.  You're just there to have a good time.			"

												Pretty good PC based board game, with (currently) four 'clans' and two heroes in each so there is a fairly varied selection for a 4 person game along with several* win conditions. Start your turn, draw some cards, move a couple of hexes/spaces to either explore dungeons (good and bad item draws), claim towns (+1 gold), cast spells or lay traps, attack players/banes/kings guard or if you have the right stuff the king himself. There are a some issues I have with the game tho, one being the only viable/fun victory conditions are Kingslayer (kill the king) or Prestige (rack up points and wait out the clock). The other two are pretty much a fetch quest or one that relies too much on the games RNG and certain conditions on top of that only like 1 in 100 games are finished that way... Another issue I have is that the heroes/clans are kinda...bland maybe the word im looking for? They all share the same deck of cards without unique cards belonging to certain clans/heros, even if the clans had the same decks but modified amounts of each card I fell would bring some extra flavor to the table. Over all I really enjoy and cant wait to see whats next, but would really like to see something along the lines of an LCG element added to flesh out the world.			"

												Definitely a fun virtual board game to play with friends. The art and animation on many of the cards are fantastic, and watching the virtual dice roll to a success or failure really adds some tension at critical moments.Some cards or abilities can be frustrating, so I recommend playing with people you know and setting some house rules. For example, one character's ability is to do 1 damage automatically before combat begins. An AI in a game I was playing did nothing all game, then crept up to the king when he only had 1 health left and won the game without even so much as a roll to determine if they succeeded in combat.Barring the use of cheese tactics to snipe victory, a very fun game.

												Seriously this game is just awesome. Bought it today and kept playing it with my normal pen and paper/tabletop group. It´s just splendid. If you are not sure trust me buy it! Drawings and animation are superb same for the soundtrack. There is so much work inside this project. Hope you will take a look!			"

												Sometimes, you really just want more of the same—as long as it's also different each time. It's why people keep playing chess, for instance. Armello is not chess, to be sure, but like that timeless game, it's easy to learn—thanks to a thoughtfully implemented tutorial—and offers seemingly endless variation. I've not tried the multiplayer yet mind you, and that's largely due to the extremely engaging SP mode. The game's visuals are simply beautiful. Unless anything less sombre-looking than Diablo (I & II) is garish to you, the cute anthropomorphic animals that populate Armello's virtual game board and the charmingly animated playing cards (that's right, the cards are animated, and each one features a unique flavor text to boot) will bring a smile to your face. The hex-based landscape on which your quest for the throne plays out varies with the seasons and features a day/night cycle (with gorgeous sunset/rise) that also affects certain aspects of gameplay. But what makes Armello such a joy is the interesting way all its moving parts come together in your pursuit of victory. Set traps for your rivals, mess with their stats, steal cards and followers from them, fight, sneak, backstab—or become more corrupted than the mad king you're all trying to replace. Of all the titles I've tried that emulate a board game, Armello is easily the most fun and lovingly designed.			"

												This is a beautifull imagined strategic board game. each player selects an animal hero to play, which can belong to one of animal clans (2 rabbits, 2 wolves, 2 bears, 2 rats). In the middle stands a corrupted king that will die after a certain amount of turns. You move between the hexes engaging with events in the hex, exploring dungeons for new followers and equipment, or gaining prestige with the animal clans, to help secure your own leadership when the king succumbs. You can also become corrupted yourself and beat the king at his own game, becoming the lord of corruption by killing him.players aren't directly against eachother, and there are some cards that work best on another player you are currently friendly with. Each of the clans lends itself to styles of plays and/or certain victory conditions. the game is very well realized, with very little superfluous mechanics, and very well balanced asymetrical gameplay.if you have ever played talisman, digital or the board game, you will appreciate this game. Where talisman is weak, in its range of poorly balanced classes and superfluous additional content; Armello succeeds on its personality, depth of play and adherence to the core cycle of the gameplay. It is beautiful to look at, listen to and play.the only knock against it, is the lack of voice acting and hotseat multiplayer.			"

												Loving Armello so far, only a few hours in. Game play is solid with lots to do and different ways to win; accommodating different play styles. The characters each have their own little niche. Once I figured out how to toggle ""AI Quickplay"" on I was a super happy camper, because I was anxiously waiting to play while it slowly became my turn.  The graphics are oh so lovely too!			"

ConsYou have to purchase a copy for everyone who wants to play... a board game... Horrible marketing tactic, if thats the case lower the price to 5$ a copy so 4 people can actually play. No Fast Forward for AI. I Don't necessarily want to wait as a computer moves.Then my biggest pet peve... My saves were erased. I put 11 hours into this game and lost all the progress. This is a great game to get when its on sale, however at the current price I'd hold off. "

												It got a nice traditional feeling of a strategy board game spot on.I love the characters as they are pretty different and interesting to play around with.There's load of strategy into it and you can really dive deep into planning your strategies.The combat feels nice, rather fluent.It got RNG but also a nice decision making thanks to the burning cards feature.The king doesn't feel weak or way to strong once you've played a few matches you can see that he is a good main objective to try to kill.The ring system feels a tad odd but seems to work well in the game.Gold seems to be the main cost and it makes it feel a bit linear for resource but it actually works well balanced wise (So far what I've seen atleast)The speed up option is really nice for AI games when you're alone and don't want to think to much though to do any good in this game you need to watch what everyone else does.I love the stats system as it works perfectly for making different ways to play and what ways you wanna take in for example quests.A negative point is the AI behaviour in some games are very linear and well for example all three of them will hard focus you when you are already having a hard time winning. Some of the king choices feel a bit weird and there should be more options! It feels like there is to few.The kings guard feel rather weak when you're inside the castle and I feels like they should be a BIGGER threat in the castle and even at settlements.More hereos would be nice, three for every clan would make every game way more different and just add to the fun!The game clearly need more options when it comes to fullscreen/windowed fullscreen/windowed.The game has problems with multiple screens as the cursor moves the overview with the cursor touching the edges of your screen and not the game which makes the mouse leave the game and move over to the other screen and well moves the view but you go out of the game with your mouse.The option to have the game muted while it is in the background would be highly appreciated!

												This game is a really fun relaxing game, and if you don't have the time to deal with games that span for hours, you can just play this game to have fun. The game is really simple to play and their are very many strategies to use to win and prevent your opponents from winning. The better way to play this game is online, especially if you have various friends to do it with. The only problem I can give this game is their are a variety of bugs that freeze the game during online play, and you do not get the chest or key rewards if you quit. If they fix these bugs the game will be perfect.  "

												Armello is a thematic combination of Game of Thrones and Redwall and as a digital board game its very hard to not enjoy each of your turns as there's almost always something you can do. It is a very polished and enjoyable game. That said I do have some things that bother me about it.It becomes slightly tedious watching each other players' turns at the same speed as you take yours and the veiw limitations of the game board seem strange when veiwing through a large monitor. This essentially means you are spending 3/4 of your time playing the game watching your opponents (if you can even see them). While it is valuable that you pay attention to what your opponents do, sometimes it becomes a chore. The other issue is how the board will not allow you to zoom out and see more of it, and when you try it becomes blurry and unfocused. This defeats the purpose of the board game style.Another issue is that there are far to few settings for video customization. Personally I find it especially irksome that there is no borderless windowed mode.I am eagerly looking forward to any DLC or changes that they make to this game to improve on these faults and polish this gem of a game, however so far the developers have made no effort to rectify these issues I've mentioned. In fact I have been told they refuse to remedy the zooming veiw issue, citing that it is done on purpose to force players to use the ridiculously close zoom.			"

												Armello is a beautiful game with a fun story and compelling characters, but the RNG makes me not want to play - and I've played nearly 20 hours since I got it. I would've played more if I hadn't had work/school, but recently it's been less fun. I've noticed that in battle the opponent will get many many more rolls of the dice than I will - not that they'll have more dice to start with, but they'll get more Wylds (or rots, if it's a Bane) and more appropriate suns/moons, and more shields. Basically, even though we'll start out with a respectable number of dice each, when it comes down to what hits land and what shields go up, the AI will generally be massively better off than I am. This is not to say that I expect to win every time, but there's a difference between being outplayed and being just ripped off by the RNG. It takes the fun out of the game.It's worth noting that the randomness everywhere else in the game seems even - the quests are spread out, the dungeons yield a fair spread, and so on. It's just the battle RNG, and the perils as well, though to a slightly lesser extent. Armello Devs, please do something about this, because I really love the game and want to recommend it to everyone WITHOUT having to warn them that the RNG is kind of bogus.			"

												This game was wonderful! Sound track, Graphics, character design, Sound effects and much more were crafted perfectly and I love it! I the short time that I played, I had more fun than I have ever had when playing a game like this. My favorite aspect is how you can use the cards you draw to boost your abilities or degrade other players. I brings a challenge and it adds another factor you have to add in to make sure you win. Plus the royal guards and banes make it much harder to do things when you are: A.) Wanted B.) Someone has higher prestige than you, and C). when they are all over the map. I love it so much as I give this game a 10/10. Perfect game.			"

												Armello is set in a fantastical medieval world where animals rule, and dark magic is at works to corrupt the inhabitants of the kingdom, starting with the king.I love this game, simply put. Its a strategic and backstabbing tabletop game in videogame format. I highly recommend playing with friends over voicechat to listen to their sweet sweet rage. Would you chose to play against the AI, the AI will provide a few enjoyable games until you learn the game and understand how the AI works. The graphical astryle is beautiful, the music is fitting and easy on the ears. The story bits weaved into the game itself are enjoyable to discover and the game is fluid to play, interface works amazingly well and provides all information that you need.There are a few issues to adress. Most importantly some balancing issues, albeit very slight ones but things that I am hoping the developer will adress in the future perhaps. As it stands, combat is the way to go in this game, especially against AI or online players, when you don't have that dimension of talking directly to your opponents/friends and messing with them. Additionally, ocassional sound tearing/repeating appears for me, and I think it has to do with alt tabbing. Thankfully nothing too problematic. I have not encountered any bugs or similiar. Lastly, I think this game needs to grow its player base. While you can find games with patience, you sadly can't log in any time and hope to get a game in a minute.If you're a fan of either strategy, boardgames, animals, backstabbing, fantasy settings or fun, I highly recommend this game.1.2 update: The developer has adressed quite a few of the issues I have mentioned, and is actively working on balancing the game out, as well as adding additional free content. I am glad to see this game didn't just get launched and abandoned!			"

												I don't normally write reviews for games, but I felt that I should write one for Armello. A lot of what I'm going to say has already mostly been said by the other reviewers, but here goes anyway.TLDR for the quick-lookers: I recommend this game in CAUTION, with the understanding that while it's a great game, the chances of you becoming frustrated and potentially losing a lot are high. If you don't care about that, go for it.Armello is essentially a game of chess mixed with a little bit of DnD, Blood Bowl, and Settlers of Catan. You choose 1 Hero out of 4 different clans (Rabbit, Wolf, Bear, Rat) in order to compete for the crown of the dying King, which takes place over a certain number of turns as the King's health declines each morning through a day/night cycle. The art style is fantastic, with beautifully crafted cards that come to life with subtle 2D animation, and wonderful 3D animations on the player characters that exude personality.In my opinion, Armello really centers around making the most of a bad situation. You'll die, fail quests, get hurt by Perils (essentially ""challenges"" which you roll dice to get out of), and get your♥♥♥♥♥♥occasionally handed to you by other competing heroes. The RNG is rather infamous for being crushingly difficult at times - so much so that I've tried really hard to not rage-quit my way out of the game instead of just trying to finish what I started. Notable of the RNG's ruthlessness is the fact that 1 face of a 6-sided die is a shield symbol (1 Shield blocks 1 Attack), whereas 4 other sides are potential attacks (Sun, Moon, Wyld, Sword), with the remaining side being a miss (Rot or Wyld - the symbol that's a miss changes depending on your playstyle). And then if it's night, the Suns count as misses, whereas if it's day, the Moons are misses. Long story short, if your Hero's max health is really low, you have more of a chance of dying unless you have the proper items and/or your fight stat is high enough to protect yourself with.In spite of all this, it's what you do in the given situation that can determine whether or not you can press on and maybe even win, or just make it really difficult for your opponents to win. A lot of it depends on whether or not the RNG is feeling particularly forgiving however, which is one aspect of the game which can be insanely frustrating at best and close-game rage-inducing at the worst.I really would've liked to have seen more story come out of this world that the game has created, and the little tidbits you get from each character's quest is great. But in my opinion there's not enough of it, and I think an expanded story mode added to the game would've been cool. Plus, there could've been more beautiful cutscenes besides the opening movie. This is all personal opinion and I understand the Devs can't work out of their financial constraints, however.Pros:-Great art style, cool character designs, amazing 2D art-While it's only 1 map, it's randomized each time and the season can be either winter or fall, which gives each game a refreshing new look and feel-The AI is competent enough that single player games are fun and exciting-Great fun to play with friends-Can play the Devs on their Twitch channel!-Different paths to victory allows you to create different strategies to winningCons:-RNG can be difficult and punishing, could benefit from some dice balancing-The AI is fickle and will take random personal vendettas against you even when you've done nothing to them (I'm looking at you, River)-Online multiplayer community is very small, so you have to hound your friends to get the game if you want to play with real people-The Prestige victory is WAY too easy to win for characters with high Fight stat - could be balanced a bit-No expanded story mode - would've been cool to see more of the world and the characters interacting "

												Rarely will you find such a magnificent translation of a board game into the video game format. Armello streamlines a lot of the usual rules-crunching required for in-depth board game play, leaving the players of this 4-player king-of-the-hill skirmish with only the task of figuring out the best way to achieve one of the many victory states before the other players do.Wrapped in the aesthetic of what amounts to Game Of Thrones crossed with Disney's Robin Hood, Armello makes for a wonderful competitive 4-player experience. WIth a variety of player characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and challenges, there's something in this game for every kind of player. Whether you choose the combat-centered wolf clan or the sneaky, backstabbing rat clan, there's no doubt that your playstyle will be catered to by the numerous options available to every character.Whether it's with friends, with strangers online or even on your own, the game is easy enough to dive into for single hour sessions at a time, and there are a lot of unlockable trinkets that spice up the gameplay to be earned the more matches you play. (Not win... just play!)About the only criticism I personally have with the game is that sometimes victory can often be decided by a single roll of the dice, negating a whole game's worth of effort in one turn. Luckily this is a two-way streak, as I've often won rounds of this game completely unintentionally simply by sitting idly by and watching the dice toll out defeat for my rivals for me.You'll be hard pressed to find very many more video games that pull off what Armello is trying to do: bringing the multiplayer board game experience into the versatile mutiplayer landscape of Steam and online gaming! Don't miss it!			"

												Only started playing this game in the last week, but I can tell I will be playing it for quite some time.

												I enjoy this game quite a bit. I've play roughly equal amounts of single player and multplayer games. It's fun to get the mystery chests from multiplayer games but I still think it's worth the money even if you just play single player. The AI isn't bad, and I've won and lost games against it. If you like strategic boards games in general, this is a good one to venture online with. I usually play one game at a time, maybe two, and time varies but I'd say between half an hour and one hour to finish the game. Turns are set so there is a cap on how long a game can be.The visuals are delightful. The board is pretty and the character movements are smooth. It can take a bit of waiting while NPC's resolve their own rolls (which you can choose to watch or not). I'm often spending that time looking through my cards and deciding what I might want to do for my turn. The music is not obstusive, and makes a good ambience for the game.Just the Vanilla game for me right now, I don't have the DLC but I plan to get it. Right now I find the vanilla characters and options are enough to enjoy the game, and so far I don't find myself being drawn to specific characters or playstyles, or feeling like any one character has a heavy advantage over any other. With several ways to win the game, it allows for more options of play.			"

												<Please Read Edit 3 as this is my opinion as of right now, 7/10/16>I fully reccomend Armello if you are a fan of Tabletop Adventures or Board Game RPGs. What separates Armello from other board games is that the rules of the game are incredibly simple to learn, yet there is so much you can do with the huge variety of cards and equipment you can obtain throughout the game. As someone who is not into the competitive multiplayer genre, games such as Dota or LoL, Armello has plenty of room for players to develop in all levels of skill. As of this moment, the only real High level grounds for players to lurk around on are the ""Devs Vs Community"" streams where the LeagueofGeeks challenge members of all skill levels in the community to battle against them. Should Armello be taken to a full competitive level, I would certainly delve further into the amazing world of Armello. Despite that this is a Multiplayer focused game, I appreciate that Singleplayer does a fantastic job preparing you for online play and is still enjoyable to look into even if you might not have any friends to play with/against. Be prepared though if you do get your friends into Armello. This game can and WILL test your friendships, but you will also forge new ones from meeting other members of the Armello community. The Music and Artwork for the game are also incredible. The music completely sets the tone for the heroic battle (Between the Heroes and admitably the Players) for the throne. To be honest, I often head into the Card Gallery just to look at the animated artwork for each card as each one adds its own background to the world of Armello. Regardless of how angry I might get at not getting a quest done in time or having bad combat streaks, I still enjoy playing game after game (Even if something like the following story happens)>Friends think 2v2 is a good idea>We try it out>Get absolutely massacred in game (MMM WHATCHA SAY, THAT YOU ONLY MEANT WELL)>Proceed to get Ice Cream >Sit in Corner for 10 minutes, crying while stuffing face in Ice Cream>Swears to never touch Armello again>Goes back 20 minutes later for another round>10/10 Game Design, would salt againGive this game a shot, get some friends along, I promise you that you will have a wonderful time.<Edit 1> So I have still been playing this game ever since the review, which I wrote at around 110 hours of total time. Now I have a total of 320 hours and I have shown no signs of slowing down. I do not play many multiplayer games, but this one has proven that addiction is guarenteed if you are into this genre of game.<Edit 2> Jeez, we're sitting four months later after the first edit and still going strong. Currently sitting at 570 hours and I still have a blast every time I load up a multiplayer match either with randoms or with friends. Thankfully, the 1.3 update has improved the player count in matchmaking for public queue. Much of that is due to the incentive of cosmetic drops from keys and chests, but I play regardless of those rewards. The game is also much more stable from previous updates and I rarely have matches break once they begin.<Edit 3> I hate to do this even at 615 hours, but I need to change my review to mixed because this is something that needs to be addressed. The new additions that patch v1.4 Battle Tides has offered has made my opinion of Armello dramatically worse. The main issue that has been raised is that experienced players do not like the fact that the special dice for Piercing/Reflect/Poison do not have any priority whatsoever. This is inexcuseable in my eyes as these special effects become near worthless as players are now less likely to use them correctly or to even get them in the first place. Suffice to say, I am rather disappointed with this new patch as it took viable strategies that were strategic in nature and opted instead for more randomness controlling the game when it wasn't there previously. Until this issue becomes resolved in a manner that is explained to the community for gameplay purposes and not for developmental purposes, this review will be placed as negative.			"

												This is probably the best digital boardgame I've played. And, yes, it includes digital versions of actual board games. I originally Kickstarted it way back when, and it remains one of the very, very, few games that I do not regret Kickstarting.Things I love most about Armello:1 - The visual design---especially character design---is phenomenal. At one glance, even if you're not familiar with the game, you can guess how a character plays. Thane (wolf with sword) is an offensive combat character. Barnaby (bunny with giant hammer and armor) focuses on equipment and combat. Elyssia (who is the best design character of all IMO) is a builder. The king's a lion, and his guards are faithful dogs. All the playable characters ooze personalities, kind of like a dark fairy tale Overwatch. This is actually the reason why I Kickstarted it.2 - Just like how games like Hearthstone does things that CCGs not played on a computer can't do, Armello does the same with boardgames. Things that would be too tedious to keep track of or involve secrecy that's impossible in tabletop play can happen easily here. Some people view that as a bad thing because it means that hotseat Armello will never happen (the devs confirmed this). I find that a plus because with Armello as a hotseat / physical game it means it's slightly easier to choose a board game when I'm playing with friends.3 - It's just a really good board game. I'm not a super board game geek (case in point, I don't even have a Boardgamegeek account) but I've played my fair share of games. And Armello is definitely in the top 10 of my favorite games. Maybe even top 5. The mechanics are interesting and mostly balanced (yes even that stupid bear with his spells). And it makes me say ""mmm this is clever"" both on plays and mechanics quite often.Biggest problems with this game are game length and NMA (no more action, essentially game ending bugs). It takes an hour or two to play a game with 3 human opponents, and while you can do things offturn things do get slow. I often multitask while playing, which I like but may or may not be a plus for you. The NMA bugs are annoying, especially given the game length, but I've only gotten them in 1/10 games in the past and haven't seen any since a few months ago (after the War chest update). The devs clearly love the game and update it pretty often with bugfixes and new content, so I'm pretty happy.			"

												Armello is a very fun/addicting computerized board game of light to medium complexity. Great with friends, and one of the few digital table tops to make good use of its medium with mechanics such as stealth. You can sometimes get screwed from dice and card RNG, but the game offers plenty of ways to mitigate chance. Worth noting, is that the Armello has received an impressive amount of support from the devs, with constant tweaks and new content since launch, as well as small events for the holidays. Style of play isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoy board games, Armello is worth checking out.			"

												This is a really fun game!  There are different ways to win a game so you can use a variety of strategies and change things up each time you play.  Standard game seems to last about an hour.  Each character has a different special ability and stats to suit different play styles and they seem well balanced.Some suggestions I'd make:1. dlc is too pricey, I'd think it should be half the price it is currently2.  Multiplayer can be a bit slow.  I realise you can use your offturn to play cards and such but that's not happening all the time so other players tend to be bored waiting - especially when some or all players are stealthed.  I don't have anything to offer as a solution, just that it's an annoying part of the game (all turn based strategy games have this issue, I guess reducing the wait time or giving people something else to do in their offturns could help)3.  The map is great and I realise there are 2 skins and dlc for more, but different maps enitrely would be nice to have4.  Just joined a multiplayer game and at the start of match I couldn't actually do anything after selecting my quest.  I think I was the first to go but I couldn't do anything, no turn timer, could chat but that's about it.  We all had to leave the match and wear the penalty, seems like a bug			"

												Bought this as a speculative purchase, because the concept seemed nice, and I like tabletop games generally.The game is surprisingly compelling. The concept is reasonably simple, and the art is lovely. You fight to become animal king of the world, building your stats through gear and quests. Combat and danger altimately come down to rolling a handful (or bucket full) of dice, and there's something satisfying in seeing a few dice hit the ""succeed and roll again"" result several times in one test.You will at some points get destroyed by RNGesus, but overall the game balances out, and has enough for the price to keep you entertained. For me it's not going to be one I'll play obsessively, but I will keep coming back for a bit more fun. Would definitely recommend.			"

												This game is great I like the story it brings and the art style. The game is a competitive challenge where you can play with or without friends. There are some things in the game that anger me like              - The Stranger always dragging you to horrible places.             - The dice rolls feel like you have to rely on luck just to win a Peril or fight, but cards help.              - I feel that I always get the Stranger, 1 or 2 pieces of gold or gain magic when raiding dungeons.             - Some of the heroes feel like they have too much damage or not enough.Anyways there are some more, but I'm not going to make a big list of pros and cons about the game. Back to my point, the game is a good purchase and might entertain you for hours, and if not there's always steam refund. While on the topic of time I sometimes complain about the game times. An average game is about an hour you can however, change the Kings health to speed up the game. That might only be for multiplayer. Like I keep saying it's a good game though I want a game where I can look at the time and say its 12:00 p.m and not look at the clock after to have it say 1:25 p.m. You also have to account for the multiple games you're going to be playing so, in the end, you look at the clock and say one more game than boom 4 hours of your life gone. Anyhow I'm rambling, and may even be overexaggerating, but if you're still reading this to the end then I appreciate that.         "

												A well creative game with a beautiful cast of characters. This game is not for everyone though as it is a board game, but if any game could make you think differently its this game. very balance with every character having its own advantages and disadvantages. The world of Armello is full of story when you look hard enough and really starts to make the game feel more personal. I would love to see this turned into a real board game.			"

												Took 1 - 2 games without playing any tutorial or reading any rules to figure out what I was doing. That's impressive for a strategy game. By game #2 I felt confident in every action I took. If you're afraid to try a 4x title due to the insanely large learning curve, but you've always been interested in one, this is a great place to start. It's very competetive but easy to understand as well. The skill ceiling is also pretty high so you won't be a pro in the first couple hours, which gives the game a needed longevity.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough if you are fan of tabletop RPGs or just RPGs in general, the community is nice, the devs are dedicated, if what you see on the trailers and screenshots catches your attention don't hesitate to get it.On the negative side, matches can take up to an hour of duration (you need patience) and the player base is not huge, but is very active, can take some minutes to find an online match but you will find it, and like I said before the devs keep the game updated.

												Armello is a very fun/addicting computerized board game of light to medium complexity. Great with friends, and one of the few digital table tops to make good use of its medium with mechanics such as stealth. You can sometimes get screwed from dice and card RNG, but the game offers plenty of ways to mitigate chance. Worth noting, is that the Armello has received an impressive amount of support from the devs, with constant tweaks and new content since launch, as well as small events for the holidays. Style of play isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoy board games, Armello is worth checking out.			"

												At first, I though I was a very different kind of game. I was very disappointed when I start to play this game. I was hoping for a bigger story. But, I had to give it a chance. I played again. Again... Again...This game began to shine when I  learn how to use the beautiful mix of cards,  dices and board game. The art is awesome and almost alive. The lack of the storyline I was expecting found a good replacement on the eerie fairy-tale atmosphere of the game. If you want a good game to play with your pals forever, I can bet you not gonna find a better fit.			"

												Extremely entertaining and enjoyable. For a board game you don't seem to lose hype or interest half way through. Stunning graphics and animations. Alluring and amusing, this game has gotten me playing all day again and keeping me happy. In my opinion that is the best a game can achieve. Very much recommend this game, even though it's a little pricey, it's understandable since it is so well designed and made by small companies/developers. Suggest trying it, most fun with friends like all board games.			"

												Armello; 1st, BEAUTIFUL AND ADORABLE! A spectacular combination of asthetics to have in my opinion! Takes me immediately to the realm of Brian Jacques world of the Redwall series(which was a staple of my childhood reading along with Tolkien. ) I haven't had much trouble with the picture. Might be something to do with the framerate handling well I'm unsure.Gameplay is solid. Its reminescent of a tabletop game just online with amazing animation. The turns can be a bit quirky when the AI's play, but I was also playing with friends so I think that has more to do with the server operation than the game itself. The initial time I played I had been awake for over 24 hours and had a hard time understanding the tutorial. Took me 2 days to complete. I introduced my boyfriend to the game and he got through it in less than 30min so I knew it had to have been me.Overall I think it is a fantastic game! My sister wants to get Amber on a shirt or poster. Its a fun game to play with friends or strangers. I love it! And I will keep converting people haha			"

												This game is a really fun relaxing game, and if you don't have the time to deal with games that span for hours, you can just play this game to have fun. The game is really simple to play and their are very many strategies to use to win and prevent your opponents from winning. The better way to play this game is online, especially if you have various friends to do it with. The only problem I can give this game is their are a variety of bugs that freeze the game during online play, and you do not get the chest or key rewards if you quit. If they fix these bugs the game will be perfect.  "

EDIT 9/2/16A custom feature now exists that provides a great deal of control over the victory conditions! Games can now be as long or as short as you want, and some of the more contentious mechanics can be modified or disabled outright.Very well done, and kudos to the developers! This removes one of my main issues with the game, and changes my review from a ""don't buy"" to a ""buy"". I'm still a bit peeved that the prologue sets up a grand universe that's really just a neat board game, but now that it can be customized, I'm less bothered about it.The original review remains below, unaltered.OverviewThis game is beautiful, and perhaps that's actually some of the problem. You play through the prologue, and you get this very slick, almost Civilization-esque board game laid out for you piece by piece, with a very fleshed out and stylish world. Very nice.But then, you go to play a game, and you find out that no, there's no story, and in addition, a single game cannot be any longer than 9 rounds. One of the mechanics is that whoever has the most influence points when the 9th round is over automatically wins (barring the occasional edge case). 9 rounds goes by in a hurry, and the game is over much faster if any of the other victory mechanics are achieved.It feels like they missed the boat here. I personally can't recommend this game due to violated expectations. The talk of ""role playing"" in the game's description? Almost deceptive. If you go into it knowing that all you're getting is a board game, with the story being a paper thin framing device, then you may be able to enjoy Armello. Otherwise, you may end up disappointed. Decide accordingly.The Good+ Beautiful and atmospheric. You can tell a lot of love went into this title.+ There's nothing wrong with short games per se; it's great way to kill an hour or so with some friends.The Bad- Cap of 9 rounds per game, and this cannot be modified by the player. Certain rare game actions will cause this to be extended, but this is rare.- Games end too quickly- More luck than skill based- Any strategy you'd like to play (perhaps trading off a character's strenghts and weaknesses) is stuck behind an inane achievement-based unlockable system.The Ugly* Realizing that the grand story laid out in the prologue never goes anywhere - it's just a way to frame the tutorial. There is no campaign.* Realizing that the biggest annoyance with this game (the 9 round limit) could be trivially patched out, giving a lot more replay value, and the developers won't do it.OverallToo short, too expensive. Armello is like an ice cream sundae from a very fancy restaurant - looks beautiful on the plate, tastes amazing, but at the end, you're left wanting for more, and wondering why you paid what you did.

												Absolutely my favorite digital boardgame to play with friends.  Unlike most meatspace to digital adaptations, Armello was built to work well as a boardgame style experience on the computer.  A serious strategy game with a healthy dose of chance, you will find yourself making rich decisions throughout most games.  The lovely art and rich mechanics give this game a lot of staying power.  Sure, you might ""only"" play 40 hours, but if you'd done it with a real board you'd have spent at least that much extra setting up and putting it away.Pros:Gorgeous graphicsRich gameplayReasonable playtimeCons:A bit more random chance than some may likeConvinging your friends to get their own copies			"

												Hotseat mode and comeback mechanics are the only things missing here. Armello is a board game with procedural map generation, furry hero characters of varying abilities, multiple victory conditions, and massive aggravation when you have your win perfectly set up and someone else waltzes into the palace with an extra action point and four spirit stones.Not for all, but enjoyable online where people know how to play. Still being updated, which I find admirable on League of Geeks' part. Keep this train rolling, boys!			"

												I bought this on a whim several months ago after watching a Youtuber play it, and I'm so glad I did. I love Armello.There are a lot of random, luck based elements to it, but there is some strategy involved. There are several ways to win, which helps balance the game out a bit. The characters are great and each has a unique feel to him/her. I personally really enjoy the battle system and the use of item and spell cards. Multiplayer is definitely more fun and challenging than single player. Just be prepared to have some matches go very, very wrong for you. That being said, Armello has an addicitve quality that might keep you coming back even after your fourth loss in a row. If you lose your mind when things don't go exactly how you imagined, this probably isn't the game for you, lol. If that kind of thing doesn't stop you from having fun, and you're looking for a challenging, whimsical, visually pleasing video game with the feel of a board game, Armello is for you. "

												Listen. I'd be here for an action-adventure story driven game with similar combat & gameplay structure set in Armello's world about overthrowing the King, with different narratives for the different clans... I'd die happy. But what we get is pretty damn great too! It's easily one of my favourite titles I own on Steam, and I'd recommend it wholeheartedly, even at full price. I got it on sale, and frankly, I'd pay the full 20 USD for it, even with the terrible AUS currency rate right now. The world is beautiful, the artstyle is fantastic, and the characters are excellent- both design and gameplay. I love the art on the cards. The voice lines update took me by surprise and I'm not sold on the noises the King makes while getting Rot every night. I almost preferred it voiceless, but I'm looking forward to further developer updates- they're friendly and engage with the community well. Also, as an Australian, it is a source of both relief and pride to see such a cool game come out of my country, because there aren't many others I've come across. The gameplay is extremely solid, and the RNG isn't stupidly punishing like some I've come across. You get some bad turns, like activating a bane at a dungeon three turns in a row, but you get some awesome ones too, like getting a 15 attack roll for Zosha and proving to a friend that the statement 'if I die I'm taking you with me' is true. I find it stays fresh and interesting every game, despite the similiar set up, and the characters playstyles are diverse enough to keep you invested. I can't really comment on the state of multiplayer- I don't really play it, because the long, long turns bore me and I get disinterested. I do love playing with friends, though!			"

Though this isn't so much a tactics game, as it is a RNG with some tactics for questing and positioning. Multiplayer is something I'll be looking to get into asap, to make full use of this game.

												You play as a animal hero in a fantasy world (Wolf Warrior, Rat Thief, Bear Druid and so on...) and compete against other players to kill the mad king. It plays like one of those very complex board games with RPG elements, only there's a computer making the game run smooth (and avoiding those endless hours of dispute about the rules with your friends) and there's beautiful, gorgeous 3D animation of fantasy characters acting and fighting on the game board. It's good fun and has pretty decent variety, there are many characters to play as, cards and different paths to victory. Also, Armello is constantly evolving, the developers are releasing new elements of the games and new heroes every few months or so. The internet community are quite nice.			"

												Very Nice game. When i first purchased the game I wasn't entirely sure about it. I reckond it might get boring very quickly but man; was I wrong.This game is very fun and best of all very relaxing to play. You could be watching TV and playing the game by occasionally.making your move. It is very fun to play with friends as well and the characters are just fantastic.			"

												Only played one game (won, btw), but so far I'd say the game looks really good, though I would have appreciated more cutscenes (it wouldn't have been crazy to expect one when the game ends with victory) as they are really gorgeous and full of atmosphere. I would definitely pay to see an Armello cartoon.Too much random luck though, even so it keeps you on your toes, I achieved victory through pure luck. Played in solo mode, after a couple more solo games, and trying the different characters, I'll attempt multiplayer, sounds like fun.I recommend the game, but maybe not at his full price.			"

												I'm not sure I can recommend this game enough. It's engaging in story and gameplay, with beautifuly polished visuals that really give the in-game world a breath of life. The OST only adds to the atmosphere, presenting a fantasy feel that seems reminicent to LotR. It's easy to learn but can be difficult to master depending on who and how you're playing.The only two downsides are the multiplayer and current lack of content. Unfortunately, while it is as engaging as the main game, the multiplayer is best experienced with friends or family whom you know will see the whole match through. The offered content is a little lacking as well, especially at the price they're asking. I would wait for any of the DLC to go on sale before purchasing them.Overall, 9/10; an excllent game that's deffinitely worth your time if you're into the fantasy genre, RPGs, and/or table-top gaming.

I gave the tutorial a second go through and got the hang of the game and it's rather enjoyable.I'm glad I didn't refund. Armello is a complete change of game genre for me. It can be relaxing at times and I love the artwork. Its nice to see developers who are still hard at work releasing content and updates.			"

												Armello is a compelling turn-based board game with a variety of different ways to win. There are always 3 opponents (human or AI controlled) along with a variety of NPCs that hinder or help your progress. Being tasked with returning the kingdom to normal, you can choose to defeat the king in combat, become more corrupt than him by being tainted by the 'rot', gather 4 spirit stones to banish him or become the prestige leader and keep the king alive. The different heroes you play as all have their own talents and skills. Each clan has their own rings and coupled with the trinkets and artifacts you uncover during the game you can have a wildly varied hand. At first it seems easy but there are many things out to get you. You have to face perils, survive enemy players and mobs and get close enough to the king to stop him. I love the aesthetics of this game, it certainly feels and sounds like a fantasy adventure you'd want to be a part of. The animal motif fits the theme and the range of cards and effects makes this a deeply complex game. Definitely one of the best board games on Steam.			"

												This is a game of strategy to tip the odds in your favor. Nothing is ever concrete and therefore very replayable. The memories you can make with friends are fantastic as your grand plan either suceeds for epicly fails. Whatever story your character ventures or stumbles down, odds are, you'll come back for more.The art is fantastic and gorgeous to look at. Zooming in and out actually changes the audio you experience. The sound track and ambience are lovely and a joy to listen to.The gameplay is unique and increasingly fun the more familiar you become with the mechanics. Hunting achievements was never something I did until I played this game.My only request is possibly a campaign mode or maybe a new mode that has more in depth quests. I think the quests mechanic can be explored more and be used as a tool to flush out the world of Armello. Maybe even get us emotionally attached to certain characters.			"

Product received for free
												I received the game as a gift from a friend some time ago, but held off reviewing it in order to see what direction the development team would take it.  I have to say, that after all this time, I'm pretty pleased thus far. ^^The visuals are nice, and the boardgame-style gameplay is pretty solid.  The random chance elements in the form of the dice and various card decks encourage players to think on their feet and choose their battles carefully.It's easy to learn, difficult to master, and fun all around.If I had to nit-pick, my only gripe would be that there isn't enough story content.  The game only provides you with enough to understand the basic premise, but really nothing concrete beyond that; leaving you to cobble together a -very- loose narrative from the snippets of flavor text you glean from the various cards.  At the very least, they could finish giving all the player characters their back stories.			"

												I didn't think I would like a digital board game. I'm also allergic to hex tiles. However, Armello is beautifully animated and super fun. I once heard it compared to ""what would happen if Disney bought the rights to Game of Thrones"" -- while this obviously isn't a completely logical scenario, I think it's a pretty fair comparison. The game is cute, but maintains a mature attitude that makes you take it seriously.On the sliding scale of skill versus randomness, this game sits somewhere in the middle. You need skill to not screw up, but randomness features pretty heavily in determining the winner. As a skilled player, you won't necessarily win a game against three new players. Lots of fun BS happens at the end of the game; ""upsets"" are frequent and wins are not locked down until you strike the last blow.Also an excellent game to multitask on; while you're waiting for people to take their turn, you can do other stuff. Play games 24/7, even when you have stuff to do!			"

I have put 4 hours of the game on the PS4 and about 7 on the pc and have enjoyed every minute.My issues with the game is mainly with the multiplayer. The lack of local multiplayer is a bit dissapointing, especially with the release of the steam box coming, I feel like this being able to have friends over and playing would be awesome. Also this game has great potential for cross platforming, but that is strictly my opinion. For 20 dollars (US) its a great buy and I would highly suggest this game to board game lovers.			"

It has a rich lore that I would really like to hear more of, various characters allow you to play the game differently every round and the graphics and music are top notch.My only concern with this game is it does feel a bit repetitive. I'd like to see a more Settlers of Catan map shuffle so the game feels a bit more diverse even though the aspects are the same.I love the use of quests and cards to play every turn and I feel if you like boardgames this game is totally for you!

												Armello is basically a digital board game. It's easy to pick up and play but the gameplay is complex enough for each game to be exciting. (I'm not gonna bother describing the game mechanics because other people already have and I'm lazy! Oops! If you need an in-depth look at how the game plays I recommend finding and watching a Let's Play) The game's aesthetic is gorgeous with beautifully illustrated cards, fun characters and a great soundtrack. The ""fantasy w/animal people"" setting is strongly realized and despite the fact that there isn't much of an overt story, (it's a board game) there is a great undercurrent of lore, and it's a good world to jump into when you feel like playing a couple of matches.

												Armello would be a solid tabletop boardgame. The mechanics are simple, and for the most part are determined by your strategy. There is enough luck to keep it unpredictable, but not enough that you feel you're playing RNG Simulator. So far, games seem to be determined on the last or second to last turns, with no runaway victories or crushing defeats.			"

												I love this game. It's so much fun. It's like a board game you can play with friends or strangers. It's seriously got to be the best game in this price range. .... but it's unplayable. Literally half the games you play will bug out. Someone will end their turn and the game will just stop responding until someone quits the game. Lookat the r/armello subreddit or the community hub- this has been going on since launch, and has never been fixed. If it is fixed, I will gladly change this to a positive review.

												My friends and I love to play this game, when I first saw this game I thought it was a rather silly game in which you terrorized towns as a giant rabbit. Though I understand the game better now the wonder has never left. This is an amazing game about strategy and I would recommend it to everyone.			"

												This game is really short. It's basically a boardgame that takes approximately 30 minutes to play vs 3 other opponents. Not sure if it has a real boardgame counterpart, but I'd probably prefer it that way instead of a video game. I still think the game is fun even though im ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it with my comments.			"

												Very good game to play with friends, awesome if you love animals, the board is randomly generated every game.The game revolves around a corrupted king at the center of the board, while player race to either overthrow him in battle, banish him by collecting spirit stones, or  wait until he dies from the rot and claim a prestige victory. bceause of this, games usually do not last more than an hour, so it is great to play if you're low on time or don't like the endless hours of playing games like Risk or Civilization. Cards have animations on them! Game gets updated continually, and has online multiplayer as well. You can create custom rules for your private games too! Biggest gripe is how expensive the DLC is. Understandable that it is expensive, as the developers are Australian, and most games down there are typically more expensive. The only DLC that can actually affect the game itself if the hero packs. Heros and cards do also get updated and balanced as well. DRM free version available out of Steam!Overall, fantastic game, would reccomend to friends, high replay value, absolutely satisfied with my purchases (I have the Usurpers DLC.)			"

												Great game to play with friends but playing by yourself is like playing chess on pc or playing mario party by yourself. Not being able to communicate with Ai and make alliances or plots to gang up on a strong player through chat makes the game lose some of it's best elements.

												Hotseat mode and comeback mechanics are the only things missing here. Armello is a board game with procedural map generation, furry hero characters of varying abilities, multiple victory conditions, and massive aggravation when you have your win perfectly set up and someone else waltzes into the palace with an extra action point and four spirit stones.Not for all, but enjoyable online where people know how to play. Still being updated, which I find admirable on League of Geeks' part. Keep this train rolling, boys!			"

												I can't recommend this game enough if you are fan of tabletop RPGs or just RPGs in general, the community is nice, the devs are dedicated, if what you see on the trailers and screenshots catches your attention don't hesitate to get it.On the negative side, matches can take up to an hour of duration (you need patience) and the player base is not huge, but is very active, can take some minutes to find an online match but you will find it, and like I said before the devs keep the game updated.

												Armello is the kind of game you sit back relax and have a cup of coffee or tea as you wait for your turn.Pretty easy to pick up, a bit more difficult to master, as some times the hand of cards you get is a bit punishing and you have to make do. As it is in any game like this.Visually it is exactly what it promises. Easy on the eyes and relaxing, good atmosphere for what it is and overall a game worth sitting down and playing. Matchmaking is pretty good. One hour (or so) long matches where you pick your hero and go to work. It offers a balanced roster of heroes and a randomly generated map.The rewards, even though not so great, vary from simple dice skins to rare ones which you can get by unlocking chests with keys you receive from finished matches.Only con I could find is that if a player (in mp) gets too salty he'll try to ""milk"" the time out of his turn and in an hour-long match this gets from tedious to frustrating, to infuriating.9/10!

												Armello is an intersting take on boardgames within the digital world. It has a rich lore that I would really like to hear more of, various characters allow you to play the game differently every round and the graphics and music are top notch.My only concern with this game is it does feel a bit repetitive. I'd like to see a more Settlers of Catan map shuffle so the game feels a bit more diverse even though the aspects are the same.I love the use of quests and cards to play every turn and I feel if you like boardgames this game is totally for you!

												Armello is basically a digital board game. It's easy to pick up and play but the gameplay is complex enough for each game to be exciting. (I'm not gonna bother describing the game mechanics because other people already have and I'm lazy! Oops! If you need an in-depth look at how the game plays I recommend finding and watching a Let's Play) The game's aesthetic is gorgeous with beautifully illustrated cards, fun characters and a great soundtrack. The ""fantasy w/animal people"" setting is strongly realized and despite the fact that there isn't much of an overt story, (it's a board game) there is a great undercurrent of lore, and it's a good world to jump into when you feel like playing a couple of matches.

												Armello would be a solid tabletop boardgame. The mechanics are simple, and for the most part are determined by your strategy. There is enough luck to keep it unpredictable, but not enough that you feel you're playing RNG Simulator. So far, games seem to be determined on the last or second to last turns, with no runaway victories or crushing defeats.			"

												I love this board game.  Great visuals and lighting effects.  I really enjoy the artwork and unique storyline.  I enjoy the varieties of cards you can collect, along with the attention to detail that was put into each of the animations.  The gaming style has many different strategies, tactics, and angles to think about while you play.   Each character you choose has a very unique style that changes the way you think and plan out your strategy.  Its like playing a different game with each character you use.  While waiting for multiplayer match, the game allows you to play single player game, then alerts you with a popup to join when your match is ready.  You do get to unlock unique items to play in future games (dice with unique bonus symbols for fighting, rings with perks, and badges that give you bonuses to certain character traits starting off) These are unlocked by collecting chests and keys in multiplayer matches.  You do not have to purchase keys to unlock chests like in other games with this feature.  You get to win, collect, and unlock these items for free which is nice.  I did however purchase the DLC expansions because I enjoy the amount of artwork that was put into this game and want to support the developer and see where they go with future titles.  I look forward to seeing more cards and animations added to the game.  The cards themselves  are very entertaining.  The game is very replayable and doesn't get boring quickly. (although, I wish the external movement animations and watching other players battle was a little more interesting)  If you like board games, with a bit of depth, and deck building (per game) I definately recommend this title.  ProsUnique StorylineGreat Artwork, Animations, Lighting, and EffectsVery ReplayableEverything you win in multiplayer you get to unlock without having to buy more into the game with micro transactions.  (The micro transaction type of purchasing model just annoys me)Best looking cards and hand drawn animations that I have seen in a game.Lots of depth to Strategy, Tactics, and multiple levels of PlanningMultiple ways to win a game.Unique characters each with different play styles.All traits are not fixed and can be improved by taking quests, acquiring cards, and winning battles.ConsDefault gameplay can feel fairly long.  However they have added options to tweak the speed and pace to your choosing.  You will come out of this game wondering what happened to the last two to three hours of your night.  But, you will enjoy playing it.I felt the price is a bit high (to purchase the title and all the dlc content at once in the bundle package). Its kinda hard to convince friends to purchase a board game for this price (especially one that contains a fantasy genre with enchanted animals that come from a magical forest).  I am willing to purchase all of the content because I appreciate the artwork and overall design of the game.   But, alot of my friends are cheap,  and don't like to buy anything if its over the $15-$20 range.  I myself, don't like to gift to people that are cheap, and that are ok with letting artists and programmers starve.  So, I am kinda stuck in an infinate Catch 22 scenerio.Its hard explaining to others what exactly you are doing when you are caught playing a game with lots of happy colors and magical creatures. "

												So far after a handful of games I can say this is a great game.  I highly recommend it.  Pros:+Similar to Civ in that there are multiple win conditions, but games only last ~45 minutes+Great art, lore, and overall aesthetic.  Cards are animated too which is a nice touch+Sound is amazing+Players that disconnect are replaced with AI in multiplayer, so no dropped games+I like rolling diceCons:-Games could be much faster if animations/turns were sped up-Pointless unlock system for certain items that should be available from the start with super long requirements.  For instance, you need to play TEN Games with each of the four clans to get all rings?  That's 40 games @ ~45 minutes each, give me a breakOverall:  Definitely worth checking out at the low price point for board game fans and fans of strategy games (that don't mind some RNG)			"

												While most of the mechanics would translate well into a physical board game there are little touches that are exactly the right way to use the medium of computer games. The most obvious example is the stealth mechanic: other players will not see you when you are hidden, which is hard to replicate in a physical game. I also really appreciate the addition of collectable dice, which is a nice way to reward players without giving them an advantage over other players. I occasionally have difficulty finding online play but that may be due to the part of the world I am in. Clearly this is not a big deal so far, as I keep coming back for more. Overall, I recommend this game!			"

			Three Parts Board Game, one part Fantasy RPG Armello is a beautiful and addictive digital board game created by League of Geeks.		

Three Parts Board Game, one part Fantasy RPG Armello is a beautiful and addictive digital board game created by League of Geeks.While there are some worrying DLC practices regarding the game the price of the core game is rather decent and furthermore has a solid and reliable single player as well as online multiplayer. TLDW: 	Pros: Low Price for core game, often on sale.    Easy to understand and entertaining tutorials.Simple to pick up, deceptively fast gameplay, Single player games take on average 30 minutes and online 1 hour.Beautiful cinematics and overall artstyle with hits of a deeper story.Atmospheric music and sound effects.Decent AI though it is explotable.Unlocks available in single player and regardless of a win or loss.Multiple victory conditions which can allow players to always feel they have a chance of success.Each game is different due to the variations available and the ability to craft custom games. Character each have prefered playstyles but can adapt to any victory type.Steam Cards and Achievements.Cons: Cosmetic DLC rather costly or has distastleful requirements leading to resentment in the community.It is not always clear why a player doesn't have a chance to respond to Perils. Multiplayer is partly unstable at this time with occasional connection drops, though AI take over dropped players should anything happen to a player's connection, there is zero ability to reconnectKey and Chest drops only available in multiplayer.Lack of hardware interface options. (This can be a pro for those wishing a simple setup)The Combat can make turns long in multiplayer.Bot Farming: Due to high cost of cosmetic drops players have been know to join multiplayer and go afk just to earn drops however the reporting system is eay and should be encouraged.Unlike in the tutorials the followers offer no banter which is a bit disappointing and reduces their character a little.Lack of game modes, an adventure or story mode similar to the tutorial or a team V.S. would of been a nice edition.Music can be a little too calm and becomes unnoticeable after a while, consider having your own fantasy playlist on standby.No modding. Final verdict: Worth the price as a solid digital board game, I recommend picking up the core game and Usurpers Hero Pack while on sale but ignore the overpriced cosmetics. "

												I played the minimum to see what was wrong in this game, for me : time spent on waiting for the opponents to play. Three IA playing with me is more than long to wait for their turn to play, and I didn't get the real tactics out of the gameplay waiting this way. It IS a pretty game, and it's remarquably done and worth a try, but a try is alas enough for me, If I wait in a game, it has to be useful and I can't see how I could deploy some tactics while waiting. I would suggest something to allow players to speed up the IA opponent time of play, with a sort of resume on what happens, it would in my opinion raise the interest of the game.			"

												A beautiful board game, good fun if a little easy to win with certian strategies.Not a massive fan of them charging for Twitch subs, as a result of which I won't even follow them, but the game is good if you like boardgames, shame there is no hotseat multiplayer (yes there are issues with opponents seeing cards but it's not hard to have them look away or close their eyes).I would love to see a physical version and would definatly add it to my collection.

												Game is stupidly fun.Game is stupidly dumb.Rolling 10+ attack die With exploding die is fun.Not rolling a single shield across 7 die and losing because of it makes me want to kill myself.♥♥♥♥ this game and I love it			"

												Armello is, quite simply, an incredibly well designed game.It's basically a digital card game / board game hybrid which combines strategic decision making and multiplayer bluffing and politics with a moderate degree of randomness. Yes, most actions in the game are determined by dice rolls but if you use your cards efficiently this can be mitigated to such a large extent that the victor is nearly always determined by strategic play rather than luck (I personally have around a 70% win rate at the time of writing and trust me, I'm not that lucky) .On balance the gameplay works extremely well and creates interesting situations with a surprising amount of replayability. Armello is by no means a game which you binge all day every day (although you could if you wanted to) but it's fantastic for a couple hours of laid back fun every now and then.The game has a theme and art style which somehow immediately reminded me of the Redwall books I used to read when I was younger. It's somewhat cartoony but in an extremely polished, non-comical way. The 8 different characters that can be played all have different playstyles and are, on the whole, surprisingly well balanced. Many CCGs released these days could actually learn a lot from Armello in terms of game balance because the same is true for the cards in the game. Even  cards which are less obviously useful and might sit dead in your hand for a turn or two can still be 'burned' for beneficial effects in combat or in perils (traps basically).The only criticisms I have are that there are still a few bugs here and there (the most annoying one being a bug that freezes the game when a player gains AP using Strategist or Hot-Rot Wine when it's not their turn) and that ranked mode has still not been implemented. This is a real shame as the game definitely has the player base to support it. The amount of players seems to have actually gone up significantly since the game was released on Steam and it rarely takes longer than half a minute to find a game at the time of writing.Overall, highly recommended.

												Seriously this game is just awesome. Bought it today and kept playing it with my normal pen and paper/tabletop group. It´s just splendid. If you are not sure trust me buy it! Drawings and animation are superb same for the soundtrack. There is so much work inside this project. Hope you will take a look!			"

												This game really touches me in my sence of stradegy, and unique style. It does it's own thing and does it very well with unique animations for every hero and the playable cards adding a little bit of character to everything, which I love in a video game. I would suggest giving it a look if not the time to sit and play it.			"

												When I first played Armello, I finished a game and said: ""That’s it?"". But then still played another game. Then another. And now I see the simple yet genius in the games design. It's beautiful and artistic, and simple and unforgiving. The short games encourage experimenting with different play styles.			"

												Love the game with its beautiful scenery, excellent soundtrack, amazing animation of the cards, and colorful characters. Interesting concept of using anthropomorphic animals for this game definitely is a core aspect that brings a unique personality to the game. I'd personally recommend this game.			"

												Great strategy table-top game. The ads are a bit misleading, from what it seemed i thought it would have an almost Fire Emblem like story mode to it, but after the tutorial this is not the case. The ammount of characters and modifyers to change your playstyle makes this a great strategy game, i only wish there was hot-seat local multiplayer.			"

												Fast 30 minute game, with interesting enough AI to play solo too. Good graphics and simple rules for entry board gamers. Note: This game is super simple, much simpler than I had thought it at first, which is actually not a good thing. Too little to do or strategize. But definitely a fun and good buy anyways - just don't overexpect stuff.			"

												Gameplay 8/10Graphics 9/10Audio 8/10Cons: -Slighlty unfair ranking system-A fair time of waitingArmello is not your average strategy game due to the unique winning conditions and constantly changing board events. In this game you will play as one of the four animal clans seeking to take down the king of Armello who has been corrupted by a evil known as rot, yet there are three other players that also wish to take down the king and steal his throne for themselves. All these players are pushed into one RANDOMLY generated board composed of varying hex tiles that take effect upon the player ( Ex. Moving into a swamp causes you to lose a life while moving into a spirirt circle gives you a life). I personally enjoy the gameplay for there is a hint of cut throat required over multiplayer and in fact many ways to win the game which gives every player a path to take towards victory. The random generation of the board along with the King's Acts that are determined by a player makes no two games alike as players are trying to win the game through their own preffered path. Graphics in the game are rather stunning as the cards actullay have fine detailed art that actually moves upon hvoering over said card. Games can last up to about a hour or more, yet the graphics are thankfully easy on the eyes as you play hours on end. Audio is nothing really to praise nor spit on. The CONS vary in severity to player to player and may effect whether or not you wish to buy this game. Games can last for long hours and demands that you idly wait for your turn as other players take their lengthy turn which can lead you to becoming rather bored after skimming over your cards and planning your next turn if it ever comes. A Multiplayer issue is the ranking system where you maybe a mere level one and end up being paired up with a rank 5 player which seems a bit unfair or poor ranking. I would reccomend this game to those who are fine waiting for their turns over a long lengthy game and are willing to put in time to play a whole game. I give Armello 9/10 Spirit Stones			"

												I love this board game.  Great visuals and lighting effects.  I really enjoy the artwork and unique storyline.  I enjoy the varieties of cards you can collect, along with the attention to detail that was put into each of the animations.  The gaming style has many different strategies, tactics, and angles to think about while you play.   Each character you choose has a very unique style that changes the way you think and plan out your strategy.  Its like playing a different game with each character you use.  While waiting for multiplayer match, the game allows you to play single player game, then alerts you with a popup to join when your match is ready.  You do get to unlock unique items to play in future games (dice with unique bonus symbols for fighting, rings with perks, and badges that give you bonuses to certain character traits starting off) These are unlocked by collecting chests and keys in multiplayer matches.  You do not have to purchase keys to unlock chests like in other games with this feature.  You get to win, collect, and unlock these items for free which is nice.  I did however purchase the DLC expansions because I enjoy the amount of artwork that was put into this game and want to support the developer and see where they go with future titles.  I look forward to seeing more cards and animations added to the game.  The cards themselves  are very entertaining.  The game is very replayable and doesn't get boring quickly. (although, I wish the external movement animations and watching other players battle was a little more interesting)  If you like board games, with a bit of depth, and deck building (per game) I definately recommend this title.  ProsUnique StorylineGreat Artwork, Animations, Lighting, and EffectsVery ReplayableEverything you win in multiplayer you get to unlock without having to buy more into the game with micro transactions.  (The micro transaction type of purchasing model just annoys me)Best looking cards and hand drawn animations that I have seen in a game.Lots of depth to Strategy, Tactics, and multiple levels of PlanningMultiple ways to win a game.Unique characters each with different play styles.All traits are not fixed and can be improved by taking quests, acquiring cards, and winning battles.ConsDefault gameplay can feel fairly long.  However they have added options to tweak the speed and pace to your choosing.  You will come out of this game wondering what happened to the last two to three hours of your night.  But, you will enjoy playing it.I felt the price is a bit high (to purchase the title and all the dlc content at once in the bundle package). Its kinda hard to convince friends to purchase a board game for this price (especially one that contains a fantasy genre with enchanted animals that come from a magical forest).  I am willing to purchase all of the content because I appreciate the artwork and overall design of the game.   But, alot of my friends are cheap,  and don't like to buy anything if its over the $15-$20 range.  I myself, don't like to gift to people that are cheap, and that are ok with letting artists and programmers starve.  So, I am kinda stuck in an infinate Catch 22 scenerio.Its hard explaining to others what exactly you are doing when you are caught playing a game with lots of happy colors and magical creatures. "
