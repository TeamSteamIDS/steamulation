												This game is terrible, I don't know how this game is getting positive reviews from anybody who has actually played through it. The puzzles make little to no sense, the overall story is convoluted and easily forgotten after random npcs inform the player of nothing.  This game tries so hard to make an immersive world full of its own languages, history, lore and other cultural aspects but they all make no sense and don't even sound cool, all the parts of the world have the worst sounding names that try to sound so mystical.  Lastly the gameplay this game has is just....my gosh so terrible, it's not optimized for any set of controls and this game literally mixes in Tekken style fighting mechanics (which don't work well at all and the AI is pro level on all difficulties at random fights) and FPS moments that just make the game even worse.  People applaud this game for some reason when there is nothing spectacular or even decent about this game.			"

												Good game, Bad interfaceI had tried this game on an emulator at my school a long time ago, never had the chance to finish and always wanted to. So when I finally saw it on Steam and got the money I looked forward to it. The first time it worked. The second time it did not.Pros1. Game world is mapped out and planned like a real active city.2. Characters, while rushed a little have genuine human-like reactions to events.3. Power in events but mystery to their true nature, leading to a good story.Cons1. Steam's version of this game does not work.Yes it is only a single con, but not being able to play the game you paid for is kind of a big one thing. I spent $10 on a game I had wanted to finish for years and the interface doesn't work. Oh it will the first time you turn it on but the second time through the twentieth time, ""Video Card Error"". All other games work fine and I checked around to see what might have gone wrong, as it turned out many of the people who downloaded this on Steam got the same problem. As of February 2017 there is no fix for it, not on Steam anyway.Please, BUYER BEWARE! The game is not bad but on Steam it is a waste of money, you are being sold a fundamentally broken product.			"

												A visionnary game, a unique mix of genres, Omikron might be an old game but a lot of recent games could draw inspiration from it. First thing developers should learn from this game is to break the rules, and to create new ones.This game is a mix of current standard open-world game, shooter and fighting game (as in, Mortal Kombat/Virtua Fighter style), with a real interesting story, in a very well-thought world full of characters with real depth.Also, David Bowie, the Legend, has an active role in this story. No need to mention the music alone is worth the price. No wonder he accepted to play in this game, it's kind of like his music was: daring, imaginative and rules-breaking.Only thing I really dislike about this game is the save system. Without this I'd give the game a 11/10, so I'll have to go for a mere 10/10 instead.			"

												You may look at this and based on the graphics, overlook it. But when I was young this was one of my all time favourite games and it still is. At the same time Half Life was hitting shelves, so was Omikron. An expansive sandbox with (at the time) amazing graphics, coupled with driving, arcade fighting, RPG elements and even FPS stages, it had everything. It even features a soundtrack containing custom work by David Bowie (not to mention an in-game cameo as well). The body switching is a great touch which compliments the great story and expansive locations. This thing came on 3 CD's at the time, it was HUGE. When Quantic Dream finally release a sequel, many people will be happy.			"

												With David Bowie's recent passing, I'd imagine a lot of people will be learning about this game that were unaware of it before Omikron is a game I've tried to complete several times now, but I doubt I ever will. It's really a shame, because on top of it having both Quantic Dream and David Bowie attached to it, it has some pretty interesting ideas, like being an open-world adventure game that combines multiple combat genres and a neat resurrection mechanic where during certain parts of the game your death will result in your soul (described in the game as being your own, real-world soul, transferred into the game as a trap) moving into a different character with new stats. Unfortunately, the game was just too ahead of its time, and as such almost every aspect of the game is flawed in some way. The standard adventure mode plays out like an extremely clunky version of Quantic Dream's later games (like Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain), but the cities are terribly designed and the signs are written in a font that I can only assume was designed to be incomprehensible until you stare at it for several minutes, and as such the only way to reliably travel is by taxi, which essentially defeats the purpose of a open world, let alone the issues I had later on where addresses I had read wouldn't show up as destinations at all. The FPS segments are arguably the only part of the game that works the way you'd expect, but they still feel sluggish and the controls aren't that great. The fighting game portions are the real nightmare, since those are usually the parts where you can be truly ""killed""; they play out as if the developers got completely trash-face wasted and then played tekken until they passed out and used that as their inspirational focus, and while there does seem to be some form of a combo system in the game, it doesn't tell you how to use it, and the controls are slow enough that I probably couldn't manage them anyways, so every fight is really just a test to see how quickly you can successfully do a downward leg sweep to known the enemy off their feet and then keep doing it over and over in a stunlock until they die. I would love to finish this game, because even though he barely seems to appear in the game outside of concerts I would love to listen to more of David Bowie's acting, and the story seems legitimately interesting, but the game is just practically unplayable, and even though I make it a little bit further each time I pick it back up I doubt I'll ever manage to finish it without giving up. This is the sort of game that I would love to see remade by Quantic Dream now that they have the tech, but I doubt they ever will. Ultimately, if you want to remember David Bowie, you're better off rewatching Labyrinth instead of playing this game.			"

Controls are unplayable in 2014, can be kinda mitigated by Xpadder (check the Community Guides) but even then they handle awkwardly, it shouldn't be such a chore just to walk around effectively. Save system is terrible, but its annoyingness can be fixed by downloading an Omikron save editor. Inventory system feels clunky.Conclusion: when is David Cage going to remake this game with modern controls and a non-masochistic save system?? Thanks.			"

												If you want a nice send-off to ‪Bowie‬ and have an appreciation for a well-written, albeit old Directx7 game, I seem to be consistently recommending Omikron: the Nomad Soul. Bowie's music, voice acting, and philosophy manifests itself throughout. The game holds up, despite being a bit odd/difficult.I first played this game about 15 years ago, all the way through and while it has some bizarre controls and weird gameplay choices, it stands the test of time and is a captivating story.Any enthusiast or Bowie fan should give this game the time of a full play through, even in 2016. Once you begin jumping souls it speeds up, too. Enjoy!			"

This game came out around the time that his album ""Hours..."" was released, and the Thin White Duke was all over the talk show circuit promoting both his new album and this game.  At the time of this game's release, David Bowie fans and gamers tended to be mutually exclusive, and it was criminally overlooked.  A damn shame.

												The story of this game is very original. At the start of the game you meet Kay'l who tells you that you are not actually playing a video game and you are transferring your soul into your computer and traveling to an actual place called omikron which is being taken over by demons. Your job is to save your soul and omikron from the demons. This game is a combination of Adventure/FPS/RPG/puzzle/fighting game. This game has a brilliant soundtrack(with help from David Bowie), brilliant atmosphere and a great story. I think this game is one of the best ever made, but maybe that's because I played it at such a young age. I have heard people say that this is the best game ever made. I have also heard people say it is one of the worst so I think i just depends on what you like in a game. This game was made in 1999 so you cant expect much with the graphics and it can be glitchy, but if you can look past that then I think that you will probably love this game.			"

												One of the greatest and most cerebral games ever. Way ahead of it's time. Kindled my imagination when first playing it on DreamCast when I was little and still holds a special grasp in my heart today when I play it on the PC as an adult. Under-appreciated and not very well known, perhaps this gem made by game developer Quantic Dream captures the heart of the strange and misunderstood. One of the first game developers ever to use a motion capture suit. Also has awesome music by David Bowie. I am glad this game was available to download on Steam, what a pleasure.			"

												***English Version***(Sorry, nie będzie polskiej wersji, nie mieści się. Chciałem umieścić w komentarzach ale jest limit 1000 znaków)Omikron: The Nomad Soul is the first game of the Quantic Dream studio. It might as well be considered three games in one. For the major part of the gameplay it remains a TPP adventure game relying on the usual stuff:  talking with NPCs and using items. Occasionally it switches to FPP shooter or hand to hand 1 on 1 brawler kind of similar to early instalments of the Tekken or Virtua Fighter series. It is worth mentioning that all of these are made pretty solid and none of them feels like it was forced into the gameplay without a reason (well, maybe with the exception of swimming, but it occurs 2 or 3 times in the entire game, which is acceptable).      An interesting mechanic incorporated into the gameplay is the switching of the protagonist’s bodies. While it is not possible to reincarnate into any NPC, there certainly is a significant number of possible bodies the ‘Nomad Soul’ can possess. Some of these are plot induced – when your actual shell is killed, you will take over the first person that touches the dead body – yes, dying does not necessarily mean  seeing a game over screen.  Later on you acquire a spell that allows reincarnation whenever you find an interesting host – for instance to gain access to a particular area. Or just for fun. I find it a bit disappointing that, while all of these NPCs have their statistics (eg. Strength, speed, HP, MP) and some information on their background, likes and dislikes, when you decide to reincarnate, your previous host simply disappears. At no point it is mentioned that what you actually do is stealing the bodies of living people. I believe that this theme is not sufficiently explored or developed during the game.    Surprisingly enough, the graphics of this game are not all that bad (considering the fact it was published in 1999). Of course, models and  textures are simple and the viewing distance is obscured by the mist,  but all of the game’s districts have their own style and color palette that catches the eye. Furthermore, the way the districts look contributes greatly to the  game’s cyberpunk atmosphere. On the other hand, it is noticeable that there are very few models of NPC characters on the street (2 – 3 per district) and vehicles (1 model of a hovercraft-car and 1 bike –  that’s all!). If you decide to play, I strongly suggest overriding the game’s settings in your graphic card’s panel and forcing every possible filtering on – it greatly improves the game’s appearance: especially the character’s faces during the conversations. Quite obviously, music is where the game excels (David Bowie!) . It needs to be said that not only the tracks featuring David Bowie are awesome (look around the city – you may find a concert going on. ) but the entirety of the soundtrack is an impressive work.In my mini-reviews I usually do not discuss the game’s story line, and this case should not be an exception. But let me tell you that: at some points of the storyline some of the NPCs will openly say that Omikron is a computer game ( while others will tell you that it is not :D) and it is the integral part of the plot.  It is quite worth playing the game just to discover this particular story gambit. To conclude: I cannot say whether Omikron is a good game or not. It is certainly an ambitious one.  It is noticeable that lot of work has been put into Quantic Dream’s first child. Still, one can’t help but notice that the later part of the game is significantly weaker, just as if authors ran out of ideas in the end. It doesn’t help that the puzzles in the final chapter of the game are EXTREMELY annoying ( For example – AND THERE WILL BE SPOILERS as I am describing two most annoying riddles in the game – at one point you are required to run around one of the districts, without the use of cabs, looking for four symbols – this task takes more or less half an hour, while solving the riddle when you know the symbols – no more than a minute. Ten minutes later you need to find a gem  - in the chamber where you can get it, there are approximately 20 chests with 20 similar gems – of course the game gives you hints as to which one you should choose but these are quite vague and you are not told in any way whether you picked the right one – and the place where you use the said gem is one hour ahead into gameplay. So yes, if you chose poorly you will be running right back. Or RAGEquit. Anyways, SPOILERS OUT).         If you are still planning to finish this game, it should take around 15 hours. It took me some more time since I decided to lose all the battles and check out the outcomes. My recommendation in this case is: buy this game (discounted!)  to check out where the authors of Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls started. Play to discover that one major plot twist.  After that, there is not much Omikron has to offer. Be warned: I finished this one solely because I loved it OH SO MUCH back then in primary school.			"

												So thanks to some programmer wiz one can finally play this mystical game.Is it ""good""? I dunno. The graphics have that 90`s Quake/UT Engine charm, likewise the music. Gameplaywise it divides into an Adventure/Open World part sprinkled with FPS and Tekken-like (or whatever) fighting style sections. The open world part is interesting, you get to run around varied locales altho its really pretty linear, no sidequests to speak of (you can get keys to houses and theres semihidden fights around the maps, both give stuff but thats about it).The FPS parts are ok, feel abit floaty but eh. Now as for the fighting stuff : Doesnt feel responsive and theres dropped frames or sync errors or whatever you would call that where you get hit but you dont see the opponent actually doing the animation hitting you. Other times you do a move and just ""bump"" off the other dude without anybody getting hit because hes in the middle of a move himself. Played my share of brawlers/fighting games and im somewhat positive it wasnt on my end but that this gameplay element is just technically crude or put blunty, ♥♥♥.Its not that long but maybe thats a good thing because it starts really strong with a kinda Bladerunner setting and somewhat easy but varied and fun puzzles whereas towards the end it drags itself along with samey puzzles all centered around translating symbols or interpreting symbols. Id recommend it for the oddball experience it provides, not so much the gameplay.And now i wanna play Anachronox or Outcast for some reason...			"

Old graphics yes, but they still look amazingly good for a game that appeared in... 1999?Big thumbs up.			"

												I missed this game back when it was first released, though I read a lot about it in magazines at the time. So after Bowie's death, with Square Enix putting it out for free as a tribute, I decided to pick it up and see what it was all about. It really hasn't aged well. The controls are a NIGHTMARE to set up how you want them, the interface is pretty bad, and the graphics  and voice acting just show how far things have come in the last couple of decades. Music's not all that great either, considering who did it. I like the ideas in it though, would love to see a remake with modern controls, UI and graphics.			"

												Interesting premise, but the execution fell short.First part was decent with an indepth story surrounding you as Kay'l, a police officer. You look for clues and follow leads like a detective. Very cool. The events that followed after Kay'l were underwhelming in comparison. You are straight up given tasks that are a whole lot less complex than before.Controls were unusual and took a while to get used to. It was annoying to strafe during shooting sections because you end up drifting and screwing up your aim (made the final battle very difficult). The brawling system would've been nice with its wealth of combo moves, but it's very easy to cheese it with the same combo over and over (a lot of games have this problem, so maybe not a fair criticism).The reincarnation mechanism was nifty. You can find certain characters and force your soul into their bodies. Unfortunately, it's pointless to do so because you are frequently forced to reincarnate into another character's body to progress the story.Not recommended for general play, but might be worth playing as a video game study.

												A long time ago I played the demo of Omikron. I love the music, the atmosphere, the huge city and I played it over and over again. The demo ended when you reached the police station so I had a pretty good idea of what to do up to that part.I think the game was rushed and lot of features seems like they never made it. Like the Sham creature, the only mountable animal, you can only use for 5 seconds. In Janpur there is a large entrance that I never could open. The magic part is pretty much useless apart from when you have to use it to continue a quest.Well, I finally managed to complete the game with the help of a walkthrough. I just wished I had played it 15 years ago.I would not reccomend this game unless it's one of those game you never finished way back in life.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing through this game from my childhood on a platform that wasn't so buggy. Unfortunately this is a direct port of the game with all of it's problems. Doing simulated fights can bug your game indefinitely and not let you progress any more, this was a problem with the original and I'm very sorry to say it's still a problem.A very fun and immersive game if you can avoid the pitfalls of the programming.

												This is a great game actually!Ofcourse there are some people saying the controls are bad and etc. But do mind that the game is from friggin 1999. Also, David Bowie is just awesome in this game. His voice and the soundtrack are both equally awesome.For those whining about not being able to run the game, go to the game folder --> Steam\steamapps\common\omikron\ then right click on 'runtime' and choose compatibility, and then set WinXP SP2 and use launch as admin. Then the game runs flawless and you can set 1080p as a resolution.			"

												I've barely scratched the surface, but this game is fantastic. The controls are terrible by today's standards, but this game could stand a proper reboot, or remastering. The music, environment, and characters are straight out of a cyberpunk dystopia. The music being written by David Bowie and company, is also amazing. A game I missed when I was balls deep in Tomb Raider.			"

												First let me start off by saying that Omikron is quite a unique game.  It is quite a trippy game.  The atmosphere of the Omikron world is something of uglyness and beauty at the same time.  The graphics are dated, but even when this game first came out the graphics looked a bit dated anyway.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing though.  The way the camera angles flow and just the general movement and weird textures and sounds in the game really kind of blend together to make Omikron stand out as a very unique looking game.  So instead of thinking ""God these graphics suck!"", I end up thinking ""What a crazy artistic look this game has!"".Omikron is also a very unique playing game as well.  It has a relatively large set of city maps to explore somewhat sandbox style.  The story itself plays out pretty linear from what I can tell, but there are alot of different areas to explore and site see.  There are plenty of interactions to be had with random people on the streets and whatnot just for the hell of it.  Some of these people you may end up becomming if you die complete with that person's attributes (which can be either a good or a bad thing depending on who you come back as, however you can ""level up"" your character somewhat anyway).  If you don't like who you come back to life as, you can find another person to be too.  You can hail a cab to get around or just run around instead.  There are a few things to do around the cities like watching an Omikron David Bowei do an underground show at a club (again, just for the hell of it).  Another thing you can do around the city is go fight in a tournament semi-Tekken style (although don't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as Tekken).   And if going from playing an almost GTA3 style feel of an adventure game to Tekken style tournament fighting wasn't enough, Omikron also has you fight some of the main combat situations in the game as a first person shooter (although a very crappy and hard to control fps).  Luckily, there aren't too many fps situations to worry about from what I've played.  Most of the game is adventure story driven playing instead of being a ton of combat situations.  The adventure story parts of the game are what I like about Omikron by far the most anyway.  Would I recomment this game?  Yes I would.  This game has it's faults no doubt, but if you can get past the awkward controls, bad camera angles, limited numbers of saves system, the hard to read fonts in the game, and all the other little quirks about the game, then you might find yourself liking this game at the same time.  So yeah Omikron definately tried to experiment with a new flavor of gameplay (some elements favorable, some elements  not so favorable), but overall I like their ideas they put into the different aspects of the game.  Catch it on sale for like $2.50 on Steam like I did.			"

												There is simply no questioning the artistic integrity of this dated action exploration roleplaying game. Graphically the fidelity has not held up well over the years, but taking in the voracity of its design, here is a piece of art that will leave a lasting impression in the hearts and minds of players for generations. There's no question that the purity of vision afforded by the influence of the incomprable David Bowie is a driving force in the emotional tangibility of this world.Bowie provides several songs which serve as set pieces for the digital stage, and also cameos as a guiding character with the peculiarity and vision we expect from the creative visionary. Always a leader in many frontiers, the digital in particular, one might easily forgive the less than fluid manner in which different game styles are meshed in ways later perfected, but rarely with such passion.A screenshot has the presense of a painted work of art, a feat rare when this game was released. It is unflinchingly challenging, with themes sexual and moral that will bring the jaded player pause. What are you doing and why? For whom? A question this game seeks to explore, where only you can provide the answer.A rare game that suits its most notable collaborator. The daring and adventurous would be remiss in passing this game by. Do yourself a favor and study this piece, as it is of the time and timeless in its presentation.			"

												Before David Cage and his band of merry men decided that an ideal video game should have no gameplay whatsover they managed to rub two braincells together long enough to create what is undoubtedly one of the best lesser known titles the open world/multigenred genre has to offer. Archaic controls and desperately aging graphics aside Omikron takes place in a futuristic cyber punk world drawing heavy inspiration from 80s sci fi movies that really draws the player in both figuratively and literally. You play yourself using your computer to enter the world of Omikron taking over the bodies of a wide cast of characters to solve the mystery of just what exactly is happening to this mysterious world of Omikron.The gameplay is broken into 3 segments. There is the overworld adventure mode where you take part in an investigation which is where the story mainly unfolds and progresses. Combat is then split up into Fighting and Shooting. The shooting segments are your standard FPS style controls (though you will what to adjust the controls as the default is the arrow keys and not WASD) and the fighting segments play pretty much exactly like the Tekken games.All in all Omikron is a fantastic immersive game and while it does suffer from sever early 3D game syndrome such as tank controls wonky interaction mechanics and so on, it is still on of the most innovative and ambitious games I've played to date.Would highly reccomend 8/10			"

												Taking off the nostalgia goggles for a bit, the game hasn't aged well. Especially considering it's a bit bugged, the ingame inventory just about moves at 1 frame every eon (at least on my computer) making me dread even using my own inventory.Game is prone to glitches, as I have crashed on more than one occasion, including right after the most difficult FPS section in the game (the factory).Otherwise the game has some great atmosphere, great music, and great setting. Graphics were ""okay"" considering its time.10/10, would not resurrect David Bowie for a sequel.			"

Also the combat is god awful, can't understand what punch, kcik or block. Also I can't figure out how to equip the gun, which you get at the start of the game.			"

												I have not played enough of this ame to tell you if it's ♥♥♥♥ or not. What I am here to say is not to buy the steam version. After a single play session, where I bumped the video setting to 1080, I can no longer open up the game because it is telling me I don't have enough system memory on my video card. I have an R9 380 which can run the Witcher 3 at 50 fps on average at low - medium setting at 1080. Enough said.This is not just a problem I have expirienced as many others on the forums and others sites expirienced this as well with no fix by valve.Go support (censored by valve) because they actually put effort into making modern computers be able to run old games.Note: comment not censored by valve I'm taking the ♥♥♥♥.

												It is easy to see how Omikron influenced games of the next generation. With innovations on different areas, the game brought a new experience.The city being ""alive"" by itself is nice. Gives a good feel to the environment that links perfectly with the lore.The story is good. Follows a linear path and has a good development. It could go deeper on characters, though. I haven't felt really attached to anyone.The gameplay develops on different ways, making the player experience adventure, investigative, fighting and even FPS. This is good and helps the game to not get boring.The overall lack some polishment, with little flaws here and there. Usually they are not a big deal, but there may be two or three that can make you lose many time. I lost some hours doing right things because of this.Omikron is challenging and has puzzles to keep you entertained for some hours. At its time, the game had everything to be a hit, so it was a great experience.Recommend.7/10.			"

												I remember this game being one of the demos on the demo disc that came with Tomb Raider Gold on PC back in the day. I would know because it is practically the only demo on that disc that I kept going back to. I was completely enamored with the demo. I for some reason felt the need to remember that David Cage directed the game. Turns out, this delicious piece of creative pie was his first in a storied legacy of near flawless masterpieces. The genius mixture of Adventure, fighting, and first person shooting gameplay is a formula that few others have even attempted to replicate. The adventure controls don't hold up very well, but that is a given for how early of a 3D game it is. I didn't even realize that David Bowie had contributed to the soundtrack until a decade & a half later while I was looking at the wikipedia entry.			"

												There was a time when I would have traded anything for a sequal to this game. Sometimes I still fantasize about a MMORPG based on it. However, after making Omikron the creator has only made two very bad games under the mentality that he would rather be making a movie. Now I no longer want him to make Omikron 2; because I am afraid it will be as terrible as his last two games. Nevertheless, Omikron will always be in my personal top ten games of all time.			"

												Omikron is 14 years old, however by no means is that a reason to pass this game up.While my review may be fueled by nostalgic memories, there are a ton of reasons to still experience this notable cyberpunk RPG.The Nomad Soul did a lot, and took a lot of chances. In the current development atmosphere where games must be marketed to reach the most absolute mindless of the massess to get the greatest return, this game hails from a time when developers were trying all sorts of things to break the mold. Keep in mind that this was released 2 years prior to the legendary open world RPG Morrowind, yet managed to accomplish having an engaging open world built off fairly interesting and new concept. All of the dialog is voiced, and the world is huge- to a point where it really starts to be a detriment, a mistake Morrowind did not learn from either. Omikron is not without it's flaws. It is simultaneously an open world RPG, a fighter, a shooter, and maybe something else thrown in there as well.  It does all of these things fairly mediocrely, but combined, it holds up fairly well- particularly for it's age. The story was very dark and very interesting when I had played it in 9th grade. Looking back and revisiting it, it is still very interesting, although is not immune to some cliches that I may not have picked up when I was younger.Definitely pick the game up on sale just to experience a different time in game development, a developer who took chances with mechanics and genres, had a terrific new IP, and also managed to get robot David Bowie in their game.

												Omikron joins two or three sorts of gameplay with bound achievement. It's a 3D third-particular wander distraction with one-on-one battling and shooting groupings, and in light of the way that none of its three play parts are focal, each has every one of the reserves of being shallow and serves just to offer a relief from the other two at any given minute. Notwithstanding the way that Omikron is a stunning distraction by most measures, its attempt to go on a consistent exchange reality falls level. Its amazing 3D representation are really point by point, and its masses looks particular, however Omikron's breathtaking vision warrants an incomprehensibly upgraded treatment. The greater part of the city takes after your standard postindustrial sci-fi cityscape - it has nothing you haven't seen before in some other sci-fi redirection or film. Omikron's just loads of tremendous structures, gleaming autos, floating standard people, and flying watercrafts, and every one of these things rapidly begin to resemble the other alike and do essentially decrease your edge rate to a slither at whatever point you're outside. Moreover, the character activity is by and large stilted and improbable, and the beguilement's hand-to-hand battle movements look senseless, particularly separated and the 3D doing fighting preoccupations Omikron tries to copy. Luckily, there isn't an over the top measure of taking part in Omikron; all the more routinely, you'll be taking a gander at the city and talking with its occupants. These examination groupings, which cut from the enjoyment's standard third-particular point of view to first-solitary close-up shots, highlight uncovered crucial 3D characters that look better than anything ordinary. They bear on sensibly and really appear to act their parts, while their unblinking eyes and moving facial portions credit a momentous puppetlike appearance that isn't revolting. Marvelous voice acting comparably restores Omikron's key characters. Regardless, the redirection's gigantically ballyhooed soundtrack gave by capricious skilled worker David Bowie and accomplice Reeves Gabrels isn't in an indistinct class from you may anticipate. It needs course of action and matches the city's unremarkable cutting edge appearance with in like way forgettable techno. A few new Bowie tunes are likewise a package of Omikron's score and are down to earth if unessential as Bowie's in-redirection change mental self view performs them in show up, in-preoccupation. Heartbreakingly, Omikron doesn't sound remarkable at all despite its discernible soundtrack. Its sound impacts are either over-surveyed, as with the key character's likewise rowdy strides, or extremely checked, as with the stimulation's bothering first-particular shooter strategies. Shockingly, that they sound frightful isn't the most troublesome issue with these required activity scenes. Omikron will by chance change to a first-particular view and welcome you to weapon down various powerless yet annoyingly rectify foes as you explore some mazelike environment. While the stimulation's representation motor doesn't make a loathsome showing up worried of rendering the foes, weapon impacts, and working of these movements, they notwithstanding feel unpleasant and totally confounded. They're dull, too long, and all around not very impressive. In addition, character moves bit by bit, and it's difficult to point your weapons. In like manner, these shooter scenes appear, from every angle, to be much similar to the battling groupings, in that they feel unwieldy and thoroughly wrong inside what's in a general sense a direct paced undertaking redirection. In spite of whether it's reasonable for a redirection to join a few sorts is unimportant; Omikron's utilization of three totally withdrew sorts of gameplay is deficient and completely self-confident. It's pretty much as the originators consolidated these sorts for no other elucidation than that some individual up top happened to like every one of the three. As needs be, Omikron take after three ordinary beguilements moved into one: The doing fighting and shooting movements drew the coordinators' idea from whatever is left of the distraction, and along these lines, even the indispensable experience parts are inadequate. Omikron tries to contrast by keeping when and also the measure of times you can spare your beguilement; it in like way requests that you get used to utilizing an enchanting stock framework that confines the entirety you can go on for no detectable reason. In addition, regardless of the way that you can investigate two or three reactions amidst talks with the redirection's different characters, you'll see that these decisions are frequently insignificant. Regardless of controlling your character is troublesome, as vital moves like turns and back strides are nonsensically move to let you adequately examine the city's little rooms and thin back ways. Omikron has an enthralling reason - while it should be a puzzle, even the back of the container gives away your capacity to incarnate a broad assortment of characters inside the city. In any case, even this segment is never put to magnificent use, as each and every character you can control has every one of the reserves of being unequivocally practically identical paying little regard to what he or she takes after. What's more, the problems in the redirection are irrelevant or tedious and join arrange arranging, coordinate number juggling, weakening errands, and some confuse. The riddles are never troublesome, however your objectives are habitually ambiguous, which is the reason you'll routinely wind up circling the city with nothing to do. Omikron is a long amusement, yet none of its play parts are fulfilling, and rather they all vibe like they've been executed to give helping from each other, as when Omikron's deceptive exchange offers approach to manage winding, and when the meandering forms into shooting, and when the overlong gunfight at long last comes down to a reasonable one-on-one fight. Regardless of the way that Omikron impeccably moves between its differing play styles, these grungy play mechanics are as moved as they are unenjoyable. In the event that you like experience redirections, first-particular shooters, and doing fighting beguilements, then you'll number various cases inside every sort that beat Omikron supportively. Similarly, in the event that you don't incline toward these sorts of beguilements, you'll see that Omikron's development groupings smash the pacing of and raise the mistake with what may have been exceptional off as a more customary issue distraction. In either occasion, you'll see that Omikron's deduced progression and ingenuity connote just the silly blend of insignificant yet to an awesome degree without a doubt comprehended play styles. At long last, Omikron's enrapturing plot and unprecedented representation won't additional you from its bamboozled graph.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												I'm a newcomer to this game, never played it back in the day. I'm a David Bowie fan so that was my main motivation for the purchase. The soundtrack is awesome, especially the intro movie track. I'm also a Cyberpunk fan and Omikron has that kind of vibe in spades.Omikron gets some flack for it's dated visuals and controls. The visuals are on par with the time, so don't listen to those that say the game is ""ugly"". It wasn't beautiful in it's day, but on par for certain. Deus Ex is ugly by today's standards too. The controls are hard to get used to but they too were par for the course in 1999. The contols remind me of the original Resident Evil.As for the game itself, I'm not very far in, but it's holding my interest. For some reason it gives me vibes of three specific movies, none of which are related to this story: those movies are Blade Runner, Demoition Man, and Terminator.I ran into several hiccups after launching Omikron on my Windows 10 PC. I've worked past all those and have created a guide in an effort to help others as well. Hope it helps someone out there...enjoy!

												Weird and divisive, but the worldbuilding is on point. The gameplay defies genre-- it's got 3rd person shooting, adventure game puzzles, and some wonky fighting game mechanics. The atmosphere is honestly amazing for the time period. Also, David Bowie had quite a hand in the OST, which is just as weird as the game. The controls are incredibly wonky, and the game runs on limited saves, which I've always disliked as a concept. Still, it's worth a buy, if only for the soundtrack.You might have trouble getting it to run on some PCs.			"

												If you are here to see Bowie, you must know a few things. You must be ready to take a lot of abuse if you plan to play this game. Seriously, this is not an easy game to like.Controls are awful. First of all Nomad Soul doesn’t support analog joysticks so xbox360 controller is out of the question. Keybindings affect menus so after changing them to WASD you have to use menus with WASD and there is no mouse support. Most of the time you move around in a city, talking to people and searching for places. In these section you can’t strafe or use mouse look. Usable objects are not highlighted and sometimes hidden in places that you can't see them. You find them by accident. Textures are so muddy that it’s really easy to miss doors, since everything looks so flat. You can only save at set save points which are really far apart. Fighting is not well made and while the first person shooter element works, it's really really clunky.On my machine the game runs perfectly well exept when there is a lot of non-polygonal (sprite) objects on screen. For example the inventory screen is made mostly of sprites and runs at horrific frame rate that makes it really difficult to use.I’m not trying to bring the game down. Just saying that a 1990’s pc player mindset is needed to enjoy. Just to see the cutscenes i'll recommend a let's play. If I can keep going, I’ll post a proper review later.			"

												Putting it simply this is one of the greatest video games I have ever played. The gameplay blends a mix of third person adventure, first person shooter and even Tekken-style fighting sequences. Exploring through a rich and futuristic city you will  uncover a compelling storyline that mixes both sci-fi and spirituality into a dramatic experience that will make you wish for more once it is over. This game was well ahead of its time and features David Bowie as both a crucial plot component and feature via in-game performances from his album 'Hours'. If you enjoy good writing, adventure, sci-fi etc then you should play this game. The only downside I can speak of is it seems to be a bit buggy, though this might be a local issue.			"

												My feelings towards Omikron are very mixed. It is certainly one of the most unique games I've played... but it's a bit too unique for my liking. What I mean is, the game has a lot of variety- but not a lot of variety in it's actual gameplay. There are sections where you walk around and talk to people, sections where you swim, sections where you shoot enemies, and sections where you fight Mortal Kombat style. But there isn't much variation to this at all, and each gameplay has some hick in it; something that makes it really clunky to play around with.The graphics are fine in Omikron. I have no problem with them. But my problem is the animation. Faces make strange expressions and people over-emote by gesturing wildly. It's almost comical to watch at times. As far as stories go, Omikron's is the most involving I've played. It goes to great lengths to make sure that you know that you are NOT playing a game, but interacting with a very real world with very real consequences... but that had no effect on me, as I would often correct my mistakes by booting my old save up and trying again. And the design of the world and flow of the story is way too vague for me. A lot of the game almost requires you to look up a game guide, as the answers to a lot of the puzzles are borderline impossible. And sometimes just trying to find out what EXACTLY you have to do next in order to progress the story can be a massive pain, as you don't telepathically know what the game is requiring you to do.As far as the world and lore of Omikron goes, it's fine, but it has the same problem that Dragon Age: Origins only suffered slightly from- reading. A good lore can be told with subtlties between characters and showing in the dispaly of the world itself. I'd rather see mages practice magic than go to a library and study and make my own damn Beshe'm. (And I PERSONALLY want to know the people who knew how to make a flipping Besehe'm with no guide because none of the stuff I did to make it made any sense at all!)I personally don't like Omikron for it's faults. If it wanted it's consequences to matter, well I'd applaud Quantic Dream for doing a much better job of getting that across in Heavy Rain years later. But as Quantic's first production, Omikron suffers from some massive problems as a game, but it still has charm to it. There is freedom in the open world of Omikron, characters can be fun to interact with, and there is a certain draw I had to the game before I got really tired of playing it really fast- since the missions for The Awakened can get repetitive very quickly.If you want a gaming experience like none you've played before, Omikron is certainly one to fill that desire. But as far as great games go, I'm pretty sure Omikron won't stand the test of time to become a legend.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Back in 2000 I played the Dreamcast port of this game, but never had played the PC version of it untill now. If you've only played the Dreamcast version; the keyboard controls take a little while to get used to, but you'll have it down in a few minutes or so. Overall it's a great game, and I'm happy to finally play it again.			"

												Fantastic game brings back alot of memories and of course it features a bitpart & soundtrack from a Legend that sadly passed away today who also had some input on the storyline and game's design. Pros:- Good soundtrack- Very fun gameplay- Very good story- Really pulls you into whats happening around any character you play- Each character has a bio about them- Cool extensive investigative gameplay- The game doesnt hold your hand the whole way throughCons:- Can get a little confusing and is a very fast paced story- In order to save you have to pick up secretly placed memory rings which I personally think is kind of stupid- The font can get very difficult to read sometimes			"

												I can't speak for the version on Steam since I haven't played this game since 1999... but I have very fond memories of it back in the day. It was a very ambitious game that would have been quickly forgotten if it hadn't been for the awesome David Bowie soundtrack and secret David Bowie concerts to find.The main game is a 3D free-roaming exploration with some basic puzzle solving (not just how to navigate through doors and avoid swearing at the third-person camera), with a couple of completely different game-modes thrown in for good measure - a not-completely-awful one-on-one 3D fighting game and a fairly awful first-person shooter.It was a great place to explore, it had an amazing soundtrack and it was quirky, sexy fun whilst also being delightfully awful and unbelievably cool. Don't expect a perfect triple-A game - expert a nostalgic slice of body-swapping, lizard-feeding gaming history.			"

The writing is rushed and cliche, characters look awful, plays even worse and music is either okay or the worst thing ever. ♥♥♥♥ you David Cage.

												One of my old favorites from way back in the day. Nice immersive story line (many a game designers could take notes) and a hell of a large world for the time it was released. Definitly a big recommendation for anyone that can look past the old-school graphics. The start of the game makes you feel one with the world, and the death mechanics are really unique and interesting.On the downside its a slightly clunky control setup, and the fighting feels really counter-intuitive at times. Especially in the beginning you`ll be like ""how the frack did that npc grab me, and why the hell can't i do anything :<"".  takes some time to get to know nevertheless, but very fun once you get the hang of it.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Omikron - The Nomad Soul is a game developed by Quantic Dream, the same people who made Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls. This was Quantic Dream's first game and I must say its not a bad game. The story sounds interesting, the graphics remind me of early Deus Ex games, the music is by the incredible David Bowie, who also stars in this game, the game is fully voice acted, and I must say, for an old game, the voice acting is pretty goodWhat put me off is the game's gameplay and controls. Although the PC port (this game was developed for the Dreamcast) is good, the controls are annoying. You move with the arrow keys, space to jump, Q to fight and Tab to access your inventory, very annoying controls. The game mostly involves you moving from one location to another and investigating an area. Sometimes the game has fighting sequences which look like they're taken from the old fighting games and sometimes there are shooting sequences, which put me off greatly. The game looks interesting however the gameplay does put me off. The game also has limited saves which will put off some people, including me...Omikron - The Nomad Soul looks interesting but with its gameplay issues and other things, the game did put me off just after an hour of playtime, some people might like but some others might not. I am recommending it because it looks interesting but it does have some flaws RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I played this game for many many hours when it debuted on the Dreamcast, and it is every bit as fun and challenging now, as it was then.  THe highlights of this game for me is that it doesn't hold your hand throughout he whole playthrough, it makes you think about what your doing as if you yourself were the character, remembering pieces of information that you gather, and where you need to go to progress  the storyline.There are only two negatives I can find about this game, and one of them isn't really a negative considering the age of it. The dated graphics (but considering it was released in 1999, you can hopefully forgive this one) The controls on PC are pretty horrendous, but can be made manageable with third party controller programmesOverall though, this game is a great ""on-sale"" purchase, a blast from the past that you should check out. Oh yeah, and David Bowie cameo's in it too.  10/10 "

												For a game that's 15 years old, it still holds up. The story has a fairly silly premise, but is executed fairly well, and is fully voice-acted. David Bowie's cameos are fantastic, but the concerts will drag if you're not into his stuff. Even when he's not involved, the music is still fairly well composed. The controls haven't aged poorly, and the only complaint is that it's built for a gamepad, however, the controls are rebindable, so that's not a big deal. The shooting segments are somewhat awkward, but it may just be personal experience, since I haven't played the game for over 10 years. Puzzles are sometimes cryptic, but the solution generally presents itself in some format, as long as the player's been diligent about picking up EVERYTHING. The lip-sync gets pretty laughable, but it's impressive for a game this old, considering it animates the entire face.The open world is interesting to explore, though it can get a bit tedious since there isn't much to do outside the main story. Variation between the multiple characters is great, and players can always find someone who is fully capable, or at the very least, looks like a badass.I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves classic adventure games or David Bowie.

												Granted I've only started playing this on Steam, I can remember as a child playing this (with the 5-disc PC set)! It was so difficult back then and I was amazed at the music and storyline. Playing it again is just wonderful, even if I'm biased. If you can get past that this was made in the 90s and may not look as great as ""new"" games now-a-days, the game can still be very much appreciated. I would say if you're into mystery solving, a sci-fi/supernatural vibe, and like that there is music from David Bowie with half-naked pixel chicks roaming around, it's worth the purchase.			"

Glad I found the full version on steam!  It has a mix of almost every type of game out there. My only real warning is people people who have not played old school hardcore games, you can save in this game but only a limited amount.  There's this ring save system you have manage when you save.  There are mods/trainers to fix that issue but thats up to you.Buy this game and imploded your mind!!!			"

												Just tarted getting into it but this game is a rarity. We just don't get this level of original creativity and attention to details in this game. Graphics are typical 1999 but it also takes you back to the cyperpunkesque atmosphere. The city really does feel immersive and sets a nice mood. I can't wait to put more time into this. On the negative side the controls are weird and the fixed camera can be quite annoying at times, however it does give a nice feel for the environment. I highly recommend this game if you can look past the weird camera and controls but I'm sure there's a mod for that. "

												Quantic Dream's first game, mostly known for featuring David Bowie, is as wacky as its successors.After being asked to send your soul into a police officer's body in a parallel universe, you replace him in the futuristic city of Omikron, and try to figure out what's going on in a mysterious alien world. It doesn't take long to figure out that nothing in Omikron is what it seems.Unfortunately Quantic devs bit off more than they could chew. The game is too ambitious for its own good, trying to do too many things. The shooting minigame is tedious, the driving minigame adds nothing to the game, and the pacing is completely ruined in the last few hours.Still, go ahead and give it a try if you don't mind imperfect, ambitious games.

												I played this game a while back and have been looking to play it again (but one of my discs had cracked while playing).  The steam version seems to be better configured to run on modern systems than the Gog version (have tried both - gog was unplayable).The gameplay blends FPS and third person adventure mechanics to investigate a mystery in a cyberpunk setting (the switching back and forth gameplay was pretty innovative for the era - 1999).  In addition the ability to switch your character (the you that you're playing as) between various characters (of different genders and races) in the setting provides an intersting way to explore those identities within the culture.  But you still play as you regardless of the shell you're... inhabiting?Also... New Angels of Promise (by David Bowie) is the theme song and it's awesome.			"

												A long, long time ago, in a dark age when WASD was not yet an industry standard, there was this game. It featured low-polygon porn, WipEout-esque zero-gravity cars and David Bowie (may peace be upon his soul). This game was shipped on three CD-ROMS, which you had to switch in order to travel between certain areas. Too much switching caused my drive to break and thus never gave me a chance to finish this game. Even though I have .1 hrs of gameplay on record while typing this review, I can assure you I have several days of gameplay with the CD's 15 years ago. Great game that really deserves a complete remaster, but the controls need some getting used to.And also David Bowie.Did I mention David Bowie?David Bowie.			"

												NOTE: Scroll down for a tip on beating the game.The only reason to buy this game is for David Bowie.Is the game fun?  Shrug, kinda.  At the time it came out, it was undoubtedly unique.  Now this feels dated.  The puzzles are annoying.  The story isn't that great.  It's not nearly as open a world as you'd like.  But hey.David Bowie.  Man.  It's David. Bowie.As Neo.And occasionally singing to you.DAVID BOWIE.Just play it.  You won't regret it.MAJOR SPOILER:The last boss is a HUGE pain.  If you didn't bring a ton of healing with you, just ignore what you read on hint sites.  There's only one way to beat the big baddie.Lure him to the big...stalactite?  Tree?  thing to the right of where he is.  Go around it so you're on the side that is just a tiny area to pass through.  Guess what: he can't walk through this.  He will start to turn around, like a weirdo.  Shoot him in that little blue oval between his shoulder blades.  This will take various tries, he can wriggle out of this, but whatever.  This is FAR easier/actually possible, as compared to the circel/strafe crap everyone else feeds you.  Largely because his jump attack is apparently triggered mostly by being stunned, and this doesn't require stunning.  Also, he's in a glitch trying to, I dunno, turn around to leave? and so he never jumps.  So you can just shoot away.  It's great.  Unless you love annoying boss battles, just do this.			"

												I had this game years ago, but always had a problem getting it to run on my PC because of the ultra-realisitc graphics and 3D models of 1999.  I know: it's just NOT possible for graphics to ever get any more advanced that this.  Am I right?  Because my computer just could not handle the 32 MB of RAM needed to play this beast, I was only ever able to play it on Dreamcast, but is among my favourite games of all time, ranking just below the original Fallout.  That's just how good it is!It's a game that features David Bowie, his music, and his wife is a playable character.  What more is needed?  Nothing, I tell you.  After all these years now I'm able to play the game on PC without problems.  I dusted off my strategy guide (because I still have the strategy guide for this game) and entered heaven once more.I remeber the game being much more difficult when I was younger, but this game is not about struggling to advance further in the game, it is to experience the narrative.  Made by QuanticDream, the company known for its Hollywood-esque cinematic games like Deus Ex, Fahrenheit (or Indigo Prophecy), and Heavy Rain, just to name a few.  However, unlike Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit, you do actually get to play this game instead of going through quick-time events and occasionally getting to walk.  Nomad Soul (or Omikron: The Nomad Soul) requires strategy, it has timed events, gun combat, hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of Virtua Fighter, action events.  Basically this game is cross-genre hybrid of gaming types and it tries to balance them the best it can, though because of the tank controls (Yes, tank controls), things that require precision timing can be unfair. The game is fully-immersive.  You play as multiple characters throughout the game and each one has different strengths and weaknesses.  You, the player, are thrust into this world where you can go to the store to buy things, hang out at the bar, listen to some music, visit your apartment flat, do side missions, or just go through the plot.  The game has a similar feel to Shenmue where you can completely live in this game and ignore the main plot and go have fun in all the different locations.  The game really feels like a city.  There is obvious draw from Blade Runner in the game's design.The game offers some of the old-school-iest things in gaming that you just don't see anymore.  You have limited saves and checkpoints.  The game will require you to find rings to get more saves.  There does come to a point where you will have, like, 30 rings so as long as you play a good chunk of the game each session, you will not use up all your rings.  This really is not for the person who likes to save their game around every corner.  Be prepared to reload just so you don't waste all your rings.  These rings also act as continues, so again, reloading your last save is sometimes better than wasting all your rings. RIP Bowie!			"

												A game from 1999 that isn't up to standard any more.From the sexist fart with the messiah complex who gave you Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit / Indigo Prophecy, comes the very first Quantic Dream game, which doesn't play quite like the others, but kinda does. It's basically (very basically) an open-world RPG, but the progression is linear and there's not much point in exploring. The main part of the game is going from point A to point B. If any combat is involved, it's either a first-person shoot-em-up or a beat-em-up, both again very basic.The game is best known for having David Bowie, which is only really of benefit to Bowie fans. He's in that elite of Phil Collins, Rod Stewart et al where if you don't like all their stuff then their non-single songs are gonna bore the pants off you (personally I'm a Phil Collins guy).It might've been worth playing in 1999, but now, unless you're a Bowie megafan, there's probably another RPG in your backlog or being given away 'free' on Xbox or PS Plus that you'd enjoy far more.

												I played this when it first released and almost finished it back then. I got it on Steam because of David Bowie's death and Square Enix giving it for free, which is a very nice move from their part.Unfortunately, I don't recommend this game.As usually, David Cage's hubris promises a lot and delivers nothing.The writing is clunky, the overall appearance is ugly, the world feels empty and the controls are awful : they change all the time, from relative to the camera to absolute, from keyboard and mouse to controller. Don't get fooled by those who say that WASD wasn't a standard at that time. It was. The only other games from that period that used tank controls were Grim Fandango and FFVII (PC port) and at least, they sticked to them. Omikron wants to be everything and achieves nothing. If you're here because of David Bowie, you're better off watching excerpts on Youtube. And frankly, these are not very interesting songs.If you want to play a game from the same year, from other hubris driven french speaking developers, play Outcast and just compare. Being a game from 1999 is not an excuse.			"

												I bought this game the first day of release on the Dremacast, then i bought on the PC years later. Now i have it on steam :) My System Specs: Windows 7 64bit Ultimate edition SP1, Intel q6600 2.4ghz Quad core, 4gb ddr2 memory, PNY GTX 550 TI 1GB GDDR5 Memory. Game works flawless at 1600x900 / 35-60FPS. I don't run the game at 1920x1080 becasue i record alot and for some odd reason only on steam the frame rate drops down to 12 when recording. Actually to point out, the game runs better non steam version. Drops down to 35 in the big city but still runs good and fast. :)Pros+David Bowie David Bowie MusicDavid Bowie is in this gameBeautiful visuals for a old gameOpen worldMassive open world exploringBeautiful Music -------> Wait until you hear the music at "" jahangir park "". I cried a few times listening to that. I kept going back to that area just to listen to that music. There's also other music in the game which i won't mention that is out of this world, but i won't tell you :)  Credit goes out to Xavier Despas.................................................Pros+ ContinueCharacter voicesCharacters in generalStirp ClubsPlaces to visitCollecting itemsFighting Is fun once you get use to the controlsEpic cut scenesInteresting looking creaturesCombat is very fun using the gun..........................................Cons-Controls could be a bit better, but using the game pad helps.Magic rings crap . If you have rings to save, save them an use them wisely. Puzzles later for the first time can take you a long time to figure out, at least i remember that being that way on the dreamcast. But its not hard puzzles, and its only a few........................................9.5 Ratings.  I recommend that everyone gets this game, its one of the best open world action rpg adventure sci-fi games ever. Rest in Peace David Bowie, you're the man :) P.S. WHERE IS PART 2, COME ON DEVS WE NEED A PART 2.			"

												I bought this  game out of nostalgia, sadly it's all this game offers.It might run with or without workarounds.If it runs, getting it to  render appealingly and to accept your xbox360 controller or derivative requires external mods, wich have been written by some dedicated people, to wich I can only express thanks. (That means in 2 or 3 years , those fixes might vanish if noone backs them up.)After  getting my knockoff 360-pad to work, I wasn't sure if keaboard/mouse or gamepads play worse.The puzzles are very wonky at times and switch from insultingly easy to brainhemoragingly hard on a whim.(I consider everything a puzzle that isn't fighting or shooting in this case) I needed a guide once when I couldn't figure out a puzzle and the guide provided the solution, but wouldn't or couldn't explain how to actually figure it out.The worst part however is the buggines.If you want an example search for ""omikron factory bug"" or similar and you'll find threads about a level in wich you just randomly die at one point. I had this bug and on top of that it was immediatly followed by a rotating platform not being where it was supposed to be but being offset by some meters/feet, rotating in the air, thus making the level impossible, forcing me to reload my last save, wich led to me rage-quitting and writing this probably biased review.So I own the european boxed copy since my early pubescence and until now, I was not able to finish this game due to bugginess/incompatibility. Tha is what my review basically is. It might be one of the best games ever, but you will be lucky if you can even properly play it.			"

												I try to reserve judgement until I've played for a llittle bit of time, but I don't think I can make it far enough here. the controls are difficult.It's hard to enjoy the shooting section in the supermarket when I'm watching enemies rise out of cardboard boxes like they were stairs. It just looks silly. The melee system is shoddy. Half of the time my guy won't punch or kick when I press the button. Also my enemy blocks non-stop while I can't deflect one hit. Dialogue options are treated like you only receive a set number of options, so while I want to ask every question to learn as much as possible, I'm only allowed a few. However the dialogue progesses on set routes, so somehow my character knows answer to questions I didn't ask! I always wanted this game when I was a kid, but I really should have let it remained on my nostalgic wish list.			"

												I first played this game on my Dreamcast console back in 2000 and was instantly mesmerized by it.  I had never experienced such an open world phenomenon within a game.  I can't even estimate how many hours were lost.  It was also one of the first games to really give you choices. Who you talk to, what you say, how you go about accomplishing certain tasks. The variation from explore mode to shooting was a little clunky and the fight mechanics are frustrating at best but the game is more about the story.  The ability to switch bodies was both intriguing and anxiety inducing at the same time. But what if I regret losing my body and can't ever get it back???But let's be totally clear here. Secret underground David Bowie concerts all but made this game a legend.  New Angels of Promise and Survive?? Get out of here.... And so weird too. What other games can you casually browse a sex shop?? I will say this tho, when I rebought the game for PC over a decade and a half later, I forgot just how haunting this game can be. From the soundtrack to the cutscenes but most of all the macabre way that peoples faces freeze once they stop talking *shiver*.... If you haven't played this game....play it. Keep in mind it's 17 years old and the graphics are NOT going to be stellar, but just pretend you're in another universe and let it happen..... =)			"

A decade or two l8r I noticed it on steam and decided to go @ it again having played farenheit and heavy rain and enjoying them also and to be honest I am so glad I did.The game is extremely good minus the terrible control scheme, with a blade runner esque cyber punk setting and intriguing story line, plus an extremely awesome soundtrack by David Bowie, Its an ambitious game for its time with a fantastic atmosphere.So if YOU dont mind old school graphics and dogy old school controls I would advise YOU play this nostalgic trip to the past present and future.

												Game came out in a time when 3D open world games weren't even the standard yet. As a comparison: GTA3 was released in 2001, the Nomad Soul was released in '99.From the very first lines that were spoken by Kay'l 669, it had me hooked. For its time it was one of the best games and one of the best open world games. A unique soundtrack(part of which by David Bowie, who even lend his likeness to a couple of characters). The game had great ambitions, but did not deliver on all fronts. Story was original, adventuring was great, fighting had depth(which i did not expect), but the shooting was lackluster... but it worked. Quantic Dream won my heart with this game. I am still waiting on Omikron2 though, maybe it will happen someday.P.S. Drink Quanta Cola!			"

												DC ports on PC like these makes me really want to buy a USB DC controller adapter and play them with a real Dreamcast controller. The only close to it being the 360 one.Advise is to get the fixes for controllers and/or a patch for YOUR language (if you happen to not know frigging ENGLISH...). Otherwise, optional. But controller is a MUST GET.David Bowie: Your game sucks? Put on some of my music and it'll become a cult gem.Me: I got it for free, so I can't really complain or being one of those reviewers-wannabes.Edit: I also forgot this game went free as a homage to Bowie himself after he passed away.So play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on his name and feel proud after completing it!PS: Bowie is watching you.

Rebinding Run to Left Shift so it works with WASD for some reason breaks it. Minutes past the overlong and offputting opening sequence and I'm struggling to actually work the game. I may revisit it at some point in the future but for now it's simply a disappointment after all these years waiting to have a go.			"

												This is a pretty amazing little gem of a game. I would say def something to add to the collection of cult/ retro classics to hang on to and play randomly when the time is right. The graphics are superb based on when the game was created. The music adds that extra level of charm to the game. The plot of the story I found to be a bit dry but as many of the other reviews say - once you get into the soul jumping part of the game you become very immersed. The fight scenes aspects are also good - though i've yet  to try with a controller which is something I will have to do. I think this game is very unique and is therefore hard to really categorize. It does have many flaws such as poor movement control but as a whole this game is everything that I expected it to be. <3			"

												I took a gamble on this game in spite of the mediocre reviews because i love sci-fi adventures. Unfortunately, it seems i don't have the patience any more for this era of game. The default controls are woeful, though you can WASD-ify them to make it slightly less awkward (no mouselook, though). I was still semi-interested in the world right up until the first battle. The FPS mode is very slippery and difficult to enjoy, but the fighting game mode is the real fun-killer, and this is coming from someone who played the hell out of the first three Mortal Kombat games as a kid. Perhaps it would be easier with a gamepad, but it's almost impossible to get your guy to do what you want with a mouse and keyboard. Given the savegames are all checkpoint-style and you have to go back 5+ minutes to replay the fight it's just not worth my time. The story seems like it could have been okay, but with controls like these it simply doesn't stand up to the countless modern games you could be spending your time and money on.			"

												In the beggining I thought all these genres blend together wouldn't work but they surprisingly do. The exploration part plays just like a Resident Evil game(tank controls), the shooting and fighting sections while somewhat clunky, they are manageable with the right strategy. The story could be a bit more subtle with all the ""videogame"" thing, but it's understandable since in that time they were trying meta narratives.Yeah, good game.			"

Omikron's purported innovation and originality amount to nothing more than the senseless combination of unrelated but very familiar play styles. Omikron combines several types of gameplay with limited success. It's a 3D third-person adventure game with one-on-one fighting and shooting sequences. These conversation sequences, which cut from the game's standard third-person perspective to first-person close-up shots, feature detailed 3D characters that look really good. the game's much-ballyhooed soundtrack provided by legendary musician David Bowie and collaborator Reeves Gabrels isn't as good as you might expect. It lacks variety and matches the city's nondescript futuristic appearance with similarly forgettable techno. A few new Bowie songs are also part of Omikron's score and are effective if extraneous as Bowie's in-game alter ego performs them in concert, in-game. "

												This game is pretty much unplayable. I should have known that something was wrong the moment that I was unable to take screenshots of the game with Steam. I don't know who thought having four different sets of controls that needed to be rebinded individually was a good idea, but I sure hope that they've since moved on from game design. The game dumps you into a really bad sci-fi setting with pretty much zero context and practically no explanation on how to do anything. Tank controls were the order of the day back when this was made but I imagine that even back then Omikron would have been awful. This whole game is proof that videogames were a mistake, Omikron was a mistake.I couldn't even enjoy David Bowie.			"

												Oh jesus..Where can I start in ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this?Well.. Let's go to, graphics..1: Very old graphics, and people are just geometric ""blobs""Controls..2: Despite the graphics being ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I can't even play the game because the controls are ""that"" bad.3: If you try and set controls, the controls won't make any sense from the beginning so setting it is impossible.Cost..4: I got this game free, from a code online (Thank god) 5: A $9.00 game like this is clearly making $0.00Advice6: Don't buy it lol.7: And seriously don't play it, it's just a waste of time, I couldn't even pass the first part of the game without getting irritated. Oh and 8 (Never forget 8 :D) I've never seen such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game in my entire life :cPeople misunderstood this review, it was supposed to be a joke :(			"

												THIS IS NOT A GAME, THIS IS A PORTAL TO ANOTHER DIMENSION CREATED BY DEMONS IN ORDER TO TRAP THE SOULS OF UNSUSPECTING VIDEOGAME PLAYERS. IF YOU ENTER YOU WILL BE TRAPPED UNTIL DEMONS FIND YOU AND SEND YOU TO HELL FOR ETERNAL DAMNATION. THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE IS IF YOU ARE THE LEGENDARY NOMAD SOUL THAT MIGHT DEFEAT THE DEMON LEADER AND CLOSE THE PORTAL FOREVER. >>>ONLY BUY THIS ""GAME"" IF YOU ARE THE NOMAD SOUL<<<oh, and david bowie is in it.

												Why everybody rates positive this game? I mean, yes, the game is awesome, but this is a really old game, you can probably have an error starting the game with your 2GB VRAM PC.I was like 2 hours looking for a solution to ""Your video card does not have enough memory to play The Nomad Soul"" and when I solved now I'm having trouble with the controllers.Is like they take an old game with cobwebs from the garbage and say ""yeah, lets resell this...thing""I've played the Dreamcast version and it was AWESOME, but this one, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												The gameplay is crap.However, amazing world!You are placed into an immersive cyberpunk dystopia with a unique vibe and attention to detail. The story starts as an eerie investigation into a dangerous conspiracy operating at the top levels of an authoritarian power that controls all aspects of the dark city you find yourself in. Later, it suddenly branches out into an Islamic mysticism inspired alien/demon fantasy.David Bowie's involvement goes beyond the animated performance of original songs, he clearly had input into the lore and worked alongside David Cage at least to some degree.Fledgling Quantic Dream + David Bowie branching out = A flawed game, but creative gold!Ignore the #hours played on Steam, I experienced this on the Dreamcast over 15 years ago.

												I remember buying this game in 1999, think it was 3 disc's.... still have them somewhere.  It kept me and my 2 brothers entertained for hours.  FPS, RPG and side fighter all in one.  But heck, it's not 1999 and things change.  You might still enjoy it, buy on special if you must.			"

												I rarely write a review for a game I haven't even gotten into for an hour, but I respect my time too much to put even that much into this game.  Maybe it gets better if you push past the incredibly bland initial scenery and total lack of instruction or direction - but there are just too many good modern and retro games out there to waste on this one.
