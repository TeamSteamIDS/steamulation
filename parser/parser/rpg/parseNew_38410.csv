												The best game ever. It was the best game when it came out, it still is the best game ever made. Now with all the fanmade patches that add the cut content and fix a massive amount of bugs, there is no reason not to try this classic. If I could, I would take this game out, buy it dinner, have sex with it and call it the next day. Then we would start going out regularly, we would fall in love eventually. We would become the couple that has their own inside jokes and are always teasing each other and everyone else would be jealous of us. We would get married and have a child (System shock 2, the second best game ever). We would grow old together, on my dead bed as I lie there about to draw my last breath, Fallout 2 looks at me with tears in it's eyes ""Thank you for everything, you were always so good to me"" and I would take Fallout 2s hand, look it in the eye and say ""No, thank YOU"" then pass away. Updated on 26/11/2016 Still the best game ever			"

												*I have included some tips at the end to help newcomers to the early Fallouts*I remember the hundreds of hours I've spent on the console version of Fallout 3 back in 2011. Fast forward to early 2015, I've decided to try out the older Fallouts, starting with Fallout 2. This being my first ""true"" RPG experience, all of the info and stats, along with the fact that it was a turn based isometric game, made it look intimidating from the surface, but after some researching, the game starts to look less daunting.Just like the Bethesda Fallouts, the game uses the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and the familiar stats, along with traits. Fallout 2 really does gives you a lot of options on how you can adjust your character. Naturally, I (stupidly) chose to have a really buff gunman with perception and agility as my dump stats. I went through the Temple of Trials (the tutorial dungeon) and got demolished. My stats made playing through the game a nightmare. See, unlike Fallout 3, the stats you choose matter a great deal more. Some of stats in Fallout 2 function the same as Fallout 3 (Strength judges carry weight and ability to use weapons, Intelligence increases skill points, Endurance increases HP and resistance, Agility affects Action Ponts, Luck increases stats slightly and influences random encounters). However, some act differently. Perception affects how acurate you are at longer ranges, every single action requires Action Points meaning that high Agility builds are better for combat, Charisma affects the number of companions you can have, and low Intelligence can effectively deny you from a large amount of quests and activities.With this information, I remade my character and went back into the Temple of Trials. It must be said, however, that the Temple is a very poor representation of the game. The game forces you to use melee and barely gives you enough healing items to get past the darn thing if you don't use hit and run tactics with high agility. Fallout 2 gives you no information regarding mechanics, and it's clear that the devs were forced to phone in a tutorial segment (if you can call it that).Fortunately, the game starts to show its magic after you exit the Temple and rejoin the villagers of Arroyo, the home of the decendants of the protagonist of the first Fallout. The village is dying and you are tasked to gind the G.E.C.K, a device that can help bring life back to the village. From there, you find a multitude of interesting characters and locations, such as New Reno and its many gangs, to the Broken Hills with its super mutants. Although there is a small amount of quests compared to the later games, the quality of the dialogue and the world you are thrown into makes it easy to forgive. The game also includes some returning characters from the first Fallout, which give some background to the protagonist and the events of the first game. Unfortunately, the humor of this game is something that may not be appealing to some, however. Fallout 2 does include many pop culture references and fourth wall breaks, which does get tiring admittedly.Combat in this game is very enjoyable and has a satisfying punch to it, with gory animations accompanying sounds of limbs being blown off. The amount of weapons in this game is fairly reasonable, but this is mainly towards the end where you have gained large amounts of money and can handle the tougher enemies with better loot.Overall, Fallout 2 is a real classic of a game. It may be hard to adjust as a newcomer, but the game is very much worth it.*Some tips*- You have four types of cursors in the game (switch by using M2), a yellow arrow (click on items to interact, hold M1 to get a list of interactions), a red hexagon (decides where you go), a hand (decides what you pick up in the inventory screen), and a red crosshair (decides what you shoot, only accessable when you are in combat).- You can break wooden doors by using melee on them or using a grenade.- To use Skilldex skills, click on the skilldex button, choose the skill and then the item you want to use the skill on.Examples: Click on Doctor and yourself to heal. Click on Lockpick and a door to lockpick. Click on Steal and a person to steal.- Before exiting towns or talking to important characters, save.- To change the action done to a weapon you are holding, press M2 on the weapon box. For guns, this can change them to Single Fire, Aimed, Burst (If the gun has it), or Reload. The green ticks on the side of the weapon represent the ammo level.- When bartering, make sure to get change from transactions. For example, if I bought a gun that costs $1000 and gave a gun that costs $950, I need to bring the vendor's money into the transaction area to get money. In this case, I would ask for $50.- The red button above the inventory button helps switch weapons.- To enter combat with friendlies (or unaware enemies), click on your weapon. To end combat, press the CMBT on the bottom right. To end your turn, press Turn. (Also on the bottom right).- Rest by clicking the Pipboy button and clicking on the yellow button on the top of its menu. This can only be done after finishing the Temple of Trials.-  You can scavenge extra ammo from dead NPCs by using the yellow cursor and choosing the ""unload gun"" icon (picture of a gun and magazine) from the interation list.

												THIS GAME.THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.BUYING THIS GAME WAS ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES I EVER MADE.I started this game up expecting to have a good time, as I did with the other Fallout games. I'd played Fallout 1, and I'd heard from almost everyone that Fallout 2 was FAR superior. I throroughly enjoyed Fallout 1, but my main problem with it was that the game was timed, and practically forced you to rush through it. Because of this, I felt as though my experience with the game was cut short. The main thing I was looking for when I started playing Fallout 2 was a lengthier game that would allow me to explore and progress at my own pace.I got more than I could have ever hoped for.The game started out slow, much like many other RPGs, and frankly, it was a bit boring for the first few hours. But I knew from my previous experiences that Fallout games only get better as you progress. I made it through the first few areas, and started getting a feel for how things worked, finding plenty of new quests, etc. It was becoming rather enjoyable, then I got the car, which would allow me to carry more things, and explore the wasteland with much more ease. It was very exciting, almost like getting my first car all over again. And at that point I was hooked.Everything from that point on is a bit of a blur, I remember traveling from city to city, back and forth, looking for every quest I could possibly find. The process of finding better and better gear for my three companions was addicting, the process of ensuring the prosperity of all the settlements was addicting, the atmosphere is addicting, becoming famous for various reasons across the wasteland was addicting, the fact that the game goes into so much detail and lets you influence the way things play out was addicting. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS ADDICTING!I couldn't help it, hours and hours of my life were being sucked away, and there was nothing I could to about it except keep playing. IT WAS AMAZING.The final toll was a little over 66 hours for me. And that was all spent on a single playthrough. When I FINALLY beat the game, I felt a feeling of happiness and satisfaction that I haven't felt in YEARS. But most of all, I felt an overwhelming sense of FREEDOM. NO LONGER WAS I SHACKLED BY ITS IMMENSE QUALITY, BY ITS SHEER BEAUTY. I will never play this game for the first time again, that makes me both relieved and depressed. Depressed, because this game is phenomenal, because it is one of the best games I ever played. But relieved, because I will never lose that many hours that quickly ever again.This game is a true gem. It is an incredible, immersive experience even by today's standards, and in fact, shïts all over most modern RPGs.That's the problem, though, this game is TOO GOOD. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna start my evil playthough.			"

												Destroys everything, one of the greatest pieces of art ever created, Fallout 2 is an RPG in which you play a tribesman who is tasked to find and return a device to his village known as the G.E.C.K (which is a piece of technology that is able to revitalize areas of a post-nuclear wasteland, transforming dead, irradiated soil into viable land suitable for farming) to save his people from famine. The plot is subtle and a great break from all the melodramatic, save the universe type♥♥♥♥♥♥most games consist of.Fallout 2, like the first, gives you a large, brutal and unforgiving world to traverse at your own risk, full of genuinely fascinating locations and extremely interesting characters to interact with; from scientists who give mutated scorpions chems to their increase intelligence, talking plants and a highly intelligent and articulate Deathclaw, there are tons of geniusly fantastic, memorable characters to interact with through-out and even though Fallout 2 doesn't always take itself too seriously and is sometimes outright comical the game still portrays a grim, cruel and extremely immersive world like no other.Fallout 2 features some of the finest role playing out there, with tons of meaningful choices and consequences through-out which question your ethics and morality on a far deeper scale than just simply being the good / bad guy. The quests you recieve in Fallout 2 are diverse and often offer multiple ways in which you can complete them, some ways which were not even intended by the developers, there is just so much freedom of choice here that is completely non-existent in 'RPGs' today.The character building is brilliant and has a ton of depth, every little stat directly affects how your game plays out, being highly intelligent with the personality of a brick or being a knucklehead with the charisma of a dictator will deeply affect how NPCs interact with you. There are so many choices to make in character building that have huge, meaningful impacts on the world around you that multiple playthroughs are essential to experience what this masterpiece has to offer.The visuals at first glance may seem bland and out-dated but the art direction is beyond brilliant and is complimented by believable, excellent world design and an insanely thick atmosphere - this doesn't feel like videogame world nor like it was designed to be one, rather an actual post-apocalyptic place.The sound effects are absolutely spot on. The ambient, non-intrusive music through-out is fantastic and adds a lot to the atmosphere and the voiced dialogue is pretty well done. Fallout 2's combat is turn-based and offers a ton of depth, giving you the opportunity to use a tactical approach rather than just mindlessly clicking away like in many of todays so-called RPG's - I do however encounter frustration with not being able to control friendly AI in combat and as a result get shot in the back and watching friendly AI running at an isolated enemy instead of backing up your character who then gets outnumbered and killed is rage-inducing to say the least, these flaws only occur right in the beginning until you get used to pathing and such but rather big flaws non-the-less. Overall Fallout 2, along with Baldur's Gate, Darklands and Planescape Torment are the pinnacle of RPGs in every regard and will probably remain that way until the end of time judging by how far the genre has declined since. You can't call yourself a fan of RPGs until you have experienced these absolute masterpieces, if you're interested in playing Fallout 1 or 2 for the first time and haven't played anything of the sort before I'd advise a lot of patience in the early stages which by judging from some of the negative reviews is too much to ask for some. This is a mandatory experience for anyone who loves videogames, experiences like this simply don't exist anymore.			"

												If there is a genre of games which I value and play above all others it's first person shooters. Especially competitive MP FPS games like UT, Quake, Counter Strike etc. However every once in a while comes a game that isn't a part of those genres and it's so bloody good that it makes an exception to my preference. This recommendation is for Fallout 1 and 2 which are easily bought in a cheap value pack. Without a doubt they stand as some of the greatest games ever made. Even if they are technologically way behind the times, the concept idea and execution are so well done that this become one of the biggest benchmarks for role playing games in general.These games are simple to explain, it's a free roaming massive quest based role playing game. You start the game with entire world open to you, hardly any restrictions and it's up to you to what happens. There are absurd amount of choices in pretty much everything. Make a character that is a gunslinger, sniper, brute using melee weapons, a silver tonged diplomat, a retard who can only communicate via grunts and hardly understandable shouts,a slaver, evil to the core son of a ♥♥♥♥♥. it's all open to you from start. The character creation portion is extensive, complicated and delightful to how much you can plan out for your game. This is followed numerous ways to solve problems. Almost every problem has multiple solutions, ranging from taking different sides (pleasing or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off factions), violent approach, diplomatic approach you name it. A person won't help you with something you just take your gun and kill them, then face the consequences. Game is really harsh, anything rash and dumb can easily end up with game over.One huge praise to the choice presented to the player is the adult theme that isn't dumbed down (unlike the more recent Fallout 3 and NV(though NV to less extent)). You can become a porn star, ♥♥♥♥♥ yourself out for services and persuasion, you can kill children and be labeled as a Childkiller. Everything you do reflects your standing in the world and how NPCs look at you.Another big praise is how humor is incorporated into this wacky, grim post apocaliptic world. Expect several monty python references and spoofs.It's seamless and fitting. It's amazing how well such wacky humor incorporated into dark games such as these two.If there are downsides it's that vanilla games are rather buggy. I recommend Killap's unoffical patch/restoration project for fallout 2 and the appropriate patches for fallout 1. Check No Mutants Allowed for patches. Get the resolution patch as well. This way you can upscale the resolution to more modern standard.I could sit here all day and write about the insane amount of cool things to do in this game, but that's better to be experienced in person. Do yourself a favor and if you like RPG games where you are not shoehorned into a path, play these game. They are most certainly some of the best you will ever play.			"

												While Fallout 2's wacky humor and ridiculous references to things like Monty Python and the Holy Grail might not be for absolutely everyone, it does have a much larger world with much more content than Fallout 1 that is, in my opinion at the very least, of equal quality as it's predecessor. The story shares some similarity to the first game, as you play a tribal descendant of the Vault Dweller, sent out to find a device that will save your dying village of Arroyo from famine and disease.The world, though, feels much larger, showing far more signs of development over the years. Old towns like the LA Boneyard and Junktown have disappeared off the map, replaced with or absorbed into new, more solidly established places like the New California Republic, an evolution of the town of Shady Sands, a San Francisco Chinatown populated by chinese refugees and even New Reno, a city of vice and sin populated by casinos, porn theaters, drug dealers, and gangs of post-nuclear mafiosos all going at each other's throats for control of the city.Mechanically, Fallout 2 tightens up a lot of stuff from the first game. Most immediately noticeable are things like a ""Take All"" button in container menus, an option to push NPCs out of the way non-violently should they ever block your path, and an overhaul of the companion system, allowing you to get one extra character in your party for every two points of Charisma, with the limit maxing out at five companions for ten Charisma, and the ability to change every companion's strategic options if you don't want them accidentally mowing you down with a Vindicator Minigun.Although Fallout 2 was criticized heavily for it's buggy and rushed state of release, with a large chunk of content never seeing the light of day, it has since received support from modders that fix all of these issues. Most notable are sfall, which makes many engine tweaks and quality of life improvements, and Killapp's Unofficial Patch and Restoration Project, which respectively patch out all the major bugs in the game and fully implement all the cut content seamlessly into the game.All this put together, Fallout 2 is a very large, but tight package with solid mechanics and fun writing, injecting even more personality into the wasteland than the first game. It can miss the mark sometimes, but on the whole it feels like the writers had a fun time, and the game itself is well worth playing even today. Whether or not you're a lover of old-school RPGs, Fallout 2 has a lot on offer, and most of it is pretty superb.			"

												Just over a decade ago, life was simpler and more frivolous, so every fictional discovery was fascinating and entertaining. It was in that simple, mid-teenage life, that I dug Fallout 2 out of a fortunate coincidence. A disc copy of the game, in a modest gaming magazine, to whose cover it was poorly attached. It seemed interesting enough, and with little knowledge of cRPGs or English, I went home and gave it a try. Boy, was I enthralled by this game. A game which would, about ten years later, still be the most cherished piece of gaming I have ever experienced. Fallout 2 ventures deep into the dark territories of humour and morbidity. Not many have the grit for its atmosphere, inauspicious and heavy as it is, its dense soundtrack that evinces feelings of gloomy solitude and decadence; exactly the vibe you have got to be in when playing any Fallout title, for that matter. Back when I first tried it, I would engage in conflicts between the curiosity to explore its narrative and the uneasiness caused by that very atmosphere, even after having previously and briefly tried Planescape: Torment - an equally dense game. Fortunately for me, I got past that.Provided that you can also overcome such uneasiness, you've got an unparallelled RPG challenge ahead of you. Fallout 2, very much like its predecessor, is beautifully written, and cleverly designed in a way that connects your actions to the realities and contextual changes of Northern California as you go. The turn-based combat is typical late-90s cRPG gold. The S.P.E.C.I.A.L role-playing system, a jewel derived from Gurps, offers you that edge of character construction and skill management that makes a bonafide RPG pleasurable. The post-apocalyptic setting and aesthetics, built on the famous premise of the Divergence - the historical fragmentation in which the fictional linearity of the game took a different course from that of our world in the heat of the Cold War, leaving the former with that futuristic-50s style -, renders Fallout's identity unique and typically dark humoured. Its characters are deeply unpredictable and credible, especially the companions, much more mature than those of the previous installment (with all due respect to the likes of Ian and Dogmeat). The game leaves that bitter feeling of longing in the player's mouth should they pass away or have to be left behind for some reason. Each companion adds to the player's enterprise, each has their own story, each has their own passions and motivations. And flaws.Fallout 2 appeals to multiple audiences. Those looking for an RPG; those looking for a post-apocalyptic piece; those looking for a story-driven game; those looking for open-world dynamic narratives; those looking for a demi-horror title; and so forth. While it may not touch some of these categories in depth, it is a game that brings them all to a perfect harmony. Be ready for a challenge, an unforgiving gameplay, but be also ready for enriching rewards that will open your mind to new spheres of role-playing gaming.			"

												- Starts game.- Completes Temple of Trials tutorial. - Wanders around home village for a little while, helping people solve trivial problems to gain a little experience.- Exits to world map, starts heading due South.- Stops to save often on the journey South, as the region is extremely dangerous and he is still only Level 3.- Randomly encounters Fire Geckos, dies horribly in flames. Relaod at last save.- Randomly encounters Deathclaws, dies horribly torn limb from limb. Reload at last save.- Reaches southwest coast of California, begins searching about world map.- Randomly encounters Super Mutants, dies horribly riddled with 5mm bullets from a minigun. Reload at last save.- After a short search, locates secret Enclave base hidden behind an old gas station by the coast, just North of San Francisco.- Sneaks into Enclave base, collects standard-issue Enclave Advanced Power Armor and Plasma Rifle.- Sneaks out of Enclave base.- Goes on to handily dominate every foe in the game and save the Wasteland, in style.- Is not a cheater, just knows this game that well after playing it for more than 1,000 hours.10/10 Would murder Mr. Bishop and sleep with his wife again.

												A classic for the ages. When I hear Louis Armstrong on the radio it immediately takes me back to geckos, rad scorpions, and those secure vault tec vaults. The graphics are old but the gameplay and story are great. I feel the content is a bit greater then the orginal fallout making it to be a very long game. Your goal is not only a main quest but also to intervene with the towns and locations you encounter. The ending is the best because it tells you the later fate of all those you've helped or destoryed. One of the best video game endings ever!~update~ I failed to mention this before. Your SPECIAL stats are very important. You will miss a lot of side quests with a low Charisma (people will refuse to talk to you). Other Special stats might play a role at times. Its best to keep them atleast above a 3 or 4. The Gifted trait is a great choice to get 7 extra points to allocate anywhere.			"

												Second volume of the legendary role-playing game about humankind after Doomsday, very thorough both in the battle system and in interactions with the world around player. World with numerous different characters, situations and occasions. And with constant multiplicity of choices for every your step, of course.Now, with the High Res mod which Steam finally added into the launcher. Without that mod, you couldn't play this classic on everything upper to WinXP, which was a bummer really. So glad that Steam finally fixed it…Some of my friends are so purist they think Fallout 2 was a misinterpretation of the first, the-one-and-only, Fallout game. Thanks to Heaven, I'm not one of them. On contrary, I'm enjoying the second game more, for all additional content it have with comparison to the first game. Which was great, but a little straight-forward closer to the end.In the Fallout 2 I've spent dozens and hundreds hours of my time, found so many secrets and easter eggs... It is like a town where you were grown. You may be now a big man from big city, but you'll always remember old shortcuts and hiding places where you were at your childhood...Sure it looks dated, and maybe somewhat clunky at first, but, once you get to know that game better, I’m sure, you’ll love it.My mark for one of the most tempting games of my teens age? 10/10, of course! Yes, it’s dated, yes, it’s much harder and unforgivable for beginners than new-age RPGs… But it’s lovely thing. Like some books, that you want to open again and again, or people you always love to meet.			"

												Before i start the review i would like to give you a overview of what i will speak about in the review Fallout 1 Fallout 2 Fallout 3 Fallout NV and maybe Fallout 4 if i feel i need to Story Fallout 2 is set 80 years after the events of Fallout 1 and you are the grandchild of the 1st games's protaganist the vault dweller you are the chosen one of your village Arroyo tasked with finding a G.E.C.K to help save your village.Gameplay Fallout 2's gameplay may not be appealing to the modern genration but once you become familiar with the combat system and the fact that all quests are unmarked the game becomes excellent Fallout 2 sticks to the formula of the first game you can tell this because the games play virtually the same.For me Fallout 2 was definatley more challenging than Fallout 1 and definatley more challening than the newer Fallout 3 and FNV this brings me onto my next pointWhy i personally think fallout 1,2 and NV are better than 3 and 4Personally i think 2 and NV are the best games in the franchise for me Fallout 2 engrosed me into the deaper lore and decisions of the game along with the backstory. When i comes to the ending of Fallout 3 there is only one major outcome of the game (Im not going to spoil if some of you havent played Fallout 3) and the end credits just talk about what sort of person you were in the game. Whereas in Fallout 1,2 and NV the way you handle quests in different areas and your actions in these areas affect the areas future in a deaper manner. for example Fallout 1,2 and new vegas in the end credit scence you hear things like ""Your involvment in this town and how you did this mean the town prospered or the town was quickly eradicated"" Wheras in fallout 3 this isnt there. General overview of Fallout 2 Fallout 2 is a timeless classic of the Fallout franchise and for those who consider themselves die hard fans of the fallout series you should get this game also if you do get the game also download the resteration patch from the No mutants allowed forum it adds cut content into the game and fixes bugs and generally makes the game better overallNote: In no way in this review am i hating on Fallout 3 i think Fallout 3 is a brilliant game and i recommend it to anyone but i do not think of it as a Fallout game that stays true to the originals like Fallout New Vegas did Thank you for taking the time to read this review			"

												Fallout 2 is by far the worst Fallout game I've ever played, a total abomination. Character Customisation: You actually have to put thought into your character, their special points ACTUALLY matter through the game, if that isn't enough to bore you to tears, I don't know what will. Way too much thinking and planning.Speech: How the hell do I get quests? Everyone in every town always wants to make conversation with me about pointless nonsense, like as if you were having an actual conversation with a person? Seriously? A horrendous design flaw. And don't even get me started on the options for speech, way too many. I need to take a break just reading one paragraph of text.Factions: So It turns out that there MORE THAN TWO FACTIONS in this game. And you actually have to talk to them, and worst of all, they all have their own motives and goals for you to learn about? why should I care about the history of vault city? Or why the enclave are there? Fallout 3 did it much better, good vs evil is so much simpler. A lot less character in the npcs and more killing. Like a good Fallout game.Story: If you want a snore fest of a story based around topics such as human evolution, science, vengeance, slavery and long list of boring, broad and ethical topics, this is the story for you. But for the real Fallout fans, just go to 3. The story is 1000 times better than this garbage.Boss encounters: Why would anyone want to waste time having a final conversation with the boss, learning about their motives and their goals and even potiential sparing of their lives, when I could just kill them? A waste of everyone's time.Map/Travelling: The worst map in all of Fallout's history, why would I want to travel a realistic world where people have naturally built places far away for tactical and territorial gains when in Fallout 3 Every location is close to each other? You'd think they would have thought of that earlier. If you want to play a good Fallout game, play Fallout 3 or 4. Not this garbage.			"

												Oh boy, where should we start? Well, at the very least, in 2016 this game still manages to make me completely forget about everything else (including other games from this series) and forces me to spend a week or so on another playthrough. This game is not perfect, but it doesn’t matter: it captivates with benefits, while allowing to ignore the disadvantages. Bugs are pesky though, as well as newer OS compability.Pros:Engulfing atmosphere. The whole world is marvelously crafted to be believable and interesting. Poor cities look like a crumbling mess, striving to survive, rich cities shine in the Wastes, contain quests connected to political issues around the post-apocalyptic California and involve a lot more features that you could imagine.Simple and effective RPG-system. Famous S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system didn’t change a lot from the previous game, but everything else did. Level cap - 99, you could say there is none, and this allows for unlimited potential for any character. Perks & Traits revamped and adjusted. Skills are now much harder to develop. As a general reminder, this game allows you to create a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character that speaks in grunts. What’s not to love?Gruesome combat system. It is more unbalanced than Fallout 1’s combat system, but it delivers much more fun than previously. No more 8 HP human critters - people tend to live longer and hit harder. “Gore”-geous gore, get it? Death animations are extremely satisfying. The whole process of trying to squeeze multiple actions into 5 to 16 possible action points is engaging and rewarding when done properly.Possibility to become a pornstar and arm wrestle wtih supermutant (your punishment for loss is getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sell your friends, drugs, weapons or Elvis pictures for money, get involved in a shotgun wedding, talk♥♥♥♥♥♥to an army officer via network, etc. Lots of dark humor.Cons:Bugs on bugs. Crashes, save corruptions, graphical glitches. Get ready to google patches and fixes.Bizarre amount of pop and cultural references. Even though I listed dark humor as a good thing, sometimes this game just throws a lot of stuff at you, like quotes, characters, etc. This is not a great thing for me, surely it maybe not a good thing for others. Fallout 1 is a better choice for a more “serious” post-apocalyptic adventure.Old graphics. Aside from meaty execution animations, graphics aged poorly. Not a turn-off for old cavalry, but it is a disadvantage that’s present.In general: 11/10 game, cult status, prospering series. If you say “post-apocalypse RPG”, Fallout is the first thing that comes to mind. And this part is the pinnacle of it. Surely, Fallout 3 is better in combining old and new, but Fallout 2 is superior in everything else, and not only inside the series itself.I’ve gotten a lot farther than I should have. But then again I’ve never met any other game like this either. My ride’s over, folks. Time to play.			"

This will improve your accuracy. You will miss quite often in the Temple of Trials, but don't get discouraged; you've still got plenty of room to grow, and if you distribute your skill points correctly, the rest of the game should make it much easier to hit things.And that's not ever scratching the surface of what you can do. Games like this aren't for everyone, but if you don't have a problem with reading a lot (it is an RPG), then you should at least try this game. It's one of my favorite games ever, as I have owned the original disc far longer than I've had an account on Steam. I strongly recommend you try to play it, even if you don't like it in the end.			"

Fallout 2 is my favorite RPG. If you have played it, I hope you enjoy it too!If not, give it a chance sometime. It took me about 80 hours to complete.PROS:+ Turn-based tactical RPG action that doesn't mess around+ Almost every character skill has a very good reason to invest in, unlike Fallout 1, a major improvement from the original+ Hilariously violent, painstakingly crass world to explore and subjugate; leave your safe spaces and idealisms at the door, as you will do terrible things throughout the game (and enjoy it)+ Lots to see and do, oodles of secret content+ Many quests have multiple outcomes that persist throughout to the end, often with obscure ways to complete+ Says the ""f*ck"" and ""sh*t"" words, way before you saw it in the console world, relays tone of the world+ You can be a porn star+ Kids steal your stuff and sell back to you at a markup+ Michael Dorn (Worf from the Star Trek) is in it+ No autosave or V.A.T.S. crap; git gud baby+ Untainted by the Bethesda Fallout canonCONS:- Runs like absolute garbage on newer machines; crashes at the worst times(your milage may vary depending on how much you want to invest in playing this game)- The 'meatier' gameplay elements like Action Points and Sequence can be a little daunting for some, mostly unfamiliar players			"

												It has some of the coolest dialogue  ive ever experienced. It is really funny and gritty. In fallout 4 nothing you said changed peoples reactions. This game is totally different because sometimes it completely alters the quest if you♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off. It  is a true rpg because you have to have skill checks for pretty much everything. The combat is really challenging and even though the graphics arent that great all it is is numbers so it doesnt matter that the graphics arent good cuz its still fun. Its one of my favorite games of all time and i havent even beaten it yet. I just like this type of game where you have to read and it really gives you a good sense of choice and consequences for your choices. I wish they made games like this cuz they are a lot of fun. I just dont think people like to read and thats a shame.			"

 I beat this game as a kid (and the First One, and i still play it as a man.)-This game just stays classy. Post-Apocolyptic, Chaotic World. I wish the new Fallouts still resembled this fully as the original game designers intended fallout to be. Sex, Drugs, Alcohol, Guns, Mutants, Raiders.- I loved this  because you can be bad, and kill every thing in your path. There are no such things as invincible people.  *Bethesda* {cough, cough} - This killed the new fallouts for me.-Any Ways, Get past the slow game play and the graphics and you have this wonderous story line. - -You have almost everything you can imagine, hell on earth with out the demons and of course satan. (Well i guess you could play as satan)-Anyways just remember this isn't really a review just a little bullGot You! and just a little speel on how great this game is.

												Fallout 2 is a game that went under my games to play radar for far too long, mostly because when it came out I wasn't even   in primary school yet. I'm typically not the biggest fan of this kind of post-apocalyptic setting, in fact this is the only one I like. I owe my discovering this masterpiece entirely to the streamlined fallout experience by Bethesda and later Obsidian.I found the first dungeon to be ruthless my first playthrough, it took me a reload or two before I managed to survive the initial trial and start the main quest. When I emerged into the wasteland of Fallout 2, I was a bit intimidated, every direction on the map had opened up to me. The main quest giver did point me in the direction of a nearby town, but I wanted to see how far south I could go, maybe discover a cool town or two. Nope, I just ended up with plenty of bullets in my corpse. I decide to not go south when I reload and instead go to the town that the elder directed me to, this is where I lost interest initially. I ended up not in the mood to read any of the dialogs that would've pointed me in the right direction and instead gave up. A few months pass and on a whim I decide to reload my save and see if I can't make any headway in game. After I did a few side quests I really started to enjoy myself, the battle system I found unforgiving started to feel a little rewarding, and I kept going.I am a little sad however, I'm nearing the final content of the game and I'm trying my darndest to make my remaining hours on my character, the powerfist wielding warrior Gertrude, last as long as possible.PROS:-The game has aged well in my opinion, the graphics may not look as sharp as some people may desire, but the game is  still entirely playable.-The combat is very fun after the initial slow burn, I'd say about level 5 is where it took off for me.-The characters have been very fun, I can recall most of the characters I've run into in Fallout 2, the same can't be said of Fallout 3 or New Vegas (granted they each had a few good characters).-Tons of content, I've spent a good 30-40 hours on my current character and still find new quests.CONS:-The game is from the late 90's and has technical limitations because of this (Combat can be very slow when a large number of characters are engaged in battle)-You cannot reload in combat when it is not your turn to move, this doesn't sound too bad but in large battles where you try to keep your companions alive it can be a little bothersome.-There is a time limit in game for how long you can play, it's an unfortunate technical issue, however you have about 13 in game years until you are forced to play a new character (my current character is on year 3 near the end of the game)Final thoughts on the game:This is honestly the best game I've played in past years, it makes me yearn for games that don't constantly hold my hand. Every mistake I make is punished, every good decision I make is rewarded. The myriad of companions in game really made my experience that much better (barring when Sulik would sit in doorways, blocking my only exit). If I had to give this game a number score it'd probably be an 8 or 9 out of 10. There is no perfect game, and this game certainly has quite  a large number of faults, but this is the most fun I've had with a game since my initial Dark Souls playthrough.			"

Her dad walked in on us after the deed was done, and demanded to know what was going on. I then proceeded to tell him that I was a doctor, and I was giving her a full body physical. He then asked me why I had to be naked as well for the physical. Like any good doctor, I told him we needed to make sure no germs could be spread. He then asked me to give him a physical.............. 10/10 would give her a physical again.			"

My review of Fallout also goes for Fallout 2, which took everything that made Fallout great and made it bigger, better, more complex, allowing even more solutions to quests and puzzles. Here the history of the Fallout universe was fleshed out in ways that remain essential to this day. Whereas Fallout was shrouded in mystery and uncertainty, Fallout 2 explored the darkest corners of the post-nuclear world, unafraid to face what lurked in them. In fact it often laughs in the face of the most morbid and dark situations. It was a game for mature audiences in a decade when most games were still trying to be accessible to everyone.The companions are one of the best improvements: whereas Fallout only had four companions and the interactions with them were very limited (mostly talking pack-mules), Fallout 2 offers a total of fourteen recruitable companions with great mechanics of interaction and combat control, which would resurface in Fallout: New Vegas with further refinement. In fact, the way companions work in Fallout 2 is the basis for the brilliant character development that New Vegas would offer many years later. Two of the companions even have their own talking heads, with some very decent facial animation for the technology of the time.The possibility of rebuilding a nuclear-powered car is also a great improvement. Travelling in the wasteland can often be a nuisance, especially when you just want to get to your destination. With the Highwayman you can usually skip over encounters and get from A to B much faster. The trunk is also very useful to stash your loot. The best part is that it's not easy to get the car, not like when you get the first power armor in Fallout 4: it's not just handed to you, you have to work for it, do some quests, find ways to improve it and so on, which makes it much more rewarding when you finally hit the road.While it may seem a bit silly at first, the saga of the Chosen One makes tribalism in the post-nuclear world very compelling and unique. On the surface, what starts as a very long fetch quest becomes in fact a saga that makes perfect sense in the grand scheme of the game, especially when you get to the Enclave Oil Rig. It's an indictment of the very foundation of the United States government, and this was five years before the invasion of Iraq.It is also full of whacky moments and plot twists that later would be poorly imitated. From talking Deathclaws to Chinese computers; from porn studios to midgets who call you a Mad Max wannabe; several instances of characters breaking the fourth wall, and so on. The combination of very dark and adult themes mixed with some very silly jokes is something very unique to this game: it includes an actual Easter egg as an item that does nothing at all.This is not a game for everyone. The first few hours are even more difficult, but if you played Fallout you'll already be used to the UI and have some good sense of how to build a character that can survive and fight. Once you have some good gear and one or two companions to have your back, it's impossible to put it down. It's a long ride: you'll meet many fascinating, lifelike characters; you'll visit great cities and run-down villages; you'll explore caves and vaults; you'll mess around with different ways to accomplish a quest and choose an approach that suits your character; you'll make decisions and live with the consequences. This is what Fallout is and was always about.			"

												Warning: Disliking this game is punishable by death.Methods of execution include being whacked by one of the crime families of New Reno, melted into a pile of goo by Enclave plasma rifles, and getting talked to death by one of the people who run Vault City.*strolls around post-apocalyptic Oregon, Northern California, and Nevada while running into endless pop culture references and idiots who need to be ended.*(Gameplay is highly similar to Fallout 1, but there is vastly more to do here. This game also takes a more light-hearted tone, being filled with a horde of pop culture references from everything from Star Wars to Monty Python to The Godfather. Some might get turned off by this, but it adds funny moments to an otherwise dark and brutal world. Have fun with this... or else!)			"

""War, war never changes!""War remained the same when Fallout 2 was released a year after its predecessor. It was back in 1998 and it was a jolly good time to be a gamer. This game was the perfect example of ""not fixing what isn't broken"". So, game mechanics were pretty much the same while the game world became much, much larger.Storywise we control a Vault Dweller once more - in fact, our protagonist is the descendant of the hero of the first game - who's tasked to save his establishment by acquiring the so-called G.E.C.K., a device with such a power that it can restore completely damaged environments to their default state.Naturally, the ""bigger the better"" concept was followed by introducing a wider range of weapons and enemies and, of course, new environments. We also have more skills, perks and beside Karma we also have a Reputation. Something that is constantly changing along the way as we make progress by completing subquests. You can be attacked in a new town if you have a bad reputation -  settlements are not independent of one another; if you complete a deed somewhere it may very well be heard of elsewhere.Finally, recruitable characters seem to be much, much better. We have total control over them by being able to issue orders, help them level up and provide equipment. Just make sure you have the necessary Karma to be able to recruit them - not that you don't have enough to get to know. With all the new stuff introduced Fallout 2 requires much more time to complete - if you're a completionist you can expect to spend 50-60 hours with the sequel. And, of course, like in case of all such RPGs you can start a new game, pick a different level-up method, solve quests in a different way and hire different people to be at your service.I spent dozens of hours with this game when it came out. I remember being happy of having our own car (called Highwayman) which then could easily disappear (in fact, the game had a related bug which needed to be patched at the time). If you did not pay attention you could lost it forever. It was a shame as it made travelling between towns fast and easy.Fallout 2 is a classic. And it comes patched on Steam which allows us to pick a higher resolution. If you have invested hundreds of hours into Fallout 3 et al you might as well check where it all started back in the '90s.

												      Fallout 3 was one of my favorite all-time games. Naturally, I thought at one point, ""I've played Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but I've never even heard of Fallout 1 or 2. I wonder what they are like?""      Well my question has since been answered. And my god, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest games made. As most people do, let's go through pros and cons. I'd also like to say that I haven't played this game in a long time, so I'm going off memory.PROS:~Story elements. You are The Chosen One, or if you are me, Penguin Johnson. You are the descendant of the Vault Dweller, a member of Vault HMHMHM (woops I can't remember) who saved his/her vault from certain doom by dehydration, when he went out into the wastes to get a Water Purification Chip. Your tribe is dying, brahmin and crops are dying as well. And only one thing can save it. I bet you guessed, ""Me!"" HAH! DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH! No, a G.E.C.K. In fact, if you were the saviour of the tribe, then they would be doomed because of this games...~Difficulty. Fallout 3, while I died a few times, wasn't that difficult. However, when you ask this game for help, it flips you off, and says how about you deal with that guy with a machine gun yourself? It then proceeds to laugh as the machine gun guy burst fires and kills you instantly with a critical hit that does 78 damage, and you only had 5 health. You WILL see the death screen a lot if you are new to this game, but that's an element that makes it good.~So much to explore. This game, has you traversing THE ENTIRETY OF THE UNITED STATES! From San Fransisco, to Klamath. What's that? Never heard of Klamath? Where have you been living, anywhere but in Fallout 2?~So many weapons! You got your pistols, sub machine guns, assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, knives, blunt weapons, fists, fist weapons, light machine guns, miniguns, plasma weapons, laser weapons, and probably even more. And there are a lot of weapons in each of those categories.~Characters. Characters are so unique. You have the ghoul from... the ghoul place who makes a joke about what assuming does. (It makes an♥♥♥♥♥out of you and me). Then you got the leader of Vault City, who I shot many times out of pure  annoyance.NEGATIVES:-This game, is so broken. I'm not kidding. You know how people say Fallout New Vegas is glitchy? NV is the tip of the iceburg of glitches, and this is the entire thing. Luckily, people have made a total conversion mod which fixes most of the game. It's called Project Purification or something like that. I can't remember.-SPOILER ALERT! When you get the G.E.C.K. Why? Because SPOILER ALERT AGAIN the Enclave just kills your entire tribe anyway. What was the point? At least I can get revenge on them. Seriously. You have to. It's a main quest to wipe the Enclave out.So what do I give this game? 7/10. If you didn't have to download a mod this would have been a 9/10 easily, but unfortunately, that's just such a big problem that I can't. But, get that mod, and you will be embarking on a journey, through war. And as they say, war. War never changes. THAT WAS A REFERENCE THANKS FOR COMING!			"

												(In addition, I have hundreds of hours on the original retail version)Where to begin?  This is one of my all-time favorite games, and I grew up with it along with the first game. It was part of my childhood and continues to be a part of my life all these years later, and it will always have a place in my heart.  Fallout 2 is excellent and anyone who likes RPGs who aren't afraid to play a game that isn't entirely welcoming should give it a shot; I admit I am somewhat biased because of my nostalgia but that doesn't explain the entirety of why I think this is an excellent game.  There is *much* more to this game than the references, humor and fourth wall breaking; that being said, the humor is a nice touch depending on your tastes.  This game deserves as much attention and recognition as the first in the series and I consider both games to be one in the same and part of the same collective experience.This is game is punishing in certain ways, and is not that casual of an experience; and in some ways I would admit that this game isn't the most welcoming, but once you figure things out and start to progress there are numerous different possibilities and choices laid out before you, and you can play any type of character you choose and have any type of temperament you choose in this game world, which is rich and unique.Fallout 1 and 2 haven't aged very well, although personally I can transcend that completely due to my nostalgia and attachment to the series; the game looks better now since we can change the screen resolution, and the game is even better with the Restoration Project mod.You are the grandchild of the Vault Dweller from Fallout 1, the game takes place 80 years after the first game, and you are part of a primitive tribe which your ancestor founded.  You must save your tribe by finding the holy GECK.  Along the way in your quest, you can do many interesting things and talk to many interesting characters.The gameplay is the same as in Fallout 1, aside from a few things like starting skills being calculated differently and starting at different levels. Fallout 2 is much longer and there is much more to do and see in Fallout 2 than the first (especially with the Restoration Project mod), although the first game is excellent for many of the same reasons this game is excellent.  Most people who enjoyed Fallout 1 (or similar titles) will probably enjoy this immensely also.  I would even recommend this game to people who don't normally play games like it, but are merely very interested in the Fallout lore.There is an issue I have with the game but only due to playing it on newer, larger displays and playing it on a higher resolution than the game was initially intended for; certain scenes will look wrong if the resolution is set high.In conclusion, this isn't for everyone and not everyone will be able to enjoy it in the same capacity as others might, for whatever reasons, whether it has to do with the age of the game or not.  But this is classic Fallout and deserves as much love as the first in the series.  This game is highly recommended for any fan of oldschool turn-based RPGs, this and its predecessor helped to redefine the genre. This game is old, but it's excellent and one of the best RPGs I've played, and is very well written.I'd also highly recommend the Restoration Project mod, which includes the Unofficial Patch.  It restores new content into the game that the developers intended to have in the first place but weren't able to, and  you can choose which options you would like to install easily. killap.net "

												Nearly twenty years after the fact, this is still my favorite RPG. With the exception of New Vegas, this was the last official Fallout game in which the skill system was, in fact, meaningful and had a significant effect on gameplay.Do you want to be something of a pacifist, with high speech, intelligence, and survivalist skills who runs for cover at the first sign of a fight and has his companions do all the heavy lifting for him? Go for it, Skeeter.How about a post-apocalyptic hard♥♥♥♥♥who just wants to make a living skinning giant geckos and selling off discarded raider gear? You can do that too. The game does have a story and it is actually pretty good, but you're likely going to spend more time doing just about everything else than you are folliwng the main plot, and that is a very good thing.The graphics have not aged particularly well, and the game takes some minor adjusting on a modern rig in order to make it work and look properly, but seriously, don't let that stop you. Once you get used to the visual style, the pixel hunt-like searches for items dropped on the floor becomes the least of your concerrns.You will be far more interested in the cavalcade of goodies that's just fallen to the ground alongside the raider whose chest you've blasted a whole clear through.Also you can murder children, and acquire a perk which reflects said habit of killing children. Game of the year, all years.			"

												My friend got me this game for my birthday... It was a really old game so I wasn't entirely psyched about him getting me this over say another 10 dollar game like garry's mod... but I didn't complain and I started playing it and I must say...AMAZING game, havn't had this much fun with a classic game since the legend of zelda series :P. The one thing that I found a bit buggy or kind of awkward was the sierra army base, which was unlocked after doing quests for the wrights in New Reno. It was hard as nails to get through, didnt seem to be a way to completely disable the forcefields so they wouldnt kill you--I ended up using about 20 stimpacks simply passing through forcefields in that area alone, and one of the quests in there to unlock one of the companions requires you to kill one of the robots which causes the entire army base to aggro on you the entire game and if you unlock the companion they will always be hostile if he isnt with you. At the enclave oil rig there are some of the same robots there as in the sierra army base so they attack you if your not careful; So if you walk by them you agro the entire base full of end-game mobs...Moral of the story-don't do quests for the wright family in New RenoOther than this, i'd give this game a 10/10, its a must buy :P "

												It's hard not to recommend a game like this.  Being the sequel to one of the best computer RPGs ever created, it had very big shoes to fill, yet it managed to fill them.  It's a big adventure, with plenty of places to see and quests to complete.  And best of all, you can go about it pretty much any way you want.  Be it by trickery, stealth, or just plain violence, there are usually multiple solutions to any problem in the game.  Indeed, if you feel like it, you can kill  anyone (yes, even the children) who literally or figuratively stands in your way.  It won't be easy, and there will usually be consequences, but it can be done. However, the game is not very beginner friendly.  Those coming from Fallaout 3, New Vegas, and 4 will likely be frustrated to find themselves missing half or more of their attacks at early levels.  Not to mention the frequent encounters of 5+ enemies at a time while you're travelling, each of which takes a turn each round.  This can result in lengthy encounters which end badly for you.  If you stick with it, however, and pace yourself while also building your character to survive, these encounters will soon become a piece of cake, or a thing of the past altogether.  In all, a fantastic experience awaits you with Fallout 2, and if you have the time and patience for it, you'll in for a hell of a ride.  One final note: if you played New Vegas and found the ""Wild Wasteland"" jokes to be more annoying than funny, then take heed: this game's humor is like Wild Wasteland on jet.  Seriously.  You can't go ten minutes in this game without some character breaking the fourth wall, or making some pop-culture reference or other.  Some of them are really good, but if you're like me, you'll find yourself tired of them quickly			"

												22 of my 50 hours of gameplay are of the actual Fallout 2 - I have that one memorized backwards since I was ~14, the rest I spent on the superb fanmade seq/prequel, Fallout 1.5: Resurrection. This is going to be 2 reviews in one and I can't say that I care if that's okay or not.Fallout 1.5: Resurrectionstays true to the old school Fallout vibe and is aptly named with the mod being very much in-between Fallout 1 and 2. Resurrection starts in 2170, 8-9 years after Fallout 1 and well before 2241, the starting year of Fallout 2. You'll have to deal with the aftermath of the dispersion of the Master's super mutant army. Story wise Resurrection is closer to Fallout 1, being a lot more serious, mature and scientifically plausible than Fallout 2. In comparison, it seems Creative had their drawers stacked to the brim with jokes and pop culture references that then required a game to be built around them with Fallout 2.I did figure out the main plot at about the 10 minute point, but generally I very much enjoyed discovering another piece of the Fallout universe.I've even made a modest walkthrough in case you're a perfectionist and want to get it 'right' the first time around:


Fallout 1.5: Resurrection To Do List 
A Guide for Fallout 2
By: Lauri

			During my first play-through I found myself missing at least some general outline of what can be done in each city. Maybe you're like me.		


Fallout 2The overwhelmingly positive reviews others have left should convince anyone who hasn't played classic Fallout yet to change their ways, so I'm not even going to go into every aspect of the game.As I've already mentioned, Fallout 2 is a lot more jokey than its predecessor, featuring a ghost, aliens, a super mutant magician, talking mole rats, Skynet, Mike Tyson, civil deathclaws, Tragic: The Garnering, scientologists named Juan Cruz and Vicki Goldman and the POTUS to name a few. If it's hard to imagine a story arc that incorporates all of these seamlessly then you're probably on to something. I can't say that all this humor is somehow bad though, just know that Fallout 1 and 2 are different and you may find the latter not quite what you would've expected.I've read a few reviews that call Fallout 2 'slow' and being a total fanboy had to stop and think for a second to digest this criticism, but it's true. 2's story starts off really boring and I applaud any millennial that can sit through Arroyo and Klamath without deleting the game. Without using Cheat Engine or somesuch, shooting and missing a rat or gecko for the 23rd time really is for the dead-of-brain. But I swear from The Den and on the game improves by an order of magnitude with the high points coming in New Reno, which provides much to do in itself (like boxing and starring in porn) beside being a nexus for many quests from other towns.A small annoyance I noticed during my female playthrough was that Fallout 2 is very obviously a game by guys, for guys. Male PCs get a whole extra ending for New Reno, can donate sperm to alleviate the inbreeding situation in Vault City and have dozens of extra pervy dialogue options to use compared to females who can at most suck D to save a few hundred caps here and there. Caps, by the way, which are infinite after you get to ~120% in gambling. Can't say I blame Black Isle too much though because if you think of how many people owned a computer in 1998, played games on it, had the intellectual capacity to grok RPGs and out of that tiny sliver of the population, how many were women, well... peddling encyclopedias at Bible study might have been a better business model than catering to girls with Fallout 2.As customary with RPGs, save often and into different slots. I recommend always keeping around a save from the first second you arrive in a new marked location so you could replay it if need be.			"

												Fallout 2 is the game where you can:Stab robots to death with a spearFight your enemies with a gold nugget, pebbles, a katana, actual uranimum, bb guns, alien blaster, solar powered ray guns and hand grenades straight out of the BibleHelp a ghost find her locket so she can reach the afterlifeBecome a sheriffHit children in the groin with a sledgehammer (or shoot it off with a plasma rifle)Save a town from massacring a peaceful community, and cover half of afforementioned town in waste from a toiletBecome a slaverBlow up (or help) a town full of ghouls through their power plantSmuggle illegal drugs into a dystopian cityBecome a porn star, heavyweight champion, gigolo, mob enforcer, and assassin (all in the same town)Have a genocidal robot, cyborg dog, deathclaw scholar, mutant sheriff, ghoul doctor, your wife, and a drug producer join you in your travelsAssasinate two presidentsCreate a brand new community-twiceExplore in a 150 year old military baseGo undercover and meet the post-appocalyptic version of Gunnery Sergeant HartmanBecome an evil religious zealotLaunch a spaceshipBecome the hero of ChinatownBarter for a man's spleenDestroy all that remains of the US governmentAnd so much more it would take a week to list it all.Final Note: Play Fallout 1 before this, it greatly improves the experience. I'd also recommend Killap's Unofficial Patch, though don't play it with the extra content (Restoration Project) on your first playthrough.			"

												Originally released by in 1998, I never really had the chance to play Fallout 2, mostly due to the fact I was too busy being born. Having got wrapped up into the Fallout 3 hype train, I became rather enthralled in the franchise itself. So, several years later, I picked it up and…...in an attempt to not color my already vibrant opinion of the nearly twenty year old title to nothing but what can be considered felatio, let me just be a bit hypercritical about the game. The most glaring “problem” is what Fallout: New Vegas suffers from, by basically being the same game twice, effectively Fallout 2.0. While it didn’t work to the determent of the more modern entries, it hurts the overall visual experience with the sprites being rather noticeably polarized. Most are ripped straight from the original, built by pixels and with limited frame to frame animation. Then you have the newer 3D rendered sprites with smoother animation, creating an immersion breaking experience. Thankfully, these sprites don’t really appear in the same cell often, but when they do it is noticeably. Another problem they never fixed was the ♥♥♥♥ING INVENTORY UI! Its clumsy and finicky at best, with the mouse cursor deciding the change sensitivity like a pregnant women. You will work around it eventually, but it just infuriates me how this aspect was never fixed. Its horrid but manages to get the job done.Getting down on my knees, everything else is, the world, leveling system, character's, weapon variety and quest are, to put it broadly, ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. While the characters are a tad uninspired and two dimensional, and the story banal, Fallout 2 is possibly one of the best Western RPGs ever made. The leveling system grants satisfaction, managing to maintain this by having “Perks”(effectively permanent stat or combat boosts) that you receive every other level. You can’t help but wanting to progress with the prospect of nearly sawing men in half with not much but as dainty slap.The world can be summarized as a sour salted candy advertised as extremely so, its daunting at first and WILL kick you♥♥♥♥♥once you pop it in you gob, but will eventually become remarkable sweet. Southern California is huge, being exceptionally difficult during the early game but incredibly rewarding later down the line. The only problem I have with the world is the lack of variety, but I feel the questing can make up for this. I feel developers can live or die by the hand holding die. Choosing to do so makes the game a breeze, and choosing not to has the potential to make progress come to a screeching halt. Fallout 2 gives you just enough information to get on with the question without some patronizing arrow pointing out where to go. And can even have you thinking about solutions for the rare puzzle here and there. Quest are satisfying and varied to an insane degree.Fallout 2 might possibly be one of the few games in which you likely won’t see every weapon or outcome. If you ♥♥♥♥ up, you ♥♥♥♥ed up and there is no turning back, with some things being consequently cut off. Prompting actual thought and replay-ability, I love this idea. The weapons on the other hand, are insanely variant. Its not the fact that a quest outcome closes them off from you, it's the fact there are so ♥♥♥♥ing many that you're unlikely to even find them all. Whether this works for the games prosperity or detriment.Regardless, with its negatives and positives in check, Fallout 2 is one of the greatest title I have ever played. Even with its missteps, no matter how small, they pale to what the game does right. Of fantastic value, Fallout 2 is a must buy title, no matter its age.Verdict: 9.5 - Fantastic "

												Oh Fallout 2, where to begin? So first off I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story, It is actually by far one of the best stories I know (Fallout 4's story is crap in my opinion so get over it) I've played all the Fallout games and currently own all but one. Fallout 2 is a game I enjoy playing( though I don't play very often and don't have many hours on my account) It's very enjoyable and for it's time was a very advanced game. My one wish right now is to see this game and the first one remade into first and third person games...while leaving the story totally untouched, Hopefully Bethesda (and maybe Obsidian) do remake this game (And yes I know that they likely have to get permission from interplay given the games were made by them) Even if that doesn't happen I want bethesda to take a big slab of pages for the next game they make...Fallout 4 needs work bad...I don't want the same mistake made on their next game			"

												I would like to begin my review by saying I started the Fallout series with 3 (I know shameful right?) But soon learned about the first two games and how different they were from Bethesda's Fallout 3. At first, I thought they looked horrible with their dated graphics and gameplay. But after reading hours upon hours of lore and story tidbits on the Fallout Gamepedia, I just knew I had to play them. I was on Xbox 360 at the time so I couldn't play them yet, so I figured I would play New Vegas in the meantime.Anyways, eventually I got my PC, and one of the first games I got on their was the entire Classic Fallout Collection. I played through 1 first, I loved it. Then, after a long break, I started Fallout 2. I was blown away by it's atmosphere and compelling story. Even though I am not used to turn-based gameplay, I have come to enjoy it because of Fallout and Fallout 2. The game makes you think about your moral desicions and the consequences they bring, something Bethesda games could never really do. For example, if you kill a child bounty hunters will chase you down and everybody will hate you, discouraging you from doing such evil things. I highly recommend this game to any Fallout fan, even the new ones like me. This is definitely my favorite RPG game, and maybe even my favorite game. 10/10			"

												I have to admit, at first, I had difficulty adapting to the isometric style of this game, my first fallout being new Vegas after all, but after playing for a few hours, I was hooked. This game is possibly my 2nd favourite in the entire franchise (the first being New Vegas). The game has content for hours, 200+ hours into the game and I'm still finding new things as I go along. The combat is easy to learn, but can be punishing if you don't adapt to the isometric style quickly. There is a large variation of weapons and armour for your character to use. There are also companions (with varying levels of usefulness) who can back you up in combat or help you with various tasks you may come across in the wasteland. There are a wide variety of interesting and vibrant characters to meet, from gangsters to ghouls, Soldiers to slavers. There are plenty of quests and locations to complete and explore. I cannot stress enough how good this game is, it has more content that fallout 4 and it has all the charm of New Vegas. I would give it an 9/10. it's a masterpiece that has more content than most modern games have.			"

												One of the best role-playing games I have ever played.  A great sequel to the original Fallout and probably one of the last great Fallout games (except Fallout: New Vegas, sure).   It has a huge map to explore, lots of weird characters, an amazing storyline, and lots of memorable NPC's.  Plus stealing that Enclave armor.  See all the stuff Bethesda basically ruined in their Fallout games when it was still proper canon!The only downside, and this is very minor, is that the controls seem a little clunky by today's standards.  However, that shouldn't deter anyone from trying this classic cRPG!			"

												I was afraid that Fallout 2 might've been too outdated for me at first, that it wouldn't be entertaining or worth the time.Oh boy I was wrong. I'd say it's the best Fallout game I've played so far (haven't played the first one yet but I'll get to that someday).The combat feels satisfying and its turn-based gameplay seems to have aged well, though, it might be a bit slow at times and can be very punishing because of them lethal critical hits. But there's a lot of options to fiddle around with to personalize the type of experience you want, same goes with the game's great characterization system where you can create a lot of different builds.Game's tough at the start but if you give it time and try to make some progress you'll surely get well rewarded, because of the loot you get after hard-fought battles feels worthy enough for you to want progress even further. The dialogues are really well written too, there are a lot of different options you can choose from depending on what stats you invested in, which can lead to some really amusing conversations. For instance, high intelligence with the speech skill mostly provides with the most available options, but even low intelligence comes with unique dialogue or reactions from NPCs throughout the world.Choices you make does actually feel like it has consequences, it also affect the game's ending to a large scale. So the replayability is there if you want to tackle the game with an entirely different approach.The whole plot in this game is also a pretty thrilling experience the more progress you make, it's very gritty and has this dark atmosphere to it which I love. I also do think the game's soundtrack and visuals have a big impact on the game's atmosphere and that it's really well done. I'm happy I decided to pick this game up, even bought it during a sale for a few dollars.So money well spent I'd say. If you're a fan of the RPG genre you should definitely get this game, Fallout 2 is the classic RPG you wouldn't want to miss.			"

												One of the best RPGs ever created. Period. And probably best of post-apocalyptic games of all time.Pros.- Absolute freedom within a strictly linear plot (paradox?): you can finish your mission.. if you want. Or go somewhere to find something. Or kill anyone in sight. It's up to you. Playing this game is so much more fun than finishing it..- Totally unpredictable random encounters (on first playthrough, but anyway): getting in the midlle of gangfight? check. saving innocent farmers from wildlife? check. saving innocent wildlife from some bad trappers? check, and don't mind if wildlife would try to eat you, it's just their way to say ""thanks"". getting one-hitted by gigant predatory lizard? check. finding an extremely OP weapon being level 2-3 right after you leave starting location? check, if you'll find a way to actually get your hands on that weapon without dying.- Special encounters: no spoilers, you must find them all by yourself.- You and only you choose how you would play: kill bad people and get praised by others (actually not), kill good people (and get your butt hunted for that), don't kill anyone ever (it's even possible to win the game that way, with only one exception), aimlessly wander around exploring, become a gangster (almost), help some people with their problems (or help other people with those problematic jerks). Your choice is only thing that matters.- Side quests: they make up about 95% of all quests you'll get. Yes, you could finish the game and see about 5% of content only. But take one step aside from main quest - and a brave new world will open before you.- Easter eggs: there are plenty. Nuff said. Go find them.- Combat: totally unpredictable even on your 144 playthrough. Critical oneshot with a 7% chance to hit? Easy. Missing target with 95% hit chance while it's staying in front of you? Easy. Killing three random targets with minigun - out of five standing before you EXCEPT YOUR ACTUAL TARGET? Very easy. Killing yourself with a critical miss? Not that easy, but possible.- You can actually kill these annoying little critters: yes, it's about kids. Name another game where you are allowed to do such horrible thing at last? No more immortal godly beings that wander around, annoy you and steal from your pockets. Be warned: people of wasteland won't like you for that (and your♥♥♥♥♥would be hunted).Cons.- Too much myths about cut content: there are some really beatifull things that didn't get to the final version. Maybe they  existed, maybe not.- Map: after 4-5 playthroughs you will get everywhere and find everything. Maybe sooner, maybe later, but that will happen. There are so much empty space on the map, so many lost opportunities to place something exciting.. not to mention that map from first game could've been added to second.- Replayability dissapears after 50-60 times. Seriously, what else could you do when you've done everything possible?Total score: 9.7/10. Almost perfect.			"

												A great classic RPG with plenty of charm.I experienced Fallout 2 for the first time after playing the newer installments, and I found this title to be just as impressive in most ways. Fallout 2 tells an interesting story, is housed with a unique environment and compelling characters, and rewards exploration very well. Basically, Fallout 2 excells in the fundamental mechanics of an RPG. It builds on the first game in scope and experience in ways that enhance gameplay while retaining the core characteristics that make the first great.If you haven't played through this game or the original Fallout from start to finish, you're missing out.

												The best one.-Extremely interesting characters and innovative locations. The art and animation is very detailed for the time, and sometimes quite stunning.-Engaging and lengthy quests and character arcs, and actually has a main villain that you don't just encounter for the first time at the end of the game.-Wide variety of enemies with a vast multitude of attacks, and the combat system is different but entertaining.-Not afraid to touch on wacky elements and pop culture, and pulls it off in a superb manner.-Basically refines and tightens the mechanics of Fallout 1, resulting in an even smoother experience than the first game which is also very much worth playing.-Talking deathclaws.

												Fallout 2 is the sequel to one of my favorite RPG's of all time and it does a superb job of the lifting the mantle of the original Fallout even if it does have it's flaws.Fallout 2 sets you as the descendant of the original Vault Dweller who we now learned founded a small tribe near the Californian coast following the events of the original. This tribe has now fallen on hard times and as the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller you are charged with going out into the world and finding a mythical Vault device known as the G.E.C.K. This device, the elder of your village believe, have the power to turn the part of the wasteland into an utopia and ensure the tribe's future.You start off the game with a somewhat lackluster tutorial that introduces you to the basic elements of the game however it is only once you leave this initial area and are ready to depart your childhood village for the first time that the game truly comes into it's own. The massive world map at your feet with no restrictions on where to go and who to see.The mechanics are much the same as the original. Isometric turn-based role playing game using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system for character development. It is however in the open nature of the game that you find it's soul. Made a female character with high charisma? You might be able to charm, or sleep, your way past several encounters. Made a character with incredibly low intelligence? All of the sudden your dialog responses are just various grunts and the people you encounter will treat you as a freak of nature.Even most of the storyline can be skipped if you know where to go and almost every task you are given in the game can be solved in a myriad of ways, many options not even becoming apparent to you unless you have the needed skills or made some particular choices beforehand.The game does have some shortcomings. The 4th wall breaking that was rare in the original are much more commonplace and several characters and areas just feel out of place with the rest of the game.New Reno in particular, a gambling town complete with mafia families fighting for control and a working porn studio takes you completely out of the game and makes for a rather disappointing experience.Fallout 2 has all the qualities that made the original one of the greatest RPG's ever and it improves on many aspects of it with better companion AI and a much larger map. It's faults however do weight heavily and keep it from surpassing it's predecessor. It is still one of the greatest RPG's ever to be made and if you are a fan of open ended RPG games and intelligent story and dialog then it should be a definite purchase.			"

												“The struggle for survival is a war without end. And war… war never changes.”This sequel succeeds in expanding the post-nuclear universe of Fallout.

												When I finish playing the first fallout game I love it and I said to myself that this sequel cannot surpass the first one. I was wrong in so many levels. STORYIt picks up right after Fallout 1 and there are many reference to fallout 1 so I recommend playing the first before heading to the second.Fantastic the plot, should I say is better than the first...well is really hard to say because they're both great! In my opinion I slightly sided with the first game plot because of sentimental value moments but the second just nail right in the park with interesting characters, settings, the jokes oh my god the jokes are better than ever because there are some moments that I smile for those humorous wacky moments. The new enemies are interesting like the enclave (I havn't played fallout 3 before this review) sadly I was a slight dissapointment of not much shown on the brotherhood of steel just only a mention on their OPs and I like them in the first game but I understand they want the most focus on the enclaves. Your partners have a combat control which is awesome that you can put some orders into your team and they do better in combat but it does not mean their AI is better oh no just slightly, the rest the AI of your team can be walking targets at times. Side missions are better than ever especially the many new added towns they put that you can do a lot in their for many hours. I spend countless of hours just to complete the side-missions which are just awesome to complete because each important side missions adds personality of the towns and it will eventually effect the ending depends of actions you take.EVERY ACTION COUNTSI really starting to love the fallout franchise just because of the towns I visit and the different atmosphere the citizens treated you or to others and it adds different layers of problems and situations that can effect other towns as well if you don't take care of the problem. You can be the savior of many towns saying your name like a hero or you can be a complete bully to everyone and doesn't give a dang about anyone and just want money, booze and sex. Each reputation to each of the town you did effects the endings and there are multiple once and even some funny shock once that you can actual impregnate someone and that child will be ""this character."" Depends on whom you impregnate though is very limit and I wish they put more on that including when choosing a female. I was playing a female and a slave trader wants me to be in bed if I did and got the ending that I have a child and that child will do this I would laugh but instead I didn't and just pop his head by the end of my barrel. Now there are some minor annoyance when doing specific actions and that is when following some direction to someone only that you the player playing the game for the first time just follows direction. When doing that task you actually miss one conversation to this specific NPC or doing this specific task and thus either lose that oppurtunity to get it back (unless reset a point of the game) and have to either do it the hard way or just lose an event that you wish to explore. I know the game can be specific on their actions toward some events but man can it backfire sometimes to very important events that you either wish you don't miss or don't want to tackle. Like extra experience or easier access to a certain level with ease.Diversity and RealityI'm really surprise Interplay is really open and creative with this game back in the late 90s! I will say atleast when playing a female there are hinted of homosexuality which you can actually sleep with other females (don't know males but I'm betting yes). The jokes as I mention again is up high because it tackles some interesting topics that back then videogames had to censor it but this one is like an infant state of Southpark, poking fun of many topics in real life we tackle such as; scientology, American politics, race dispute and drug war. I am so happy they made it so professional about their jokes and not over the top in your face though some you might catch up where are they putting but it isn't enough to make it ""controversy"" to start yet another arguement. There just many easter eggs, references on different levels of media that I tried google up where are all these little sweet bits come from.Bugs and ImprovmentsThere are many improvements within the game but how about the combat and trading system? Well the combat feels the same as before though I still which I get an extra AP two get two shots instead of only one and not have to wait for a perk but other than that they added some new perks along the way. The trading system they finally fix that issue I had with the cap collecting where you have to press one by one, now you have to hold it and it will raise the caps level faster the longer you hold though to be honest is not exactly what I want I still prefer that wishful thinking where you can change the digit of the number of caps to save even more time but eh is atleast a slightly better. The bugs I notice they have a bit more than fallout 1 if I'm right? Like some scenarios it won't activated, sometimes my partners even walk through walls or out of the border which I laugh a couple times when Vic just casually walking through an impenetrable base and he walk in the fence and building with no problem. The biggest complaint I should add of the bugs is script errors and even scenes missing! Like don't worry if at some parts you say to yourself ""shouldn't it be here or shouldn't the person say something else?"" Well that's script error and some scenes missing some bug reasons some developer time constraint and that's kind a sad. Because there are some interesting areas I really want to explore or complete like finding sulik's sister or going in the chinese's sub or even saving the deathclaws from extinction!Thankfully I heard there are some patches that fix some problems and even improve a better experience to the player even more. The only personal issue I will warn you is once again be careful on running this game on win 10 (and Idk win 7) because it does work and I finish the game but in some areas my fps runs slow like walking in mollasses. I don't know if there is a fix on it or not so please be warn not to break your keyboard if it slows down, just make multiple saves, reset on one point and it will go away for now is not a constant nuisance since is only on some section of a town but it gets frustrating later on if it keeps doing that.In conclussion I'll give a 9/10 the best sequel of its time and even still to this day, it really does age well to look back and enjoy this masterpiece collection to play again or start a new.

												It's the definitive Fallout game, plain and simple. I prefer 1 for the story and for the simple fact I love timed games, but this is an improvement in every other way. The best quests, characters, and atmosphere in the entire series to date. I personally believe it has held up beautifully over the years, and no future game in the series (especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bethesda Fallout) will even come close to topping it. Really, the only cons in my opinion are bugs, but you can download some patches to take care of those.			"

												I got my first taste of Fallout with Fallout 3, and I immediately fell in love. I couldn't think of a better game out there. And then Fallout New Vegas came along. And I'll be honest, I was not a fan. Not in the least. First glance was a desolate land that had more punishing combat and a bizarre ammo system. Fast forward a couple months and I decide to give it another go. For some reason this second foray really opened my eyes and I had a blast with the changed up combat that made you think, and the ammo system that gave you more flexability. And once I started playing I discovered something even more miraculous: the writing. Fallout New Vegas had a more believable environment, better characters, better writing. It simply felt more thought out. And looking into its development I discovered that it had some of the creators of the original Fallouts working on it. So I had to give the originals a try.So I started with Fallout 1, of course. I bought the pack off of steam and installed it with a gusto. Finally the 5 minute process ended and I delightfully booted up the game, only to have a brilliant rainbow engulf the screen. Great. So I do some quick interneting and download the hi-res pack for Fallout 1 and Killap's Restoration Pack for Fallout 2 in order to plan ahead. Fallout 1 started, and I hit the ground running. My first isometric RPG! Woo-hoo! I immediately fell flat on my face, being killed by rats. I learned my first Fallout lesson: It's okay to run. So after hours of such trial and error I finally completed my game of Fallout 1, and was eager to continue the adventure in Fallout 2.If you have made it this far, good lord. On to Fallout 2.Fallout 2, to put it mildly, blew me away. Though the first level was obnoxious as hell. That Temple deserves to burn. Regardless, I pushed forward and entered the world proper. And it was glorious. Everything good from Fallout 1, Fallout 2 has. And then it expands on those. And THEN adds even more. I could do anything here. The world was truely my playground. I could, and did, do anything I wanted. The combat is incredibly punishing, forcing you to make some truely tactical decisions, however it just makes every win that much more satisfying. The dialogue is witty, dark, a tad campy at times, and heartbreaking. The depths of depravity that is portrayed is mindboggling in the modern game sphere. GTA has nothing on this. Additionally I simply love the Enclave. Probably shouldn't, but I do. I really didn't do this game justice at all, did I? When it came down to it I didn't know what to say.Buy this, install it, download the Restoration Pack, install that, play the game, never stop.			"

												Forget F4, this is the real deal! A wonderful game with choices emergent story paths that feel like they really matter. Great characters, fun writing, great locations, SO MUCH dialogue and so many, many different ways you can interact with everyone and everything. It's everything you want in a good fallout game.			"

												This is it.  This is the game the cemented the Fallout universe and is considered by many the pinnacle of the series until New Vegas.  This is the game the truly cements the core story of the franchise and takes the seeds planted in FO1 and grows them to fruitiion.  In that process, they helped open up countless routes for storylines for the rest of the series.Some folks complain that now a game like this feels dated.  I would do my best to compel to you put aside that sort of metric when it comes to assessing the greatness of a game.  With some patience and thought ,which is so often taken out of today popular games, you can grasp hold of what seems at first glance, a copmlicated system for conveying your player character through the in-game universe.The routes you take, many encounters, and many other aspects of the game are so open, so huge, that you could play through many times and still find different things. There are so many hidden routes, items, quests, etc and so many ways to play the game it's impossible to describe them all here(smart, tech savvy character or a  brawler or a dimwit?  you can play them all and they all change the game)This game is a classic for a reason and is the gold standard by which other similar games should be judged.Buy it, play it, and understand where one of the greatest game franchises ever got much of it's spark.Do it now.

												War. War never changes.The end of the world occurred pretty much as we had predicted. Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around. The details are trivial and pointless, the reasons, as always, purely human ones.The earth was nearly wiped clean of life. A great cleansing, an atomic spark struck by human hands, quickly raged out of control. Spears of nuclear fire rained from the skies. Continents were swallowed in flames and fell beneath the boiling oceans. Humanity was almost extinguished, their spirits becoming part of the background radiation that blanketed the earth.A quiet darkness fell across the planet, lasting many years. Few survived the devastation. Some had been fortunate enough to reach safety, taking shelter in great underground vaults. When the great darkness passed, these vaults opened, and their inhabitants emerged to begin their lives again.One of the northern tribes claims they are descended from one such Vault. They hold that their founder and ancestor, one known as the ""Vault Dweller,"" once saved the world from a great evil. According to their legend, this evil arose in the far south. It corrupted all it touched, twisting men inside, turning them into beasts. Only through the bravery of this Vault Dweller was the evil destroyed. But in so doing, he lost many of his friends and suffered greatly, sacrificing much of himself to save the world.When at last he returned to the home he had fought so hard to protect, he was cast out. Exiled. In confronting that which they feared, he had become something else in their eyes...and no longer their champion.Forsaken by his people, he strode into the wasteland. He traveled far to the north, until he came to the great canyons. There, he founded a small village, Arroyo, where he lived out the rest of his years. And so, for a generation since its founding, Arroyo has lived in peace, its canyons sheltering it from the outside world. It is home. Your home.But the scars left by the war have not yet healed. And the Earth has not forgotten.			"

												A worthy successor to Fallout 1, and for those who loved the original they're in for a whole new experience.Few RPGs provide so deft a balance between the wandering monster-slaying and the NPC interaction phases of role-playing.Perhaps even more so than its predecessor, Fallout 2 contains dozens of subtle and more often not-so-subtle references to cult movies, television icons, and other aspects of popular culture.If you value character development, old-fashioned gameplay, and a good plot, this game delivers on all counts.

												Hello Fellow Wastelanders,I strongly suggest the purchase of Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game! It's a wonderful game, even though it's a little bit old and still uses a turn-based system. The game's storyline is amazing and it feeds into the future Fallout games. It also builds off of the original Fallout, but it doesn't make you feel clueless when you first start. It's a wonderful game, great storyline, great everything, that leads into a great series. I strongly recommend it if you are into the lore of the series! Definitely worth the money!-Kyle James			"

												At one point i stumbled across a village of ghouls. They seemed nice enough, and offered me a quest. 'Go convince this city full of bigots to help us. k thx bye.' Later i found the back door to a large shed. Turns out it contained a ladder to the underground. Down there, I found out that there were about a dozen ghouls talking about getting 'renewed'. I knew instantly it was a cult of some sort. I convinced one of them I totally knew what was going on and managed to get an audience with their god. I found an evil genius who wanted to take over the world, who was also a talkng molerat. He asked me for some cheezy poofs I had acquired, and I gave it to him. He then told me that his plan was to convince the entire population of ghouls that he could restore their humanity IF they worked for him. He also gave me an economic data disk that would convince the city of bigots to help the town of ghouls. I gave it to them, and they agreed to help. They also made me a citizen of their city and I was instantly a local hero in both places. I also got to speak with the 'mayor' of the bigoted city.

Withdrew ebola; dropped it. *CONTAINMENT BREACHED. 3 MINUTES TO EVACUATE FACILITY*. The mob boss that hired me to check out the depot was very unhappy to hear that it blew up.

												Okay this game is like Fallout 1 but stretched out with NEW features that the developers played around with. I was quite surprised how long the game was, maybe too long. I found out that I only did 75% of the game before finishing it. That is huge when I have played the game for nearly 20 hrs. Alot of it is really the travelling, as it is further and takes longer to get between the different towns in this one. But you have a CAR! BUT that car has some of the worse bugs in video game history, you can be an unlucky player like I did and lost the car randomly, never to ever see it again. There is no way to track where your car is situated and yea if you lose track of it or if the lost car bug happens to you, that's it no more car for you. You cant get it back nor can you get another one. Also in this game you can play your character even AFTER you finish the game to pick up the quests you missed etc. It is a good game but a very long and buggy game too. Still definately worth it, but you must stick with it for the long haul. :)			"

												Fallout 2 in my opinion is the best in a series of games that include Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Nothing like going back old school days with this fantastic turned based RPG. The story telling in this game is unique, very often funny, and always engaging. You are free to be who you want to be in the wastelands of Fallout, want to be a prick that steals from everyone? Maybe you want to be the hero who saves the children instead of killing them? With the way karma works in this game your actions very much affect the way the world reacts to you and your party. Along with the choice to go where ever in the world, the skill system is just as open, you can spend your skill points however you like. I find myself making many characters just to try out different styles of play. You could be a sweet talking brawler, a thieving sharp shooter, or even a non-combatant that talks, repairs, or barters thier way to the end, the choices are truly up to you. If you do decide to buy this be sure to download Killaps unoffical patch and Killaps Restoration project, both have installers and make the game more incredible. Oh and by the way kids, stay off the jet, it's addictive!			"

												Whew, this game. I could make a big frickin' list about the cool stuff here (plus killap's Restoration Project, which is a ♥♥♥♥in' awesome mod), but I am too lazy to do that. What I will say, though, is that you should definitely play Fallout before trying out Fallout 2 because of the story, obviously (if you don't care about story, I don't know what you're doing here), and also for the better introduction to the gameplay system and game that Fallout gives. Fallout 2 is harder, longer, and has way more quests and content, of course. I mean, damn, dude, in Fallout, you start with a gun, some ammo, stimpacks, a knife, fighting some silly weak rats. In Fallout 2, you're a tribal with nothing else other than a spear, fighting giant ants. It shouldn't be a big deal for players who are used to it, but I've seen people complaining about dying way too much at the beginning of Fallout 2 (and guess what, a lot of them never even played the first one!). I think I've played and finished this game more than enough to say that I loved it, and I still do, as I enjoy playing it from time to time, and try some different cool builds. I'm not an old school gamer, but I still feel a great compassion for this game, which I truly think is well-made. (Guess I'm not so lazy at all, seeing as I took the time to at least write a bit about this cool game.) Totally recommend it.			"

												I've spent a fair share of hours for this game, and I'll say they were all well spent.I'll admit, this game does require patience, but once you've figured out where that one object is or where that one person went, it makes it all worthwhile.You may have to look up a tutorial here and there, but that doesn't matter that much in the end. What matters is that YOU picked up the object, YOU found and talked to the person, YOU fought the final boss. Because the tutorial can't press the keys or control the mouse, only you can.Besides all the deep talk, fallout 2 offers a lot for players who liked fallout 1 or just like turn-based RPGs. There is a wide variety of quests,weapons,people and locations all for you(the player)to find and explore. The campaign isn't linear and gives you choices on how to handle different situations. What more do you want? Why are you still reading? Buy the game and go head-first into the wasteland of fallout 2!			"

												I'd rather confidenly say this is the best Fallout game in the series so far. All of them have great atmosphere and mood, but they also have their fair share of stupid mistakes or just plain lack of certain qualities. Fallout 2 eludes most of the failings of its predecessor and its successors and stands strong on its own as well.It provides enough variety and character to feel full and alive, while staying true to the mood and maintaining the bar of quality at a reasonable level. Just as importantly, it maintains a very decent level of reactivity and non-linearity, and offers maybe not perfect but seriously flexible mechanics. It also introduces the best plot twist of the whole series. So all in all, I'd call it the purest and the most successful execution of the Fallout concept so far. Even though I would love it to have more of the desperate and mysterious mood of the very beginning of Fallout 1, the vast pretty enviroments of Fallout 3 and the tasteful characterization of New Vegas.

												I have very little time played on this on Steam as I played the GOG version but trust me when I say that Fallout 2 is one of the greatest, possibly the greatest RPG of all time. I sank dozens of hours into this on my old laptop (if you have a laptop you use for college or whatever that dosen't have great specs but you want to play some games, Fallout 1 and 2 are perfect for this) and didn't even finish it in the end.If you have only played the newer Fallouts like I had, playing the originals is so fun and insightful and the games are masterpieces. If you can look past the strategic and somewhat slow combat (which you can speed up in the options), Fallout 2 can offer hundreds of hours of enjoyment .			"

												The masterpiece of all rpgs, Fallout 2 yet its practicly a son of wasteland, this game is worth the weight, worth getting rid of your nagging girlfriend/wife and worth quitting that business monkey job, you don't need any of that anyway! all you need is a fresh nuka-cola and some fallout 2. Now in a few weeks is mah birthdays with planning to buy wasteland 2 I decide to write my personal expierence and opinon on this game.Why you ask? I will tell you my experience.Here you are born in a tribal village in the wasteland of america,  your home where your ancestor known as the vault dweller of V13 was exiled from his overseer due to the fear of spreading diseases and radiation inside the vault towards the pure dwellers, your ancestor did nothing wrong but saved his people from being forced out of the vault into the cruel wasteland due to a dying water supply and being raided by monsterous mutants of the Master's army, he walked north and north to find a tribal village on the wasteland... in present time, you discover your home village is dying.. brahmin are dying, children sick with diseases. everything was starting to fall apart slowly, but you the decendant of the v13 dweller have been chosen by the village's elder to go out the wasteland explored by your ancestor to find the mighty G.E.C.K to fix all this hell happening.. and that is where your journey begins.Now with some quick tips before you first time play this game:I reccomend reading this guide to help you get started playing, trust me its worth to read than being torn to shreds by a small Enclave patrol or getting shotgunned in the face when you try to fight with melee in a random encounter. small spoilers because the guide also brings up the details with all the quests available in this gamehttp://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#Character_designDon't ragequit over getting wrecked by a bunch of geckos or radscorpians, the more you play the game, the better. Okay so now onto the Gameplay, its very Turnbased but its rewarding seeing the animations of someones torso being blown to bits by shotguns and mini-guns, even melting him like a witch with a plasma gun is entertaining too, of course you can also be blown to bits by anyone. there isn't open world exploration like you get in fallout 3 because outside of towns/other places will bring a large map with a green dot (you) click around and you move around, when you want to travel to another location for the side/main quests  you will often have random encounters such as radscorps, walking into a middle of a firefight between caravans and bandits, there are peaceful encounters like the caravans who will trade with you for caps (aka money) of course the small downside with trading is your karma status effects the caravans, some of them will refuse to trade with you either becuase you are known as a evil fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ villlain  or a goodie white knight of the wasteland it mainly depends on  locations that you are nearby like the cities, small hint there are easter egg encounters too!You can also choose to do what ever you want. Killing before asking/chatting, turning the tables of the side quest (i.e giving the brahmin you were meant to guard to the twins when you trick your dumb tribal friend into running away) you can't slaughter the villagers in your home cus otherwise the game will be over insta.There are also Companions that you can take with you on your travels, based on my experience I will give you the details of the companions I had with me.Vic This man may be your second/first companion you can bring along, he's good for ranged weapons, be sure to collect his rifle at his shack in the first town you go to, but he's often slow and bad for melee combat. Lenny A ghoul, he's not great with combat and carrys a knife with him but he is a decent doctor, have him as your field medic and sort. Also he cannot run.Marcus this guy has a talking head voice acted too, but if you want this big hulk with you, its best you either take his mini-gun away and give him a plasma rifle, or have him as your only companion because he will freaking kill every single thing in his line of fire no matter who's infront when you're in combat, his mini-gun often has a unaccurate shot hitting mutiple targets in a burst of fire which means he can instantly kill you or his fellow companion by accident. K9 this cyber dog is simliar to the famous dog-meat but he can talk and is cool, you can find him inside a lab at the navvarro Enclave base, its best you get in there with the highwayman car otherwise you will have a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥experience getting killed by enclave patrols in 1 turn every time. Goris this DEATHCLAW is quite a badass, except he can only fight with his claws in melee so he can sometimes get in your line of fire including marcus's and his animation with his jedi cloak gets repeative. The story also has multiple endings on every town and faction you have met along in your travels, your actions towards them will bring them a future, for example if you slaughter the slavers at the Den and free the slaves, the town will flourish and sort, and if you screw up modac its gonna die because you made a mistake on your decision. Immersion on this game regardless of the graphics is really great too, you're gonna get tempted to kill somebody because of what-he-said about those poor ghouls or maybe even insulting you.

												There is a quest in this game where you play chess with an intelligent scorpion and you can't beat it, so you do a favor for a talking plant and in return he tells you how to beat the scorpion.In all serious, this is an amazing isometric 2D roleplaying game. This game was the ♥♥♥♥ back in it's day, and still is. You can do just about anything in this game within reason. Story is great, the humor and tone are both perfect, and your actions have actual consequences. I highly recommend playing this, and seeing what Fallout was really like before Bethesda ♥♥♥♥ed it all up.			"

												The masterpiece of all rpgs, Fallout 2 yet its practicly a son of wasteland, this game is worth the weight, worth getting rid of your nagging girlfriend/wife and worth quitting that business monkey job, you don't need any of that anyway! all you need is a fresh nuka-cola and some fallout 2. Now in a few weeks is mah birthdays with planning to buy wasteland 2 I decide to write my personal expierence and opinon on this game.Why you ask? I will tell you my experience.Here you are born in a tribal village in the wasteland of america,  your home where your ancestor known as the vault dweller of V13 was exiled from his overseer due to the fear of spreading diseases and radiation inside the vault towards the pure dwellers, your ancestor did nothing wrong but saved his people from being forced out of the vault into the cruel wasteland due to a dying water supply and being raided by monsterous mutants of the Master's army, he walked north and north to find a tribal village on the wasteland... in present time, you discover your home village is dying.. brahmin are dying, children sick with diseases. everything was starting to fall apart slowly, but you the decendant of the v13 dweller have been chosen by the village's elder to go out the wasteland explored by your ancestor to find the mighty G.E.C.K to fix all this hell happening.. and that is where your journey begins.Now with some quick tips before you first time play this game:I reccomend reading this guide to help you get started playing, trust me its worth to read than being torn to shreds by a small Enclave patrol or getting shotgunned in the face when you try to fight with melee in a random encounter. small spoilers because the guide also brings up the details with all the quests available in this gamehttp://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nearly_Ultimate_Fallout_2_Guide#Character_designDon't ragequit over getting wrecked by a bunch of geckos or radscorpians, the more you play the game, the better. Okay so now onto the Gameplay, its very Turnbased but its rewarding seeing the animations of someones torso being blown to bits by shotguns and mini-guns, even melting him like a witch with a plasma gun is entertaining too, of course you can also be blown to bits by anyone. there isn't open world exploration like you get in fallout 3 because outside of towns/other places will bring a large map with a green dot (you) click around and you move around, when you want to travel to another location for the side/main quests  you will often have random encounters such as radscorps, walking into a middle of a firefight between caravans and bandits, there are peaceful encounters like the caravans who will trade with you for caps (aka money) of course the small downside with trading is your karma status effects the caravans, some of them will refuse to trade with you either becuase you are known as a evil fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ villlain  or a goodie white knight of the wasteland it mainly depends on  locations that you are nearby like the cities, small hint there are easter egg encounters too!You can also choose to do what ever you want. Killing before asking/chatting, turning the tables of the side quest (i.e giving the brahmin you were meant to guard to the twins when you trick your dumb tribal friend into running away) you can't slaughter the villagers in your home cus otherwise the game will be over insta.There are also Companions that you can take with you on your travels, based on my experience I will give you the details of the companions I had with me.Vic This man may be your second/first companion you can bring along, he's good for ranged weapons, be sure to collect his rifle at his shack in the first town you go to, but he's often slow and bad for melee combat. Lenny A ghoul, he's not great with combat and carrys a knife with him but he is a decent doctor, have him as your field medic and sort. Also he cannot run.Marcus this guy has a talking head voice acted too, but if you want this big hulk with you, its best you either take his mini-gun away and give him a plasma rifle, or have him as your only companion because he will freaking kill every single thing in his line of fire no matter who's infront when you're in combat, his mini-gun often has a unaccurate shot hitting mutiple targets in a burst of fire which means he can instantly kill you or his fellow companion by accident. K9 this cyber dog is simliar to the famous dog-meat but he can talk and is cool, you can find him inside a lab at the navvarro Enclave base, its best you get in there with the highwayman car otherwise you will have a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥experience getting killed by enclave patrols in 1 turn every time. Goris this DEATHCLAW is quite a badass, except he can only fight with his claws in melee so he can sometimes get in your line of fire including marcus's and his animation with his jedi cloak gets repeative. The story also has multiple endings on every town and faction you have met along in your travels, your actions towards them will bring them a future, for example if you slaughter the slavers at the Den and free the slaves, the town will flourish and sort, and if you screw up modac its gonna die because you made a mistake on your decision. Immersion on this game regardless of the graphics is really great too, you're gonna get tempted to kill somebody because of what-he-said about those poor ghouls or maybe even insulting you. This is not some fallout 3 where enclaves gets killed by revolvers, or deathclaws getting killed in 3 seconds or children being immune to gunshots Oh yeah you can kill kids in this game if you're a heartless monster :3  this is fallout 2 friend. -fun turnbased gameplay-immersive storyline-able to do what you want that can effect karma or faction/town reputation including the ending of the faction and town.

												I have very little time played on this on Steam as I played the GOG version but trust me when I say that Fallout 2 is one of the greatest, possibly the greatest RPG of all time. I sank dozens of hours into this on my old laptop (if you have a laptop you use for college or whatever that dosen't have great specs but you want to play some games, Fallout 1 and 2 are perfect for this) and didn't even finish it in the end.If you have only played the newer Fallouts like I had, playing the originals is so fun and insightful and the games are masterpieces. If you can look past the strategic and somewhat slow combat (which you can speed up in the options), Fallout 2 can offer hundreds of hours of enjoyment .			"

												At the time of this review, this game is literally old enough to vote in the United States. And yet no other game has made me so deliriously happy to finally get my hands on a gun.Pros:+Top-notch dialogue and writing in general+Well-designed strategic combat+Major emphasis on roleplay and many ways to accomplish any given goal+Difficulty level that reinforces the harshness of the setting without being too hardcore+I am attended by a fat, balding tuna can merchant who karate chops scorpions for me+60 fpsCons:-Hope you like brown and beige-Occasional b.s. random encounter, like spawning in the middle of a scorpion nest-There are two very obvious god stats: Agility for combat (how often you can attack and how far you can move), and Intelligence for everything else (how many skill points you get when you level up, the base value for the highly useful First Aid skill, and for some inane reason how persuasive you are in dialogue, making Charisma close to useless).

												The best of the best. And definitely the best of Fallout series. Incredible amount of choices and outcomes, good humor, beautiful graphic details (especially for those years) and fascinating soundtracks. Most famous RPG's aren't even half this good.Completed it more than 10 times:been a ranger, been a slaver, cleared the wasteland with a BB gun\fists only\knives only\etc., fought bandits\mutants\robots, assasinated important people, avoided violence with speaking skills, fixed a nuclear plant, destroyed it too, got married to a♥♥♥♥♥♥ got divorced, rode a nuclear car, been in a sect, wiped out the sect, became a boxing champion, a porn star, a gangster, impregnated mob boss's daughter, saved everybody, doomed everybody... and still willing to play more. The game becomes even more exciting with the ""Restoration Project"", which adds a bunch of locations and quests, that were cut from or incomplete in the original game.			"

												I played this after i went through Fallout 4 to see if it was as good as i remember it to be, and i was not disappointed. This is one billion times better than fallout 4 when it comes to the sheer feel of it all, Everything just works. It's such a perfect game, with an immensely rewarding and equally punishing combat system. The calculations of the hit percentage, the gameplay itself, the old graphics, the isometric viewpoint. Everything .. JUST ... WORKS. I haven't gone through the entire game since i am quite the slow player, but believe me, so far this has surpassed fallout 4 in every way imaginable. Plus i have after all played the game before, 17 years ago. as for the gameplay, let me give you a story:Once upon a time there was a gunfight between 7 golden geckoes and a lone tribes-man who just left his companion because he kept blocking passages infront of doors so that the tribes-man would have to save and reload until the companion rearranged his position. So, as the - never again - ""lone"" tribes-man (conveniently named with the most ineligible, and unsuiting name since the dawn of time) stood infront of the golden geckoes he had an epiphany that this would not end in an orderly fashion (he also did inconveniently forget to save the game since he is, and was a complete moron). He fought until there was all but one golden gecko left, with 7HP and an arm with a golden shine to it on the ground. The tribes-man with a peculiar name raised his one-shot gun as far as his ripped up arms could bear, with the 5 remaining Action-points - the fairly girthy built man had left - He pulled the trigger costing him 3 action points. The gun gasped for air as the bullet traveled through the 50cm long, rifled barrel. The bullet caught a spin and flew through the air (just like the keys on a keyboard when a companion decides to block a passage), it got near the golden gecko and flew straight past, because the tribes-man was a retard and didn't for one second think to move closer with the two actionpoints he had left in him. It was now the gecko's turn and the tribes-man died horribly in one move. Moral of the story: ""you die in-game if you make a mistake in a crucial moment, and you die IRL when you haven't saved for 2 hours"".10/10, childhood memories comes flooding back from me pulling my hair in dispair.sincerely, Nomad			"

												Fallout 2 is a perfect sequel to the best original RPG of its time, Fallout.Fallout 2 features an open-world with a S.P.E.C.I.A.L skill system like in the previous game with a larger map and even more locations to discover than the original.In this installment, you are the descendant of the main character from Fallout 1, and it is your job to bring the legendary G.E.C.K to your village of Arroyo. During the journey to save Arroyo, you run across a sprawl of interesting characters, from shady dealers to trusting companions. Who will you side with? What will be your playstyle? All of this is important in Fallout 2.Fallout 2 introduces a new villianous organization, The Enclave. They are the remnants of the pre-war government, and their goal is to control the Wastes and minipulate it, by elimating all mutants and ""in-perfect"" beings, inclusong yourself.The Enclave soon discovers you and Arroyo, which leads to grave consequences...So the choice is yours. Fallout 2 is possibly my favorite, if not one of my favorite Fallout games to date. Play this, no regretti THIS speghetti.9.5/10 Starfish			"

												So, all I have to say is that I'm quite glad I played the first two Fallout games as they are great! While 3 and New Vegas still are my favorite games in the franchise, the first two Fallout games are still amazing and definitely have withstood the test of time.I think the one thing I love the most is that the game is demanding, making you think out each action carefully, which I like, it also is fair with its difficulty.  Plus, it requires you to really think about how you build your character. I at first mistakenly built my character in the game with a gun-centric build focused around accuracy with guns, not realizing the first quest, you didn't get any guns and had to use a spear. Luckily, I quickly realized my error and made a similar character with the build to make it through the Temple of Trials without dying at all. (Thank goodness for those Healing Powders...) It's really good to see a game that isn't dumbed down too much.I love the soundtrack in this game as well.  The gloomy music is perfect with the atmosphere.Gameplay is very nice, too. Quite fun. Especially with the whole D&D style of gameplay.If I had to list any problems with the game... One, my save files keep getting corrupted for some reason... >:( and two is that the game doesn't always seem to want to work on my laptop, which has NO trouble running Fallout 3 or New Vegas.			"

												I will reccomend this game as the time that I have been able to play it (not anymore) was amazing. But, I will have to give you some adviceDO NOT RELY ON THE STEAM CLOUD, THE SAVES WILL NOT WORK!(I found this out the hard way)Just as you would have thought from me writing this, my saves will no longer work. I had put 39 hours into this game and then, one day my computer starts running into issues. Long story short I had to completly reset my HDD and reinstall windows. I thought I would still be able to play Fallout 2 as my saves have been uploaded onto the steam cloud. When I reinstalled the game, my saves came along with it, only for every save to give me this error upon attemping to load ""The instruction at 004f11db referenced memory from 00000010 The memory could not be read from"" I have looked up just about every single discussion about this error and nobody can find a way past it. I have posted about it on reddit, steam discussions and nma-fallout.com. It is unfixable and therefore I have wasted 39 hours of my life.Other than this big problem the game ran completly fine on my modern pc with no crashing, plus I really did love this game when I was able to play it.

												I loved videogames as a kid and my favorites were the action and rpg games where I played the hero with the sword slaying my enemies.  Naturally I was pumped as I put my max strength character into this world, heroically exterminating giant ants with my spear.  And after that earned me the title of 'Chosen One' nothing could stop me.  So weapon in hand I search for injustice in the closest town and find a slavers guild.  There is no room for this evil in my world!  I charge right through the front door and skewer the boss twice with my trusty spear of justice...   at which point six heavily armored guards blast my head and arms off with submachine guns, as my 11 year old eyes stare in shock at my blood sputtering corpse on the floor.  I would forever remember this day as when I TRULY understood why guns are better than swords.Fallout 1 and 2 are both artifacts from a time when there was no mainstream gaming.  Big companies all made indie games, and this is a result when that money isn't restricted by demographics and overprotective mother influenced censorship.  No indie game can match the beauty that comes from collaboration and detail this game has in both its gameplay and art.For truly shocking me into the reality of a world that no HD game has done since, Fallout 2 gets 10/10.

A Better RPG than Fallout 4Bleeding from several wounds, I thrust my spear once more toward my enemy, this time connecting, finally. I'm poisoned, bleary eyed and have six hitpoints remaining. I just survived the first dungeon with a charismatic character. I killed some Giant Ants. This is what Fallout was. A sprawling, tough RPG that actually required some amount of planning toward your character and your decisions. Even to this day the dialogue is great and the story gripping yet allows a sense of freedom. If you want a fighting character you better make a fighting character. When I played Fallout 4 I made an incredibly charismatic, intelligent character with poor stats in fighting. I still managed to kill everything. In Fallout 2 I barely survived the first dungeon, getting mauled by Lesser Scorpions and Giant Ants, all because I wanted my character to be a talker, not a fighter. Obviously it's aged; three mousepointers need to be alternated between; combat, movement and interaction. There's a panel that brings up skills and not everything is made immediately clear. But if those main 'problems' with the game don't scare you away then this is a great game. It's worth a try, even if just to see how Fallout was and to experience a true gaming classic; one that will remain for countless years as a great game in the history of gaming. jmcone's Personal Rating: Highly Recommended "

												I loved videogames as a kid and my favorites were the action and rpg games where I played the hero with the sword slaying my enemies.  Naturally I was pumped as I put my max strength character into this world, heroically exterminating giant ants with my spear.  And after that earned me the title of 'Chosen One' nothing could stop me.  So weapon in hand I search for injustice in the closest town and find a slavers guild.  There is no room for this evil in my world!  I charge right through the front door and skewer the boss twice with my trusty spear of justice...   at which point six heavily armored guards blast my head and arms off with submachine guns, as my 11 year old eyes stare in shock at my blood sputtering corpse on the floor.  I would forever remember this day as when I TRULY understood why guns are better than swords.Fallout 1 and 2 are both artifacts from a time when there was no mainstream gaming.  Big companies all made indie games, and this is a result when that money isn't restricted by demographics and overprotective mother influenced censorship.  No indie game can match the beauty that comes from collaboration and detail this game has in both its gameplay and art.For truly shocking me into the reality of a world that no HD game has done since, Fallout 2 gets 10/10.

												Builds on everything I had problems with in the first game: The companions, and travel mainly. I only got one playthrough into this and it took 40 well-spent hours away from me, it felt like a small MMO or something with all the content and quests and cities to explore. What's more, it drastically builds upon the political ideas behind the game, as FO1 mainly had just the authoritarian left that was the Master, FO2 now has Vault City as a criticism of democracy, the NCR as a pushy police state/democracy and the Enclave who stood for forced eugenics, absolutely awesome stuff. Even though the pop-culture references and less serious atmosphere only slightly take away from the game, it's a very, very solid 10/10 from me. Would ride that Highwayman into the sunset any day of the week.			"

												Hands-down best Fallout game to date. Fallout 2 blows every other game in the amazing series out of the water. Providing the most amount of gameplay, and some features that aren't even in the modern installments. Fallout 2 took the first game and made it more in depth, funnier, bigger, and badder. If the next Falllout were to have the awesomeness of this one packaged with modern graphics and combat, I don't think I'd ever get anything done.			"

												While some decry that it's a lot goofier than the first Fallout, you still have a game that'll give you your daily dose of grimdark, on top of a whole heaping of intricate quests and very well-written dialouge. However, I must temper my recommendation with a warning: Fallout 2 has what is generally regarded as the worst tutorial level ever created. If you're not rolling a combat character, you're going to have a bad time. Just grit your teeth and power through it, and you'll be treated to one of the best WRPGS ever.			"

												I finally had a chance to complete this game. I tried to beat it about 2 times before and always failed due to the lack of time. I must admit I cheated and used a wiki toward the end of the game to speed things up, because without it I, most possibly would fail to beat it again.It's a very deep, hard and challenging RPG game in the best sense of role playing meaning. I played it then it was first released, it was fantastic then, now it certainly feels aged, and controls are not as good as they could be now, but for old-school players it's all fine. If you are not scared by aged games I really suggest you try this masterpeace but be prepeared to spend at least 100 hours for a fast paced game. If you really want to figure all by yourself it's better to have a physical journal there you should write up all information you encounter in the game since it's not that good at tracking all your discoveries. P.S. And that's the one of the rare games there you really need to read manual before playing (and it's a good manual too).			"

												Hoo boy. I have mixed feelings on this one.Fallout 2 is more or less the same as Fallout in terms of gameplay, but with improvements, which is certainly a plus. There is one minor gameplay quibble I have, and that's that they slightly nerfed the Turbo Plasma Rifle for no good reason. Why, besides trying to make the Pulse Rifle seem better by comparison? That seems like the completely wrong way to go about it, making and trying to balance new content by changing the old. It was fine! On the subject of equipment changes, they also reduced the weight of the Power Armor by about half with no explanation. I'd accept that if you at least acknowledged it, but now it just seems kind of silly. Just one offhand remark about removing unnecessary systems in there! THAT'S IT!Anyway, the story issue is a bit more complex. The focus in Fallout 2, I've noticed, is more based on the moment-to-moment or area-to-area experience, rather than Fallout 1's cohesive whole. As a result, the whole thing seems more scattered, muddier, and overall less entertaining and less absorbing, as they'll do anything to make sure that you're never not entertained, while Fallout made sure that there was a single, easy-to-follow narrative, leading to a better and more consistent atmosphere.One other really annoying thing: the game takes forever to get going, especially for gun-oriented characters. The Temple of Trials and the majority of Klamath have nothing but scorn for your desire to find a single ranged weapon that doesn't have a 1-bullet clip, and even then you're still on shaky ground until maybe the Den. For a while, I even tried to just play a hand-to-hand character for this game simply because the beginning is so stupidly unhelpful! In contrast, take a look at Fallout 1's beginning. You're kicked out the door. You have a gun, a knife, and ammo to spare (and a definite and straightforward goal). Boom. All playstyles are go. Even with the gameplay sorting itself out, the whole Fallout 2 package doesn't really get engaging until Gecko. After that, though, it really does pick up steam, and by the Enclave you realize that just now you're getting the experience and thrills that Fallout 1 was delivering from square one. (I should probably mention that eventually I was so desperate for some fun way forward that I looked up Per Jorner's excellent guide. That was what truly rekindled my interest, and I urge everyone to check it out. It contains levels of love and research of and for a game that I haven't seen since Everything You Wanted to Know About Headcrabs and More. Check that out too, actually.)Overall, I like Fallout 1 more. Fallout 2 is huge, much bigger than its predecessor, and has its share of wonderous delights (don't get me wrong on that), but more often than not for me they're hidden behind some sort of obtuse non-engaging..sloppiness? Design oversight? Overreaching? that the first game rarely if ever had. I guess I'd still recommend it -mostly for the story connectivity- but really, Fallout 1 is the better of the two, in my opinion.TL;DR I like Fallout 1 more, it seems to me that they got sloppy with this one. Too big to ignore, though.Also, some of the canonical and best endings are hidden behind lazy bugs? WHAT?EDIT: Just recently, I've been replaying the Fallout games in preparation for Fallout 2. When it came time for Fallout 2, I used Per Jorner's guide to speedrun through the thing in the course of a night. Playing through the entire thing once was enough for me.			"

												The amount of ways to takle everything is amazing, I got to the end of the game with the weapon and armor they give you at the start, I didn't have to worry about this upgrade on a weapon because I didn't need it, I could suck someone's ♥♥♥♥ for 5 caps, I could investigate the murder of a dead mafia family's son, I could be a slaver or a NCR ranger, I could make the NCR into the super power it is today or reduce it to dust, I could help reduce tensions and keep one of the biggest mines running or just ignore it and let them kill each other, a game where your objective is to get an item to keep your village running but you could kill your village, a game that can be completed by taking every soul you encounter or by not having to pull the trigger once, a game where if you go up to a hooker with an energy weapon she'll ask if it's a vibrator.Now let's compare that to fallout 4,You can't just leave use the same weapon to the end of the game, without running into to trouble at least, you didn't make any faction into a super power, you're decions didn't lead to any towns blowing up, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's only 2 towns in the game  it's impossible to finish without killing anyone(what I mean is not getting into any combat situation) and there's too many essentiels that you can't kill without mods, I mean in the other one there was 3  different ways ways I know of to get the item you need here there is one, there are no consequences to joining all the factions and even if you decline you can still join until the end of the game.Yeah, draw your own conclusion...P.S if you did decide to buy this like you should, be sure to get a graphics mod because the graphics aged horribly			"

												This is a case of learning from past mistakes and implementing fixes that are fun and fair. The improvements in gameplay are spectacular and make this a must own for nearly any gamer, both new and old. Then the beautiful mixture of story and world building. One of the best old school RPG's I've played.So like I said in my Fallout review this game fixes nearly every gameplay issue I had from the first one. The VATS hit calculations seem far more logical and correct, though it suffers a few times in a playthrough. I did not feel like rage quitting because of it at any point like the original did so many times. Thank you for this improvement.Criticals, another point from my Fallout review, vastly improved. So now enemies will actually do damage to you throughout the game, and criticals won't drain you in a single shot usually. Once again I found the new system of critcals to be fair and appropriate. So the story takes a step backward but then takes two more forward. The stepbackward is the depth of the NPC's. That has left, unfortunately, but has been replaced with greater variety. These enhance the world quite a bit, while giving you a little wish that some NPC's were used a little more. It's a better trade off in the end, because not only does it build story within The Chosen One's life but it also creates world depth. So this could go either way depending on your preference.Add onto all of this more weapons and items. Then a Highwayman to boot. This is a monumental increase in gameplay making this a fun game and a great story.			"

The graphical integrity and how the game runs is just fantastic one could possibly even say that falout 3 was just a minor step on the the step ladder when it comes to graphical quality but most definatly a step down when it comes to the story. The story involved you searching for the G.E.C.K. device to save your tribe from disease but of course on your way you come across many obstacles and obstructions as you are looking for the G.E.C.K. 11/10, Must have, Game of the century, Perhaps the game of the universe.

												A very good game....SO far Due to the fact I am a fan of the later games. I didn't enjoy it as much but still liked it.The turn based combat I found wasn't that good..But the story was great! However I recommend this Game To people who played it in the 90s or people who want to learn more about the fallout story. I do not recommend this game to people who Only like the new games and think the old ones suck.			"

												Tired of your average RPG? Does helping the same settlement have you down? Introducing Fallout 2, one of the best, if not the best, game in the series. It's a great RPG overall. Fallout 2 has so many quests, characters, enemies, weapons, skills, and tons more. But wait, there's more! Like pop culture references? Fallout 2 has so much of that. Like apocalpyse games with humor injected into it? Fallout 2 has that. It'll take some getting used to if you haven't played it before, but it's worth every cent.			"

												It's definitely harder to get into than Fallout 1, but in the end it's worth it. Whereas Fallout 1 drew me right in from the start, I had to force myself through the first couple hours of Fallout 2, but it was worth it. What you find is a game with everything that Fallout 1 did right, (the atmosphere, the characters, the immersion, the story) and added onto it with a bigger environment, more things to do, more items, and a generally longer and more diverse gaming experience. Highly recommended to anybody who can appreciate an older game.NOTE: If using windows 7, the colours will most likely look really distorted when you launch the game. This makes the game unplayable, but it can be easily 'fixed' by closing explorer.exe when you run the game.			"

												Fallout 2 was a game pirated and given to me on a blank CD by a friend's little brother in high school. What I got out of the game has lasted me a lifetime. From it's familiar locales like New Reno and San Francisco, to it's gritty noir, Fallout 2 has it all.  You could even murder kids and get branded a Childkiller. Not your forte? You can go into the porn industry in New Reno! If you're any sort of fan of post-apocalytic scenarios or films in general, this is an assured staple for your library. Every few years (or new computer, I suppose), I would dig out my old burned copy and reinstall it to give it another playthrough. I happened upon a one-day sale wherein Fallout 1-3, New Vegas, and Tactics were all $2.49 apiece. Naturally, I♥♥♥♥♥♥with glee and promptly ordered. This game will entrance you, given a few hours of dedication. Just like Fallout 3, Fallout 2 begins with a catchy, old-timey tune; in this case, it's Louis Armstrong's ""Kiss To Build A Dream On."" Here's hoping this game sticks with you, too.			"

												After putting a couple hundred hours into Fallout: New Vegas, I decided to play the first three games. I started with Fallout. It was fun and gave some background information to common themes in the later games. I beat it in under 24 hours, if I hadn't wasted 3 hours remaking characters that could survive it would have been less. Then came Fallout 2. With the experience I had gained from Fallout I ran into Fallout 2 expecting a cakewalk. I was wrong. The wasteland had became an even harsher place. It took over 50 hours to beat this game and I loved every moment. Unlike in Fallout where I had ditched Ian late in the game to comtinue on, I found myself reloading ealier saves time after time when Lenny or Cassidy died. I ran all over the wasteland avoiding the Enclave and mutants searching for secret places and proper oppponents. I hope when I start Fallout 3 Soon that I can experience the same level of investment in a game.			"

												Now that Interplay has lost the rights to Bethesda, the new ownership has decided to patch the glitch that would cause your game to black out every few minutes and/or the random rainbowish colors that would be there in error due to the incompatibility problems caused by newer systems. This pretty much saves you a few minutes if you couldn't figure out the problem yourself online. Nonetheless, the game itself has an enriching storyline that even pleases graphics-spoiled gamers like me. I would really recommend this to anyone who has played any part of the newer fallout series such as Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas but wants to know the backstories to various references in the newer games, such as the origin of Marcus at Jacobstown in Fallout: New Vegas or Harold at the Oasis in Fallout 3. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for fun games in general.			"

In The End, Why Not Just Hit Children In The Groin With A Sledgehammer - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]In the event that the world ever ends, be it zombie apocalypse, nuclear armageddon, or any other fun kind of catastrophe, I feel like humanity definitely will live on. We're a stubborn race of beings. Like cockroaches. We're everywhere, we just won't go away, and we seem to find a way to procreate everywhere.Out of every possible way that the human race could near extinction, I think being mostly annihilated by an atomic bomb or so would be the best way to go. Especially if Fallout is something we could go on.In Fallout 2 specifically, one of the great tactical CRPG classics, an atomic post-apocalyptic wasteland is a pretty fun place. You can pretty much do whatever you want.Fallout 2 takes place after the events of Fallout 1, with your character from the first game starting their own village outside the Vault to live out the rest of their days. Your new character is a descendant of them, and has grown up outside the Vault. Their village has had a horrible drought, and it's up to you as The Chosen One to set off and save the world.Fallout 2 is near identical to the first game in terms of gameplay, polished and upgraded to make it the definitive classic Fallout experience. If you're looking for the very best in terms of isometric, tactical CRPG action, Fallout 2 is probably your game.The time limit is gone. You're free to explore Fallout 2's vast, open world to your heart's content. There's all sorts of side-quests, missions, and just random nonsense to get yourself into. You can join the mafia, become a pornstar, or just slaughter every human being you see. It's all free game.To start, you just need to create your character. There is a selection of pre-made ones, but the real fun of the game is creating your own character to fully immerse yourself in the world of Fallout.From there, you just need to play through what could be called a crude tutorial dungeon. After that, the world opens up. Slowly at first, as your stats will not allow much exploration when the wasteland is crawling with giant scorpions and freaks. But with time, you'll be able to do as you please.Mechanically, it's better than the original Fallout. It plays better, it controls better, and it has more depth than the original in terms of what the world offers. The gameplay has been balanced to make all character skills viable, which was an issue with the first Fallout game. As a sequel, it definitely has at least improved upon the original.However, I personally still prefer the first one. Fallout 2, I felt took a lot of what made Fallout special out of the equation. The time limit, while brutal, was part of giving that sensation of hopelessness and urgency. And having your character born outside of a Vault, it took some of the impact away of having stepped out into the wasteland for the first time.The story was not as compelling, and it didn't really feel like Fallout at first to me. The early game is particularly slow, and it takes a while to really capture that Fallout vibe.As an older game, it is still a little bit dated. Especially in the graphics department. But still completely enjoyable as a game. I always did have a thing for older games. I like them a little mature, you know?Regardless, Fallout 2 is still a very special game. There aren't very many other games where you can blow up small children with powerful explosives, become a slaver, or have sex with a mutant. Fallout 2 really is something special, and it's an essential part of any PC game collection. The sheer depth of the game constantly gives off the feeling that there's still more to do and more to see.In the event of a real nuclear apocalypse, I call dibs on leader of the pornstar mafia. No, I already got dibs, it's official. Too bad. You can be something else.I called it, it's mine.			"

Differing from the third installment (not including Fallout Tactics, Fallout BoS, or any of the other spinoffs that are not considered part of the Fallout lore canon) in the series, the first and second installments were more so based around strategy, smart thinking, constant saves, and knowing when to either fight or run. Compared to the more recent installments, this game, along with the prequel, is somewhat like playing a game of chess. Knowing when to move, when to strike, and when to regret poor decisions. Not a game for those who are not good with tactics. Sadly, it starts somewhat slowly, and once you get really going later on in the game, it get's to the point where not even the more deadly mobs, like Deathclaws or Wamaningos, can not do much harm to you or your party due to how strong someone can become in the game. Let's talk about the story. You, the Player Character, are the son or daughter of the original Vault Dweller, the main protaginist of the first Fallout game. At the start, you go out to find the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or more simply known as the G.E.C.K, in order to prevent your village of Arroyo from dying of famine and disease. As time goes on, it goes from trying to prevent your crops from dying, to trying to save your village from the Enclave, the remnants of the American Government, who captured your fellow villagers to perform experiments on them, and you're the only one who can do anything about it. Well, you and your party of not-so-merry pals. Ranging from a Artificial Intelligence, to a super mutant, to even a intelligent Deathclaw, you have a wide variety of followers to recruit. Personally, I give this game a 9 / 10, a great strategic game with a decent story and and a lot of replayability, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the Fallout series, as well as anyone who likes to think strategicly.

												It's essentially like the original Fallout but it's slightly harder and with a storyline that doesn't take itself as seriously. This doesn't necessarily make it bad though and some would argue that this makes it better.			"

												This game is an absolute classic. If you are a fan of rpgs you have to give this one a try. The pinnacle of Roleplaying in the fallout seris. Gamplay hasn't aged as well, but if you like more strategic gamplay you can probably look passed that. The atmosphere of the wasteland and humorous tone of the game really blend well. I really suggest anyone who enjoys rpgs who has not played classics like give Fallout 2 a try			"

												This just might be my favorite game ever. Make sure you get the Fallout Restoration Project for the best experience. Adds a lot of content that was cut out of the original release and fixes a ton of bugs that have existed since Interplay went out of business all those years ago.While Fallout is actually a pretty short game, this one is burgeoning with content. The world is alive and connected. You can play in any way you want. Your moral compass can point in any direction. I still find new things even after all these years.			"

												CANNOT RECOMMEND ENOUGH! This and Fallout 1 are MUST OWNS! I recently purchased the 2 in a bundle and I seriously cannot put them down! I've been hooked on them for 2 weeks straight. Now I know if you're like me and not from the era of these types of games you need to be in the mood to play this type of top down, turn based system. But if you look up a quick guide like I did, I was used to the system and was having fun within the first 20 min of Fallout 1. And since FO2 is so similar, you can get straight into it. - The story of the games is 10/10, love them.- The worlds (especially Fallout 2) are sensational, I spoke to every NPC to soak in as much info as I could- The companions are cool but as always in these games, they're in the way a lot and they shoot you a fair bit (Much improved in fallout 2 since you can push them out of the way)- And the CHOICES! I now understand why all the other fans were dissapointed in FO3 and 4.. the choices and consequences here are exciting and rewarding.- FO2 = Best RPG i've ever playedThere is sooo much more to be said here but I need to get back to slaughtering slavers. I wish I could forget the two games just so I could experience them for the first time again!TL;DR: Best RPGS ever, world, story, choices 11/10. Buy buy buy			"

												(Post Fallout 1 Review) Fallout 2 continues 70-80 years after Fallout 1, playing as the ancestor of your previous character, the ""Vault Dweller"" or also called the ""Chosen One"". You are sent off into the wastes to help your tribe ""Arroyo"" and uncover the legacy The Vault Dweller left behind within California/Nevada and introducing a new grand threat who origins are from those whom governed before, the ""ENCLAVE"". Remnants of the United States.The core gameplay mechanics never really changed when transitioning between Fallout 1 and 2 (Isometric turned based combat). The most noticable differences is the amount of new perks, and the way you begin the game. Fallout 2 entices you to create a close-quarters heavy build, over Fallout 1's small guns since you are a tribal. This game also introduces a boatload of new companions (12-13), which smothers Fallout 1's four followers. Fallout 2 has plenty of new quests that all intertwine nicely together, as multiple factions and cities effect one another.Tons of Fallout cameos, pop-culture references, and tons of new content. Such a lovely addition to my Fallout experience! (Did one playthrough, with around 90% of the sidequests complete. Time clocked: Around 50 hours)			"

												fallout 2 is without question the GOD of isometric RPG's. being one of the few games to rival deus ex for the title of greatest RPG ever made.managing to improve upon perfection with the masterful original fallout by adding even more into the mix.>bigger world>more items and weapons>refined companion systemeverything from fallout 1 has been improved and what was perfect has been doubled in quantity.the only negative I can think of is with this version of the game. traveling around the world is far too slow for comfort, making the act of exploration a chore.I would recommend modifying the game to speed up traveling or seek out the original version.but in the end, you are left with quite possibly the finest RPG ever made!brutal, rewarding, deep and fun!and if none of those things appeal to you?<--------Undertale is that way10/10			"

The pop culture is amazing with massive horror in some areas as saving the whole human race from the United States and saving your villiage, but also the pop culture like finding a crashed Federation shuttle and becoming a porn star.

												Fallout 2 is a classic, a legend that stands amongst legends. The equal of every great CPRG that came before it, and superior to most that came after it, this game has aged gracefully and still holds the charm it did when I first booted it up nearly 2 decades ago as a younger lad.You play as the Chosen One, a villager from a dying tribe who is sent on a hail Mary quest to recover an ancient device rumored to return dead wasteland to verdant fields: the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, or G.E.C.K. for short. This is not a new plot device, it is not terribly original to be the only man or woman in the world capable of saving your people. However, the execution of this quest is what sets Fallout 2 apart from even it's own successors. You are given almost complete freedom to be anyone you want in this world. You can be a sociopathic killer, an opportunistic slaver, a drug-addled genius, or a savior to the common man and the tread upon. Your character, and how you are reacted to and perceived is entirely based on your choices. An interaction I recall from my very first playthrough many years ago had someone asking my sarcastic little thief of a character what being a tribesman was all about, and did we eat our dead like he'd heard? My answer was thus: ""Of course, how else would I grok their essence? Just sauté what you want to eat in a light garlic sauce. Delicious.""As a top-down, or isometric, turn-based game, this is slower than most modern games. There's next to no handholding, as the game will frequently murder you for taking on fights you couldn't handle, or frankly just for fun. RNG is a large factor here. However, the gameplay holds as true now as it did then. Plot your moves, mind your enemies, and bask in the glory of every hard-won battle. Of course, for every victory there can be defeat, and you should be prepared for it if you've not played a game of this type before.While dated by anyone's standards, the graphics serve their purpose with charm and readability; and more importantly it supports modern monitors, no patching required. There is a fan-made patch you can use that many will recommend, but I haven't tried it. Haven't felt I needed it.This game is my go-to. I've owned probably 5 or 6 copies of it over the years, and whenever I find myself somewhere where Internet is scarce and my battery is a consideration, it never fails me. If you are in the mood for old-school role-playing magic, you've found it.			"

												If you played Fallout and liked, this one is a must-have. It's just all-around perfection, with a darker and funnier story than the first. The tone is less serious too.Well, if you never played the first one, you should, and then play this one. If you played and didn't like it, you are either a spoon-fed gamer or a babby.Grade: A+			"

												Fallout 2 is a very intresting classic game in the Fallout series. Here is the list of pros and cons. Pros *gore I love the pixilated gore *unique custimisation system  *nice combat system *many more choseable allies than the first Fallout*great story that follows up well on the first fallout Cons * No mini map  * Some skills are redundant and rarely utilised  * Your allies can die permenantly and since there is a select few number of allies you are going to have to redo battles over and over to get a result where non of your allies die  *  weapon iniquality: guns are better than mellee weapons, although this is realistic I would have hoped rpgs wouldn't stoop to such realism   * and last of all the frequent much dreaded MISSOverall though it is pretty fun to play this 1998 classic.

												This is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. I have been a huge fan of the Fallout series since I was a kid and this game delivers almost everything a fallout fan could want but you have to take it for what it is. The game is about 16 years old now so for most of the people that became fans of the series because of Fallout 3 and New Vegas this game is not what you might be expecting. I recommend this game to all of the people that grew up in the 90's and love the rpgs from that time. I do not recommend it for all of the people that are expecting it to be like Fallout 3 or New Vegas or any newer game for that matter. This game is amazing but like I said you have to take it for what it is.			"

												Play it. Now. Review over. Wait...you're still reading this arent you?Fallout 2 is by far the strongest title in the Fallout series, and one of the better games of its type from its era of gaming. The story is strong, only rivaled by Fallout 1 within the 5 games that make up the Fallout series. Your village is dying, and you're sent out into the world to find the Holy G.E.C.K. to save your people. A world filled with gangs, slavery, drug use, the Enclave, and talking mechanical dogs modelled off Dr. Who's K9.  The gameplay, while completely different than some may expect after playing FO3 or NV, is a vast improvement upon the system from 1. More weapons, more companions, no timelimit, and improved set pieces, while retaining what made Fallout 1 a good game.If you don't have an issue with the obviously dated graphics, and a gameplay style that, sadly, is long dead this game is for you.

												A post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG like no other.This game is a classic. I've put in hundreds of hours in it playing different ways with different characters before I added it to my steam library (I own the discs for 1 and 2). The game has a good mix of stat/skill building and loot collection. For its time, the cutscenes are pretty good. There's little to be desired in such a classic game.The ability to choose your path in this game is beyond astounding for such an old game. If you remember when Fable came out, people freaked out because you could choose your own path. Fallout has done that stuff way before such games. If you like to be a jerk or a good guy, you can do either to your hearts content.Fallout has some of the most memorable designs and lore of any post-apocalyptic setting I've seen, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good turn-based, isometric RPG romp.Easily a 10/10 game. As good in my childhood as it is in my adulthood, a timeless classic.			"

												The good, the bad and the ugly for Fallout 2.Fallout is one of those game franchises that gives me he warm-tingly feeling just thinking about the games and while Bethesda has made some great sequels with Fallout 3 and New Vegas, by far one of my favorite games of all time has to be this instalment.Now, just to save time the review of this game could be applied to the original Fallout game with one major difference; there’s no annoying time limit. Now, sure the lack of that time limit may affect some’s perspective of realism but I think the freedom to explore and do side-quests makes the game more enjoyable but that’s just my opinion.The good:Grittiness of stories, environments, and characters has been something that’s been fairly popular in today’s gaming culture but nothing that’s come out recently could hold a candle to this game. Throughout the game you’re subjected to a very harsh environment where even the most civilized towns seems to have a dark streak that plays into the general feeling that the world is, in fact, completely screwed up and it’s up to you (ironically titled “the chosen one”) to save not only your village but the whole region from various forms of corruption and evil. Or you know… not… that’s what’s so great about this game! It gives you real choices on how you want to address problems you come across. Do you want to kill the slavers holding onto a mission critical NPC? Or do you want to trade in a companion and join them? Do you want to work towards putting a stop to the growing chem addicts in the region? Or ensure the chems keep flowing freely? Sorry, I kind of got off topic there. Bottom line, this game’s dark themes and choices give this game a level of depth that makes replays all the more enjoyable.The Bad:Some of the problems that gripped old PC games like this is they are often under-developed. It’s hard to tell if they just ran out of time on some things or in the case of things like the child-killer perk they were just WAY too controversial to be put in at release. Some of the things they took out though honestly would have made the game more enjoyable. If you have the time, do some research and take the time to get a good unofficial patch to restore some of these missing pieces.The ugly:The learning curve… Look, this game is not for the meek. You’re going to die and you’re going to die a lot. It falls under the category of old-school rpgs where even the easiest difficulties can be brutal for those who don’t know what to expect playing a game like this. In fact, if you don’t know what you’re getting into playing this game I’d warn you that you will probably restart a few times until you can get a character build that works for you (I recommend custom builds) and just like with all old games like these SAVE OFTEN.Story: 8/10Development: 2/10Nuka-nostalgia: 9/10 "

												One of the few games I recommend without hesitation.  Fallout 3 (a.k.a.: Oblivion 2) is total garbage, which completely lacks the mechanical equality, spirit, aesthetics and depth of its predecessors.  Fallout 3 is an open-world FPS that lacks the integral granularity to exist a an RPG, yet passes itself off as one as effectively as Steve Buscemi in drag.The REAL Fallout series represents an almost unparallelled RPG system in its complexity, balance and replayability.  Fallout is, without hyperbole, also one of the most influential games in history; it literally is the foundation for much of the modern PC (and PnP) RPG paradigm.Out of all the hundreds of RPGs I've played, Fallout 1&2 are still unquestionably in my top 5.

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It is very old but that does not take away anything from it. The begining of the game is extreamly bad. The first temple will make you want to stop playign but after that its amazing. As you progress in the story you go to different cites with 10 or so different side quests. And they are very interesting. One is about a ghost where you help her find peace. Another is where you go to a bar on one side of town where drinks are twice as much as a bar on the other side of town and you can do a quest where you go snooping around looking for the reason those drinks are so low. In the begining of the game you won't have much and combat can be a little difficult since in fast travel it brings you to a map where you click around in the direction the NPC's told you the next city is which is very unique and interesting. Although sometimes you will run into a group of bandits ir wild animals trying to kill you and since there are edges of the land that you are on you can just run away very easily. Over all this is a great game.			"

												A true gem of rpg genre. Timeless classic which never becomes boring and, surprisingly enough, outdated.When I bought my first pc long time ago F2 was one the first games I installed and since that time it's still one of my favorite. And I'm still have that old cd full of old scratches.Rich world with charismatic characters, wide variety of story-impacting decisions, post-nuclear atmosphere, turn-based combat and just fun. Where else can your character become a pornstar (no videos sadly, just your own imagination), find a Holy Hand Grenade, been referred as a ""walking refrigerator"" and feel yourself as a skilfull diplomat even your character was under performance-enhancing drugs and had a huge heavily-armed supermutant at the back looking curiously at slightly shy local inhabitants? And you can't put a price tag on that unforgettable feeling when your Chosen One receives Expert Excrement Expeditor perk.And there was real supermutants before Bethesda made a typical orcs out of them.If you've ever been curious about the games which made significant contribution to the evolution of rpg genre you just must to try this masterpiece.PS. And don't forget to download high resolution patch.			"

												Its kinda redundent to say this by now but ""Fallout 4 has got nothing on 2,3 and New Vegas."" 2 and New Vegas are the ones that stand out to me the most as they both have the best RPG mechanics and dialouge options in the series. Thats something Fallout 4 seems to have forgot. Its an RPG series, not a Generic open world ""Your decisions dont really change anything"" FPS game. Fallout 2 gets a 9/10 from me.			"

												The sequel to the classic Fallout, not only does this contain many improvements over the original, but it also contains great gameplay and writing that is just no doubt better than most AAA RPGs of today. This game is the sole reason so many Fallout fans hate Bethesda. They ruined the franchise with the removal of a lot of great, classic RPG elements, a complete overhaul (for the worse) of the game's style and hiring the most boring people you could ever know as writers. This is a very old-school game and it screams nostalgia. A real blast to the past. This was also the big breakthrough for LGBT equality in video games. You can be gay in this game. Also, it was the first game to feature gay marriage, which was illegal in US back in 1998. This whole package, as well as Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale, all of it just makes me miss Black Isle. 9/10.			"

												A post-apocalyptic turn-based RPG like no other.This game is a classic. I've put in hundreds of hours in it playing different ways with different characters before I added it to my steam library (I own the discs for 1 and 2). The game has a good mix of stat/skill building and loot collection. For its time, the cutscenes are pretty good. There's little to be desired in such a classic game.The ability to choose your path in this game is beyond astounding for such an old game. If you remember when Fable came out, people freaked out because you could choose your own path. Fallout has done that stuff way before such games. If you like to be a jerk or a good guy, you can do either to your hearts content.Fallout has some of the most memorable designs and lore of any post-apocalyptic setting I've seen, and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good turn-based, isometric RPG romp.Easily a 10/10 game. As good in my childhood as it is in my adulthood, a timeless classic.			"

												Play it. Now. Review over. Wait...you're still reading this arent you?Fallout 2 is by far the strongest title in the Fallout series, and one of the better games of its type from its era of gaming. The story is strong, only rivaled by Fallout 1 within the 5 games that make up the Fallout series. Your village is dying, and you're sent out into the world to find the Holy G.E.C.K. to save your people. A world filled with gangs, slavery, drug use, the Enclave, and talking mechanical dogs modelled off Dr. Who's K9.  The gameplay, while completely different than some may expect after playing FO3 or NV, is a vast improvement upon the system from 1. More weapons, more companions, no timelimit, and improved set pieces, while retaining what made Fallout 1 a good game.If you don't have an issue with the obviously dated graphics, and a gameplay style that, sadly, is long dead this game is for you.

												This game is amazing. It has the perfect blend of atmoshere, characters, combat, and humor. Also, the game is hugely interactive. Wanna blow up that outhouse and watch fecal matter stain the town? You can do it! Also, you can now murder the heck out of those darn kids who won't get off your lawn. With grenades. Also, it has a WORLD MAP! With RANDOM ENCOUNTERS! Also, it has a lot of pop culture references, which is kinda like Fallout: New Vegas' Wild Wasteland perk, but not optional. Also, there are 'Special Encounters', which you can find on the world map. They're marked by a target on the map instead of a lightning bolt; and most of them are easter eggs. If you haven't played this ageless masterpiece, BUY. IT. NOW.Also, there is the infamous rainbow colors glitch; you don't need to go to any shady sites, just go to No Mutants Allowed and get the unofficial patch. Also, while you're at it, get Killap's Fallout 2 Restoration Project and you will have the best RPG experience of your life.			"

												Fallout 2, like it's predecessor and sequels, stands to date as one of the greatest roleplaying games ever devised. First introduced to the original game in the series as a youth, I quickly became addicted to both the setting and the story being told; I loved the choices you were asked to make, and the customisation options that were available to you; I adored the pre-war 50s feel that inhabited the wasteland, even as you carried plasma rifles and power armour into battle.In a word, Fallout 2, like the other games in the series, is sublime. As a fan of roleplaying games in general, I recognise that the post-apocalyptic genre is harder than others to make enticing - and yet Fallout somehow manages to nail it. Gore and mature themes meet head on with quirky humour, memorable locations and characters (Dogmeat and Harold the Ghoul being just two), and an expansive world to explore.Unlike the first game in the series, Fallout 2 has you taking on the role of a tribal youth who is sent out into the wasteland in order to secure a G.E.C.K. - a Garden of Eden Creation Kit - which will help your primitive people make the land furtile and liveable again. Who your character is - what gender, what they're good at, what their quirks are - is entirely up to you, as are the dialogue and moral decisions you make, and the route you take across the wasteland. With side quests all over the place, you can spend hours after hours trudging through the Fallout world, making your mark as either a sentinel of justice, or a madman with a shotgun. Good or evil, hero or villian - it's entirely up to you.The latter games might be controversial to a select few - after all, not everyone liked Bethesda's treatment of a classic game, and it's their perogative to think that way. However, it's almost unanimous fact that Fallout 2, like it's predecessor, stands as one of the greatest RPGs ever made.Buy this game.			"

												The sequel to Fallout (reviewed here if you're curious), released a year afterwards in 1998. It's bigger and more ambitious than the first game, with more quests, more items and more locations. Even the tone of the game is lighter: more 'epic quest with comedic elements' than 'save your home from doom in the dystopian wasteland', although that element is certainly still there. The wasteland is even starting to rebuild in places - a theme that New Vegas would revisit.Of course, not every writer consistently strikes gold. Fallout 2's writing contains more scattershot comedy, with less of an emphasis on your quest to save your village from starvation. Which might not hit the mark with everyone, this being a relatively hardcore niche title released in 1998 and developed by a team that was almost entirely if not 100% male. But don't despair: there's a solid game here for RPG fans nevertheless.Base gameplay is much the same as in Fallout: gaining XP to level up and allocating skill points/choosing perks, turn-based combat that uses Action Points, hex-based movement in locations, and wasteland travel between settlements - this time with an optional car!The interface and companion management is definitely improved from Fallout's. Among other things, the inventory menu isn't tedious to use, you can now trade money in sums containing five figures, and you have much greater control over your companions' battle tactics/equipment. Your companions also level up with you.Graphics are obviously the same style as Fallout, and FO2 even uses some of the first game's music. Good thing the new tracks are also excellent and evocative. You can download all of the remastered classic Fallout music here[auralnetwork.com].Much like Fallout, the patched Steam release is pretty buggy, up to and including serious bugs in main quests that can pretty much prevent you from finishing the game. I would suggest downloading killap's Unofficial Patch from his website[www.killap.net]. For those of you interested, he also made the Restoration Project mod, which adds a bunch of cut content.Fallout 2's early game is more difficult than Fallout's. The first game gave you a gun right from the beginning, and pointed you in a relatively easy direction. Fallout 2 starts with the Temple of Trials, which is an overly lengthy, somewhat implausible and definitely annoying tutorial-by-fire that is ten times more frustrating if your character isn't skilled at Melee Weapons or any of the other tested skills. If you picked any of the less-than-optimal skills, the whole game gets that much harder. Its only saving grace is that it lets you level up a few times. Most of the rest of the game afterwards is much better.After that ordeal, there are a few quests you can do in your home village before you set out, which are usually a good idea. It'll be several more XP levels and a couple of towns before you find a firearm worth anything. Your options will expand from there, although you're still kind of vulnerable until you find good armor and good weapons you're skilled with. It'll be another while yet before you can clear rooms by yourself, and even in the late game that's not always possible unless you explicitly made a character to do so.It's worth noting that there are many more high-tier weapons in each class to choose from, as opposed to Fallout where the turbo plasma rifle and gatling laser reigned supreme. True, the pulse rifle does the most damage, but now you have more options across multiple weapon skills and styles for when focusing on DPS doesn't quite cut it.Overall, it's a good game and a worthy sequel, but watch out for Lynnette.She doesn't like you.

												Old school, old graphics, still lots of fun. This is old graphics more like Dungeons and Dragons, except with Fallout script and story. A lot of customization, mad mature content (drug use, sex, and violence). You can even kill children in this game. Everything bad has consequences so it makes it even more realistic. A lot of humor in the game and spoofs hidden throughout. This was the original and so it is the best source to learn what Fallout games are really about. Combat is turn-based.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. It is very old but that does not take away anything from it. The begining of the game is extreamly bad. The first temple will make you want to stop playign but after that its amazing. As you progress in the story you go to different cites with 10 or so different side quests. And they are very interesting. One is about a ghost where you help her find peace. Another is where you go to a bar on one side of town where drinks are twice as much as a bar on the other side of town and you can do a quest where you go snooping around looking for the reason those drinks are so low. In the begining of the game you won't have much and combat can be a little difficult since in fast travel it brings you to a map where you click around in the direction the NPC's told you the next city is which is very unique and interesting. Although sometimes you will run into a group of bandits ir wild animals trying to kill you and since there are edges of the land that you are on you can just run away very easily. Over all this is a great game.			"

Fallout 3 (a.k.a.: Oblivion 2) is total garbage, which completely lacks the mechanical equality, spirit, aesthetics and depth of its predecessors.  Fallout 3 is an open-world FPS that lacks the integral granularity to exist a an RPG, yet passes itself off as one as effectively as Steve Buscemi in drag.The REAL Fallout series represents an almost unparallelled RPG system in its complexity, balance and replayability.  Fallout is, without hyperbole, also one of the most influential games in history; it literally is the foundation for much of the modern PC (and PnP) RPG paradigm.Out of all the hundreds of RPGs I've played, Fallout 1&2 are still unquestionably in my top 5.

												This game is HUGE, actually it was really too long for me and the mid-end game was really painful for me to play.Never wanted so much for a game to finish !A very good game nonetheless, didn't like the tribal thing at all but the rest is okay, i still prefer the 1st which has a better post-apocalyptic atmosphere IHMO.

												Fallout 2 is the pinnacle of the Fallout experience (in my opinion). This game presents a truly open world with hundreds of choices for any style of character to truly live in. Besides a slow start, increase in comic references, more complex story, and a few bugs here and there; Fallout 2 truly exceeds the accomplishments of its first installment here. Skills are much more useful, weapons and choices are abundant, and companions take on a life of their own here. Although most prefer the 3D titles in the Fallout series, this one truly feels the most imaginative and true to style in the series. If you haven't played it and are inclined to play 2D isometric RPG’s, this one is a real treat.			"

												Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing open world game featuring a considerably larger map/world and a far more extensive storyline, than those of Fallout 1. It is hands down one of the best games I've ever played (and that says a lot about it). The fact that the game was made in 1998 makes it even more impressive.Fallout 2 centres around the protagonist a.k.a. 'The Chosen One' and is entasked with the duty by the elder of his village to find and retrieve the Garden Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.) which is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland.The game comprises of exploring and travelling in the open world as well as speech and quests to various characters and NPC. In addition to the role playing elements, a unique turn-based shooter is used during combat. This incredible blend  makes the game so widely stimulating and intense. It is an experience unlike one other. Not to mention the storyline is as engaging as it is compelling.The player's actions throughout the game dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available. A player can choose to inhibit/aid certain NPCs and affects the entire gameplay. Aside from combat, speech also plays a huge role in the final outcome of the game. Before the game begins, the player is allowed to create his/her character with a variety of different skill, perk, trait and character point (S.P.E.C.I.A.L) builds. Because of the extensive outcome and scenarios, Fallout 2 is a game with incredibly high replay value.There is not much else to say, this game is IN-F***ING-CREDIBLE!GET IT (if you haven't already)6*/5 - 110% would recommend			"

The world is huge with tons of interesting characters, locations, quests, enemies etc. Plenty of options for character creation allow you to roleplay anyway you want (just look at my hours played to see the replay-value of this game). I strongly recommend downloading the fan-made Restoration Patch, it fixes a lot of bugs and restores cut content, making an already awesome game even better.			"

Creating different characters makes the game different every time you play. And it's not like in F3 or New Vegas. Char Sets really make the difference in the gameplay. But in fact, I think that the atmosphere of this game, the way the game was created, all the quests? special and random encounters they all make this game so exciting. MUSTPLAY			"

												Fallout 4 is a great game, but it is not a great Fallout game.Fallout 2, this game right here, was the first truly post-apocalyptic RPG where every choice had consequences, your character stats mattered, and the replayability of another character was NOT just cookie-cutter. You could actually build a character too weak to survive the first zone, instead of just doing 10% more damage with weapom type x.You most certainly did not get laser weapons, power armor, and a minigun to kill a deathclaw from an elevated position in your first play session. Your choices did not all result in the same outcome, nobody held your hand through a tutorial (in fact, you probably died in the first 5 minutes), and you the player could not over-ride your character's abilities by aiming better or jumping on top of something or or or ...I only have 41.3 hrs on record with the Steam re-release. However, I have two worn-out CD-ROM discs, a playable third in a binder, a GoG version somewhere, and a very real understanding of video game addiction.			"

												The reason Fallout 2 remains my second favoite game of all time (behind New Vegas) is that it manages to be a game that brings up idealogical questions, gets you emotionally attatched to characters, and has you make important choices with actual consequences. It does all that and also allows you to:- Get married and pimp your wife out for drug money- Play chess with a radscorpian- Get into BDSM with a super mutant- Get date♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by that ♥♥♥♥ Myron- Enter an eating contest to win $5 only to discover that the food was brahmin testicles- Donate sperm- Become a porn star (or a fluffer if your charisma is to low- Kill children and earn a perk for doing so- And contract HIV10/10 would get Mr. Bishop's daugther pregnant again			"

												In some ways, this is a direct improvement over the first. There is more stuff to do, more stuff to unlock, bigger map, etc. The character customization is deeper. That's all fine.However, what I appreciated about the first game were its simple objectives with various free-form solutions. Fallout 2 seems to strip these away in favor of increasingly complex and awkward quests. Often, they will require speaking with specific characters who are almost indistinguishable from other, less important NPCs, and doing so in a specific procedure. The Gecko Power Plant quest is a good example of how this, combined with a lot of tedious running around, results in a tiresome game of ""who's who"". Of course, the player usually has a choice in these sorts of situations to take a moral shortcut for negative karma, but the rewards for pursuing a ""good"" outcome pretty much always outweigh the rewards for ""bad"" behavior. I prefer to finish quests in as complete a fashion as I can, but their weird, constricted structure here bores and angers me.Other times, logic is sacrificed for the sake of creating gameplay. I understand that Vault 13, literally a hole in the side of a mountain, could be easily ignored, but if this Pipboy is the same one that belonged to the Vault Dweller, wouldn't it make sense for the locations canonically visited in the previous game to be on it already? At least the military base should be on there, if not the vault, but at least it's not hidden to the point of requiring a quest for exploration; Speaking of bases, what about the Sierra Army Depot? It sounds and looks like it would be big enough to be noticed just by going near it, but nope, it only appears when a certain quest is activated. There's also the Enclave power armor that's good at fooling Enclave soldiers in every situation save for the map's random events, but whatever, I'm sure someone with nothing better to do has come up with an explanation for all this. Bottom line is, the first game did not do this sort of thing. It let the player reap the full benefits of accidental discovery.A large map is good, but the random events happen WAY too often. I breathe less often than I encounter something on the map screen. Almost every time, the enemies appearing in these events are too hard (instant death), too plentiful (slow, agonizing death), or easily outrun (waste of time). Save scumming becomes a necessity for travelling through particularly brutal areas, such as the region around Navarro, where movement needs to be taken an inch at a time, lest I come across a patrol and get a one-way ticket to the game over screen. Get the car, because that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens a lot less often, although there is still the occasional stop made involuntary for whatever reason.Overall, the game is representative of living in modern day California; It's buggy (frame drops, some crashing), very disorganized, and constantly frustrating, but it has its moments, and it gets more fun after the first few hours. Bigger? Yes. Better? Maybe. It's still worth playing.			"

												Fallout 2 is a great game, and perhaps one of the best in the Fallout series. The setting, characters, and music are all wonderful. However, the combat is very dated and the game is infested with bugs. Certain quests and outcomes are simply unobtainable. In addition, I was annoyed that for a game that features many different solutions to complete a task, the game would often force you into doing things during crucial moments that if you had not previously focused upon, would be very difficult to do. Still, I can overlook this and say it is a game that any western rpg player should try out.			"

												In some ways, this is a direct improvement over the first. There is more stuff to do, more stuff to unlock, bigger map, etc. The character customization is deeper. That's all fine.However, what I appreciated about the first game were its simple objectives with various free-form solutions. Fallout 2 seems to strip these away in favor of increasingly complex and awkward quests. Often, they will require speaking with specific characters who are almost indistinguishable from other, less important NPCs, and doing so in a specific procedure. The Gecko Power Plant quest is a good example of how this, combined with a lot of tedious running around, results in a tiresome game of ""who's who"". Of course, the player usually has a choice in these sorts of situations to take a moral shortcut for negative karma, but the rewards for pursuing a ""good"" outcome pretty much always outweigh the rewards for ""bad"" behavior. I prefer to finish quests in as complete a fashion as I can, but their weird, constricted structure here bores and angers me.Other times, logic is sacrificed for the sake of creating gameplay. I understand that Vault 13, literally a hole in the side of a mountain, could be easily ignored, but if this Pipboy is the same one that belonged to the Vault Dweller, wouldn't it make sense for the locations canonically visited in the previous game to be on it already? At least the military base should be on there, if not the vault, but at least it's not hidden to the point of requiring a quest for exploration; Speaking of bases, what about the Sierra Army Depot? It sounds and looks like it would be big enough to be noticed just by going near it, but nope, it only appears when a certain quest is activated. There's also the Enclave power armor that's good at fooling Enclave soldiers in every situation save for the map's random events, but whatever, I'm sure someone with nothing better to do has come up with an explanation for all this. Bottom line is, the first game did not do this sort of thing. It let the player reap the full benefits of accidental discovery.A large map is good, but the random events happen WAY too often. I breathe less often than I encounter something on the map screen. Almost every time, the enemies appearing in these events are too hard (instant death), too plentiful (slow, agonizing death), or easily outrun (waste of time). Save scumming becomes a necessity for travelling through particularly brutal areas, such as the region around Navarro, where movement needs to be taken an inch at a time, lest I come across a patrol and get a one-way ticket to the game over screen. Get the car, because that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens a lot less often, although there is still the occasional stop made involuntary for whatever reason.Overall, the game is representative of living in modern day California; It's buggy (frame drops, some crashing), very disorganized, and constantly frustrating, but it has its moments, and it gets more fun after the first few hours. Bigger? Yes. Better? Maybe. It's still worth playing.			"

Nostalgia GaloreWord cannot describe how much I love this game and I have lost count of how many times I have played it from beginning to end. Even though the game is ridiculously bugged and in many ways flawed (in its original form); the gritty grainy charm, the uncompromising dialogue and gory pixilated body explosions on a critical hit or by using a massive enough gun are just unparalleled, even when compared to the more modern instalments of the franchise. The retro pop-50s, hilariously grotesque depiction of a post-apocalyptic future is iconic and unmatched, it creates a post-eschatological environment that is equally gruesome as it is enjoyable. With that said, I love all of the other iterations of the game universe including those done by Bethesda, even Fallout 4, but none of them really compare to Fallout 2, only New Vegas comes close. I cherish my adventures with Sulik and his dialogue with his nose-bone, I laugh every time I buff John Cassidy in the heat of battle but forget his heart condition leading to his demise and of course the possibility of being reunited with Dogmeat from Fallout 1. I also love that you can make a character with such a low intelligence score that virtually all dialogue is impossible (as you are more or less unable to speak) and yet, you can complete the game in a meaningful way. I will be playing this game again and again, and force my children to do that same.And if they refuse, I will disown them. This game is indeed; a kiss to build a dream on..   ** This is a review of the original game, not Bethesda’s polished version.			"

												The reason Fallout 2 remains my second favoite game of all time (behind New Vegas) is that it manages to be a game that brings up idealogical questions, gets you emotionally attatched to characters, and has you make important choices with actual consequences. It does all that and also allows you to:- Get married and pimp your wife out for drug money- Play chess with a radscorpian- Get into BDSM with a super mutant- Get date♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by that ♥♥♥♥ Myron- Enter an eating contest to win $5 only to discover that the food was brahmin testicles- Donate sperm- Become a porn star (or a fluffer if your charisma is to low- Kill children and earn a perk for doing so- And contract HIV10/10 would get Mr. Bishop's daugther pregnant again			"

												DISCLAIMER: I play this game with the restored content mod, so everything I say should be taken lightly if your not going to use the mod.Fallout 2 is one of the best games I have probably ever played or will play, the reasons are:1) The combat systems are near perfect, if you like turn based combat.2) The writing is also great, it's very clever and funny.3) The roleplaying is spot on and you can roleplay as pretty much anything.4) It has a ton of content, seriously I've put 100 hours into this game so far, about 70 hours in my first and about 30 so far in my second, and I don't think I did everything in my first playthrough. The only problems I have with this game are purely a result of tthe games age such as puzzles not making sense, and some minor bugs. Overall, Fallout 2 is a great game, and definitly worth $10.			"

Today is September 30, 2013, and the game was released September 30, 1998. 15 years is a huge age gap, so if you play it for the first time now, it may take some time to love it, but you will never regret.

												One of my all-time favorite video games. The writing is intricate and well-done; the environments, characters and enemies are all fitting and often-times funny and endearing. You get a real sense of adventure - venturing out into the wasteland with a underwhelming aresenal of weapons and supplies, a posse of weaklings and a steamlined roll of the dice in a nuclear wasteland.

												Fun and rewarding game but with a few problems.*It's really easy to gimp your character from the start because so many traits and perks are just useless.*You will be spending your first 5-6 hours killing rats because there are to few early-game quests to get you started. The game does get a whole lot easier once you get a mid-game weapon though.*The game has some glitches and slowdowns that can ♥♥♥♥ you over if you don't have backup saves. (There are fan patches that fix these though)*Energy weapons, First aid, Doctor Melee weapons and Traps are Throwaway skills in my opinion. Not worth leveling.*♥♥♥♥ you Lynette nobody likes you!With that said, the rest of the game is prima salami, go buy it.			"

												Now alot of people like Fallout, But What about the classics for new comers? Well Fallout 1 Was good But it was small. Where Fallout 1 Is small. Fallout 2 is Larger. Even if content was cut due to time constraints the community have mods that Re-Add that content, Fix it, Add quests, And make it as if it was actually in the game. Fallout 2 Gets easily a 9/10. A Great Must have game for Fallout fans waiting for Fallout 4. And this will take a while to finish aswell as Fallout 1 Even though its short Fallout 1 is fun. Even to this day the master will freak people the living hell out of them. I even saw a drawing of him and i got spooked. The game isnt that buggy except for the exploitive ones. And Bethesda made a HD Patch that really didnt do much. Great game that i would reccomend.			"

												Quite possibly my favorite game in the series, Fallout 2 is an engaging, difficult, and fully immersive showcase into the Fallout world that I've enjoyed perhaps more so than every other Fallout game to date.The game is turnbased, if you hate those games, you will hate this one. That's a fact. But this game offers a depth of play even with that system so much so that I don't mind it in most situations. Towards the end, it will turn into a grind to travel the huge distances necessary, but the color of the game largely makes up for it. There are tons of quests to go through, settlements to interact with, all of which play a part in the ending you find. The ending is like the end of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, where you do the same thing, but the dialogue offers more depending on what you did. The breadth of what can be experienced is great, and its combined Grit, Humor, and Atmosphere really made the game for me.			"

												I'm going to be honest, I despised this game when I first played it. My attacks weren't doing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I was extremely confused on what to do, and hated how it felt. That was months ago, until recently. I sat down, read some tips and tricks and gave this game a shot. Now I've 70 hours in this game. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blast.Pros:-Interesting and well-developed plot: The more I got in, the more I wanted to see what was going on. The stroy hooked really hooked me in.-Interesting locations: Many locations you visit always have some backstory around them and I gotta say, almost all of them are interesting and awesome to visit like the casino of New Reno with mobsters hanging around running the place or even  Navarro which let's you infiltrate the enclave base as a recruit. -Choices Galore: There are many choices to make in californian wasteland and many I never even knew about until my second playthrough. There's so much you could miss on one playthrough that it makes me want to do another just to see what the other way could have been.-Dialogue and Writing: This game has the best writing in any fallout game hands down. There are many humerous moments that we come to love in fallout, but it knows when to be dark and disturbing. You'll want to talk to everyone just to see what they're gonna say. (Low intelligence runs are the funniest♥♥♥♥♥♥ever)-Combat: This is a hit and miss for some. For me, it's a hit. When you sit down and understand what to do, the combat goes from something you may despise to something you won't mind at all.Cons:-Confusion: This game can be pretty confusing at times. Don't be afraid to pull up a walkthrough to help you out because while some quests are easy to do especially if you actually read what they want you to do, there are other quests where I just questioned Wtf am I supposed to do. Then when I do figure it out, I just think how tf was I supposed to know that. -Useless perks: There are some perks in this game that I took on my first playthrough that I thought would be good, only later to find out how useless they are and pretty much ruin my run. Traps and Gambling are prime examples of perks that you're rarely ever use most of the time. Watch out what you pick. You could really bone your run if you choose booty perks.Conclusion: This game may not be for everyone, but I urge you, stick with it. This is a kind of game I don't think we'll ever see today again. It's got laughs, it's got amazing writing, decent combat, some actual balls compared to newer fallouts (like being able to kill children and some of the subject matter) and it's just so damn interesting. Consider me a fallout 2 fan. This game rises as the best fallout game IMO.PS: Get the restoration project mod too! It adds cut content back into the game that makes the journey even cooler. (Just be sure to follow a guide for that too if you get stuck) :)			"

												Well this game is great.  I played this for much longer than Fallout 1 and there is reason for that.  This game has so much more content than the first.  There are many more quests and many more places to explore and visit.  This game is turning into one of my favorites because of everything the game is.  The guns are amazing to and all different.  What took the cake for this game was the dialouge and story.  The story far exeeds the first in depth and feel.  You feel like such a badass after the ending and feel satisfied.  The game is a memorable one for good reason.  What I didn't like about the game is that I wished that the Enclave were a better enemy faction.  I wish there were more to them so I can hate them more.  They did do things that were terrible to me but I didn't feel like they did much.  I guess that is the downside to isometric story driven games.  It is a great game and worth a buy.			"

												*For this game I will pretty much copy and paste my Fallout 1 review with a few changes, such as this game's world being larger and more content as well as the reputation system and Karma, other than that the game is pretty much the same as the first Fallout.*For those of you who got this game after playing 3, New Vegas and/or 4, prepare for a whole different cup of tea.This game is a isometric top down RPG(in case you didnt see the screenshots) and is a game that does not hold your hand whatsoever.And this being an older Fallout game means.....1) No tutorials and you are just thrown into the game straight.2) No quest markers meaning you might bang your head trying to find the correct location.3) You have to figure things out on your own.4) You have to save frequently lest you lose progress.5) Combat is significantly different that what you are used in future Fallouts, being slow and tactical.6) Inventory management and bartering is more cumbersome.7) Movement and exploration is slow with random encounters of random difficulty.If any of those turn you off then I suggest you rethink your purchase. Other than that, the game has a compelling story, great characters and quests to take on, its pretty much what you expect from the Fallout games, you are tasked with a huge responsibility and you set out to explore the wasteland. Its a very good game for its time and if you can get over the old game tropes I listed above, you are gonna have a good time.Now get out there and do your village proud Chosen One!!!			"

												Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game. I have many fond memories of this game, it is one of my all time favorites and even after all these years, after all the hours and hours and hours I have put into the game across several different computers; I can still play it shamelessly for hours and never get bored. Its like a great film that you never tire of. I bought Fallout 2 back in '99, as a teen and could not stop playing it. I ended up becoming so engrossed in the game, that I took to the internet and found myself at the No Mutants Allowed forums where I started a long running RP called Fallout: Systematic Annihilation (My name was TRAG on those boards.) The RP was a little hit on the website, and we had quite a few fans that read it regularly and even joined in the fun. But, I didn't stop there- Chris Avellone started releasing a little document called- The Fallout Bible. I was pulled in yet again. I have read that Bible more than once- I even have a digital copy on my cell phone for my reading pleasure. Yeah, this game started an obsession. Thankfully, it never got bad enough to where restraining orders were necessary (This is a joke of course, but there are those out there that have gone that far). So, you have read how this game has touched my life, and inspired my imagination. Now, you are probably wondering- where is the review!?! Fallout 2 is an isometric post apocalyptic role playing game with turn-based combat. That being said, this is not just any isometric RPG, this is one of the most well written, deep, open world rpgs ever crafted. Your choices here carry real weight within the world- Want to be a Slaver? A rough, hard living slave catcher/seller. All you have to do is get a tattoo on your forehead that the world can see and you can be one. The only problem is that people really do see it and their reactions to you will reflect that. Needless to say, Slavers aren't exactly welcome in many places in the wasteland. You may wish to rethink that life choice. But, this game is not just about career choice, this is a game with a deep strategic combat system that will challenge even the most hardened RPG gamer. The game does not hold your hand and more than likely you will die a lot. Saving often is the best tool in your arsenal, and you will be relieved when you can reload your game only a few moments before you told that Super Mutant and his pals to shove it up his you know what, and instead he shoved it up yours...Lets move on.This is a CRPG in every sense of the word, so if you get the feel that there is a feeling that you could be playing this on a table with some friends and a cashe of multicolored dice, you probably could. In fact- There is a Pen and Paper version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system (the rules system the game is powered by.) on the internet and you can find it at No Mutants Allowed (the most well known Fallout fan site, find them here http://www.nma-fallout.com/ .) There is so much that I can say about this game, but I won't, because I believe that you owe it to yourself to see it with your own eyes.Fallout 2 is considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time for a reason: It lives up to the previous statement. It really is one of the greatest RPGs of all time. The writing is top notch, the sheer amount of choice and freedom. The methodical and satisfying development of your main character from an upstart, inexperienced tribal into a wasteland killing machine who is feared throughout the region, or a hero reveared by the struggling wasteland people. The choice is yours and your actions and decisions will determine the man/woman you become in this harsh and unforgiving post apocalyptic wasteland. You will need all the help you can get, and companions are there to meet and join your quest to restore your village and save its inhabitants from starvation, disease, and destruction.This game is so detailed for its time, that even today I am finding things I have never seen in the game before; and I have been playing it since 1999, a year after it was released! If that doesn't give you an idea of the replayability factor I don't know what will. If you purchase this game, you will come back to it year after year. And if you are a fan of pen and paper RPGS, CRPGS, or old school RPGs, then Fallout 2 is a godsend. Bigger and crazier than its predecessor Fallout (Which itself is an AMAZING game.) Fallout 2 takes you to the future that everyone hopes will never happen and lets you either wallow in it, or conquor it. I HIGHLY recommend this game for any RPG fan. It will ensnare you, it will inspire you!!			"

												Fallout 2, the successor to Fallout, a game that follows the apocalyptic aftermath of an alternate history where America, Asia and Europe have been subject to a nuclear resource war. In Fallout 2, the world is much larger and appropriately filled with interesting cities, towns, villages, and abandoned and occupied vaults. The story takes place after the actions of the Vault Dweller from Fallout, and many familiar faces will appear. There is, however, a new threat to the denizens of the wasteland. A powerful faction with advanced pre-war technology, who see the people of the irradiated wastes as monsters -- indistinguishable from ghouls and super mutants. Many new lively characters, stories, choices and weapons await in this great game.9/10			"

												It's a good game, here is why.Pros:Reputations/karma/fame: e.g. you can become a slaver, which affects you in game, by making you despised by some of your possible companions.Cost: First of all, it's cheap, and for this reason alone I'd buy it. Bonus if you get it on sale.Gore: lots of it if you choose the bloody mess.Perks: lots of perks, depending on your actions and skills.Exploration: I felt as if exploring was fun and worth it.Funny: the humour is dark, which I prefer.Shortcuts: a lot of shortcuts, super useful.Cons:Story: the story is very fractured, and mostly involves you running around from A to B to C to D to kill 80 raiders then to finally get the GECK.Movement: the movement and combat are both very difficult to learn.Overall, I think it is fun and well made for its time, though frustrating at times.

												Set roughly 80 years after Fallout 1, the world once again needs the aid of an individual to overcome a great evil. Originally you're sent out from your tribe, founded by the original Vault Dweller from F1, to retrieve a GECK that will help them survive as their village is dying. Needless to say, a lot more than that is going on which you will uncover soon enough.The world of Fallout 2 feels similliar to Fallout 1's (from here F1). The very south of F2's map is actually connected to F1's top, making it possible for the player to revisit a few of the old locations, such as Vault 13 and 15, as well as the NCR, which used to be Shady Sands. Other than that's there's a lot of new places to discover, including personal favorite of mine such as New Reno and a locationIreallycan'tnamewithoutspoilingthegame. As for the combat and levelling mechanics, these are the same as in F1, meaning you start the game by picking your SPECIAL and tag skills and as you defeat enemies in turn based combat and levelling up, you get to spend more skill points on various skills. The use of AP for moves in combat is a really neat system.As for F2 as a sequel, it's pretty great. The mechanics from F1 are re-used but other than that, it's a direct continuation on the lore with new events, a (mostly) new setting, all new story line and great characters.The massive downside of Fallout 2, however, is the start. The game starts in an insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial, and the first few hours are annoying as♥♥♥♥♥♥ The SPECIAL you pick at the start wil also really influence the game a *ton*. I, for example, went with 4 strenght, leaving me unable to use 90% of the weapons untill much later on, which was a major♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Amongst that the enemies suddenly go from easy to kill to pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and if you're not prepared for that you're having a hard time. A good companion team is basically a must at that point.Before I wrap this up, I must say Fallout 2 has some absolutely hilarious moments to make up for some of the rage it might cause, such as the Café of Broken Dreams, the Bridge Guardian, conversations with certain NPCs and...SERGEANT DORNAN.Overall, 8.5/10.

												I was born two months premature. When I was one, I was dropped on the porch. When I was two, I had pneumonia. When I was three, I got the chicken pox. When I was four, I fell down the stairs and broke six ribs. When I was five, my uncle was decapitated by a watermelon. When I was six, my parents hit me in the head with a shovel. When I was seven, I lost my right index finger to my pet rat. When I was eight, my dog Spike got hit by a tractor. When I was nine, my mother lost her arm to a rabid brahmin. When I was ten, my sister was torn to bits by a pack of dogs. When I was eleven, my grandfather killed himself because I was ugly. When I was twelve, my grandmother killed herself because I was ugly. When I was thirteen, my father poked out his eyes with a pitchfork in a drunken stupor. When I was fourteen, my brother lost his hand to a wallaby. When I was fifteen, my aunt choked to death on a chicken bone. When I was sixteen, I lost my cousin to a badger. When I was seventeen, I cut off my left big toe with a hoe. When I was eighteen, my father lost his right leg to the same tractor that killed my dog.			"

												Set roughly 80 years after Fallout 1, the world once again needs the aid of an individual to overcome a great evil. Originally you're sent out from your tribe, founded by the original Vault Dweller from F1, to retrieve a GECK that will help them survive as their village is dying. Needless to say, a lot more than that is going on which you will uncover soon enough.The world of Fallout 2 feels similliar to Fallout 1's (from here F1).

												It's a good game, here is why.Pros:Reputations/karma/fame: e.g. you can become a slaver, which affects you in game, by making you despised by some of your possible companions.Cost: First of all, it's cheap, and for this reason alone I'd buy it. Bonus if you get it on sale.Gore: lots of it if you choose the bloody mess.Perks: lots of perks, depending on your actions and skills.Exploration: I felt as if exploring was fun and worth it.Funny: the humour is dark, which I prefer.Shortcuts: a lot of shortcuts, super useful.Cons:Story: the story is very fractured, and mostly involves you running around from A to B to C to D to kill 80 raiders then to finally get the GECK.Movement: the movement and combat are both very difficult to learn.Overall, I think it is fun and well made for its time, though frustrating at times.

												Fallout 2 - Fallout 2 is a direct sequel to Fallout 1; with only a year in between releases, not much has changed. The interface is fixed now, so it’s more in line with modern standards, but the combat is still freaking slow, so if you happen to choose non-combat skillsets, you are screwed. The graphic is improved which is pretty impressive given how little development time Interplay has between Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. As a result, innovation wasn’t present in this game at all. Players from Fallout 1 will notice a crap ton of game-breaking glitches being fixed in Fallout 2, you won’t get boxed in by friendly NPCs anymore because you can just push them away. The world is big(ger), and the plot is interesting as usual. Fair warning though, the game introduction is epically slow. Play Fallout 1 first, depending on how much you love that should help you determine if Fallout 2 is worth your time.			"

												I can't believe I haven't got round to writing a review for this game already!Fallout is a role playing game with an excellent story run throughout the series. This game is one of the best games I have ever played and it is a game that you can simply play through time and time again not only due to a wide range of choices but a story that you will want to hear again and again, admittedly the controls up until fallout 3 have been a bit primative and lack luster but they work if you're willing to give them a prod and experiment. Fallout 2 is an excellent addition to this series but the game either is for you or is not and with the excessive amount of bugs, primative style of controls and lacking graphics compared to todays top RPG's such as The elder scrolls I would only really reccomend this game is you really enjoyed fallout 3 and New vegas and would like to explore the story of fallout further; if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the fallout series this game is 100% for you, you will not be disappointed because the original games are just as good if not better than the recent ones except more primative.

I liked both games just the same, for different reasons, and I wasn't gonna forget about this game! But this game just didn't understand.We fought, we argued, and neither of us could remember what it was like to be in love with each other any more.And that's such a sad feeling- it's bad enough to fall out of love, but I'd say it's even worse to forget what love felt like in the first place. We said we'd still speak after the break up, but we lost contact.I guess I'd still recommend the game, but I have to warn you, if your relationship with the game hits a roadblock...You might fall out.

												Black Isle at their finest.  Game is older than many gamers.  Reviewed ad nauseum, I will take this opportunity to impart an anecdote.I am currently playing thru this game.  I was getting annoyed at the engine.  Even 17 years ago, the hidden behind walls thing was mad annoying.  I have 1 full playthru, and many partials over that time, the last substantial one I stopped at New Reno.  That was 10 years ago.  I was in a town where there is an important NPC (skeeter) in a building that you can't see inside unless you run behind it.  The doors are on the hidden backside.  I knew as I played before, but was a little frustrated.  I was muttering about how Pillars better have screen rotation.  Then I randomly talked to an npc behind this building a bit.  This one was in view.  I asked about the other guy who is hidden a few steps away, and the NPC says ""he's standing right there.  Use your eyes.""  Those guys at Black Isle knew full well how frustrating not being able to see an npc standing 10 feet away right in front of you due to an immobile painted background, and put those lines in there.  I bet whoever wrote that bit snickered like I did.  I never read those lines before, in probably 100 hours of varied gameplay.  The nuance and subtlety is what is so great about this game.  The way characters are written, the storylines, and unsanitary reality of what harsh life does to mankind.  The good do indeed die young as even the good ones have some bad in this world.			"

												Fallout 2 ReviewIs it still great all these years down the line?Pros:Solid gameplayWider variety of weapons over Fallout 1More locations than Fallout 1LOTS more companionsMore intresting charactersTalking HeadsActive modding community (mods still being made at the time of writing)You can have a robo-dogYou can team-up with a... Well, you'll know once you get to it. Wouldn't want to spoil a nice suprise :)Loads of contentConsThere's a bit of stuff I consider uneccessary. New Reno as a whole is... Well really designed for fan service. There's a brothel and a porn studio here. When you have entire PERKS centered around sex, you know something is wrong.Progression in the beginning is slowGeckos. Screw these things. Especially at the start.Missing content that's easily replaced with Fallout 2 Restoration mods.Getting a gun that isn't a pea shooter takes FOREVER. Prices are INSANELY high after Fallout 1. I mean, REALLY high. At the start, it cost me my entire supply of money, a gun I previously had (which was an EVEN WORSE pea shooter) and whatever I could scrounge up from the houses near by to get a 10MM pistol. Still a pea shooter, but it dealt more damage.Random encounters are FAR too frequent. It's frustrating when the second you leave the city you're attacked by tweleve dogs, and it takes a few minutes for them to end their turn. And you can't run because they've trapped you.Relies too heavily on pop-culture refrences that are now outdated. Funny at the time, but in 2015, some don't make sense or some are just plain stupid.On the whole, Fallout 2 is a game everyone who can think should own. This isn't a game for people that played 3 and New Vegas and enjoyed the shooter aspects: This is a bare knuckle, hard core RPG, and you WILL die. Many many times.			"

												This is one of my favorites.  This is like Fallout 3 but Top-Down and always in VATS with combat. I have played this more than 10 times and this has lots of replay value. You could change the way you play with a Melee build, Unarmed build, rife/pistol build, Big guns build. This game even includes boxing and one of my favorite towns, San Fransisco. At first this game was hard to get into but once I did, I got all the Intreplay Fallout games. I recommend you to give it a chance and try to get into it as well.			"

												To be frank, I really enjoyed the game. I started playing it way after it was released, so this isn't a nostalgia trip for me or anything, this was from pure interest in the genre and what I've heard about it. I was not disappointed.This game is packed with content. There's lots of quests, characters, weapons, locations, and items. There's almost always 2 or 3 ways to resolve a conflict and the straightest path isn't always the best one. Most of your choices do have some sort of consequence. The combat can be pretty challenging, but can also be like super easy if you have the right build, it's not particularly well balanced. The visuals, well, they kind of hit the spot for what the game is portraying. Dark, dull, forboding, if not boring landscapes. I mean, you're in the middle of the desert, it's not that interesting. The humor is pretty cool, and I must have laughed a few times at either something happening or when a character said something funny. The story is pretty interesting overall, having you start as one of the previous PC's (from Fallout) decendants in a tribal community to helping out (or hurting) towns or refugees to disabling (or enabling) nukes.I think that anyone who can deal with turn-based rpgs should play this. It's pretty awesome. Even if you haven't played turn-based rpgs or maybe have had bad experiences with them, you should like this. But stay away if you can only handle fps style gameplay, this isn't for you.The steam version does work with all of the mods out there btw, I've not run into any issues regarding that stuff.10/10Would die in the first battle again.

												Simply put Fallout 2 is a masterpiece. It improves upon Fallout 1 in virtually every way and it allows for such creative roleplaying and variety that I am still impressed that few games have surpassed this. You might want to be a slaver one playthrough and a pornstar the next who is also a champion boxer. What more do you want? Well if you want good companions you're in luck because Fallout 2 has the best companions in the whole series and they're not even comparable to the cardboard cutouts in Fallout 1.Superficially this looks just like Fallout 1 but more (the same opinion people had for New Vegas compared to 3) but the more you play it the more you realise it stands out as a wonderful game in its own right, not just as a sequel to another amazing CRPG.I'll admit that out of the 3 amazing Fallouts (1, 2 and New Vegas) this has my least favourite main quest and the final showdown is only a fraction as good as the confrontation with the Master. But despite all that Fallout 2 is an amazing game with few faults.			"

												Playing this title for the first time many years ago was sort of life-changing for me. This was the first game in the Fallout series that I played, and when I went back and tried Fallout 1, I found that I prefer all the improvements it made over the first. Some things were a little unfinished, but there's a Fallout 2 Restoration Project online that adds a lot of the unfinished parts in, so that's not a big deal. A must-play if you're a fan of classic roleplaying or adventure games. I'm a fan for life.			"

Anyways, it's good to see that they learned from their mistakes the first time, some modern devs can learn from this.			"

												(Note: Bought this game elsewhere, but wanted a digital version)The sequal to the fantastic Fallout game, you know you are in good hands. This game is set years after the first where you play as a decendent of the Vault Dweller who has been tasked to go out and find the vault for it may contain a G.E.C.K (Garden of Eden Creation Kit) which could save your people as many are sick and dying as are there Brahman. You start by proving your worth by entering the temple of the vault dweller and retriving the vault 13 suit left by your ancestor before heading out for the elusive Vault 13.This game is far better than the previous by doing away with the timer that was in the first one, however the start does involve you running into giant ants and lesser radscorpions in the temple and being armed with only a spear so if you focus on gunpower, there's a good chance you might die or be unable to get through the temple. This game also has the introduction to power gloves if you wish to make a mellee focused character where no previous such weapon exsisted in the first and you were stuck otherwise. There is more adult subject matter as you get to sleep with numerous women (or men depending on sex or your choice) with only a brief description which is somehow more graphic than the Bethesda attempt (dissapointing since the game is a 18, you'd think you'd be treated as a adult) but that's a different discussion for something else.For those who have played Fallout 3, this game is where the Enclave first appeared and in this you run into references to the previous game (appearance of Harold, a discovery of a horde of water chips and a Super mutant who is worried about getting a woman pregnant) as well as an evolution in the society where no longer do people collect bottle caps, but crudly made discs called Dollars.  Ghouls and Super Mutants are no longer a big enemy as they have been trying to intergrate with society (except for Vault City which is Xenophobic) and even gain a Super Mutant as a companion as well as many other interesting and even hidden companions.Well worth if you enjoyed the first game and a lot of fun if you like RPGs in general. You don't need to have played the first one as you can always ask questions about why the world is the way it is and the story has a totally different enemy than the last one. You also have multiple possible endings when you complete the game like the previous one and get to see how Shady Sands has evolved into the infamous NCR.			"

												This is one of my favourite games ever it has great characters and a huge open world to explore. The story in my opinion is the best fallout story yet better than fallout 4 thats for sure. If you play this game after fallout one the story will come to you better, I personally have logged more hours into this game over fallout one. On pc fallout 3, New vegas, and one are great, but I would highly recommend getting this. Still I woudln't buy this at full price wait for a sale and get the original bundle with fallout 1, 2, and brother hood tactics.			"

												Playing this title for the first time many years ago was sort of life-changing for me. This was the first game in the Fallout series that I played, and when I went back and tried Fallout 1, I found that I prefer all the improvements it made over the first. Some things were a little unfinished, but there's a Fallout 2 Restoration Project online that adds a lot of the unfinished parts in, so that's not a big deal. A must-play if you're a fan of classic roleplaying or adventure games. I'm a fan for life.			"

												At this time writing this review I have only played about 85 minutes of the game but it took just that short of time to see how good of a game it is. At first I was skeptical because of the age of the game, but honestly that shouldn't be the deterance for this game. It's your top down, somewhat turned based, game but it's more than that. The game unlocks so much creativity to solving things outside of combat! Using your brain has never been more fun! Literally...Play this if:1. You are a big Fallout fan2. Enjoy ""puzzles"" (couldn't think of another word)3. Don't mind turned based combat (real time movement isn't turned based, only when initiating combat)			"

												This is the Fallout franchise at its peak.  Taking the open world of a post-apocalyptic wasteland of the original and making it 10+ times bigger but keeping the charm of almost every location that you visit.  Every location is detailed and contains a bevy of unique and interesting characters.  This was in the era of audio dialogue and coupled with the computer generated faces of a range of notable characters from the story made this game very engulfing (except Myron, ♥♥♥♥ THAT GUY).  Add to that a list of amazing voice actors that fit their roles like a glove.  Before we got the idiotic Karma system of Fallout 3 (who is thinking of 'karma' in a dog-eat-dog wasteland?), we had the awesome system of reputation for each location (this was the influence for the faction rep in New Vegas) and it worked wonderfully.  I only wish that we could have experienced the original vision of Fallout 3 (Van Buren) instead of the Bethesda, barely-working abortion of Fallout 3.			"

												Bizarre is a word that comes to mind when playing Fallout 2. Its a world both serious and very silly at the same time. The main quest is serious but the whole game is full of pop culture references and silly scenes, sex and drugs run rampant and it feel like almost everyone is a sneeze away from wanting to kill you.  I know this game is treated like a religion so people are going to hate me but I'm being honest despite the fact how someone can downvote this game while ignoring all peer pressure and being honest lol. I Installed a restoration patch which added many things although I was there mainly for bug fixes. My strange story included giving children an orphanage to get them off the streets, sleeping with a mob leaders wife while dealing with mobster wars in an even more lawless city, getting someones spleen back which he lost in a bet, moving a plant to another garden so he could teach me how to beat a Radscorpion at chess and many many more but mostly just shooting annoying obnoxious people in the face. The combat is pretty much the same as Fallout 1 and for me that is no bad thing with a few new weapons added andthe gory deaths are still here. I encountered many things in the world map such as knights looking for a holy hand grenade then right after meeting them again getting killed by a small rat despite their power armor, Darth Vadar and friends standing around chatting while Han Solo told me something there no match for a good blaster so gave me a blaster, a crashed ship with dead red shirts, a dead whale in the middle of the desert and a man guarding a bridge asking familiar questions, the Cafe of Broken Dreams and many more which you will probably recognise. Amongst the things I didn't like is Fallout 2 has many quests but alot of them are not obvious and this game needs a guide/walkthough more than most as many are at least semi hidden and even when you get them there is no reminder in your log where you had to go/do what. Such things will effect new players more and it can be and get very confusing especially amongst its bloated game world. The same with items, there is no description how things work and what they do such as drugs and medical items and which items are just vendor trash. Once again this effects new players more because once you know you remember but there is no harm with an ingame description but I do understand games were different when this was made. With NPC's too Its so easy to say '' the wrong thing '' which more so than Fallout 1 can suddenly turn even whole towns hostile and likely result in a last save game reload. Skill checks are still here but like Fallout 1 they are '' invisible '' so you may not know when you are using them. This game is also difficult , more so than Fallout 1 and companions are almost as annoying. Comparing to the later fallout games is hard because like the Fallout 1 they are so different especially the obvious Isometric vs First Person game worlds. Having said that Fallout 2 does feel very different to Fallout 1 in many ways too. I noticed when watching Bethesda's '' making of Fallout 3 video '' they would reference Fallout 1 but not Fallout 2 so I guess they had that more in mind. Overall I can see why people like this game and while I like easter eggs and the occasional joke this game takes things beyond silly so much which felt too distracting. Also I cannot be like one of those people who are like '' wow you can bea porn star 10/10 game'' . I spent along time experiencing what this game offers which I don't regret but honestly I prefer Fallout 1 as The story , atmosphere and locations feel more consistent and the lol sillyness is not everywhere you go. I did prefer certain things in Fallout 2 such as better inventory management, the car for faster transport (which is needed in this bigger map) and you can store items in and unlike Fallout 4 the characters are not making excuses to explain indepth or technical things for you. Not a terrible game if you can get over the archaic game design. Still try it for yourself you may like it like many others seem to and you can get it quite cheap these days in sales.			"

												Fallout 2 is one of the best PC RPGs of all time.  I do think Fallout: New Vegas is the best Fallout game, but out of the original 3 (Fallout 1, Fallout 2, and Tactics) this is the best.  I do recomend that you play Fallout 1 first though, gives you a better insight into the world.  Unlike the first one, that had a time limit, this one lets you♥♥♥♥♥♥around from the start.  You can do lots of cool things, like be a porn star, drive a car, and blow up the U.S government. I will worn you though, this is an old game.  The graphics haven't aged too well.  Also, the technology couldn't display hightech things, so you'll see a lot of repeat charicter models. Also, the game has a bird's eye view, so if that is not something you like, then get over it because this is one of the best RPGs ever. Buy it now!			"

												     I honestly thought this game was much harder than Fallout. It is Harder to get weapons, and travle around the world without an Outdoorsman skill. I also do not approve of the Vault Dweller creating a VERY primitive tribe that does not even have a pistol, only spears. Other than that the game is good if you like a challenge, I just did not have the patience because I was planning to play all games in order, and the anticipation to finally get ot 3 combined witht he frustration made me quit the game. After I cool down though I will certainly play this again because it is very satisfying completing quests.			"

												The sequel to the original Fallout (which is fantastic, by the way) this is quite possibly the best installment of the Fallout franchise. It still has the strategic isometric turn-based combat, and not much has changed from the original in terms of the controls department. It's still gloriously simple, but be warned that if you're not particularly high in Strength with either a decent unarmed or melee skill, you're gonna have a bad time in the beginning. An extremely rich storyline, hours upon hours of complex gameplay, and a talking Deathclaw in your party.			"

												This game acts a very good blend of First person shooter and stealth into the game as you are thrown into an enviroment that is very breath taking. It has everything a gamer could ever dream of including dinosaurs, tanks, zombies, and wizards. The textures are in 1080p and is the most amazing thing i have ever seen and the ominous atmosphere just makes my heart race as i try to find the nearest telephone booth. The amount of effect put into this game by the developer is just truly in need of an applause as they have spent near decades of working the game to the brim with content and the amount of detail into everything in the game is great. The fully animated 3d polygons are a true work of art. The replayability is just unreal as i spent several decades dedication my life into making new characters and roleplaying as one of the many NPC in this game. It also introduces Enviroments that are mindblowing as you wouldnt think they would inploment it in here. I spent most of my time looking inside every cave, forest, town i explored to uncover secrets yet to be told. The mechanics of this FPS rivals those of Call of duty  and needs more recognition. and in conclusion i have no idea what i am talking about.			"

												The controls aren't initially too bad, especially when you finally master them. Unfortunately, Black Isle Studios didn't have the knack to implement an abundance of voice actors. Truth be told there are only a handful of them in the entire game. Everything else is good old fashion dialogue. Sure, you might here me and other people complain about this. But let's just say, for the shake of this review. I get over the fact the game only has a limited amount of voice actors until Fallout 3. The only major problem I've encountered thus far with Fallout 1 through 2 (including Fallout Tactics) is the despicable combat system. I mean this combat system sucks.. I'm talking atari style combat.. A friendly individual fires first, then a hostile target fires second. It essentially goes back and fourth until one or the other is dead. This is extremely unrealistic, and truthfully. I don't believe there was any excuse for this whatsoever. Take my word for it, I'm a huge fan of the Fallout series; but this is just ridiculous. In closing this message, I want to add the story is of course outstanding. I hope one day they'll consider doing a remastered version of both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. Preferably with Fallout 4's new creation engine.			"

												Admission time: I didn't get into Fallout until 3... and I don't like the older ones.It's not the visuals - I'm a huge fan of Baldur's Gate and Divine Divinity, which it resembles from a visual perspective. It's fine, if not impressive.It's not the writing. The word is definately Fallout, and it's awesome. So... here's the problem...IT'S SOOOOOOOO SLOW.It's maddening. I really, really want to get into it, and explore the world, and delve into the earlier fallout games. I want to watch the step-by-step creation of a thing I love. I did the same thing for Saint's Row, and while 1&2 are pretty rough around the edges, they're still perfectly good games. Fallout 1&2? Yeah, not so much. I'm not spoiled, I'm not too ""modern"" a gamer. I love turn based strategy games. I only want the visuals to be appropriate and not hideous, and these are well within that criteria. But the interface is awkward, even taking into account the age of the game. The action is so slow that it's hard to call action...And all of that keeps me from enjoying the rest of the game - which, I'm told, is awesome. It could be the best game ever, but I can't bear playing it through the initial quest, so I'll never know. If you've got the patience of Job, I imagine you'll love it. If I hadn't played the Baldur's Gate games - which use the same engine, but move at a steady clip - I might love it, too... but holy crap, I just can't bear the awkward coupled with the slow.			"

												Plainly put: This game is bad.I have a number of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ anecdotes that came from the tiny six hour window I played this game in, and numberous small complaints. Being able to sell quest items so you trudge all over the ♥♥♥♥ing wastes looking for♥♥♥♥♥♥only to find out you'd sold it an hour later. No ♥♥♥♥ing idea what you're doing in the temple so you have to ♥♥♥♥ around with walkthroughs just to learn the basic mechanics. Random encounters when you're level 2 where you get torn to pieces by mole rats. Wanting to try to do something with the skills you can barely use, but not knowing if you can't do it or if the game is giving you a ""trolled ya! ;)"" moment. Fallout 2 is old and it really, REALLY shows. This game is a slog. The combat most especially- most of my fights involved both me and the enemy missing at least ten times in a row on a regular basis, and it wore my patience so thin that I would prefer running away to fighting enemies because that♥♥♥♥♥♥is grueling. The story, through the shreds I got, wasn't interesting enough or presented well enough for me to really give this more than the six hour shot I did. When I booted up Fallout 2 in an attempt to desperately get some enjoyment out of the game, it was a ♥♥♥♥ing chore to play and I kept thinking of all the other♥♥♥♥♥♥I could be doing. Graphics are... Alright, I guess? They're old. The lack of sound / songs in the game was driving me insane, though, and I ended up just putting on a playlist of old Bob Crosby / Jo Stafford / Pied Piper songs in order to force myself through it. I know they probably couldn't license any songs because at that point it was a tiny little studio, but it was a surprisingly huge letdown coming off the back of the FPS Fallouts and I get the feeling you'd only enjoy this soundless, lifeless wasteland if you were there when it came out.Just go play New Vegas. Or Fallout 3. Or, ♥♥♥♥, even 4 was a lot better. Comparing them is like comparing apples to steak, because they're totally different in terms of gameplay and presentation, but holy ♥♥♥♥ this game has aged like spoiled milk. Don't buy it, and with the money you were going to use to buy it, go buy Vegas. Same area(ish), good game. Just watch a gameplay video or read the Fallout Wiki if you need to know the story of 1 and 2, because if you're going back to 2 from the modern fallouts it's going to hurt.			"

												I've heard that Fallout 2 is an amazing RPG and as much as I would like to believe that it just feels like a snoozefest. The beggining of the game is extremely slow and the movement is excruciating, i've finished the first fallout and despite it also being slow-paced it was manageable. As much as I like games to challenge the user and not hold the consumer's hand, I feel fallout 2 (and this is another complaint I had with Fallout 1) just expects you to know where to go for quests and as much as I like adventure and exploring it simply isn't fast paced or accessible enough for that function.  I'm also not very keen on games that use RNG as it doesn't actually require much skill but instead luck and preparation. I might come back to Fallout 2 but atm I just feel that there are plenty of other games to play that will keep me engaged and I never play games just for the sake of it, I have to enjoy them.			"

Haven't played Fallout and Fallout 2 until now? Better keep it that way.EDIT: I encourage everyone, who fiercely downvotes my review, to try and argue against any of the points I make.I won't be denying the importance and fun factor these games had once upon a time, but unless you're already wearing thick nostalgia-goggles, these titles sadly are not worth playing today. The one redeeming factor of these games is the lore contained within their plethora of content. Indeed, you can easily spend hundreds of hours in their captivating world and still have occasionally some fun. However, far too many aspects of the early Fallout entries are either extremely sloppy, ill-conceived or altogether broken. Below are the main reasons why I got so turned off: Frequent crashes - both games (especially Fallout 1) like to crash a lot. I'd understand if it was caused by the games' age and poor compatibility with modern Windows, but as I found out, the same error messages were just as common back then, as they are now.  Frequent glitches - perhaps I'm like a magnet attracting various anomalies, but I can't be impressed by standing dead bodies and NPCs walking through closed doors and walls. Disappearing coursor is quite possibly one of the most annoying bugs I've encountered so far.  Either absolutely tedious or extremely irritating combat - Despite the slow pace, I usually like turn based combat in games, because it puts emphasis on strategy, rather than reflexes. Fallout 1 and 2, sadly, highlight the sluggishness while happily ditching all the strategy. You control only your own character at all times. Your occasional companions are just extremely r*tarded AIs, that are about as likely to shoot your enemies, as they're to shoot you in the back by mistake. The single worst thing about the combat for me is the very system of calculations upon which it is built. Never in my life, have I seen in-game battles as random as those in Fallout. I've experienced the same type of damage, going from the same source, hover between ""no damage inflicted"" (thanks to my damage resistance) all the way to more than 300 points of damage - a nearly quadruple of my total HP count at that point. To amplify the randomness even more, combatants can have ""critical failures"", which is just an awful idea from the get-go, because it makes them look like totally incompetent buffoons. The worst UI I have ever dealt with - Every minute of me dealing with the ""inventory"" makes me feel ten years older. How this UI system got ever approved baffles me. The worst kind of today console port feels like a breeze to deal with next to Fallout's inventory. The game is capable of giving you a finger after tens of hours playing it - At least that's how I felt once I discovered, that the skills I picked during the character creation were totally worthless. I thought I'd try to play as a character that would be throwing stuff in combat (just to make things a tad more interesting) and using melee, which worked out okay up to certain point. Then I realised I've been using the same effing spear since the very beginning and that my character slowly, but surely, becomes completely unusable in combat against all the assault-rifles, combat shotguns etc. I was unable to find any better melee weapon until a lot later, making my melee irrelevant for the whole mid-game.

												I got this game because of the the reviews and honestly I think alot of those reviews were based off of nostalga. The rpg elements are certiantly there no doubting that but the actual gameplay(which I believe is just has important as story) just isnt entertaining. I had two phases of comabt first phase was filled with ""you missed"" and  ""gecko hit you for 24 points killing you"" and the second phase was just shooting things in the eyes over and over again because it seems like the only effective things to do. Im sure I'll get torn apart for saying this but I prefer the newer fallout games( froim my understanding 2 is alot like the original) because they are simply more fun to play and new vegas still has the decent rpg elements that alot of people say are lacking in 3 and 4,tl;dr Just get fallout new vegas, this game is boring			"

This game bring basically nothing new to the table from the first one, the story is trying to hard to top the first one and fails and to top it all off the game is incredibly broken and buggy just from downloading it.You actaully need a third party patch to fix it's astonishing 500 known bugs, the majority of which can break the game.4/10			"

												I didn't enjoy it was much as one. With both games you don't get any hints really where to go, besides what the NPC tells you, so quests would've been hard to solve. With one I just had it windowed and had a walkthrough running in the background. With two, if I were to do that, every battle everytime the game was computing the CPU's turn, my game would freeze and then it'd come back once the turn was over. Sometimes I'd just jump straight to the ""you're dead lol"" screen. That, and the really obnoxiously OP aliens really didn't make the game enjoyable. I also had to restart 3 times trying to perfect my character before I found out high agility meant more turn points. Without the turn points the game was really hard and unenjoyable. Especially the trial of ♥♥♥♥butt in the beginining. The highway man was really cool, and there were some benefits I enjoyed, but I could not make myself beat the game, and I'm literally in the last mission. I just don't want to play it anymore.			"

												So after playing this game for 50 hours, I find myself in a position whereby I'm unable to complete the game. I've spent hours reading various walkthroughs and forums to try and figure out why this is and it seems that the main quest, obviously the most important in the game, is a convoluted, buggy mess whereby actions you take will have completely unforseen consequences that will essentially make the game unwinnable.This is a game that people praise for it's open-ended structure and freedom and yet even in the main quest it will punish you from deviating even slightly from the prescribed path.This by itself would be enough for me to not recommend this game but it also has a number of other problems. The AI is terrible and your followers will shoot you if you're stood between them and a target as well as regularly blocking doorways. The user interface is absolutely terrible. Simple things like inventory management and issuing orders to your followers are a complete chore. The mission tracker is literally a single, short line of text. If you forget exactly what you have to do next, you're screwed.This game has not stood the test of time.			"

												I played this game when it first came out.  I thought it was awsome, and in its time, it was.However, times change.  After playing it a bit, I have found that I do not have patience for old-school game mechanics.For example: You get a quest to Find X.  X can be a person, or an object.  And that is all you get.  Please find X and get something from him.  You would think getting the object from Mr. X would be the problem and perhaps you are right.  However, you must spend HOURS clicking on everyone in town to find Mr. X, IF HE IS EVEN IN THAT SAME town.  If it is an object, lets hope you notice it amonge the muddled brown textures sitting on the ground somewhere.Do you want to recall what NPC said about something, perhaps there is a hint in something he or she said?  You will not find any such notes in your trusty pip boy.  Perhaps you can find the NPC and talk to them again.  Maybe they will go through thier dialog again, or perhaps they will just ask you if you got the job done yet and you will be SOL.Anyway, I discovered I do not have the patience for such things anymore.  If you do, then this game is a great classic.  Just be sure you are in the mood to play a very long, old school game or are ok with constantly googling the quest solutions. "

												The game is mainly a hex-based, turn-based combat system with ""Action points"" determining what you can and can't do.  The ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" leveling system is there and will also determine what you can and can't do in game. ( Playing with Intelligence less than 4 you can't even speak properly and NPC's will even ignore you or not give you quests )  Just like most RPG's of the era the beginning game is a hard survival but as it gets to approx mid-game money becomes so plentiful and your skills advance so quickly that most challenges are cleared easily.  This game features a car for you to drive around the wasteland quicker than normal and can be upgraded slightly for better fuel consumption, etc. It does, however run on the same ammunition as energy pistols / rifles.  It can also be used as a storage container but beware a bug where too many things are inside it, you'll get locked out of the menu. It also seats all your followers which is a nice added feature. Speaking of followers, they're still the same stupid things that block every-bloody-entranceway when you walk into a room. However they've put a helpful ""Shove"" Icon in which pushes the follower one hex away, they've also added extra combat controls ( Although default is usually best for pretty much all situations ) that come in Beserker, aggressive, defensive and custom. The ability to choose which armour they wear, although there is no visable change and the ability to get them to use a selection of weapons ( Although they can only use certain weapons, not any weapon as Followers are only ""loaded"" with certain animations )However I cannot recommend this game solely on the basis that it is so buggy and frustraiting. Walk into the wrong part of town at the wrong time of day and all the guards shoot at you. Enemies ignore you if you wear a certain armour type but if you have a follower in the same armour only 1 type of enemy will shoot you, yet if you walk into a town with your parties weapons drawn everyone will shoot you.It's highly inconsistant and irritaiting, saving everytime you do something successfully becomes regular. The game only received one patch in it's life and like many others have said, you have to mod the game for it to become bareable. So likening this over Fallout 4 but then telling people you need mods to enjoy Fallout 1 or 2 is hypocritical.It's a shame because I got it as part of the Fallout Anthology and I haven't enjoyed either game and I cannot really see why it has such a cult following. Even other RPG's of the time period this was launched fare better and I think being the one of the only post-apocolyptic and non-fantasy based RPG got it where it is.			"

												Super Slow game, I only wanted to try this game because it has a similier look to a way better game. This games like a garbage verison of ""arcanum of steamworks and magick obscura"" expect Arcanum is 100X Better.  and come on wasteland post apocalyptic searching for Geck Has always been so droll. Fallout games are boring. Bethesda has better genra games to play. Id Strongly recommand Arcanum for any Actual fans of this game. Trash game dont buy it.			"

												I can see this used to be a good game and I can look past graphics and sound pretty well to play something fun, however there was little to no effort spent on getting this running right for newer computers, the base controls were not improved at all despite that being easy to do.Whats more the programming to let it run on steam is so bad that running it once royally screwed with my moniter's display settings and I still don't know if I fixed it completely, the game insists on reinstalling part of itself every time I turn it off and it more than once just stopped doing anything for a little bit as if it needed to catch up.

												This highly-regarded classic game has the worst introduction/tutorial imaginable. A journey through a temple teaches the player some of the basic mechanics of the game by boring them to death. I've purchased some classic games this month: Heroes of Might and Magic 3, System Shock 2, and Fallout 2. Heroes is every bit as awesome today as it was 20 years ago. SS2 is nowhere near as scary as I remember and  now it feels like its just a series of switch flipping missions to advance to the next area; level design has IMPROVED. This game, Fallout 2, is the worst of the three, by far. It is no longer fun to have only a 19% chance to hit an ant thats directly in front of you; was it fun 20 years ago? Must have been since thousands of people got past the tutorial...Not me.			"

												This game has not aged well. If you are commited or have played this game or games like it in the past, you will have fun. If you are a young and naive Fallout fan who played 3 and New Vegas and are looking for a new adventure, this game is not for you. It plays nothing like 3 and New Vegas. It's a top down RPG and it plays like one. It's difficult, there's a lot of reading, and most of the game mechanics feel like they died during the clinton administration. My point is the game is old. There's no getting around it. If I or You don't like this game, it doesn't mean that I/you are not a fallout fan. It's an old game, it doesn't mean it has to be good/bad. In conclusion, the game hasn't aged well. It's old and plays like an old game. You also may have trouble running it on your computer.			"

												    The main problem(s) with this game are crashing, frame rate drop, and countless bugs/glitches. I also played the steam version of fallout one, and that was pretty much just as bad. The thing is I have also played the disc versions and I can tell you they are not this bad (even when both game's came out in 1997/1998), this is clearly steam's fault I can guarantee that. If I was able to play the two copies (which are now in the possession of a relative), you wouldn't get the same frame drop from the tactical map, CONSTANT CRASHING, or glitched/bugged missions, cutscenes, battles, items, dialogue, that you would get in the steam versions. Do yourself a favour and stay away from the steam version of these games until steam decides to properly fix their lazy port. "

												  Although I'm a Fallout fan, I have to give this a thumbs down for being buggy and very dated.  Personally, I was never a fan of action points, turn based combat, or isometric graphics & I'm not into nostalgia enough to really enjoy this.  On a positive note, it does have an excellent story line, and the character and skill system are very detailed. If you're into old school isometric, turn based games, and are willing to take a risk on the steam version, then you might well enjoy this. Lots of people do like it.			"

												A always the pre warning that this is a review based on how I found the game.. if it does not agree with you that this is the best game on planet earth feel free to leave a hateful comment about how ♥♥♥♥ing gay my autistic♥♥♥♥♥is and of course be sure to leave lots of stuff about my mom in there... I look forward to reading them all! Now onto the actual Review!I've played through Fallout 1 extensively and absolutely loved it, out of all my ""old"" games Fallout is my goto game but however I started with 3 believe it or not.. the only retro games I had is what my dad deemed appropriate for a 5 year old and of course I'd never heard of Fallout so I started on 3 then wen't to 1 then New Vegas then Brotherhood of Steel though I could never get 2 to work on my PC.Steam re-released Fallout 2 and jesus christ is it a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ the tutorial consists of a temple trial where you'll face enemies much much tougher than yourself and each 3 room level wil ltake you 3 days of playing miss, miss, miss, miss and so on... From what I could gather with this is that if you make any other character than the game wants/FORCES you to play then it'll either take you weeks to get passed the tutorial or you'll die.. to this day I've only ever done it once and that was of course by creating the character the game wanted which was a Grognak The Barbarian ripoff and that's just not my play style, if I wanted this I'd play street fighter not Fallout.. hell even TES Arena better suits the Barbarian fist fighter... but a game about post-nuclear survival? rubbish! So of courswe I've not experienced anythingthis game has to offer as Fallout has always been about choices for me and I really cannot play the super simple and linear game/quest that has been put before me.. I recommend you buy the original Fallout 1 then move straight to 3 and skip over this one.. waste of money!My official verdict on this is 3/10 the intro video song is badass!  "

												I had found out about fallout in 2008 when fallout 3 first came out. I instantly fell in love with everything about the game, i hadnt even heard of the fallout series before this. Keep in mind im now 30 and have long expressed interest in RPG games so how did the first two games fall under my nose? Well rhetorical or not they did, and finally...finally after hours of reading the reviews of how its the best rpg ever and so so so much better than fallout 3 I bought it.And I must say I am quite dissapointed! The fighting is just so mundane and repetitive...It took me 3 mins to kill a rat! Miss after miss after miss it was just stupid.The inventory....So untidy, just full of everything making me point and click to see even what the hell it is.One of my favorite parts of fallout 3 is organizing all my items and rumaging through every single desk, cabinet and safe. WELL NOT ANYMORE. It is just so tedious making my character check all this stuff, pointing and clicking till my fingers fall out.Keep in mind im 30 and have been playing games like starcraft, AOE, diablo etc for a long time so I love to click but this is too much for too little reward. I cant believe id say this about a fallout game but I got maybe fours into it and i think im just finished playing it. It doesnt give me that ""addiction"" mentality to warrant putting those true kinds of hours into it.I suppose I would of loved it perhaps if I played it 15 years ago when it came out...wait...thats exactly it! why am i even writing this review...?!and to be honest I dont even want fallout 4 to come out, its taken so much of my life I love playing it but...at what cost??

												As a hardcore RPG veteran, I'm telling you that this game is not like Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, an Elder Scrolls game, or any other classic you might like. If you're looking for something similar to one of those (like I was), don't buy Fallout 2.I've tried nurmerous times to like Fallout 2. But each time it just utterly frustrates me.Fallout 1 is a great game because of the dozens of ways you can build a character. In fact, it's not that hard to beat the game as a pacifist, relying on skills and such instead of fighting. It offers a true roleplaying experience and rewards creativity. It lets you roleplay the character that you want. Fallout 2 is the opposite. It is based way too heavily on combat. Even on low difficulties, the fights are really hard. In addition, there are random encounters that happen while fast-traveling, that in addition to be very annoying and repetitive, also contribute to this difficulty problem. You basically get fatally punished for not making a perfect charatcer, and for exploring. The lattter of which defeats the purpose of an open-world game. Playing a character that is focused around dealing with problems by using things like stealth, speech, or computers is impossible. Only heavily combat oriented characters can survive. But even if you optimize a character for combat, it's still ridiculously hard. I did exactly that (optimizing for combat) and still got 1-hit-killed by a gecko on easy after barely leaving the starting area, so I'm not exactly sure what kind of build is capable of beating this game.Apparently, you can only play the developer's way rather than playing how you want to play. By not letting you play the ROLE you want, it completely defeats the purpose of ROLE PLAYING. And since it isn't fun and feels more like work, it isn't really a game.So in conclusion, Fallout 2 neither role playing, nor is it a game.  "

""What is the definition of insanity? Doing the exact same thing, whilst expecting different results.""Save/Load fest that is an impossibility without a guide, filled to the brim with below-the-belt humor and obscure, awkward cultural references and puzzling non-sequiturs. Possibly one of the worst games ever made. In 23 years of gaming there are very few games to which I can come back to, after years, and still feel an outrage 15 minutes into the ""gameplay"".This game is just ridiculously bad, it's horrendous. It's a mystery how you could ♥♥♥♥ up something as good as Fallout 1 so badly. A munchkin heaven. Grind to survive - for hours. This is why people play things like WoW - no proper aim in the game, just a mindless levelling and math stats enough to get you through Calculus exam, made up of puree of elements from previous installment, sprewn across the blanket of an aged engine.Needless skill increases that you would only need to use once like lockpick to open only one rusty door which does not get damaged explosives or crowbars (or anything else). Or repair at ridiculous level of 50% to repair a generator to progress further in the quest.The quests are illogical, game elements are not standardised (one door can be broken with a crowbar, another with a fist, another one is barely held together, but can easily take on a C4 or a plasma shot). You have to find ""extravagant solutions"" but your freedom is not limited by your own imagination, it's limited by twisted imagination of neckbeard developers.Weapons and elements that are completely unrelated to Fallout universe are shoved in, like they are shoved in later in NV (the ""Service Rifle"" and shiny nuAge ""9mm"" as opposed to proper aged 50's sci-fi weapons of Fal 1 and Fal 3) completely screwing up the whole immersion.300% for skills, why not 500? ♥♥♥♥ it, why not 1000? And a perk only every 50 levels instead of every 2-3.How 'bout missing a 90% chance to hit in a row, thrice or four times while getting always hit by early-game enemies from three screens away? How about random encounters every 5 minutes with packs of wolves and dozens upon dozens of raiders with weapons that crit. hit you every single time?How about bugged out everything, from the dialogues with followers where you're unable to trade or to take their equipment to the glitches and crashes. I have nearly completed this pile of dogshit until the game crashed and corrupted THREE of my saves in the Navarro base, I had to go back to my saves more than a decade of levels ago when I was just making it big in the ♥♥♥♥ing New Reno.Near infinite ammo for enemies, inability to steal it before the fight.Stupidly overpowered enemy armour, lack of critical hits even for luck 10.The game is stupidly, mindbogginly, grindingly difficult for no other reason than ""because ♥♥♥♥ you!"", it was created simply for those who thought Fallout 1 was not enough, but it was. It was more than enough.Ludicrously nerfed unarmed combat. A punch with spiked knuckles that does 4 damage at over 140% Unarmed? Really? 4 attacks per turn for most enemies in HtH? Late acquisition of Bonus HtH attacks perk? Dogs and Rats that do 8 damage (non-critical!) to an upgraded leather armour? Early raiders that never miss a burst and do over 70 damage per an always critical hit? Dumbass Cassidy that always misses the enemy and hits me? Use Jet once - you're an addict? Knuckles do more damage than a power fist? Come on! Incredibly narrow focus on select skills, while others are of no use. You want to play a character of your own? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ pick guns and speech, otherwise you're gonna have a bad time.Walls of text, boring dialogues that reek of grade 9 English literature homework and bunch of other irrelevant stuff that just breaks the experience. Ghosts, friendly mutants and talking deathclaws... what? The game is either trying to be too serious or too wacky. Racial stereotypes and biased, black and white, presentation of the world. New Reno, for example, is supposed to be the ""cool place with no morally polar characters"" as it's everything that's ""bad"" in humanity, filled with vice and rotten people. But it's a sarcasm that misses its mark because it's so ""ad absurdum"" and gortesque - the actual essence of it is unrealistic and this distances the player from the game. Everything feels like a joke and yet the game is taking itself seriously, like a comedian that's gone too far into the number as the nervous audience chuckle to avoid awkwardness of the moment.At level 10 the pack of wolves is still a problem. A bodyguard in a casino get's a face full of Minigun at Big Guns 120+ % to get 12 damage and comes back with 30 damage as you get gunned down by a simple shotgun shot half the way across the room.And to top everything off, constant crashes, corrupt game save files and tons of bugs.It feels like a DLC to the great Fallout. Dumbed down and with ridiculous traits like ""childkiller"" and such.No wonder it was more popular than the original, YOBA approved.Worse than Fallout 1 in all respects except one - inventory management.I come back to this...""game"" every once in a while, mustering all of my will just to push down the stomach convulsions as I try to keep myself from vomiting or just trashing my computer and putting a wooden stake into its remains so that ""it would not rise to terrify the living ever again"". And every time I do, I honestly try to enjoy it and beat it, but the truth is, this is the only game that I cannot bring myself to tolerate. No matter how much time has passed since my previous attempt, be it late 90's or today. A steaming pile of rotten ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ does not turn into a fruitcake and some things only get worse with time.Horrible.			"

												For all you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s back at Black Isle studios and interplay THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never in my live seen a game where your character can miss a target a point blank range with a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun! The A.I is so stupid they just charge you and surround you to the point where you can't ♥♥♥♥ing move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then the game is glitched like that. On top of everything else including the fact that HUMANS take 10 to 20 rocket blasts to kill, half the ♥♥♥♥ing game is a wild goose chase! If I could even begin rate rate this game it would be a mother♥♥♥♥ing 2 out of 10 it's just so horrible. Take Ride To Hell and make it a Post Nuclear Role Playing Game, thats fallout 2. I'm sorry to say this considering I absolutly loved fallout 1 but YOU CAN'T MAKE♥♥♥♥♥♥FOR PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted Black isle studios to come back and make another fallout game, UNTILL I PLAYED FALLOUT 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Let's just say I'm glad Bethesda is making fallout 4 and not you ♥♥♥♥♥uckers! ♥♥♥♥ YOU BLACK ISLE STUDIOS! ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Fallout 2 takes the incestuous abortion of two 90's top down game engines and diarrheas it onto the face of buyers.

Further still, the few sales seen by Fallout II were only superseded by a god damn nerd rumor that it contains some ♥♥♥♥ing ""secret cow level"".

I would only recomend this game to someone revisiting there favourite childhood game etc. this game makes FO3 look like a 100m sprint, FO2 is so slugish by todays standards of gaming that you will be bored to death in minute, If your in to more modern up beat faced past games like FO3 or FONV this is definelty NOT FOR YOU!Ignore the other fanboy reviews!!!!!in 98 this would be a 10/10by todays standards (including gameplay, narative, charechter models etc. (not graphics for obious reasons) 3/10COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

More open-ended than it's predecessor Fallout but that depends entirely on you whether or not that is a good or bad thing.If you come from Fallout 3 do not give up on the rough start with this game (also applies to Fallout), it is worth every bit to get into it, dare I say way more rewarding to get into than Fallout 3.If you want an amazing immersive experience that even FEELS realistic, this is for you to sink up 60h into. Amazing game for it's price and I don't even consider it ""dated"" in any regard. The gameplay feels intuitive and the visuals are gorgeous. "

												Although the graphics are sligntly outdated, this game still finds many areas to shine. The dialouge for example can be both funny and serious with a high intellegence character and utterly stupid with a low intellegence character. Also the turn-based combat will bring most RPG fans back to the good old days where combat was incredibly stratigical and fun. Finally the story is very emotional if you take the time to delve into the characters and their stories. I recommend this game to any Fallout fan.			"

It's pretty easy to finish this game quickly, but there are so many different ways of doing things and so many different endings that you can play it over a dozen times and still not do everything the game has to offer.

												I have to admit that I never played either of the original Fallout games back when they first came out and only became aware of the series during the release of Fallout 3 which I fell in love with. To say I was hesitant in getting into an older game that is known for being arduously difficult and based on the GURPS RPG system is a gods damned understatement. But when that good ol' Steam Holiday sale rolled by and saw this game for the dirt cheap, I decided ""What the ♥♥♥♥"" and started my new favorite game.Folks without a doubt this is a great game. Its fun, its got great writing, the gameplay mechanics (though challenging at first if unfamiliar) are great, the character system is great...the game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Obviously, however, it's not perfect. For starters its graphics have aged with the grace of an avacado left under a UV lamp in high humidity for several decades and can prove to be frustrating when you initially start the game and everything looks horribly glitched until you find a fix it. Pacing can be hard to get into if you go from a fast paced pick up and play game, and there is a lot of reading (which isn't a negative but for extensive gaming it can ware your eyes sore).While it is true that you can basically make a perfect character based on how you want to play the game (ex. a character perfect for the main campaign invest stats in X,X,X an X etc.,) the fun of this game is just seeing what happens when you try and not be conventional. This is where the GURPS mechanic shines and as a result I'm looking into the table top game system  . This game is fun to play around in and while, yes trial and error results in several (and I mean SEVERAL) in game deaths for the uninitiated, it helps you get a strong feel for the world you are playing in.Another minor gripe I have is that there is no tutorial, you are basically dropped into the game and left to figure it out, which for some is great, but it would have been nice to have the option.

												Fallout 2, what can I say about this glorious game... it's easily the best rpg of it's time. Even today it's one of the few games I can go back to and play endlessly. I probably have closer to 250 hours in at the time of this review. I played it on an old laptop before I got steam. It is without a doubt the best turn based rpg I have ever play and the only thing that comes close is fallout 1. If you are in anyway interested in the begining of fallout you should no doubt get this game. If you want to try out a good retro or classic game look no further. If you are concerned about graphical glitches people seem to be having it's because the colors are 8-bit. Go to Killap.net and download the restoration installer. I man spent years recovering all cut content and patching almost all known issues in the game. It greatly expands content fixes almost all issues and gives resolution options and color bit choices. Fallout 2 is a timeless game that will forever be the pinnacle of classic rpgs. I would spend more time telling you what I love about the game but I would have to describe every aspect of the game. The only thing lacking is actually radiation. There is not much of it for a game about fallout lol. Other than that it's perfect 10 out of 10.			"

												This game is old as♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it has not aged well. If you buy or download it, you will most likely get graphical errors, only thing which fixes this is unofficial patch. Otherwise, this game is an RPG with really strange combat system which can be described well with this line ""you just spam the weakest attack and hope it hits the target and hope opponent's attacks miss"", this sadly kills it for me. Otherwise, this game has really cool references, and perk icons and cutscenes are really fun to watch. If your about to buy a fallout game, id suggest you to try newer games, because the gameplay is so different compared to other RPGs ive played.			"

												Well, my relationship with the fallout series isn't that lengthy, as I have still yet to complete Fallout and Fallout Tactics along with all the other classic Fallout games. But as a person who mainly just favors FPS and direct combat and whatnot, when I first got this game, I was plagued with graphics issues.Things showing up as mixmatch of black,red,blue pixels, overall sound being rather screwed up, and I really started to doubt whether my purchase was worth it.But recently, while waiting at an airport, I decided to just out of boredom give this game a try.I dunno what really happened, but the graphics problem was gone. I assume it was patched over the time that I left it to sit in the library, but it was gone. I watched the intro, I started to play, and there I was, clicking away for hours.This sort of game with the old-school PC point and click action normally wouldn't be my cup of soup, but for whatever reason this game got me addicted. I paid more attention to story than I ever did with Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and even just laughed at how many cultural references were being made in this game, along with certain 4th wall breaking elements.Basic story line goes like this. You are a tribal who leaves your settlement to find a GECK, which is supposed to turn barren land into fertile soil, and recreate towns. You go on a looooooong journey, choosing careers, finding companions, but once you come back to your village, you find out that it's been removed, and the lone survivor tells you to go and find them.The rest is up to you to find out. No more spoilers for you, come back next year!Did I mention careers? Hell, there are also so many reputations/jobs/statuses you can get. Do you want to be a gun-slinging ganster? Do you want to be a dirt-flinging grave digger? Do you want to be a crap-shoveling brahmin excrement remover? Do you want to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥swinging pornstar? Do you want to get MARRIED? Then this game's got you covered (In more than one way... Grab yer jimmy hats!)It's almost like GTA in some aspects. You can also get a car! (Conditions do apply though; you need money. And parts. And fuel to get the car operating.) But no biggie, once you get that dream car of yours working (And if you've got enough fuel) you should be zooming around the wasteland (Unless an Enclave patrol pulls you over and shoot you with their futuristic-crap weapons. Then you're sunk unless you've got good stats and good armor. Or mutant soldiers, for that matter.) Want to get drunk? There are multiple types of alcoholic drinks that you can (over)indulge in! Feeling really horny? There are sex-workers GALORE. (Though you will be missing the hot pixel-to-pixel action between your hero and the person you're screwing/being screwed by. Too bad. All you get is a black fade-in screen.) Want to be the ""cool kid"" and take drugs? You won't be doing cocaine or heroine, but try some psycho and jet. Oh, some drugs make you stronger and more intelligent, too (Withdrawl's still a ♥♥♥♥♥.)There are of course, like all other Fallout games, the infamous SPECIAL and karma system. Do you want to be a hero and save the wasteland from evil? Or do you want to join the evils of the wasteland and become infamous? Take your pick, because once you get outta your small podunk settlement, guaranteed, your karma won't be staying at 0. Oh, as for your SPECIAL system, you get a few options: Play with whatever characters the game provides you with (And with their original stats) or just choose that character and modify their stats a wee bit. (Side note, having low intelligence is pretty funny, but on the long run, it will make everything just harder. Take your pick: Funny dialogue, or practical gameplay. Funny dialogue, or practical gameplay.) One thing did kinda get me a bit iffy about the game, though. It's the infamous talking heads. They're hideous. They're... Rather too smooth-looking, some of them. Almost as if they're made from clay. But other than that, that's pretty much it. Other than those hellspawn wanamingoes. Those you try to avoid.Yes, there were glitches (obviously not going to be really patched anytime soon), yes, there were frustrating moments in which I forgot to save and was pushed back 4 quests back (losing massive progress and possibly my laptop due to the amount of frustration), but hell, if you know when to save, know what you're clicking (ESPECIALLY the dialogues, mind you, a wrong click can seriously cause big problems. And you can't back away from it unless you exit and load your closest save), know how to read (And if your character has the intelligence to actually say fluent sentences, but it's rather hilarious and frustrating if your character's intelligence is below 3), you wouldn't regret buying this game. Chock-full of quests, interesting characters, jokes, and random encounters with enemies, friends or foe (the special ones are more or less what we'd call now, ""easter eggs"") Oh yeah, unlike the original Fallout (Which gives you 150 days on time limit with the waterchip), there really isn't a time limit for this one. I myself took at least over a year screwing around and actually finding the GECK. Though you should still be aware that the game engine itself can only let you play for 13ish in-game years. Do I recommend this game?♥♥♥♥ yes. Is it worth $9.99?Ehhh.... I'd say wait for a sale to happen. I've got my collection at a 75% off sale, and I don't regret that decision one bit.			"

												Truly a classic in the making. I remember playing this years ago and thinking ""This game is the best! It can't possibly get any better!"". Now today I still stand by that claim; oh sure, Fallout 3 and New Vegas are all good games but theres just something about Fallout 2 that really sticks to me, more so than even the first Fallout (though to be fair Fallout 2 is exactly like Fallout 1 just with more stuff). Mostly likely nostalgia but I'd like to think it was a game years ahead of it's time. The setting, the story, the side quests, the humour, the action (turn-based action that is), the adult themes the.... well EVERYTHING! It's just such a great game I don't think I could possibly recommend it more. It's cheap and what you get for such a cheap price is hours upon hours of fantastic role-playing! 11/10			"

												Basically if you played the first game, it's pretty similar. You'll get slightly improved gameplay, slightly improved graphics and a bigger map overall. It's still pretty good, you can now go as slow as you want this time around since you don't get the annoying countdown. You can also skip many steps like the first one and finish really fast if you know what you're doing of course. The story this time around is basically years after the first one, you play the chosen one in order to save your village that is slowly dying. It's as good as the first one but the main quest is this time around a bit longer which is good, so yeah good game if you like older games again.			"

												What can be said about this game? Hmm. Well the first thing you should know is that you shouldn't judge this game by its graphics. The post apocalyptic world many of the modern day gamers are used to seeing is rendered in 3D and significantly different in both story and atmosphere. This world seems almost filthy and bland by comparison.But that's the trick of the matter. This game decieves you thinking its some lame top down RPG when it is actually one of the most immersive games *ever made*In Fallout 2 your character creation really, really, matters. The way you design every stat and trait has ramifications that will help or hinder you throughout the game. People in the world really notice, and not in a stupid skyrim ""I see you're a fair hand with a blade"" generic line noticing either. You'll converse with them and they'll immediately notice if you are a dumb hulking brute or a sly sneaky sort. If you are handsome or ugly people will comment on it. Hookers will upcharge you if you are too ugly or simple. Murder or hurt enough people and the world hears about it, townspeople will run from you when you walk by, while criminals will nod respectfully as you pass. The way you make and play your character changes everything.Lets just start with Intelligence. If your character is of average intelligence, you can proceed through most of the game normally. But should you have high intelligence many options open up when dealing with more intellectual people or subjects. You can figure out solutions to problems that a less intelligent character couldn't, to the point where some boss fights or enemies can be defeated with a simple dialog option because your character was smart enough to see through the problem.The same goes for charisma. A charismatic character will be able to talk his way out of incredible situations. Heck, if you are persuasive enough you can sleep with a mob boss's wife and convince him you were just lost. You know, just lost, in her bedroom. There are places where you can talk down suicidal bombers or convince hard hearted racists against ghouls to change their ways and be more accepting.Every single stat is like this. Stronger characters will be able to open doors and force their way through situations others can't. More perceptive characters will see hidden traps and doors to avoid enemies and change the way confrontations happen. Every type of character made will have unique ways to solve any problem and this feels *so* good. Maybe you want to be a big stupid brute who is barely smart enough to speak but can kill anything with ease. Maybe you want to be the cocky sharpshooter who is perceptive, smart, and good with a gun but can't take much of a hit. Maybe you want to be completely crazy and give yourself 10 luck and the jinked perk so everyone around you dies in horrible catastrophic accidents while you walk away from huge explosions with minor cuts and scratches.You can do all of these things. The limit is really your imagination. This game is massive in scope and provides hundreds of hours of content, and with the addition of bugfixes and additional content added from the folks at http://killap.net/ who headed the Fallout Restoration Project, it becomes near a thousand hours of things to do in this game.If you want a game that you can play a hundred times and come back a hundred and one times and STILL see something new, buy fallout 2. Its a fabulous product and my only regret is that Bethesda did not put as much care and love into future releases as this original team did into making this a work of beauty, despite its flawed exterior.

												A fantastic sequel to an already amazing game. Took the franchise to a whole new level.+ Maintains the amazing atmosphere Fallout 1 already set up+ Introduces a new and extremely dangerous foe, the Enclave+ Although the game takes place around the same area, the map has expanded around it. You even get to return to Vault 13!+ New enemies and weapons+ Very interesting characters, such as Harold, who is growing a tree out of his freaking head+ Better followers, in which you can control who to fight, when to fight, and how to fight+ Uses the same ""Build Up"" story that Fallout 1 used. Instead of a water chip, you have to get a G.E.C.K., a device that can save your village from destruction. Seems like a big fetch quest, but like Fallout 1, it turns into something bigger+ Many new locations to go to+ Actually explains why the events of Fallout 1 happened in the first place, and why you had to go and find a water chip+ Combat is for the most part, satisfying. It may get repetitive sometimes, especially if your in power armor running into little Golden Geckos, but when you defeat a squad of the Enclave, it is very satisfactory+ Cities have more of a 40s-50s vibe than Fallout 1+ Again, a few different endings depending on your choices+ Explains what happened to the Vault Dweller after Fallout 1+ SO MANY THINGS TO DO! Become a slaver, get a car and travel the wasteland, save a community of ghouls and men from being killed by a man looking for his son, join the Mafia, buy everyone at the bar a round on the house, get taught how to fight hand to hand by a random guy, save a man's buisness by fixing his moonshine, beat up redneck twins, be a fighting champion, play Mortal Kombat in Chinatown, go on guard duty for 6 hours, and become...+/- Follower AI is a bit wonky, but is usually due to the default settings of the combat controller+/- Not much of a graphical improvement- Enclave can tear you apart at the start- The story is so unclear on what you must do. This is more apparent in this rather than Fallout 1. How was I supposed to know I was suppose to go to Reno, talk to the guy behind the locked door, ask him for a key, wait 1.34186 years exactly so he will say yes, take the key, open up th....10/10 A MasterpieceThis game is a legend in the RPG franchise. The storytelling is awesome, the writing was cheesy at times, but self aware and still great. Bursting with content and a great story to be told with lore to back it up as well. Don't feel bad for looking up guides or anything, as you may absolutely HAVE to in order progress.			"

												One the greatest RPGs released in the 90s. Dated references hamper the experience, but solid mechanics, incredible atmoshpere, and an engaging story make this one not miss out on. I'd reccomend downloading the restoration project; it's a mod that includes cut elements of the game.			"

												Takes the first Fallout and refines it in almost every way. Gameplay is improved, companions are much easier to use and manage, the content is increased. However; I recommend installing the FO2 Restoration Mod. I suspect from my research that the game would have been far less satisfying without it, especially concerning some cute deathclaws. More weapons, more companions, more humour, more grim and grit, more dakka. Lovely. Oh and black power armour. Gotta love that.			"

												This game literally made my life.There's a few times in life when the word ""masterpiece"" or ""perfect"" is the only possible way to describe something, and Fallout 2 is exactly it.This game will leave you feeling more satisifed than you've ever felt in your natural life, and upon completing it, enter an existential depression, for the beauty of what you've witnessed will never be re-created.The only thing you can do having finished the epic journey of the Chosen One, is to sit in the Cafe of Forgotten Dreams, on No Mutants Allowed, and wistfully remember the past of the Vault Dweller from Fallout 1.Then begin another 120 hour playthrough.

												Like so many others fans of the Fallout series, Fallout 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart. I've started by playing Fallout 3 (which at the time mind blew me, but in retrospect... meh), where a friend of mine recommended FO2. I tried it and was hooked. The whole world, the characters, the way it was turn-based... I just loved it. The game has a lot of in it, with plenty of options for completing the game, different way to handle situations, combined with a good sense of humour. Now, this game isn't perfect. It can be buggy as h*ll, especially without the Killap mod(s). That's why my steam account says I have only clocked 8 minutes of the game, because I use the mod instead, which I haven't added to my steam library.The humour, although a strengt for the most parts, can also be weakness. Sometimes the game became a bit too silly and over the top. The game has the tag line ""A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game"", which it's of course is, but compared to FO1, it sacrificed some of the grimness that the orginal game had.That being said, I think this here is a terrific game, I've glad I tried back then. This game is without a doubt my favorite game of the series and perhaps my favorite game of all times. I know I started playing the game a lot than it came out (10 years in fact), but I think that just prove how good it was, that even after all these years, it still felt innovative and original to a completely new player.I'm sorry I just wrote the review now, since I like the game so much, but since the Steam Awards are coming up, I'm going to bash 2 flies with one swat. I recommend this game for the ""TEST OF TIME"" award.			"

												Perfection at its finest. I have no negatives for this game. If you have never played Fallout, Fallout 2, or Fallout tactics and are trying this out after trying Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, I offer these points.- The game is not first person, it uses a bird eyes view for the gameplay- Nothing is off limits, for example; in FO3 and FNV, killing children was prohibited. Fallout 2 allows you be the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the world. Kill children, desecrate graves, procreate with different women/men, become a slaver, sell off your companions as slaves, and be the biggest a-hole you want to- The speech skills definitely comes in handy more often in Fallout 2. - Fallout 2 has a very dark sense of humor incorporated into it. Fallout 3 is a little happier.Fallout 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. If your a fan of 3 and New Vegas, give this a shot. Just remember its an older game, and will not compare graphic wise. It has an excellent story behind it and plenty of side quests and items that allow you to immerse yourself into the Fallout world.			"

												Fallout 2 may not look like much at first glance, but it is among my top 3 best games I've ever played in my entire life. The game offers compelling quests and missions that can be performed in literally any way you can imagine, and as you go deeper into the story and explore the different towns and cities, you begin to realize just how well connected everything is. The world feels very much alive and reacts to your decisions in ways that feel significant and reasonable. More importantly, you can become a lot of different things from a grave digger, to a prize fighter, to becoming a reknown pornstar and much more. You can charm your way into people's hearts and influence them to follow you, only to grow tired or bored of them and sell them into slavery. The first 20 minutes can be decieving, get through the tutorial (which can be a little annoying, I know) and you won't regret buying this game.			"

												I started playing this game when it first came out and I keep coming back to it.  I am now working on my fifth game of it which is saying something as I rarely play most RPG games more than one time.  This is a classic, so even though the graphics are now outdated they are fine with me.  The game has a great story and plays different depending on those that you have travel with you etc.  A great value, especially if you play it as many times as I have.  This is actually my favourite of the Fallout games to date.			"

												BEST RPG EVER <3 better than Fallout 3 with lots of twists and turns! The storylines are immersive, loads of different species of companions with very different personalities and skills. This game has you make important decisions which ultimately impact the game and what unfolds next. There is plenty to do and you get the run of the map - free to go where you choose and what you choose to do, iconic cities and the humour is just classic! Thoroughly enjoyed it, wish Black Isle/Interplay had actually made the third installment of the series rather than Bethesda!			"

												First of all, buy this game. Right now. It's an amazing turn-based game and in my opinion an equal to fallout 3 and New Vegas. Now that I have the review done, it's story time.Started up the game, and I'm immediately presented with an intro quest; Make your way through the temple of trials. Simple enough, I set off into the temple and begin my journey. Now, I had built my character for heavy melee combat, so I was easily oneshotting most enemies in the temple. I lockpicked one door and walked through the first part of the temple victorious. The next corridor presented a similar door-based challenge, except now you have to blow the door to bits instead of picking the lock. I wander around, searching for explosives, killing ants, and the norm. After a small while I found a packet of plastic explosives in a container. With my new bomb, I walked up to the previously insurmountable door, place the explosive with a timer for 30 seconds, and hide behind a wall. Now, the bomb has no visible indicator for when it will explode, you just have to wait. So I did. For 20 seconds. I then decided to look at the bomb to see if it had a timer on it, so I click it. However, instead of peeking at the bomb, my character RUNS UP AND GRABS THE LIVE EXPLOSIVE. I panic, try to reset the timer, and subsequently get blown to pieces by my own bomb. 10/10 would suicide bomb a door again.			"

												Basically Fallout with the ""Bigger = Better"" mindset applied to it. Whether it indeed is better is up for debate, but in my case I'm going to have to fully agree with the side that says it is, because in terms of content this game blows Fallout 1 out of the water. Although lacking an equally intriguing antagonist, Fallout 2 further builds on the greatness of Fallout 1 and increases the world map at least 3 times, adds many new weapons and perks, adds a fully functional companion management system and more. With a bunch of interesting quests, NPCs/companions and locations this game will keep you going for at least 40 hours the first time through. The first time I completed this game and watched the final cutscene I was left in absolute awe, reminiscing about my adventure-filled journey. What an absolute gem of an RPG that anyone hungry for one should get their hands on.If you can't get into the ""dated"" gameplay (read, ""if you are severely lacking taste"") then I can only feel bad for what you're missing out on.On a side note, play it with the Restoration Project, it's seriously worth it.

												Like it's predecessor, ""Fallout 2"" is a classic game. That is to say, it comes from a time where men were real men, women were real women, and real, fuzzy things from Alpha Centauri were real, fuzzy things from Alpha Centauri.My apologies to Douglas Adams.What I mean is that the experience is born of a time when games demanded a lot from players, and pretty much refused to engage in hand-holding. If your character isn't especially scientific, or stealthy, or good at talking, then you'd better be able to independently figure out combat - or you're out of luck. (A well-rounded character may not be your best bet in this game. That was my approach, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the game is much more rewarding for players who choose to specialize.)There is one section, very late in the game, which requires you to solve a rather mind-boggling puzzle. If you can't solve it, you can't progress. This isn't like the ""Half-Life 2"" episodes, where a major design goal was apparently for every player to see the ending. In ""Fallout 2,"" if you can't get through, it's tough cookies.I cheated. Maybe I'm just a simpleton, but I couldn't get through it without help. I have no idea how anyone figured it out to write the walkthrough, to be frank. (Maybe if I had spend a few hours making detailed notes...maybe.)Like I said: Games like this are demanding, and do not ""suffer fools gladly.""And if you want to know how this kind of RPG gaming got to where it is now, you need to play this classic title.

												What a wonderful game.  Here are some pro-tips for beginners I wish I'd known at the start:1)  In the first dungeon, the Temple of Trials, you're going to be forced to melee.  Everything in here (ants and scorpions) can be kited if you have at least 7 action points.  Punch something (using 3), and move 4 spaces away from it.  It will use all of its action points to close the 4 space gap, and not be able to attack you.  This will save you a lot of trouble.2)  You can heal yourself using doctor/first aid skills in addition to the powder.  This can only be done successfully three times each though.  (Save your antidotes if poisoned, you'll be able to cure the poison with the use of these skills and/or it will wear off over the course of the time it takes you to attempt to use them)3)  When you enter the second area, walk slowly forward, one space at a time.  As you notice the raised stone plates, use the traps skill on them.  Even if you skill is low, keep using it.  Eventually, you'll disarm them, for 25 XP each.4)  You can steal the key from the final guy to avoid fighting him.  You can keep reloading if your steal skill is low.  Alternatively you can talk him out of the fight if you have enough speech skill.5)  If you level up in the dungeon, don't put points into melee or unarmed. There's a trainer for each in the first village.  If you have less than 55% unarmed skill, you can train to 55%.  There's a guy for melee weapons too, that'll give you +10%.  I'm not sure what the cutoff is.			"

												Hey, a Fallout game! The first one was fun, and since I've beat all of them but 2, this'll be a piece of cake, right?No. No it will not. This game will murder you over and over and over and over again. If you don't make every choice right this game will rip your arm off an beat you with it, you will know this game inside and out, be able to redraw the map like it was tattooed into your brain. This game is hard to say the least, but is also fun.Pros: Don't get me wrong when I say fun, it's kind of like mowing the lawn for the first time, exciting and you can't wait to do more, but constantly worrying that you'll do it wrong and it'll come back to bite you in the future. Story wise, fantastic. Better than all the others and than some. Also lots of crazy easter eggs and references so be prepared.Cons: Sometimes the game just decides to kill itself and have seizures, but it was made in the 1990's so I'll forgive it.Final thoughts: If you consider yourself a fan of the Fallout series you have to play this. And you should. But if you're asking yourself ""I thought Fallout 3 was the first fallout game"" or, ""why are you stuck in 3rd person"", than you should probably stick to COD.			"

												If you are playing this game because you want a cool open world adventure with lots of freedom and choice this game is for you. Just to give you an idea you can become a pornstar, or you can complete the whole game with an intelligence of 1 and just grunt and make noises in all conversations.If you are expecting to come into the wasteland and pretty much destroy everything that walks in your path at the start like in fallout 3 or NV you will find yourself killed very quickly. You will most likely find yourself running from most enemies at the start of the game because you don't even get a gun, ya you need to find one yourself because guns are very expensive in shops in this game. This makes it all the more satisfying when you actually get your first armor and gun and you slowly are able to take on raiders, golden geckos, and radscorpions. You feel yourself becoming stronger with each new item and level.Your SPECIAL and tag skills mean more in this than 3 and NV as they affect dialogue and combat more, since it is all turn based stats matter more in this game.I love this game it's a big open world with easter eggs to explore and fun sidequest. You really can make your own story which is what makes this game great. Whether you want to be a heartless slaver, a champion boxer, a mafia member, or just a guy who wants to do good in the wasteland it's all available to you. Don't let the age of the game stop you from playing. It's different from 3 or NV, which I still still think are great games, but just like every fallout game it's extremely fun (except brotherhood of steel but I think it's better for everyone to forget that game)			"

												[Note: The game time logged on Steam does not reflect the time I spent playing Fallout to date. I bought it back in 1997 on CD-ROM and have owned a couple of other bundles which included it since, and have completed Fallout 2 at least a dozen of times since first release.]This is definitely a worthy successor to the first game.  It's bigger, better and it follows the original story line of the ""lone wanderer."" You're in search for the G.E.C.K., thar Garden Of Eden Creation Kit to save your village.The recipe is the same as in Fallout 1, just improved. It's one of the best RPGs I've played and it thankfully gives you a different setting than the typical fantasy, elven and dwarf infested dungeons. Not that I have anything against that, but this is refreshing!In addition, there is the community developed ""Fallout 2 Restoration Project"" which adds A LOT of content, fixes and tweaks to the game, that were never added properly, were buggy, or missing. Even if you have completed this game a number of times before (I would hope at least once!), then this adds a tremendous replay value.The cast members of the previous game resume their high quality performances again and all I can say is: Go play. For the love of the lone wanderer, play this game!			"

												 I got into the first town I see a 'bath house,' I go into this 'Bath House'. I inquire about the these baths, then the lady who call herself 'big nose ma(or mo can't rember)' tells me that the baths were not the baths and that there were ladys only. at this moment in the back ground I see a person wailing there arms and runing into a bathroom. I pay for a minium 'bath' the screen goes black. A new lady says something about never doing that before looking around I see a bed with stairs next to it I talk to the lady she says that shes dried up meat. I walk out and got to the the diffrent looking room I check the bed apperntly ♥♥♥♥ was on it. 10/10 I would unknowingly pay for a prositute again>.			"

												At the very beginning, I had a hard time getting used to the gameplay. Older, openworld games are not something I've played a lot of. (I shy away from largely nonlinear games in general) Despite my overwhleming rejection of the first part of this game, the moment the ""tutorial"" (if you can call it that) was over I could not put it down. I'm sitting here at 3:30am writing this review and all I've done today is play this game. It's all I've done for the past THREE days. I honestly don't think I've ever been so thouroghly addicted to a game before. It's tense, humurous, intriguing. Also, I chose brains over brawn (Chista) and all of the dialouge choices and sneaky ways to solve things that come with it are really fun to explore and exploit. It didn't feel just like a list of choices or a puzzel on how to chose the right dialouge choice, it was more a question of how what sort of person you wanted to be and added to how you wanted to aproach a variety of groups and people. Fallout 2 has opened my eyes to a new genre of gaming and I highly suggest it to both those who know and love this style of game and those who are a bit iffy about it.Also, don't give up until the ""tutorial"" stage is over!

With the FO2 Restoration project the game has renewed life, and much more content adding hours of gameply even if you have played through the game before without FO2RP i suggest you try it again with the Project installed.

												Truly a classic in the making. I remember playing this years ago and thinking ""This game is the best! It can't possibly get any better!"". Now today I still stand by that claim; oh sure, Fallout 3 and New Vegas are all good games but theres just something about Fallout 2 that really sticks to me, more so than even the first Fallout (though to be fair Fallout 2 is exactly like Fallout 1 just with more stuff). Mostly likely nostalgia but I'd like to think it was a game years ahead of it's time. The setting, the story, the side quests, the humour, the action (turn-based action that is), the adult themes the.... well EVERYTHING! It's just such a great game I don't think I could possibly recommend it more. It's cheap and what you get for such a cheap price is hours upon hours of fantastic role-playing! 11/10			"

												This is one of the best role-playing games and also probably one of the best games ever? It has humour and atmosphere and is extremely open-ended level design wise and has a sense of genuinely helping people or at the very least making some kind of difference in the wasteland that isn't present in games like Skyrim or Fallout 3 where nothing you do actually feels like you're changing anything. It's a game about life after nuclear annihilation and people trying to scrape by in a desolate wasteland but it's also somehow very uplifting and optimistic and I get extremely sentimental just thinking about it. Please play this game.			"

												If you haved liked an RPG or turn-based game before, ever, you have to play Fallout 1 and 2. In my book each is easily among the top 10 games of all time, and if Steam actually reflected how much time I've spent on each it would be in the 1000s of hours. (Maybe slightly less for Fallout, easily well above for Fallout 2.) Seriously, I can't recommend these strongly enough.			"

												I started with Fallout 3. I'm not ashamed or anything this game came out before I even knew how to play video games. I still love Fallout 3 and the world Bethesda crafted for it. I've replayed it so much I know it like the back of my hand. Obviously being that there was a number 3 at the end of the title it got in my head to wonder ""What were the past games like? Fallout 3 has introduced me to a fantastic world and I want to see where it started!"" Opun looking at screenshots I remember thinking ""Wow... these games look old and crappy"". However as time went on I actually played Half Life 1 for the first time which really open my naive eyes to the idea that ""Hey! Just because it's old looking doesn't mean it sucks!"" So I looked the games up again and decided on getting Fallout 2 over 1 as it said there was no time limit to 2. I can now say that I think Fallout 2 (and 1 respectively) is a far superiour game to Fallout 3. It's amazing how a game where many of the character sprites look the same and the world it self is clearly just 2D with an isometric view could get me so immersed. Being able to place plastic explosive at the foot of a door, set a timer, then run like hell to watch it explode is just one of many things that made me fall in love with this game. While the gore and graphics of Fallout 3 are awesome being in a gunfight with raiders in Fallout 2 is even cooler. I've had a raider aim for my head only to miss and hit the other raider coming up behind me. Fallout 2 is one of the few games that truly made me feel like a Wastleland Vigilante, like Mad Max and Clint Eastwood in one person. I did a mission for a town where I inspected a haunted farm only to find it inhabited by friendly ghouls. When I came back to the town the mayor told me if I didn't find one of their townfolks who had gone missing at the farm they would kill all the ghouls. When I couldn't find him I came back only to find that the mayor had really done it. He really killed all those innocents. So I shot him. I've never been so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at a fictional character in my life but unlike in a book or a movie I actually got to decide his fate and I decided his time was up.My hope is that Fallout 4 will look back at some of these games and really try to implement some of the amazing player freedoms that this game allowed. If Fallout 4 ended up being and amazing 3d representation of this game my life would complete.			"

												Oh GOD YES! This gotta be the best of them all, of all the Fallout games THIS is the crown jewel.It is dark, it is funny and it is a really great RPG with many choices that impacts your character.There are 2 versions of the game, one is with children the other is without. The one without is apperently the german and mainly in europa version and the one with is american, This copy on steam have the children in them.Now to the game it self....It is harder than fallout 1 in the start as Stimpacks and medication cost have sky rocketed, it is still however highly important having High Agility, Intelligence and decent perception to become a death dealing sniper with good stealth and a general jack of all trades as the skill points and AP will aid you a lot and the STRENGTH boost of Power armor will give you more than enough carry capacity for the weapon of choice, the arrmor and enough mediciation to rule the world.... unless you get companions to carry stuff for you, yupp you can get companions and they do die easily so best in the start, end game not so much. But then again you can just replace those blasted companions with your nifty car that runs on small energy cells or micro fusion batteries.... meaning your priced energy weapons will suffer a bit unless you can get a steady supply of them by hunting down Enclave goons.Now..... the story is in a sense just like Fallout 1 with a few changes but in general happen in the same way, go get thing, get back and deal with bigger threat, but the world is bigger, more towns, more quests and more goofy persons to meet. If you just liked Fallout 1 then you are bound to love fallout 2, it is simply done better.			"

Runs fine on my windows 8.1, in the version I've been playing I have encountered no major bugs. My one complaint is that the combat feels clunky and dated compared to modern turn based games like XCOM. Overall, 9/10.			"

												What a wonderful game.  Here are some pro-tips for beginners I wish I'd known at the start:1)  In the first dungeon, the Temple of Trials, you're going to be forced to melee.  Everything in here (ants and scorpions) can be kited if you have at least 7 action points.  Punch something (using 3), and move 4 spaces away from it.  It will use all of its action points to close the 4 space gap, and not be able to attack you.  This will save you a lot of trouble.2)  You can heal yourself using doctor/first aid skills in addition to the powder.  This can only be done successfully three times each though.  (Save your antidotes if poisoned, you'll be able to cure the poison with the use of these skills and/or it will wear off over the course of the time it takes you to attempt to use them)3)  When you enter the second area, walk slowly forward, one space at a time.  As you notice the raised stone plates, use the traps skill on them.  Even if you skill is low, keep using it.  Eventually, you'll disarm them, for 25 XP each.4)  You can steal the key from the final guy to avoid fighting him.  You can keep reloading if your steal skill is low.  Alternatively you can talk him out of the fight if you have enough speech skill.5)  If you level up in the dungeon, don't put points into melee or unarmed. There's a trainer for each in the first village.  If you have less than 55% unarmed skill, you can train to 55%.  There's a guy for melee weapons too, that'll give you +10%.  I'm not sure what the cutoff is.			"

												This game, this game right here is the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even after 16 years this game holds up EXTREMELY well! I have never played this game before I bought it in 2014, so this isn't me saying this game is amazing simply from nostalgia factor, as many people are very biased when reviewing old games for that reason. Not me though. This game has very good, well, everything! You just need to get into it, perhaps get use to the somtimes annoying or cluncky combat and extreme lack of hand holding/any guidance apart from a brief description of what you need to do for a quest, and you will find one of the best games EVER! (Beware though, a lot of reading is required, most characters are not voiced, so people with short attention spams might want to reconsider, however you should still try it, like I did).So in breif is this game good; no... It's better than good. Better than great. Better than amazing. Want evidence?YOU CAN BECOME A MOTHA♥♥♥♥IN' PORN STAR!Point proven, case closed.			"

												I have to admit that I never played either of the original Fallout games back when they first came out and only became aware of the series during the release of Fallout 3 which I fell in love with. To say I was hesitant in getting into an older game that is known for being arduously difficult and based on the GURPS RPG system is a gods damned understatement. But when that good ol' Steam Holiday sale rolled by and saw this game for the dirt cheap, I decided ""What the ♥♥♥♥"" and started my new favorite game.Folks without a doubt this is a great game. Its fun, its got great writing, the gameplay mechanics (though challenging at first if unfamiliar) are great, the character system is great...the game is ♥♥♥♥ing great. Obviously, however, it's not perfect. For starters its graphics have aged with the grace of an avacado left under a UV lamp in high humidity for several decades and can prove to be frustrating when you initially start the game and everything looks horribly glitched until you find a fix it. Pacing can be hard to get into if you go from a fast paced pick up and play game, and there is a lot of reading (which isn't a negative but for extensive gaming it can ware your eyes sore).While it is true that you can basically make a perfect character based on how you want to play the game (ex. a character perfect for the main campaign invest stats in X,X,X an X etc.,) the fun of this game is just seeing what happens when you try and not be conventional. This is where the GURPS mechanic shines and as a result I'm looking into the table top game system  . This game is fun to play around in and while, yes trial and error results in several (and I mean SEVERAL) in game deaths for the uninitiated, it helps you get a strong feel for the world you are playing in.Another minor gripe I have is that there is no tutorial, you are basically dropped into the game and left to figure it out, which for some is great, but it would have been nice to have the option.

												If you are a fan of point and click games, RPGs, and like a challenge; Fallout 2 is for you! Fallout 2 is a big improvement when compared to it's predecessor, the origional Fallout. The mechanics are average, but it is still very impressive. I judge games by gameplay, not graphics. Even though the graphics are old (which doesn't affect my gameplay experience at all) they are still awesome.9/10			"

												Multiple endings, moral choices, multiple factions, strong voice acting, tactical gameplay.  Less than one year after original game.  The year is 1998 and this is the sequel to the best post-apocalyptic RPG ever created.  More characters, more locations, more weapons, more items, and more choices.  Just more of everything in Fallout 2.  Yup – you guessed it right – I’m going to say that this game is worth the piddly $10 they charge for it.  After you crush Fallout 1, carry on the story in Fallout 2.			"

												Wonderful NPCs, colorful dialogue, flexible character creation. Combat is even pretty fun with VATS and being able to target specific parts of the body. My only major complain is that your character is of tribal origins, which limits some character development/backgrounds for the unimaginative (me). Overall fantastic game, however! Definitely worth a buy, and it won't break the bank, either.Also, you can hit kids in the groin with a sledgehammer and that's pretty funny.			"

Wander aimlessly across the wasteland with the imminent danger that lurks within it, amongst its ranks includes the ill-met Enclave to the infamous slaps-you-in-the-thighs-and-somehow-gives-you-rads-from-it packs of aliens.

												90%The missiles were launched. The bombs were dropped. The War happened. Specific details have grown blurry over the last few generations. Scattered, struggling survivors do not keep histories so well. Besides, useless facts about the Ancient Tribes and their politics will not put food on the table or uncontaminated water in the tanks. Do you think the last remaining dinosaurs sat around discussing the color and shape of the comet that doomed them?Some surface dwellers survived, but few without genetic scars from the fallout. Others survived underground, although they too changed in their way. A lucky few lived in the Vaults, built in preparation by the Ancient Tribes. They worked and grew and had children untouched and separated from the holocaust above. But nothing lasts forever, and eventually a reason would make it necessary to leave the Vault and discover what was left of the world. Or sometimes it was the savage outer world that discovered the Vault first. Either way, the Vault dwellers were seldom prepared.This is the world to which you are born, the world of Fallout 2 from Interplay. Your tribe, the Arroyo, are the descendents of survivors from Vault 13 who moved to the surface in the original Fallout. Recently in your village, water is becoming more scarce, raiders more frequent, and the crops are getting thinner and sicker every year.You have been chosen (you lucky dog) to leave the tribe and risk life and limb in search of an ancient artifact. Tribal lore describes the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK) which can be used to build a paradise* (*results may vary). So off you go, bold adventurer, to brave the wastelands, to confront bandits and mutants, to comb the boneyards of the destroyed cities in search of mythical science. At least you have a spear…And you'll need it if you want to make it through the dark, complex, dangerous, intelligent story of Fallout 2. Having last reviewed Zelda 64, it was a bit of a shock moving to Fallout. Unlike the cutsie-poo Zelda, this is a very adult game with complex dynamic plots, a fairly high violence level, a dark mood, and every swear word in the book.In fact, it is difficult if not impossible to be completely moral in this game. Decisions are complex and there are often no right answers. Which New Reno crime syndicate do you help? They're all just competing for the distribution of highly addictive 'jet'. Which competing towns do you help or hinder? Sometimes there are no 'right'anwers.Of course, this assumes you want to try to do right. You can also slaughter the innocent, pimp your wife, and shoot children in the head if that is more to your taste. However, if you do the latter, be prepared to defend yourself from the other townspeople.To be fully prepared, you will need plenty of armor, weapons and ammo. You may begin with only a spear, but there are many levels of technology out there, and you'll quickly move to guns and advanced armor of you wish to survive. There's even power armor and energy weapons when you get far enough.To augment all this, you have seven primary stats and dozens of different skills, abilities and 'perks'. These affect many gameplay issues, not just combat like most other games. I made a fighter for my first character, and lowered his intelligence in order to have plenty of strength. However, I lowered it too much and I soon realized that the computer controlled people were treating me like an idiot (which I was). It was especially frustrating trying to respond to them.""I have a job for you, dullard, if you think you can help guard this merchant caravan, "" someone might say to me. However, my choice of responses was often limited to ""Me Baldric."" or ""Ug herg ba?""I quickly started a new character. What I am saying here is that the depth of Fallout 2 is simply phenomenal.The graphics, on the other hand, are a bit disappointing. 2D sprites wander about using what is obviously the old Fallout 1 engine. Everything is well detailed, but there aren't very many frames of animation and all the humans tend to look the same. The similar isometric graphics in Ultima Online, for example, have much more character differentiation, and Fallout has no online component at all.The interface is a bit awkward. By making everything 100% mouse driven (there are keyboard shortcuts), they have made many actions difficult. Nothing is impossible (except removing weapons or armor from one of your party members for some reason), but the interface really could have been much more streamlined.Despite these problems, Fallout 2 is highly addictive. The warm, fuzzy, post-apocalyptic world has all the little details and exactly the right tone. The immersive story has kept me up until the wee hours of the morn on many occasions. And finally, if you aren't convinced to buy it yet, Fallout 2 simply has the best opening movie of any game, ever. Now if only I had a telepathic dog and a disposable girlfriend…			"

This game has you make important decisions which ultimately impact the game and what unfolds next. There is plenty to do and you get the run of the map - free to go where you choose and what you choose to do, iconic cities and the humour is just classic!

												This game is not like any other fallout game to date. Though it's built in an isometric world instead of an FPS, you are immediately immersed into a sprawling universe that feels like it has been existing for a long time now. It doesn't feel like it's built for you to play in, but it was built by it's own citizens. The game is hard. Like, almost near impossible even at a low difficulty setting. This makes conservation of ammo and healing items ESSENTIAL for your surivival, if not totally dependent on it. There are tons of mad max refferences, a car you can drive, and some unique sidequests that you won't see in ANY OTHER fallout games.Before you start playing, get into the habit of saving after every encounter with an enemy. A large amount of uncontrollable variables can get you or your team killed in an instant. I'd give this a 9/10, the games only flaw  (for me)  being the incredible difficulty.			"

												Fallout 1 was a very good game.. but this one probably takes the crown. Even though Fallout 3 and New Vegas are very very good games.. this one still has to be my favorite.. for its time. This game really did good for its time, the random encounters are pretty fun so many unique and interesting things to run into, there is SO much to do. I never get bored of this game, I still play it even now. Plus it brings back so many good memories. I'd recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs, if you liked Diablo it's a chance you may like this game.. if you liked Final fantasy, there's also a good chance you'll like it. It is a turned based combat system. But it's been developed smart and it's very fun and helpful if you love strategy games. Also if you liked X-Com.. you may fall in love with Fallout 2. It's a lot like X-Com but free roam, you can do whatever you want, so much to explore, the story line was built very well and it's extremely interesting. I hope anyone who grabs this game will enjoy it a lot. Also steam supports this game for different Operating systems. Which is a huge help, also if you like to spice the game up a tad bit.. check out http://www.nma-fallout.com/ to check out some of the cool mods you can add to the game. Enjoy your awesome journey in Fallout 2 and good luck!			"

												What a wonderful game.  Here are some pro-tips for beginners I wish I'd known at the start:1)  In the first dungeon, the Temple of Trials, you're going to be forced to melee.  Everything in here (ants and scorpions) can be kited if you have at least 7 action points.  Punch something (using 3), and move 4 spaces away from it.  It will use all of its action points to close the 4 space gap, and not be able to attack you.  This will save you a lot of trouble.2)  You can heal yourself using doctor/first aid skills in addition to the powder.  This can only be done successfully three times each though.  (Save your antidotes if poisoned, you'll be able to cure the poison with the use of these skills and/or it will wear off over the course of the time it takes you to attempt to use them)3)  When you enter the second area, walk slowly forward, one space at a time.  As you notice the raised stone plates, use the traps skill on them.  Even if you skill is low, keep using it.  Eventually, you'll disarm them, for 25 XP each.4)  You can steal the key from the final guy to avoid fighting him.  You can keep reloading if your steal skill is low.  Alternatively you can talk him out of the fight if you have enough speech skill.5)  If you level up in the dungeon, don't put points into melee or unarmed. There's a trainer for each in the first village.  If you have less than 55% unarmed skill, you can train to 55%.  There's a guy for melee weapons too, that'll give you +10%.  I'm not sure what the cutoff is.			"

												Overall great game with a great story. It can be miserable at times especially during combat hence the fact that it is turned based an very slow paced. This game and Fallout 1 have both aged terribly, but if you put that aside, they are actually fun. If you missed out on Fallout 1 and 2 adding them to your steam library will be worthwhile.I hope Bethesda remakes these two classics, so gamers today can relive the experience that gamers did during the late 90s.

												In the beginning there was Baldurs Gate which you can now buy (enhanced editions 1 & 2 on steam) to re-live the classic RPG/Adventure/D&D style of gameplay...but in the late 90's there was fallout.  It introduced a different kind of tone: a  post-apocalyptic world for you to explore.  Fallout 2 however really expanded in terms of allowing you to really explore and do whatever you want.  There is no right or wrong way to play...and if you beat the game you can still play it afterwards.  On one of my save files I was a hero who tried to do the right thing but eventually became a slave trader/runner.  I would massacre little towns and loot them because I had become so savage and primal.  I tried to redeem myself but I became addicted to Jet and my legs became permanently broken from all the drugs I injested.  I just stayed in New Reno gambling my life away and doing more Jet.  This is a classic gem!  Try it out it even if you've played Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas it does a lot of things that they tried to implement but could not really capture from the original Fallout 2.  P.S. Nothing beats punching a little kid in a town who throws rocks at you with power armor...seeing his body drag along that map brings back memories!!			"

												Its like the first game, but even better ! Now you're a tribal instead of a vault dweller, which make for some pretty damn funny discussion with npcs !You get a ton more guns, cities, sidequests and crazy adventures, you get a car too ! And you can shoot kids with a rocket launcher ! You'll get labelled as child killer though. The companions have been overhauled in this game. And you can even get dogmeat back in a speacial random encounter ! And try having a max strength character score a critical on an enemy with a sledge hammer, and prepare to laugh at how far he slides on the ground, before suddenly bleeding out.			"

												Fallout 2 defined the series. The creative force of this game led to the fallout series being what it is today. Despite a number of bugs and unfinished quest lines, the depth and intricacy afforded by this game was the gold standard of its time. For fans of the modern iterations of the series, this is a must play. For fans of isometric rpgs with turn based combat, this is a must play. And for fans of post-nuclear-apocalypse themed games this is a must play. And when you do play it, say hi to Sulik for me.			"

												This game is wonderfull. I know kids these days onbly know ""good"" games such as Call of Duty. But they are 100% wrong .Fallout 2 is full with; Action, role play, paitence, and a great storyline.I did have a few problems. 1# when i was in a battle or a random event while traveling i was 36% of the time cornerd wich is really anoying  you will imidently die.#2 The charecters intellegence LV does not effect bartering.#3Money.I understand money is supposed to be hard to get but i had to be a slaver. #This was the bigest one i can not get into vault city the 2 guys who are suposed to be in therer are not in there in the customs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But there are realy cool things too! AS AN EXAMPLE: you can control your companions,easily find more money,a great story, really good graphics,you can join groups and many more examples. If i coulg enter vault city i would give it a 9.6/10 but with that  a   8.4/10. I recomend this game to people who have paitence, stretegic values and knowledge / good logic.			"

												Let me preface this review by stating my bias for this series. I have sunk endless hours into this game, from original disk, to GOG, to here; and i've loved every second of them.That said, this game is brutal and unforgiving, like most games in that era.Go into it aware of how much you're going to have to WANT to play it.It's a lot like reading a history book written in middle english, yeah you're learning something, and some part of you is enjoying it, but damn is it taking some effort on your part.

												 Ever since fallout 2 came out... I've had it (bugs and all) for every computer I've had... It's in my mind, the best Turn-Based RPG ever made.. Everything you do, or don't do, has an impact on the ending... The action is great, the comedy takes from every sci-fi genre you can think of, It's hard, VERY hard if you set it that way... you could end up fighting aliens and deathclaws that destroy you at every turn.. And thats why it's so much dam fun!! it was random..  I personally was dissapointed with fallout 3 because it felt to me, like a carbon copy of oblivion... They could have done more with fallout 3.. And the other reason why I was dissapointed with fallout 3, because fallout 2 set the bar so high, no third game could compare...  Normally, I don't write reviews for games.. I just wanted to add my two cents on THIS game though, because it's that good!! with the patches made by fans and the high res patch.. Fallout 2 is a must buy!!			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.I recommend playing it with either Killap's Unofficial Patch or Killap's Restoration Project (includes the Patch)Killap's Patch fixes MANY of the bugs in the game.Killap's Restoration Project does everything the Patch does and more, adding most cut content in the game. If you're aiming for the best ending, you technically need this, otherwise you wont get the Vault 13 best ending due to it being cut.Pros+I really like its art style for some reason+Several times larger and content-packed than the original Fallout+Your actions have consequences (in the ending slides)Cons-Bad companion AI. Thankfully you can shove them, but you have to do this several times to get them out of the wayOther:The Restoration Project makes the beginning of the game way more difficult. However, the danger of being killed by a single gecko can be avoided by getting Sulik as a companion ASAP.Perfect choice for the ""Test of Time"" award, in my opinion.			"

I have never played this game before I bought it in 2014, so this isn't me saying this game is amazing simply from nostalgia factor, as many people are very biased when reviewing old games for that reason. Not me though. This game has very good, well, everything! You just need to get into it, perhaps get use to the somtimes annoying or cluncky combat and extreme lack of hand holding/any guidance apart from a brief description of what you need to do for a quest, and you will find one of the best games EVER! (Beware though, a lot of reading is required, most characters are not voiced, so people with short attention spams might want to reconsider, however you should still try it, like I did).So in breif is this game good; no...

If there ever was two games I would like to experience in the Fallout NV style, it would be these two. Fallout 1 & 2. Because as much as I love those games, I do understand that younger players might not even look at it for the old graphics. Which is a real shame. That said, I still can't believe that Bethesda won't put these back on GOG. Shame on them for not putting this on the very place where people actually look for old games to play.			"

It introduced a different kind of tone: a  post-apocalyptic world for you to explore.  Fallout 2 however really expanded in terms of allowing you to really explore and do whatever you want.  There is no right or wrong way to play...and if you beat the game you can still play it afterwards.  On one of my save files I was a hero who tried to do the right thing but eventually became a slave trader/runner.  I would massacre little towns and loot them because I had become so savage and primal.  I tried to redeem myself but I became addicted to Jet and my legs became permanently broken from all the drugs I injested.  I just stayed in New Reno gambling my life away and doing more Jet.  This is a classic gem!  Try it out it even if you've played Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas it does a lot of things that they tried to implement but could not really capture from the original Fallout 2.  P.S. Nothing beats punching a little kid in a town who throws rocks at you with power armor...seeing his body drag along that map brings back memories!!			"

												When the original Fallout shipped, it was hailed by many to be the savoir of computer RPGs. With its gritty story, compelling art design, and brilliant mix of old school statistical based combat and an interface easy enough for a beginner to use, the game not only pleased the hard core niche market, but also introduced the joys of role-playing to a whole new generation. Now all the company had to do was to make another one that would make everyone just as happy. With Fallout 2, the company has done just that. Despite the loss of crucial team members, economic difficulties within the company and an irritable consumer base, the development team at Black Isle Studios, Interplay's internal role-playing division, has put together a game that is everything the original was and perhaps, a bit more.Let's bring you up to date. You are the descendant of the original Vault-Dweller who wandered the plains in search of a water chip. As the game starts, you are asked to run a gauntlet that will prove you to be the Chosen One, the one worthy to wear the suit of the Vault-Dweller. Once you complete this relatively easy task, you find out what's really going down. Your village is dying. In a last ditch attempt to save the town, the elder is sending you out into the real world to find a device that has been whispered of in legends called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (or G.E.C.K.). Sent away from the only home you've ever known, armed only with a spear you must wander into a world filled with mutants, ghouls and raiders in order to save your people.			"

												If you're a huge fan of the Fallout series, take a gander at this installment...Pros:1)Multiple friendly, humorous and diverse compainions to choose from.2)For it's time, the graphics have intense messaging; you really get the sense that you're one of the few left in the wasteland.3)A challenging plethora of side quest across many towns and settlements.4)(Depending on hardware performance) Smooth and crisp tansitions between areas.5)The only true loading screen you see is at the beginning.Cons:1)Somewhat reduntant encounters and brawls amongst semi-generic enemies.2)Turn based combat leads to a back and forth, stimpack filled feud with the smallest of creatures.3)Even with the inclusion of a ""push back"" button for NPCs and companions, you'll always find yourself cramped in a large area.4) Dying isn't fun in any game; this game reinforces that statement to a broad point.5)The occasional framerate drop when entering a new area may force you to restart the game.With those points in mind, decide...to walk the wastes...or not, I guess.

												Overall great game with a great story. It can be miserable at times especially during combat hence the fact that it is turned based an very slow paced. This game and Fallout 1 have both aged terribly, but if you put that aside, they are actually fun. If you missed out on Fallout 1 and 2 adding them to your steam library will be worthwhile.I hope Bethesda remakes these two classics, so gamers today can relive the experience that gamers did during the late 90s.

The humor is on point, the turn based almost tactics style is unequaled in my mind and its story is something that I've never grown tired of.Been playing this game since the 90's and I will never tire of it.  If for any reason you don't care for it, there is a huge community of mods available.As long as you don't mind the slightly older graphics it is an absolute NEED in any collection.			"

Difficulty is somewhat rng'ish, for example you can meet very tough opponent in certain areas at start of the game but such are the wastes, harsh and unforgiving. Gameplay is a perfect mix of strategy and rpg with rng for a good measure. AI without mods is somewhat dumb, so don't get surprised if it does something wacky.Visual part is something from 1995'ish but still pretty good.Stability is kind of nice, it runs smooth and mostly stable on modern systems although not flawless (might be a few crashes here and there at certain points in the game).Overall it's a great game but not flawless. Thankfully all of the irks and kinks can be fixed by mods.If you were looking for a serious RPG with deep immersion and good story then this game is for you.			"

												The best rpg I've ever played, bar none. Usually such grand claims for old classics are attributed to the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia, except in my case I totally missedthe game when it first came out, raising my nose at the notion of turn-based rpg combat. What I fool I was! I played Fallout 2 for the first time more than 10 years after its release, long after the likes of rpgs like Diablo 2, Morrowind, Oblivion, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights. And yet Fallout 2 quickly became my favorite.pros: + Incredible atmosphere, due to a believable and very well realized post apocalyptic wasteland     made all the more powerful by the superb soundtrack.+ Robust and diverse character leveling system in which you are spoiled for choice most of the time.     Far less constricted compared to something like Neverwinter Nights.+ Satisfying and brutal combat with excellent sound and visual effects.+ Huge, but manageable world to explore with loads of interesting locations and people to interact with.+ Very good replay value, with multiple ways to complete quests, and some quests being mutually exclusive. Also,    the restoration project adds tons of content which is perfect for a 2nd playthrough.+ Fun easter eggs, of which there are quite a few.cons:- Starts slow and can be a little annoying the first hour or so while you are still dependent on your spear and ammo is sparse (unless you're going for a melee character).- Can get quite difficult.

												You start in a tribal village with the mere Quest to get a magical Item that is capable of saving your Village.What sounds like the beginning for a generic fantasy RPG leads you to a great adventure in the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout.If you enjoyed the successors of this game and don't care that much about the grafic (just remember, this game is nearly 2 decades old), it will be definitely worth a look.Just dont think it will be easy or political correct (or what do you think about reputation titles like ""Childkiller"", ""Slaver"", ""Porn Star"" or ""Grave Digger"")			"

												*Edit: came back to play Fallout 1.5 Resurrection mod:http://resurrection.cz/en/download/Original Review:If you do your search through the internet, you will find that the developers made this game just one year after Fallout “1”.But surprisingly they made a masterpiece of Role Play Game that must be played by the hardened fans of the genre. Of course you don’t need to play the first game to play Fallout 2, you will lost a bit of lore, that’s all.The game portraits a decadent, deceased, tortured and a corrupt society that emerged from the in-game apocalypse. The line between good and evil is a thin one.The worst of the human history is condensed in this game. The content, by my impressions, is recommended to 18 +.One last thing and perhaps the most useful: download the unofficial patch to correct a ton of bug and be able to play in widescreen resolution (I played in 1920x1080).Here is the link:http://killap.net/ "

If you played Fallout 3 and 4 and can't decide if the originals are worth trying, the answer is a definate yes.ProsThe best soundtrack in the new games is taken from the originals. Unlike fallout 4, these are actually roleplaying games not FPS.See how atmosphere and richness in characters and locations was acheived back in the day.consYou will need a lot more patience as it is not always instant gratification and will need to read text from a lot of NPC's.

												Fallout 2 picks up where Fallout essentially left off. More storyline, guns, smart-assness, complete with fresh combat and more tactical options with your party.Steal from kids. Lie about doing it. Then throw a rock at their face for accusing you. Groin punch a porn star after you make bank on her face. Pay another one to do your Hulkified mutant buddy. Make a few robo dogs to go with your real dog(meat)! Cruise around in a 70's style car with a nuclear engine with a big enough trunk to fit every item in the game. Pimp out your gay husband, or face ride girls as a lesbian with a sledge hammer.Drugs? There's drugs, go find the trash talking Erkel to make you a ton before you go on a huge killing spree in a nice quiet town. Then reload so you can play nice, like you totally didn't just shotgun that old lady in front of the guard 2 minutes ago. Give your big mutant buddy a minigun and watch him carelessly take out half your party. Why? Because that Mole Rat has 1HP left, that's why.Now go put on your rubber boots, skin some geckos, find Smiley, and sell your newfound tribal friend to some slavers. Then tell them where your village is and help them round up your people too!Like I said. Tactical. Options.			"

												Much broader in scope and storyline than was its predecessor. There is much more to see and do in this game. It is a true non-linear game that lets you do pretty much whatever you want. One of the first, open world games. Fallout 2 contains dozens of subtle and more often not-so-subtle references to cult movies, television icons, and other aspects of popular culture. If you value character development, old-fashioned gameplay, and a good plot, this game delivers on all counts.  Has great post-apocalyptic atmosphere, awesome turn-based combat, non-linear playthrough and a variety of gamestyles/ways to solve quests/ways to win batt;es, variety of items/guns/ammo/armor, numerous sidequests, amd memorable NPCs. However, the game suffers from a myriad of bugs in its original form, applying ""Killap's Unofficial Fallout 2 Patch"" found on killap.net removes most of the bugs and adds a bit of extra content. The game is truly worth the money.			"

YouTube™ Video: Jontron - BEST GAME. 

			Views: 488,426		

			10/10 100/100 best game, best game		

'Nuff said. Refer to my Fallout 1 review, since this is just a more enhanced version of the first one, generally. Items, skills, perks, SPECIAL points' usefulness, quests, story, all indeed enhanced.Because of that, if you are interested in the isometric fallouts and if you care about the story a lot you should probably get the first one, first, since chronological orders and all that, also if you can't afford both. If you don't care about the story or the order you play them I suppose it's best if you got 2 instead. Or Tactics. Maybe. Personally Tactics isn't as good as even the first one given I play Fallout more for the real RPG factor and not a squad simulator.Anyways, yeah, that's that. Fallout is personally my favorite franchise AND also personally I find it to be the best games ever. Therefore, using that clip would make perfect sense. Since 2 and New Vegas are the best Fallout titles to date.			"

												In case you don't want to read this here is the summary:9.5/10 - A must have game for an RPG fan.In case you are interested in my opinion:Fallout 2 is a great RPG.I recommend playing the first Fallout before it, as there is a lot of overlapping content that you can only appreciate if you have played both games. I first started with games from the 2004 onward, so picking up Fallout was a little difficult.The controls and interface proved problematic at first, but overcoming this challenge provided me with more joy and satisfaction than many ""modern""games did.If you can overcome the difficulties posed by the beforementioned things, this game offers you role-playing options that will reward you like no other ""modern"" RPG can. You just cannot create a jack of all trade character (unlike in Fallout 4) and the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is not just a gimmick (like in Fallout 4). Conversations have a lot more depth and meaning and you can totally create a character of your own and really play as that character.The game's story is nothing special (huh, get it?) it is quite good, just not Bioshock Infinite good.(it may be infair to compare a game released in 1998 to a game release 15 years later, and probably with 10 times higher budget and way longer developement time)What Black Isle Studios made is truly astonishing IMHO.With Fallout they have created a truly unique universe.With Fallout 2 they have expanded that universe and in a funny yet just as desolate way and that is why so many people love it, including myself.

												Nearly 20 years later and this remains my all-time favorite game. Its ""go anywhere you want at any time"" approach was something that most of the RPGs of its time were not doing. Sure Baldur's Gate had a big world, but it had a fairly linear path through it. Fallout 2 just set you loose to go wherever you want from the start. The more modern RPGs that share this approach (such as Bethesda's) are great, but they can't match the sheer scale that Fallout 2 had, even with almost 2 decades of advances.			"

												It may say I've only played this game for 3 hours but believe me. Before Stream I played this game till my PC had a melt down. I've purchased this game more than once as well and its been worth it each time. Everything has already been said about how great this game is so I'll just say my favourite things about this game.Replay value. As I have said that I've played this a lot. Each time I have played it the game is different. I have discovered new places and events each time I have played it. There are millions of way to approach this game. Actions has consequences. You can't just do what ever you want but in the world of Fallout 2 you can do what ever you want. But there are consequences.Anything you do. If you become a porn star there are some Pro's in it but many of the NPC will loss respect for you and make fun of you.Become a slaver? Nice money in it. But you can forget about entering half the towns in the game. Wear power armor that will stop any bullet. Get laughed at for looking like a walking refrigerator.Set off a nuclear explosion and everyone in the fallout 2 world will talk about it.If you set off a nuclear explosion in megaton in fallout 3 nobody bats an eye. Even if you go back to Megaton everyone has turned into gauls NOBODY QUESTIONS IT? What the hell kinda game is Fallout3?You're not forced into anything. Unlike in Fallout 4 where you are forced to help out NPC at the start of the game and be a good sport. There is nothing like that in fallout 2. You can be evil or nice or both. You can kill anyone in the game. even important NPC that are important.Did some little kid just steal from you? What a little♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm gonna shot him in the groin for that. Can't do that in the newer fallouts. And my favourite thing about Fallout 2 which no other game in the world comes close to this is at the very end when you complete the game you get a prologue of all the towns. Basically you get to see what you actions have done to the Fallout 2 world. Which towns have made a change. Which ones have advanced, which ones failed and died. Very satisfying to see. And it changes each time you play it. Absolutely brilliant Name 6 reasons why fallout 3,4 is better than this game? You can't. "

												There is not enough good that can be said about Fallout 2. I played it for thousands of hours growing up and will still play it again. In my opinion, it is the best game every made. It is perfectly balanced, unique, clever, heartwrenching and inspiring. It has covered every base that needs to be in a game and much more. From entirely unique units and scenarios, to challenging and satisfying turn-based combat with splashes of hilarity, Fallout 2 cannot disappoint. With hundreds of easter eggs/references to other games, shows, movies and more, any 80's-90's kid will be in heaven.The game is 18 years old and I will happily replay it against any current-day title. This is the strongest Fallout title of the series and is a must-buy for any RPG, post-apocalyptic scenario, or turn-based enthusiast.			"

												I have played only about 30 minutes of this game and I was expecting it to be cringy, but I was delightfully suprised by the depth of this game. It is a lot harder than the newer fallout games, and there is a lot more of a puzzle aspect to this game. Lets say for example you find a door, but you can't lock pick it or normally open it, so you inspect it and it says it is weak to explosives then you go looking for explosives. It is just little puzzles like that so far, but I played this game going with no sleep for about 38 hours, so I could really only play 30 minutes of it because I was so delirious. I would definietly recomend this to anybody who wants a fun game for fairly cheap, especially when it is on sale for cheap. I would give this game a 8/10 for the time that I played this, when I have more time on this game  I may make a more updated review on it.			"

Oh deary me.Starting with FO:NV any working my way down, not even FO3 could prepare me for the harshness of FO2s SPECIAL. Dont get me wrong its fun, but hard. For the first hours of playing iti sucks. You will miss damn near every shot/smack/zap you take unless you get the needed skill up to at least 80%.Which isnt that hard. Above-average intelligence means you'll get around 20-25 points per level up. Get one thing to use i.e big/small guns, melee, whatever and then it's smooth sailing			"

												After more than 70 hours, I'm finally done with this game... And what can I say about it ? I really really enjoyed it. This game DOES have an atmosphere. You really feel like you are in the wasteland, in this desert 2 centuries after the Great War that brought the end of the world.Plus it's the kind of game where your choices actually matter, and change the way you play. You sometimes will be the one to decide wether you will save a village because you're a good guy, or we will blow it up, like the city of Gecko for example. Same for Vault 13, you can decide to help or... kill the inhabitants, it's up to you.But there's one thing I can blame this game for: it is not well balanced. By this I mean you will sometimes have to face very strong ennemies (especially during random encounters) while you are still low level. But once you get the power armor, you are almost invincible because most ennemies won't even be able to hurt you.So yes, I strongly recommand Fallout 2 even if you may turn crazy because it tends to be kinda hard sometimes. But you will enjoy it because of the combat system and the atmosphere. It's light years away from Fallout 4...			"

												The quintessential post-apocalyptic CRPG, in my humble opinion. Don't take my game time fool you, I've owned the physical CD for years. It just became impractical to not have a digital copy now a days. If you liked and/or loved Fallout 1, you will very much enjoy this sequal. Gameplay wise, it follows the first; turned based combat, open world travel via world map, SPECIAL system, etc. However, the sequel gives a lot more freedom to the player with a larger world, and longer plot line that has you travel all over the place. You don't have to play the first to play the second, as it only loosely makes references to events that occured in the first game. Additionaly the dialouge takes on a more darker tone rarely found in modern RPGS, and does not shy away from letting the player do pretty much anything they want within the boundaries of the gameworld and game engine.Over the years, this game has held up extremely well in my view, and I would often find myself wanting to come back and experience it all over again. If you want to add more content to the game I highly suggest you try out MIBB's Megamod. If you wish to just have content cut from the original game restored, with a few added features, I suggest trying the Fallout 2 Restoration Project.Closing: If you love the post-apocalyptic genre and crpgs, get this game.

YouTube™ Video: Jontron - BEST GAME. 

			Views: 488,426		

			10/10 100/100 best game, best game		

'Nuff said. Refer to my Fallout 1 review, since this is just a more enhanced version of the first one, generally. Items, skills, perks, SPECIAL points' usefulness, quests, story, all indeed enhanced.Because of that, if you are interested in the isometric fallouts and if you care about the story a lot you should probably get the first one, first, since chronological orders and all that, also if you can't afford both. If you don't care about the story or the order you play them I suppose it's best if you got 2 instead. Or Tactics. Maybe. Personally Tactics isn't as good as even the first one given I play Fallout more for the real RPG factor and not a squad simulator.Anyways, yeah, that's that. Fallout is personally my favorite franchise AND also personally I find it to be the best games ever. Therefore, using that clip would make perfect sense. Since 2 and New Vegas are the best Fallout titles to date.			"

												This game is unique and, in my opinion, still holds up to this day if you get used to how it plays. No other game did I genuinely laugh out loud at a conversation that I had with an NPC, and text based, too. This game has some of the best writing you will ever see in any RPG that you have played before, and most importantly, it is addictively fun; not Fallout 4's shoot and loot fun, but more questing and talking fun. Fallout 2 is one of those unique, special games that makes you always think twice about every little decision that you make. The world is fully tailored to your actions, and you rarely decide to kill someone because it can have disasterous concequences on the story or immediate situation. Although almost all of the quests are linear, most of the endings to the quests have some form of choice that lets the outcome fall into your favour (or maybe not, which is the beauty of this game). You truly feel like you're in a post-apocalyptic world; everything in this game is HARD, difficulty wise, and brutal, atmosphere wise.So, do I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you think you have the patience to play it. Combat can be exedingly slow at some times, and the first 2 hours of the story can feel a bit more boring than the rest of the 46 hours playing the game. If you are looking for a hard, gritty game full of choices with a story tailored to you and a very rewarding ending, look no further than Fallout 2.			"

												In case you don't want to read this here is the summary:9.5/10 - A must have game for an RPG fan.In case you are interested in my opinion:Fallout 2 is a great RPG.I recommend playing the first Fallout before it, as there is a lot of overlapping content that you can only appreciate if you have played both games. I first started with games from the 2004 onward, so picking up Fallout was a little difficult.The controls and interface proved problematic at first, but overcoming this challenge provided me with more joy and satisfaction than many ""modern""games did.If you can overcome the difficulties posed by the beforementioned things, this game offers you role-playing options that will reward you like no other ""modern"" RPG can. You just cannot create a jack of all trade character (unlike in Fallout 4) and the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system is not just a gimmick (like in Fallout 4). Conversations have a lot more depth and meaning and you can totally create a character of your own and really play as that character.The game's story is nothing special (huh, get it?) it is quite good, just not Bioshock Infinite good.(it may be infair to compare a game released in 1998 to a game release 15 years later, and probably with 10 times higher budget and way longer developement time)What Black Isle Studios made is truly astonishing IMHO.With Fallout they have created a truly unique universe.With Fallout 2 they have expanded that universe and in a funny yet just as desolate way and that is why so many people love it, including myself.

												My test of time nomination was a no brainer for me. I don't know how many copies of this game I've collected over the years, physical and digital. I've picked it up again here purely so I can gush about it.The best RPG's, I find, are the ones where the story shapes the character as you play, and vice versa. Not unlike a tabletop RPG, where a good DM can contextualise and personalise the game as it goes. I love it when I go in with a vague idea, maybe thinking about certain skills to focus in, and the further I go the more personality they come to have, developed all on their own, unexpected and unplanned. Before long dialogue choices become easy, because that's what the character would say. This is one of the earliest and best examples of games I've played that have enabled this experience for me.Also, the fact I could flirt with female characters while playing a female character, and even marry one (joke though it was) blew my tiny teenage lesbian mind.

												There is not enough good that can be said about Fallout 2. I played it for thousands of hours growing up and will still play it again. In my opinion, it is the best game every made. It is perfectly balanced, unique, clever, heartwrenching and inspiring. It has covered every base that needs to be in a game and much more. From entirely unique units and scenarios, to challenging and satisfying turn-based combat with splashes of hilarity, Fallout 2 cannot disappoint. With hundreds of easter eggs/references to other games, shows, movies and more, any 80's-90's kid will be in heaven.The game is 18 years old and I will happily replay it against any current-day title. This is the strongest Fallout title of the series and is a must-buy for any RPG, post-apocalyptic scenario, or turn-based enthusiast.			"

												Fallout Two is a extraordinary game. I will try to express the game. Two dimensional computer game that is ahead of it's time. You can give your character attributes classified as S.P.E.C.I.A.Lthat stands for strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. You also have another system that allows you to choice and upgrade your skills. If you kill enemies or do what your skill is made for you can get experience and change level. For example lock pick could be upgraded by trying to lock pick something and exceeding. Books can also give you experience and new found knowledge when you read them. You can get perks and traits by acting a certain way or doing a certain thing. The world is a unstable environment with radiation and enemies. You are the chosen one follow your path down the heroic side or evil side. This is a great game ten out of ten a really great game!			"

												Fallout 3 but hard, harder than me thinking about the enclave.Droops:Again its hard even on easy with wimpy combat, I'm not kidding don't play a hero!Klamath is an extreme noob trap, but all of the game is, and you may end several playthroughs there.Ups:God bless the Enclave, God bless America.Enclave!What do you want, other than the enclave its a mean port of the first.  Don't worry, (whispers) the Enclaves worth the price. "

												Pure, un-adutarated RPG. If you want to experience the original Fallout- this is it. The first one isnt bad. But this is the one that feels more fleshed out and gives you some real freedom.It really feels like the developers didn't hold back any of their ideas and weren't held back by production companies worrying about age ratings and maximizing their target audience.

Its because i have played that so many times so thats why i went with a older fallout and im enjoying it so far. And i saved £4.00 in the monster sale and got it for £4.00. I would recommend this game to anyone to who is a fallout fanboy like myself but if your new to fallout i would recommend to buy Fallout 1 first before to get a feel of the game but fallout 2 has better gameplay more weapons a new map etc.			"

												Second installement of the classic collection.The gameplay has not changed and is still the same turn-based style like all 3. There are some improvements with the inventory system, you can finally ""take all"" instead of dragging and dropping each item to your inventory side. There are more weapons, items, enemies and areas of the map to explore which is a plus!The only problem I had were some quest bugs that made them impossible to complete, they'd automatically fail you even though you'd ""complete"" them which makes it a pain if you want to be a completionist...Other than the few bugs that can break the game's quests, this game is still a classic and always fun to pick up and play if you enjoyed the previous title.

												To this very day Fallout 2 is one of the best games that I've ever laid hands on. I played it back in school for hundreds of hours and now that you can get it on Steam, I just had to buy it once more. Its graphics might seem quite outdated, but if you're not too much of a superficial gamer, you should be able to deal with it.What makes this game so incredibly beautiful is the developers' love for details and a really convincing atmosphere. You get thrown into a post-apocalyptic world full of glorious black humour, knowing only little about your actual main quest. There is barely any hand-holding, which modern RPGs do all too much. In Fallout 2 there are no quest markers, only hints. To solve your missions, you have to listen to what NPCs tell you, instead of clicking right through dialogues, following a pointer on your minimap and shooting a few bandits in the face. As most things in Fallout 2 can be done in a variety of ways, you can solve problems by talking, violence, in favor of your own interests or to help a certain person or faction. And the outcome will always be entirely different. You decide everything.On your way through the radioactive desert of the American West Coast you will discover tons of secrets, interesting characters, quests and enthralling side stories. Considering its release date, the game's actually huge. I've played Fallout an infinite number of times, but so far I always managed to discover something new - be it a secret area, a new way to solve a certain quest or just another crazy NPC.As if this wasn't enough cool things to know about Fallout 2 already, there's even more. For example Fallout's unique character creation system. Your avatar will have a truckload of skills, talents, perks and attributes, which have a direct influence on the gameplay and everything else. You want to conquer the wasteland as a highly intelligent scientist and sweet-talker instead of being a violent brute? Want to be a sniper instead of chopping your enemies with a chainsaw knife? Well, just give it a shot. No two playthroughs will ever be the same.I could go on and worship this game for another 20 minutes, but I think, if you're not convinced by now, you won't ever be. However, if you're into oldschool RPGS, buy this game and experience one of the most superior titles in video gaming history. Period.			"

This game has you make important decisions which ultimately impact the game and what unfolds next. There is plenty to do and you get the run of the map - free to go where you choose and what you choose to do, iconic cities and the humour is just classic!

												*Edit: came back to play Fallout 1.5 Resurrection mod:http://resurrection.cz/en/download/Original Review:If you do your search through the internet, you will find that the developers made this game just one year after Fallout “1”.But surprisingly they made a masterpiece of Role Play Game that must be played by the hardened fans of the genre. Of course you don’t need to play the first game to play Fallout 2, you will lost a bit of lore, that’s all.The game portraits a decadent, deceased, tortured and a corrupt society that emerged from the in-game apocalypse. The line between good and evil is a thin one.The worst of the human history is condensed in this game. The content, by my impressions, is recommended to 18 +.One last thing and perhaps the most useful: download the unofficial patch to correct a ton of bug and be able to play in widescreen resolution (I played in 1920x1080).Here is the link:http://killap.net/ "

												At the very beginning, I had a hard time getting used to the gameplay. Older, openworld games are not something I've played a lot of. (I shy away from largely nonlinear games in general) Despite my overwhleming rejection of the first part of this game, the moment the ""tutorial"" (if you can call it that) was over I could not put it down. I'm sitting here at 3:30am writing this review and all I've done today is play this game. It's all I've done for the past THREE days. I honestly don't think I've ever been so thouroghly addicted to a game before. It's tense, humurous, intriguing. Also, I chose brains over brawn (Chista) and all of the dialouge choices and sneaky ways to solve things that come with it are really fun to explore and exploit. It didn't feel just like a list of choices or a puzzel on how to chose the right dialouge choice, it was more a question of how what sort of person you wanted to be and added to how you wanted to aproach a variety of groups and people. Fallout 2 has opened my eyes to a new genre of gaming and I highly suggest it to both those who know and love this style of game and those who are a bit iffy about it.Also, don't give up until the ""tutorial"" stage is over!

I inquire about the these baths, then the lady who call herself 'big nose ma(or mo can't rember)' tells me that the baths were not the baths and that there were ladys only. at this moment in the back ground I see a person wailing there arms and runing into a bathroom. I pay for a minium 'bath' the screen goes black. A new lady says something about never doing that before looking around I see a bed with stairs next to it I talk to the lady she says that shes dried up meat. I walk out and got to the the diffrent looking room I check the bed apperntly ♥♥♥♥ was on it. 10/10 I would unknowingly pay for a prositute again>.			"

												The very best part about this game in my opinion and it was really innovative on the developers part may I say, the uncanny ability of my companions aim. In fact I still believe that your companions were working for the Enclave the entire time, that's why they blew my stomach out every chance they got! Even my shotgun wedding wife killed me! The moment my character left Arroyo, an epic tale of debauchery and back stabbing began, but in the end my character won. So to those that think about companions as useful... Your wrong... Dead wrong.			"

So yea, it's pretty good. There's also a car that helps you move around the wastlenad MUCH faster, but it requires Microfsion cells or small energy cells to run, which kinda sucks if you get the car early on. But it IS probably an end game kinda thing so it doesn't really matter.			"

												Just a game is old, doesn't mean its bad.In the beginning it feels like a fallout, the whole intro and everything, and to all the people who havent played a old fallout game IT IS NOT LIKE FALLOUT 3 OR NEW VEGAS!!! But that is a good thing, a whole new experience. In fact, I like this game just as much as fallout 3, and if you dont know Ive played that game for 700 hours on my ps3 which is filled with crashes, so you can imagine how much rave over fallout 3. Anyways its a point and click game that will agrivate you in the beginning because you wont know what the hell youre doing, then when you start to get it the game becomes just as addictive as jet. I never thought id be able to play a mouse only game for 4 hours straight without feeling bored. This game is a steal for 10$ and if youre tired of FPS games or just dying for FO4 then buy this game.			"

												Look, I'll be honest this game is definitly not for everyone. It has a steep learning curve, no waypoints to tell you where to go, and no ♥♥♥♥ing autosaves. Jesus Christ I had to restart atleast five different times because I forgot to save. However this game can also be one of the most immersive and enjoyable RPG experiences you will ever encounter if you let it. I made three characters who played basicly the same (Mr. Generic man who always did the ""right thing"" and shot guns) and got three distinct ending. This game is great at making sure your actions matter, like in this one quest where you have to find this drunken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ somewhere in the wastes within 30 days or one group of survivors will be slaughtered. Also the companions, they were a true step up from the companions of fallout 1 and in some ways better than the ones in the more modern Fallout titles by Bethesda Softworks. Most were fully voice acted with few exceptions, and they were really believable and it in many cases it was very emotional when they died. It also presented you with a tough choice of wether to continue on with your adventure and know they will never come back or reload an earlier save to prevent this frome happening but lose your progress and maybe some sweet gear in the process. Now if you do consider getting this game I strongly recomend getting the Killapp Fallout 2 restoration project. This fixes most of the bugs and glitches with this game and also adds stuff that was intended to be in the game but was never added because it was rushed. The instalation is quite simple, and is fully explained on his website. Now it should be stated that you do not need to play the first game to understand what is going on partially because this game takes place 80 years after the first one and the events of the first game are explained well enough in the begining of the game.

												So, I was kind of uneasy about this game at first. most of you out there might be here because of the bethesda games, some for a wastelandish RPG. Whatever the case is, this game is great. so far in fo2 I:vaporized, blew up, bribed, stole from, persuaded and tricked hundreds of men, mutants, and other creatures.Punched one of the thousands of Klammath's annoying, scrawny and annoying children. i soon regretted my decision as aa hundred more came to aid the first kid and beat me to death. Visited New Reno, where I did some illegal♥♥♥♥♥♥like jet, phsycho, Mrs. Bishop, Mrs. bishop's daughter. Became a pornstar after becoming a chapion boxer. for the first time in any (modless) fallout game had a deathclaw and cyber dog as followers.... WHO TALK.also enlisted the help of Cassidy (yup new vegas fans, The father of everyone's favorite whiskey addict.) and Marcus, who, was a great npc in fallout NV, became the murderer of my followers and reason for loading previous saves. This game also, has a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of easter eggs including (but not limited to.) Star trek, Monty python, fallout 1 and  The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. such an amazing game but be warned.  The mutated toe doesn't kill Frank Horrigan, the end boss with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stats and a♥♥♥♥♥♥eating minigun  also, the combat is much more deadly as you can't just spam stimpacks in the mille of battle by bringing up your pipboy. be mindful of the AP costs and you should do fine. I could go on about this game but.... ♥♥♥♥ that I'm too lazy. so go steal your parent's credit card, download this game and play one of the greatest fallout games ever made. wether it be for holding back the fo4 craving, a desire for old RPG's or to have this game for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles fallout 2 is one of my favorite RPGs I've ever played.

Difficulty is somewhat rng'ish, for example you can meet very tough opponent in certain areas at start of the game but such are the wastes, harsh and unforgiving. Gameplay is a perfect mix of strategy and rpg with rng for a good measure. AI without mods is somewhat dumb, so don't get surprised if it does something wacky.Visual part is something from 1995'ish but still pretty good.Stability is kind of nice, it runs smooth and mostly stable on modern systems although not flawless (might be a few crashes here and there at certain points in the game).Overall it's a great game but not flawless. Thankfully all of the irks and kinks can be fixed by mods.If you were looking for a serious RPG with deep immersion and good story then this game is for you.			"

I bought it on Steam after owning it on CD since 1998 just so I could continue my 18-year-running annual tradition of installing it, starting 20+ character builds before settling on one I liked, then beating the game after 100 or so hours per play-through. Some people have DOTA2, I have Fallout 2. And I always will. Buy this game.			"

												Fallout 2 is the epitome of cRPG's. D&D dice roll mechanics, turn-based combat and skill sheets. A must have for any fan of classic D20 rules and game mechanics.			"

												Game as old as time from the era when games were still made decently and well (well not the 1.0 version, but you catch my drift). Still one of the best games I've ever played. If you like rpgs then this is a must play. 10/10 would (and will) play again.			"

												Still the best in the series. Truly a classic of the RPG genre offering COMPLETE freedom to do what you want. You can skip the story, you can skip the main quests, you can murder entire settlements, dogs, children and all. You can save the world or destroy it piece by piece.Easily one of the top 5 RPGs of all time for me.			"

												It has everything you would want in a role playing game :- rich background- detailed character creation- nonlinear story- countless combinations to resolve quests- enough rng to make turn-based combat fun- combat is optional- dialogue is optionalYou can simply enjoy creating different characters and stories for a decade or two without being too frustraded by other games limitations. Fallout 1, Arcanum and Planescape Torment will do the rest.			"

												Hau! I tried to beat this game when I was studying in a high school, and after more then 10 years I beat Fallout 2!The game is very well thought, and I still have a lot of new ideas for next characters. The design might look quite pale, but this is just a part of atmosphere. This is one of my favorite rpg games .			"

												 I got into the first town I see a 'bath house,' I go into this 'Bath House'. I inquire about the these baths, then the lady who call herself 'big nose ma(or mo can't rember)' tells me that the baths were not the baths and that there were ladys only. at this moment in the back ground I see a person wailing there arms and runing into a bathroom. I pay for a minium 'bath' the screen goes black. A new lady says something about never doing that before looking around I see a bed with stairs next to it I talk to the lady she says that shes dried up meat. I walk out and got to the the diffrent looking room I check the bed apperntly ♥♥♥♥ was on it. 10/10 I would unknowingly pay for a prositute again>.			"

												At the very beginning, I had a hard time getting used to the gameplay. Older, openworld games are not something I've played a lot of. (I shy away from largely nonlinear games in general) Despite my overwhleming rejection of the first part of this game, the moment the ""tutorial"" (if you can call it that) was over I could not put it down. I'm sitting here at 3:30am writing this review and all I've done today is play this game. It's all I've done for the past THREE days. I honestly don't think I've ever been so thouroghly addicted to a game before. It's tense, humurous, intriguing. Also, I chose brains over brawn (Chista) and all of the dialouge choices and sneaky ways to solve things that come with it are really fun to explore and exploit. It didn't feel just like a list of choices or a puzzel on how to chose the right dialouge choice, it was more a question of how what sort of person you wanted to be and added to how you wanted to aproach a variety of groups and people. Fallout 2 has opened my eyes to a new genre of gaming and I highly suggest it to both those who know and love this style of game and those who are a bit iffy about it.Also, don't give up until the ""tutorial"" stage is over!

												My test of time nomination was a no brainer for me. I don't know how many copies of this game I've collected over the years, physical and digital. I've picked it up again here purely so I can gush about it.The best RPG's, I find, are the ones where the story shapes the character as you play, and vice versa. Not unlike a tabletop RPG, where a good DM can contextualise and personalise the game as it goes. I love it when I go in with a vague idea, maybe thinking about certain skills to focus in, and the further I go the more personality they come to have, developed all on their own, unexpected and unplanned. Before long dialogue choices become easy, because that's what the character would say. This is one of the earliest and best examples of games I've played that have enabled this experience for me.Also, the fact I could flirt with female characters while playing a female character, and even marry one (joke though it was) blew my tiny teenage lesbian mind.

												The quintessential post-apocalyptic CRPG, in my humble opinion. Don't take my game time fool you, I've owned the physical CD for years. It just became impractical to not have a digital copy now a days. If you liked and/or loved Fallout 1, you will very much enjoy this sequal. Gameplay wise, it follows the first; turned based combat, open world travel via world map, SPECIAL system, etc. However, the sequel gives a lot more freedom to the player with a larger world, and longer plot line that has you travel all over the place. You don't have to play the first to play the second, as it only loosely makes references to events that occured in the first game. Additionaly the dialouge takes on a more darker tone rarely found in modern RPGS, and does not shy away from letting the player do pretty much anything they want within the boundaries of the gameworld and game engine.Over the years, this game has held up extremely well in my view, and I would often find myself wanting to come back and experience it all over again. If you want to add more content to the game I highly suggest you try out MIBB's Megamod. If you wish to just have content cut from the original game restored, with a few added features, I suggest trying the Fallout 2 Restoration Project.Closing: If you love the post-apocalyptic genre and crpgs, get this game.
