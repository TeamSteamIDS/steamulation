												I enjoyed Costume Quest quite a bit, until I reached a game-breaking bug, two hours in. More on that in a bit.Costume Quest is a streamlined RPG. It's a fun game, but not particularly difficult. The combat is a simplistic timing game, and the quests have a way of fulfilling themselves as you wander around the map. But that's OK, because Costume Quest doesn't present itself as a serious RPG.I's a breezy, light RPG with a sense of humor, that begs to be played straight through in a sitting. Truely, it's an RPG/Platformer hybrid, in that there are environmental puzzles that must be worked out to advance the map and the story. It's a mix that works....until you come to the Autumn Haven shopping mall. There's a game-breaking bug in the camping equipment store: If you walk between the sleeping bag and the tent, your companion will follow you into that wedge, and block you in. None of your special skills will get you out of this position. If this happens to you, don't exit to the menu! Crash the game manually, so it doesn't have a chance to autosave your position. If it saves your position, you'll be stuck there when you start again, and you'll have to start over from the beginning of the game. Seriously. Check the Steam forums, I'm not the only one with this problem.So, yes. I like Costume Quest, and I think you will, too. I want to complete this game, but I don't want to replay the first two hours again. I give Costume Quest a thumbs up, but be careful in the mall so you don't lose your game like I did.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Costume Quest Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Casual; Adventure; Lighthearted    My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Casual gamersREVIEWCostume Quest has a lot of good things going on for it.  The game takes you on a journey of the imagination as some children’s quest for candy on one Halloween night quickly turns into something much more.  Ultimately, this game is just very well done and has a “soul” that should easily appeal to a vast audience.The level design is charming and exploring the maps is fun.  The whole concept of “trick-or-treating” being a fundamental part of the gameplay is brilliantly done.  The story is basically one giant trope, but the way it is told is delightful.  The characters are likeable and the humor is clean but entertaining.  Even the style in which you warp into old-school, turn-based battles is executed well and synergizes perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.  This game is a quintessential example of how several good things can work together to create something great.    As I alluded to, one of the most charming aspects of Costume Quest is the way “trick-or-treating” in the game world is a central part of progressing the game.  You knock on doors and are either given candy (treat) or have to fight a battle (trick).  This leads to another splendidly charming feature of the game, which I also alluded to earlier: the battle warp-ins.  Depending on what costumes your characters are wearing, they change from little kids into various gallant warriors with nothing but the power of their imagination.  From there, the battles play out in the old-school, turn-based RPG style that was prevalent in the 90s.Aside from that, you may also want to explore the levels, find secret areas, meet characters, and do side-quests and mini-games to gather more candy and collect the trading cards.  There is plenty to do!Costume Quest is a charming little game that makes for quite an enjoyable experience.  As I said, I feel it can appeal to a wide audience.  I would posit: if it sounds like the type of game you may enjoy, it will probably be a specific game you do enjoy… if you decide to get it.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Really cute and fun little game. It‘s pretty short as rpg, but you‘ll have a fun time playing it. It‘s simple and pretty easy. You play as the kids, form your party and collect candies and costume parts made of cardborad. When the fight starts you‘re being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesn‘t need to be different. Seriously go and buy it, it‘s really really good game i promise you will fall in love with this little cute gem :)			"

In short, is the game good?Yes, the game is really good.Is it worth my time and money?Depends. While the game is very fun to play, it is kind of short. You can breeze through the main game in about 4 hours. The add-on story is about 2 hours. I'd suggest waiting for at least a small price drop or sale.Is this game for anyone?Yes. The game doesn't require any specific gaming skills and can be enjoyed by anyone.Linear, open-world or something else?While the world of Costume Quest is technically open-world (that is, you are not restricted to a ""rail"", moving from A to B), the world itself is so small, it still forces the player to simply move on when the player finishes up quests in the area.Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?It's basically Halloween meets Final Fantasy meets Persona meets Super Mario RPG meets Tim Schafer. It sounds weird on paper but it works. When in battle, your Halloween costume changes into the real thing (i.e. a cardboard robot costume changes into a real giant mecha). Additionally, each costume grants the person wearing it special attacks. Battles are turn-based, which are usually pretty slow-paced, but thanks to pretty good animation design, attack animations are fast, fluid, and don't leave the player bored while waiting for the enemy attacks to end.Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?Even though the world in Costume Quest is pretty small, it is crafted with much attention to detail. The cartoony look only adds charm to the whole aesthetic.Audio design and soundtrack?Audio design is impressive. The soundtrack consists of generic Halloween-ish songs but with a few twists. Sometimes the music will actually take a sinister turn, bringing forth really creepy humming, drones, etc. A nice touch that hits the player off-guard.Plot, story?Brother and sister go trick-or-treating. One of them gets kidnapped. Sounds generic? It isn't - that's all I can say without spoilers.How does the game run?Runs perfectly fine on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM). No stuttering, no framerate issues, everything turned on except for SSAO (which is known to be a resource hog on older machines).Any details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?The costumes in battle form and their special attacks. No other game will let you have a yeti, a giant black cat and the Statue of Liberty as your party. Anything you didn't like?Yes, a few things. The music in the add-on story is of lower quality for some reason. The Battle Stamp system could be a bit more complex. Finally, the static camera can be annoying at times (especially in the early part of the game where you're navigating through suburbs). Final score?I give Costume Quest a coffin with candy in it out of 5. "

												Costume Quest is a cute, creative, charming, simple to play, easy to master RPG set in Halloween. There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.Speaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.In battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.The combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.When the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.The enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.When you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.You can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.When party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.Every battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.On the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.Every costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.In all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.			"

												Yet again Double Fine surprises me and yet again they manage to make another rather unique and great game. Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween. You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes. Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat. The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle. There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn. You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest. Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny. Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining. In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say. You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this. Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game.			"

												Costume Quest is a simple but well put together party based RPG game. You play the role of a child who is obsessed with halloween, and spends the night going around the neighborhood trick or treating to get his candy. At the beginning of the game, your twin sister is kidnapped and you embark on your journey to rescue her. Along the way you make friends with other trick or treaters who join your party. While you are walking around the world, you are able to pick up extra candy, talk to the residents of the town and start battles with the bad guys. The combat system in Costume Quest is turn based, each of your characters will have their own costume which all have different powers. The combat is also primarily quick time events, which is normally not something I am a fan of, but it works quite well here. The graphics are nothing special, but they do look pleasing and the cartoon style is something which fits the story and setting nicely. Sadly the audio in Costume Quest lets it down, there isn't any voice acting, and very little sound effects when you are walking around the world.The game is set across four different levels, each of them has their own theme and style, with lots of different items and hidden locations to find in each of the levels, they feel plumped out and interesting to explore. I didn't find there to be any difficulty, you can complete the game without being beaten once, so maybe a New Game+ mode would of fixed that. I'm not sure why Steam has counted me having sixteen hours, as the game took me about five hours to complete along with the majority of all the side missions and achievements. I only really ran into one technical issue, and that was frame rate, the Steam in game counter shows it running at 30 fps while walking around the world, while in the combat phases, this jumps up to 60 fps. I noticed some screen tearing with v-sync off, but this also may be an issue with my rig (I don't think it is considering the specs I run), but it was nothing major. I can recommend Costume Quest, because I had a really good time playing, and it has a different take on the party based games, and for the full price of £6,99, you can't go wrong with the amount of content that is included. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Overall: Costume Quest is a cute and adorable game about the complicated relationship siblings have with each other, set against the backdrop of one of my favorite holidays: Halloween. While the battles in the game tend to become tiresome at some point, the game is short enough (both stories) to not become overbearing. The game doesn't try to be more than it is, and is definitely worth the playthrough. Recommendation is to get it on sale as it's been bundled several times. However, if you're in a position to pay full price, please do as the devs deserve it. Rating: 9/10 - Details belowStory: In my opinion the story was absolutely fantastic. Humor was there and though I'm not a twin, I do have a younger sister and I appreciated the sibling rivalry though I'm ancient these days. Though the main idea is to rescue someone, and though that's not very original in stories these days, it was a well told story that kept me very entertained. Further, it allowed me to revisit the child inside me and remember that power of imagination and what can be accomplished and believed in. Graphics: Though I'm not a huge fan of cel style animation, I was extremely pleased with this medium with this game. Too many details would have ruined the power of the children's imagination and the softer non-detailed aspect of cel animation felt like it lent power to the story rather than taking away from it. Controls: Simple and easy. No issues there. - NOTE: I used an Xbox One controller.Sounds & Music: All basically well done. I didn't play with other music and felt like it complimented the game rather well.Gameplay: One tiny issue was that the battles started to feel like they were more of jumping through hoops than accomplishing anything worthwhile. However, this probably has more to do with my lack of patience for grinding/leveling in games in general as I get older. Honestly, the game didn't drag at all really, and without the unknown of what knocking on the door would do, the game would lose part of the ""Trick"" aspect so essential to Halloween. Only real complaint is that I couldn't advance the text faster during dialogue and was forced to sit and wait though I'd completed reading the sentence. Nor could I pause the dialogue if something came up. Final Notes: Forcing me to read at one speed as I read fast, is something that definitely will annoy me. That being said, it's a very solid game that is worth the time and energy if you enjoy Halloween, sibling rivalry and the imagination of children. If you can afford to pay full price and want to support a good game, do so.			"

												In the glorious words of the immortal Ernest P. Worrell I bring you these words of advice.. ""Pretty soon the kids won't have to worry about eating their Brussel sprouts because the Brussel sprouts will be eating them.""Exchange the word Brussel sprouts with candy corn and you'll understand the game of Costume quest, a cute Halloween themed adventure game from the wonderful team at Double Fine entertainment.  The same group responsible for such classics as Psychonauts and Brutal Legend (Jack Black playing a rock and roll roadie.... YES PLEASE)  In this game you play as Reynold and Wren a pair of twins who have recently moved to a new neighborhood, it's Halloween night and they are planning on going trick or treating.   After selecting which sibling you want to control, either Wren, the 10 minute older sister or Reynold the 10 pound heavier member of the dynamite duo, you are shipped off into the world.  The selected sibling gets a Robot custom, the other gets dressed as a piece of Candy Corn..  Social norms be damned if you pick the female character..  who says females aren't into Robots :-D  certainly not me.  (It was here where the first bit of disbelief struck me, the parents allowed their twin children to leave the house unaccompanied to go trick or treating in a new neighborhood.  These are two children who appear to be 8 - 9 years old, wandering the streets of a new neighborhood on Halloween night which is a night when child predators are normally tremendously on the prowl looking for victims.  Furthermore, after the sibling you didn't pick gets literally kidnapped, instead of running home, or screaming for help  or literally anything we've been teaching children to do for the last 30 years, they decide to go on a crazy adventure to find the sister to avoid punishment.  Just a quick note, a police officer is literally a twenty or thirty feet away away from the abduction site...)  soap box offAfter trick or treating at the first house, the pair try a second, only this time the candy corn gets abducted by a candy stealing grubbin monster...  OH MY!!!..   So off we go on an adventure to rescue our sister/brother from the clutches of a nasty candy stealing evil corporation, I'm talking a really dirty nasty organization we haven't seen in video games since Umbrella corporation..   Along the way to rescue your sibling you meet new friends, discover a sinister plot to steal candy, and defeat some monsters making for an amazing Halloween adventure which can be enjoyed at any time of year. The Story I pretty much described the story above, siblings, candy, stealing, adventure.  The story takes place in three locations, Auburn Pines, which is the starting neighborhood, Autumn Haven Mall (easy enough it's a Mall), and Fall Valley carnival, each area offers up the chance to explore, trick or treat, bob for candy apples, defeat monsters and oh yeah... get that sweet, sweet candy baby.. nuff said!!! The Gameplay The first aspect the gamer is introduced to is trick or treating, which is just as it sounds, you go up to a house, knock on the door and wait for a trick (battle) or a trick (candy)  It's as simplistic as that.  Knocking on doors isn't the only way to collect candy, numerous interactive objects in the environment such as mailboxes, trashcans, shrubs, etc etc etc, can be pounded on by your candy pail in an attempt to wriggle loose a few extra pieces of candy, also numerous areas have candy thrown about on the ground...  I personally wouldn't pick up candy off the ground and eat it, but hey whatever floats my characters boat.  The game features three types of collectibles, the first is Costumes, you start with the Robot costume, and soon after acquire a knight outfit, others you can collect are the statue of liberty, a unicorn, french fries and many more.  Many of the costumes have two special benefits, the first being an extra ability you can use while out of combat, like the Robot which can travel faster, or the Knight, that can shield from falling items.  The second ability is a special battle ability, whether it's rockets, a shield of protection or a powerful group heal.  The second type of collectible in the game are battle cards, these cards can be used to further enhance your character, give them additional HP, defense, a stun, etc etc etc, you can buy the cards from Sadie using the candy you collect during your adventure.  With each new area, additional cards are added for you to buy, the new cards offer upgrades over the older cards.  These are very useful in helping to gain the advantage in your battles to come.  The final collectibles are called treat cards, these resemble trading cards, they really serve no purpose, outside of being necessary to complete a few quest and unlocking a costume for collecting all of them.   You gain treat cards by defeating enemies and completing quest.The Combat The combat in Costume Quest is rather unique, upon starting the battle your given one option to select basic attack (unless you have a battle card which gives you a secondary option like a stun)  after selecting that option you're taken into a quick time event.  If you succeed in the quicktime event your character does extra damage, if you fail, your character does quite a bit less damage.  During the enemy phase of combat, when an enemy attacks one of your characters, you're given another quick time event, if you are successful you defend some of the damage and minimize the damage you receive, if you fail the quick time event the enemy a significant amount of extra damage.Special ability's   -  those special abilities each costume has I mentioned above are useful here, after three combat turns each of your character unlocks their costumes special ability, this can be anything from from protection, heals, massive damage to a single or all enemies.  It's a good idea to mix and match your party to ensure you have all your bases covered in terms of combat, defense and healing.  A good defense is a good offense makes sense in this case.  It's especially important to include some type of healing for your party, as no healing exist outside of special ability or battle cards.  The combat sounds simplistic and it is, but the quick time events keep the gamer engaged and on their seat with each successive battle, letting your guard down can and probably will result in you suffering a defeat. Pro's Good story,interesting charactersunique combat systemvery fun to playeasy to 100% if you're into achievementscontroller support Con's Can be a bit too easy with the right combination of costumes/battle cardsSlightly repetitive enemiesoccasionally controls can glitch out Recommendation I'd highly recommend this game, on paper it looks rather simplistic, it seems to have many strikes against it from a gamer's perspective prior to even installing it, but trust me on this one, once you start playing and get into the story you'll be thoroughly entertained as I was.  A fun game to play and enjoy, once you start to play you'll want to keep playing until you finish the the story.  It can be a bit difficult to get into, especially when you realize you'll be playing with children as characters, but that's part of the charm, a person of any age can kick back and enjoy the thrills and exciting of going trick or treating once again..  (without having your neighbors call you a cheapskate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to collect candy from them)  I'd really suggest taking the plunge, buying the game, collecting the candy and saving Halloween for children and adults all across the world..

												Costume Quest is a fun little RPG from the folks at Double Fine. You play as one of two suburbanite siblings (brother or sister) on a quest to save the other from monsters on Halloween, but the only way to do that is by trick or treating, getting candy, and crafting more costumes, naturally. From start to finish, this game does a great job in recreating the wonder and excitement of Halloween that we all remember from when we were little. You're not in costume as a robot, you ARE a robot. Each costume transforms the character into what the costume represents when you enter combat, a brilliant idea that makes you feel like your imagination is making it happen, as it did as kids. Each costume gives you different stats, 1 special move in combat, and some also have special abilites on the world map that you need to use to progress in a puzzle like way, though I am disappointed that the different costumes look the same regardless of which party member is wearing them.This game oozes personality with its fantastic writing and entertaining characters. It creates a fun world that is both whimsical and believable and for that, Double Fine deserves a lot of credit. The game consists or 3 zones (for the normal game and 1 additional zone for the expansion Grubbins on Ice) that are each varied, noticeably distinct and very well realized. You start in the most familiar of places and gradually move to the more fantastic. The further you progress gives a feeling of going deeper down the rabbit hole. It's an adventure that, once finished, leaves you glad you made the journey.This game is not perfect though. As with most turn based RPGs, the combat can get repetitive, and the system is rather shallow. There are only 3 choices in combat, basic attack, special move, and stamp attack. The special move is only available every 3rd turn and the stamp attack only exists if you have an ability stamp equipped so most of the time you will be using basic attack and each costume only has one animation for each battle option. Though combat incorporating timed button presses to strike harder or deflect some of an attack aids in keeping the player focused. Those same presses lead to another complaint: the default keyboard mapping is a bit strange and even movement felt a bit clunky on the keyboard; once I switched to an XBox 360 controller, the controls felt great and much more natural.Another minor complaint is that sometimes the text goes by too fast (automatically) and you may miss a line here or there, which can be disappointing as the writing is a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable, but that's just a nitpick.Also I wish the game were a bit longer, I managed to 100% complete the game in around 7 and a half hours. I wouldn't say the length is a con, more that I enjoyed playing and hated for it to end.Overall: A great game with a great story, writing and atmosphere. It manages to accomplish exactly what it sets out to do. Could some things have been a bit better? Sure, but that can be said about most games out there. I'd give it 8.5/10			"

												NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit  Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]Costume Quest is a Halloween-themed, turn-based RPG developed by Tim Schafer’s crew at Double Fine Productions. For those who don’t know, Tim Schafer is the mastermind behind critically acclaimed (but not necessarily financially successful) games such as Psychonauts, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle and more recently, Broken Age. In many ways, I feel that Tim Schafer is the Tim Burton of video games. Whilst not all of his games (or in Burton’s case, movies) are necessarily fantastic, all of them share a common, whimsical and imaginative style with a quirky sense of humour. Therefore, going in, I had big expectations going into this game. Needless to say, given the big red thumbs down above this review, these expectations weren’t quite met.Story:The game takes place on Halloween, where you (the character that you pick) and your sister/brother (the character that you didn’t pick) go out trick-or-treating, only to have your sibling kidnapped by strange monsters. You effectively spend the rest of the game in an attempt to rescue said sibling. There are three major locations to explore, including your initial suburb, a mall and … another suburb with a fair. Simple, straightforward, and not a whole lot more to say than that. Gameplay:As previously stated, Costume Quest is largely a turn-based RPG. Unlike many other turn-based RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, battles are not random encounters. Instead, they are generally triggered by either knocking on doors (“trick or treating”) or walking into a wandering enemy. A large majority of the enemies that you face in the game are compulsory, as you are required to “trick or treat” every house in each area in order to move to the next area.The “class system” in the game is determined by the costume that each character is wearing. Each costume has a normal attack (which to my knowledge is the same regardless of which costume you use) and a special attack, which you can use every 3 turns, which each have their own unique abilities. This usually consists of extra damage, healing, armour or some negative effect on the enemy (such as stun). You initially begin with one character with the Robot suit. As you progress through the game, you unlock more characters (maximum of 3) and costumes (of which there are many). Unfortunately, despite the large number of costumes, many of the characters play very similarly and largely fall into 3 major classes – a fighter that deals damage, a healer and a character that provides buffs. This is exacerbated by the fact that, apart from one single boss fight (in which you are constantly reminded to use a particular sort of character), you can more or less run through the entire game without changing your costumes at all. The battles themselves play out similarly to most turn-based RPGs, with the notable addition of timing-based button prompts, which will be familiar to people that have played Paper Mario or The Mario and Luigi RPG series on handheld Nintendo systems. The prompts for each attack depend on the costume that each character is using, and successfully completing these will lead to additional damage (when on offence) or reduced damage (on defence). These prompts include things such as pressing a button immediately, pressing it at a certain time, twirling your left stick around or mashing a button repeatedly. Although these do add some depth to the battle system, in the sense that you can’t entirely fall asleep at the wheel and just mash A repeatedly, it still remains far too shallow and far too easy. I am practically an old man when it comes to gaming, and even with my old-man reflexes, I managed to hit approximately 99% of the prompts without any trouble. Winning the battles awards you with which is used to level up (which increases HP and strength) and candy, which is the currency in the game used to purchase stamps, which can be equipped to your characters to give bonuses, such as increased damage/defence, splash damage and so on. Once you’ve reached the level cap and/or have purchased all of the stamps (both of which I did prior to finishing the game), there’s no longer any purpose to the battles, making the already cumbersome and tedious battles just that much worse. The rest of the game is padded with tedious fetch-quests, hidden-object finding and an awfully unoriginal and unimaginative mini-game. Worst of all, you are required to do these same activities each time you move to a new area. Most (but not all) of the costumes that you unlock have a secondary ability that can be used outside of the battle. The Robot suit, for example, has rollerblades which allow you to travel faster (which is generally why you’ll spend most of your time in this suit) and travel up ramps, leading you to so-called “hidden areas”. The other costumes have abilities that are, for the most part, used once in a particular part of the game (most of which is right after you obtain the costume) and then never necessary again. As a result, most of these abilities seem really tacked-on, which is a real shame as I feel like they could have done so much more with it.Presentation:First things first – I loved the cartoony art style used for this game. I really have no complaints about the graphics. The characters are cute and the setting is undeniably Halloween. Remember - nothing screams Halloween more than Jack-O-Lanterns and candy, and be warned – there are Jack-O-Lanterns and candy everywhere in this game. The sound and music are, for lack of a better word, appropriately Halloweeney. One thing that they absolutely nailed is the animations used for the battle transitions, in which the cardboard boxes and cheap trousers used to create the children’s costumes are transformed into visually-impressive life-like versions. This will hit all the right spots for anyone that’s worn an awful costume in their younger years and imagined looking so much cooler. With that said, having these animations play out every single time you enter a battle wears out very quickly, which is exacerbated by the fact that there’s no way to skip them.Another major gripe that I had was the complete lack of a map/mini-map. This, coupled with the fact that most of the sub-areas in the game look more or less identical, resulted in me walking around in circles looking for the last house to trick-or-treat, or the last hidden child. By far the biggest hook for this game is the classic Tim Schafer-esque humour and dialogue that we’ve come to expect from Double-Fine. Whilst not every line will necessarily make you laugh out loud, it’s hard not to at least smirk. At the very least, you’ll appreciate the effort that Double Fine has gone through to give each and every character a unique line of dialogue. It should be noted that the game lacks any voice acting, instead opting to go with on-screen text. On one hand, it’s a shame, given how awesome the voice acting has been in some of DF’s earlier (i.e. Psychonauts) or later (i.e. Broken Age) has been. On the other hand, bad voice acting could have destroyed the delivery of the quirky, humorous one-liners. Overall verdict:Overall, the game was largely disappointing. It’s a shame, really, because the quirky presentation and humour really highlighted everything I love about Tim Schafer’s games – it was more everything else that let the game down, most notably the repetitive and shallow gameplay. I can honestly say that during the 8 or so hours that I spent finishing the game (including the DLC), I can’t think of many moments that I actually enjoyed myself.  Therefore, with a heavy heart, I can’t recommend this game to anyone.			"

												What to say? This game is definitely a classic. You play as either the brother or the sister trying to save the other, who is kidnapped by monsters on Halloween as they try to invade this world. You use the power of various costumes along with the powers of friends you meet and have join your party as you progress along to the end. You also collect candy (money) and complete various quests for various people along the way.It's arguably the cutest RPG out there and also happens to be a lot of fun. Although Double Fine has somewhat fallen from grace of late, this game remains a shining example of the sort of excellent games they are capable of producing. Definitely a game that shouldn't be missed or passed over by anybody. Make sure you play this on Halloween, and at least turn it on Christmas Day for a few minutes (you will know why if you do it).A classic, one of the best games out there, and an easy 10/10.			"

												Absolutely adorable game that oozes Doublefine charm. You play as a bunch of kids who get wrapped up in a halloween monster plot to steal all the world's candy. The gameplay is somewhere inbetween the Mario RPG games (Superstar saga, Paper Mario) and South Park Stick of Truth, with your kids actually turning into their costume for the battle. There's a heap of unlockable costumes which act as character classes and a few other clever ways to customise your guys. It's just all round fun.I really wouldn't be surprised if the guys that made Stick of Truth were inspired by this. They're ridiculously similar, in a good way! It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun. Definitely grabbing the sequel :D			"

												When monsters invade to disrupt the sacred trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween, kidnap your twin, and attempt to steal all the candy that is yours by right, there's nothing to do but turn your costume up to eleven and kick them back into the netherworld from whence they came. Thus is the setup to Costume Quest, a hilarious and creative RPG-lite from Double Fine that is as sweet as the candy you so eagerly collect, despite its gameplay being highly simplified.You spend most of your time exploring the world, collecting costume pieces, and of course knocking on houses with the hope that a bundle of candy will be waiting for you on the other side. There are also a handful of side-quests to complete, most in the form of hide-and-seek games or typical fetching errands. Though in most games I find quests such as these mundane and uninteresting, here they are full of so much humor and charm that it was hard for me to keep from smiling the whole way through.But supposing someone not so nice and full of candy answers the door, then it's time to for some Persona like turn-based combat to occur. This is where gameplay hits a snag, as while fully functional the battle mechanics are extremely basic, revolving almost entirely around quicktime events with little to no variation or strategy to speak of. They are also terribly easy (I failed all but once, and on the final boss no less) which made the few options you are given for altering your character's attacks even less noticeable and necessary. That's not to say battles are completely devoid of fun, as I did enjoy them to an extent, but after only a few hours the repetition becomes grating so much as to have me actively try and avoid encounters (as if the Ninja costume wasn't already awesome enough). Thankfully with the story clocking in at 6-7 hours, it never got so bad as to greatly degrade the experience, and so long as you keep play sessions to short bursts are little more than a minor annoyance.The big head celshaded look works surprisingly well with the theme of the game, making transitions between the lighthearted character models to the much more intricate (and in some cases suitably creepy) characters used for battles seamless, on top of simply being cute. The fixed camera is at times a hassle, but for the most part works well for the style of gameplay and stays out of your mind where it belongs. I do have one odd complaint about the presentation, which is the lack of any music or sound effects for most cutscenes. Even a simple text scrolling sound would have helped, as the way it is now made them feel awkward and drawn out, not to mention greatly reduced the impact of significant plot points.Regardless of any problems I mentioned, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Costume Quest to anyone who has enjoyed a Double Fine game in the past. The writing is comedy gold, the characters lively and likeable, and its concept is completely unique. If you are looking for a complex and involving RPG then you won't find it here, but if you can look past the simple mechanics for the heartfelt adventure underneath it is greatly entertaining and worth playing.

												An outstanding Halloween themed adventure, that made my weekend and I am so glad I own this lovely thing.Pros+ Captures the Halloween theme perfectly, very fun to play and takes a lot of time to finish.+ Characters look good, animations are great, and music and sound effects are really awesome.+ A very funny story, and the character's dialogues are really funny and very well-done.+ Very detailed world design and many places to visit.+ Various main and optional quests to do, and so many stuff to find.+ A lot of costumes to make, each with its own ability that can help you proceed to the next place.+ The battles looks great, and their layout and all are good.+ Fun for everyone, suitable for kids or adults.+ Candy candy CANDY.Cons- Weird fps performance, when at a battle or a small cut-scene it locks at 30, but if you press esc and resume it goes back to 60, I am not sure if anyone else is having this problem but it does for me, however it felt normal to me at 30fps.- Battles gets kinda boring and repetitive, you get abilities and stuff to increase your power and new costumes, but the battles are basically the same, good at first but sorta boring near the end.Rating 9/10 without doubt, If it did not have the small fps issue and faster battles it would'v easily gotten 10/10 , because it really is perfect, the story is great, the gameplay is really fun and the dialogues and everything is just perfect, its like watching a Halloween-type movie with a fun story.

												I can't believe I had this little gem for so long in my library and have not played it.The game is about a brother and sister going trick or treating on Halloween when they come across real monsters who want to steal all the candy in the neighborhood. As one of the siblings is getting abducted by the monsters, the other, sets of to find a way to rescue them. You must go through your neighborhood and collect all the candy from all the houses. Along the way you must:- solve side-quests- battle monsters with your awesome Halloween Costume Superpowers- deal with bullies- make new friends to join your team- find as much candy as possible- find and make new Halloween costumes, each with their own unique special powers on and off the battle fields- collect Halloween Trading Cards you can trade in-game- buy upgrades for your Halloween Costumes- Level up to get stronger and have more health to battle badder enemiesThe game captures the creepy Halloween atmosphere amazingly well with the little background noises, creepy sounds and empty streets, giving it a great feel to it. The Story is very nice, dialogue is well done and the way the game is graphically presented is very cute.The quests are great and dealing with the other kid's problems in the neighborhood is fun too,While the costumes are just costumes during your adventures, during the battles you transform into what ever it is you are wearing.The Battle's are simple but the imagination in regards to how the costumes translate into the ""real"" battle suits, is brilliantly done. I would definitely recommend this game and if you are a parent and have kids they most likely will enjoy playing this with you very much. Depending on the age of your kids the atmosphere might be a little creepy but nothing to serious :)			"

												A great game in all aspects. It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :) What's to Like ?  1. Good story, involving for both young and old.2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests.3. Relaxing style of open world gameplay, with exciting battles.4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily.5. Addon ""Grubbins on Ice"" DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game)6. Great cartoonish graphics remniscent of old games such as XIII.7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.What's not that exciting ?1. A little more length of the game would have been nice.2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievments for some more of them too.3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.What's to hate ?Nothing :) No major flaws.Costume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3. Though this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the addon DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that cany you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.The game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game. In all, a recommended buy. Do not hesitate if you get it on sale.			"

												A hilarious turn-based role-playing game by Double Fine. You play as a trio of over-imaganitive kids going door to door trick-or-treating on a spooky Halloween night. Changing costumes to transform into a giant mech or sparkling unicorn during battles is super comical, and rewarding.The game is obviously inspired by older Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest titles, but contains enough tongue-in-cheek humor and casual-friendly aspects to keep the game entertaining, and not grindy or frustrating. Costume Quest is a short, but sweet game; it only takes about seven or eight hours to see and do everything, but the writing is top-notch and it is definitely worth at least one trip.			"

This game has no voice acting. At all. It's all ambient sounds and SFX. At first it's weird, but it isn't too bad at all. After 20 minutes you forget your expectations and just accept the design choice.The game is super fun and exudes charm, with the classic Double Fine level of humour and level design.I spent 7 hours completing the game 100% including all DLC and achievements, and it was very enjoyable, both in story and gameplay, with perfect controller integration. I was so ""hooked"" by the little questhubs that I actually played the entire game in one sitting, and finished the DLC the day after. Very addictive, very fun.Highly recommended!Nilesy			"

												Costume Quest isn't a bad game. But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.The thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.Apart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.But it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.The game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.[After a bunch of ""unhelpful"" ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]			"

												Unfortunately, I really can't give this game a good review.I tried to enjoy it, I really did, I mean its Double Fine right?The gameplay is almost non-existent and all three of the chapters have the same bobbing for apples minigame over and over again. There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?The variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.The supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well. It also hurt that the dialogue is not voiced.If you are looking for a cutesy little game for a young child who has 6 hours to burn, I say go for this as long as it’s under 10$. Otherwise unless you are a Double Fine fanboy (which is not necessarily a bad thing, they make good games) then just walk away.			"

												I'm going to start this out by saying this: I loved this game. It is absolutely adorable. You play as one of two siblings out to collect candy on halloween. Alls not well however, when they discover that the neighborhood has been taken over by evil doings.Artistically, Costume Quest is great. Interesting graphics with a FFVII-esque transition between the cutsy overworld and the combat scenes. The music fits the game well, but isn't outstanding. The story is silly and fun, and not super serious.Mechanically, the game is solid. Combat and overworld controls make sense and everything is easy to pick up. Combat is menu based, but not overwhelmingly so. Each costume has different strengths and weaknesses, and different combinations can make for a very different combat experience.If you're looking for a quick, uninvolved RPG, you could do a lot worse than Costume Quest.If you liked this review, please have a look at my other reviews!

												Every year around Halloween I have to pull this game out and play a little.  It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere that really does define Halloween for a young child.  The world is a bright, colorful, slighty scary place full of surprises.  In the game you have to explore the area for candy, solve a few puzzles, and battle a few monsters.   There is some rpg aspects in fact that you level the party,  you can buy power-ups with candy, and the choice of costumes. The idea of combat is great as your costumes come to life, each wih a special ability.  In reality, the battles tend to be a bit repetitive and button mashfasts.  Still, I always look forward to each new costume to see its animations in battle.Overall, I highly recommend this game just on charm alone.  Its got great artwork and the game mechanisms work for the most part.  I even like the soundtrack with its spooky sounds interpersed with children's laughter.  The humor is great too, you can view this game as a satire on American culture.			"

												This is probably one of the cutest, most charming games I've played.The game mechanics aren't anything ground breaking. It's a pretty straight forward RPG battle system where you transform into the literally larger-than-life version of your chosen Halloween costume. But the game's world is what you wanted to experience when you were 10 years old. You wanted to BE your costume (which picking was one of the most important decisions you made all year). You wanted life to be very cartoony. Candy was more precious than money.The game oozes charm. It has child characters that are actually likable, funny, and clever, which is pretty rare in video games. The monsters and villians are pretty funny. Basically, it's just so fun!			"

Both of those combined makes this game even more interesting.Costume Quest should entertain most of the jRPG fans. Especially younger ones.This is one of the few games which took me back to my childhood and world of imagination.Despite of the fact that it has more advantages than disadvantages, i got bored of those constant battles (still enjoyable in some kind of way) at the end of the game.So all in all, i am giving this game 8,5/10.If you have not played it before, you should give it a try!

												Costume Quest is a cute game where you are the brother or sister (Depending on whom you picked) and during trick or treating your sibling gets taken by a troll monster thinggy. So, in all great games you must go rescue them! It isn't easy but not hard, I was running about for about 20 minutes a little lost ;D But other wise  epiccc graphics! It also had a pokemonish styled battle thing which I actually dislike. It's a fun game where you can just go trick or treating, you ever get sweets or you have to battle! :Poverall, a very cute and detailed game. I would buy  it for the halloween season / if its on sale!			"

												This is the first and best game to ever truly capture the spirit of why Halloween is the treasured holiday that it is.  From the childlike fantasy that costumes are a transformation rather than a mask to the currency systems of candy and collectible stamps, the nostalgic whimsy is endearing and addictive.Every year I look forward to playing this game (I have it on PS3, thus the short play hours on Steam) and whenever I need a little dose of Halloween but it's not October, this game scratches that itch.If you love Halloween, this game embodies it like no other.

												Costume Quest is a cute little Halloween themed casual adventure game. This fun game had you teaming up with newfound friends to rescue your sister and save Halloween from candy-hunting monsters. The game feels like it was made for a younger audience, but certainly enjoyable by the young at heart.The graphics were really nicely done. It was appropriately cartoony, which fit the game quite well. All the animations and movements felt really smooth. Each level of the game was set in a unique setting which the art represented well.Story isn't the main focus of the game, but it is there. It's quite cute, fun and appropriate. There are certainly a couple of nods and winks in there and there's some enjoyable dialogue too.Gameplay was simplistic, requiring you to complete a number of quests on each level, all revolving around collecting candy, battle cards (which would give characters a boost in combat) and collectable trading cards. While each level was in a different setting, the gameplay felt a little too much like a copy of the level before it and that made it a tad boring. There were some unique activities on each level, I feel that more variety from level to level would have made it feel more fresh.Combat was very simplistic. Depending on which character's turn it was, it would either require a timed button press of one of four keys, a single button press or a mashing of one or more keys. Every third attack by a character had the options of choosing a special attack. Defence used a similar mechanic. I believe the simplicity of the combat can be attributed to a combination of the younger target audience as well as a relic of it being a console port. A Paper-Scissors-Rock style strength/weakness system would modify the damage given/received. The problem with this simplified approach is that after a while, it becomes rather repetitive. Given the number of battles you'll need to complete the game, the repetitive combat simply becomes boring and I found I was wanting to avoid combat rather than chasing enemies for extra candy and experience. This is compounded by the inability to skip special attack animations. While each animation isn't that long, you'll be seeing a lot of them, and if you're like me, you'll just want to skip it and move on.Achievements for this game at quite simple to collect. If you examine them prior to playing, you should be able to pick them all up bar one in a single playthrough. That bar one is ""Tisn't the Season"", which can only be acquired on Christmas Day.Polish. Costume Quest is really quite polished. I saw no bugs, screen artefacts, characters getting stuck, or the like. If I want to be really picky, the only thing I could bring attention to is that there are some minor signs that this is a port, combat mechanism for instance, but I don't think it would have been practice to have done anything about them.Conclusion. Overall, Costume Quest is a beautiful fun game. If you like a casual, light-hearted adventure and can tolerate a little repetitiveness, you'll find enjoyment here.			"

												I love it when you start a game like ""Ok, let's see what this is like"" and get hooked so badly that you end up finishing the game the same day.I was deploring a few days ago the fact that Halloween isn't celebrated in my country and came accross this adventure game, in which you play as a costumed kid ready for some trick-or-treating. But this is a heroic story from a child's perspective, as your sibling is kidnapped by a monster and the evil takes over. Costume Quest is a cute and funny RPG with a simple combat system, your abilities depending on which costume you're wearing. Get candies, trade them for special abilities, put some new costumes together, complete some quests, kick some bad guy's a** and save the world - or at least, your sibling ! A very entertaining adventure for all ages with a lot of humour and a great story.			"

												Costume Quest is a cute little game worth goofing around with in October. Once you get into it, it's pretty fun. I find myself really eager to try out whatever new costume I come across just to see its special abilities.Combat is pretty much nothing but quick time events, which is somewhere between disappointing and frustrating. Each costume has its own different take on the quick time event though, with some asking you to get timing right, some asking you to hit a button before its too late, and some asking you to mash keys. It does keep it interesting I suppose. At least defending is always the same thing.			"

												I got this game a couple years back on a steam sale and I must say I am not dissapointed.The Game itself is a nice cute comedy rpg for young and old. The Graphics are very cartoony and cute and I had no problem running it whatsoever. To Upgrade your fighting gear and ability you need to make find Costume Parts and create them. Each one has their own special ability for your own uniqe Playstyle.The Achievements are also not very hard to achieve, main Reason being is because you can unlock them almost all by just playing through it. This Game also comes with Steam Cards for extra cutness.It also comes with a Bonus Level / DLC for free called Grubbins on Ice. Which is a bit more difficult then the main campaign and requires more of a tactical thinking.All in all, this game is super cute and after 14 Hours of finishing it I can recommend this Game for its original price, however it is never a mistake to get it on Sale.

												Charmingly cute turn-based RPG. The game has a simple comic-book aesthetic, and is full of silly characters and clever dialogue. Through the power of the children's imagination, in battle they transform into towering fighters, based on the costume they are currently donning. These fighters include a robot, a ninja, a unicorn, and a giant crab made out of french fries. The four hub areas feel visually distinct, but the quest types in each zone are very similar. You will find hidden children, bob for apples, knock on doors to ""Trick-or-treat"", receiving either a handful of candy or entering into a battle. The battle system in this game is almost stiflingly simple. Each costume has a basic attack and a special move that can be used every three turns. Attacks and defense are managed through simple quick-time events, and there are no items or resistances to keep track of in battles.Your parties stats are limited to HP, Attack Power, and Defense. Levelling up increases these stats by a fixed amount. The only character management lies in deciding which costumes to wear, and spending candy to obtain stamps which give various perks in battle. Each character can only equip one stamp at a time, and some are undoubtedly more powerful than others. Difficulty is very low, especially once you have a full party.			"

												It's another great game by Double Fine. It's got the same humorous dialogue, good story on a smaller scale as compared to some of their other games.  Graphics are simple, music has that Halloween feel as it's perfect for playing something like this around October. Gameplay overall is a turn based RPG, it's easy and recommended for beginners of the genre. It does get repetitive but like a said, it's basically an RPG for beginners. My only complaint is that this game needed a map badly. Especially in the first part of the game. It's real confusing and almost took an hour just to find a house I did not go up too. Also the framerate is sort of locked at 30. I disabled the vsync and got it going up to 40 but for the most part this game is locked at 30. It's a 7/10.			"

Every area you enter has you doing the same tasks-Limited combat strategy.  Every character has a normal and an ""ultimate"" attack and that is it.I didn't dislike the game enough to stop playing, but I can't say that I liked the game either.  Towards the end, it felt like I was dragging my way through because I had made it this far and might as well finish it.  With that, I can't say that I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 12. "

												This game tries to give you an insight on the kids’ imagination at best time possible: Halloween trick’or’treating, with all the costumes and funny games (until someone loses an eye, and oh boy they do!). And it is designed just right to do so. Game also offers a solid amount of exploration, a few side quests and some level-upping to do. All of those would make me definitely recommend the game, and for those qualities I do, but the repetitive and unnecessarily combats make me not. Because there plenty of repetitive unnecessary combats, and I cannot recommend only half a game.			"

Costume Quest is a Double Fine RPG set around Halloween where by some magical intervention, your character and his or her friends gain the ability to transform into super powered versions of their costumes to save your sibling who has been mistakenly kidnapped as a result of dressing in a terrible candy costume.It's very... Double Fine. I really don't know how they make their games all feel so similar despite them having different mechanics and stories and settings. Art and dialogue, I suppose. Anyway, that's my only negative-ish criticism.It's a pretty good short RPG, with quick time attacks/dodging similar to the Mario RPGs. It is actually reasonably difficult despite how it might look so if you're buying this for kids, consider that. I like the innovation of having ""random encounters"" limited to houses where you're trick or treating. The story is kind of sparse, but manages to touch on some themes of the difficulties of siblinghood. It fits into the game's world organically, so I can appreciate that.			"

												A really fun game even for someone who does not celebrate Halloween. As halloween is not majorly celebrated in my country.A creative, original and gorgeously animated RPG, you go around trick or treating collecting candy and fighting monsters in turn based  combat which is simplistic but fun as you end up with a collection of costumes that transform you when in combat and besides the basic attack, after a few rounds you can use a special attack such as for the unicorn it leaps into the air shoots a rainbow and can revive and fully heal a downed ally or just fully heal if no one is KO'ed.The game is quite short, I completed it plus grubbins on ice in 11 hours. Doesn't matter though as  the length is perfect for the game as I can see that any longer will probably become boring. I highly recommend playing through this game. I had fun.			"

												For those of you that are in for a one way ticket ride throughout a rather comical world with cool challenges and heroic action scenes should know that this game offers exactly what you are looking for. Although the game is rather short, resulting in an 8 hours play to cover completely both the game and the extension, Costume Quest has the talent of keeping you seated for hours as you are constantly plundered by the affirmation ""I'll do just this one and then quit"". From the graphics perspective the game is truly gorgeous, combining the animated themed models with comic book influences and a really well built atmosphere. Even tho you will spend most of your gameplay surfing through text lines, the game is still very enjoyable having some good humor and offering you a rather challenging comical journey, with extreme boss fights, that you won't regret.

												A charming and cartoony JRPG about kids saving Halloween, bogged down by a a battle system where the best three costumes are the first three you get, and where combat boils down to everyone attacking normally for two rounds, suing their special ability on the third, and repeating until the fight's over. There's no real reason to use any of the other costumes because none of them have as good stats or as good special ability as an all area hitting massive nuke with follow up DoT damage, a powerful shield capable of turning hits into 1 or 2 damage, or the only heal in the game that doesn't require the target to be dead first to revive them. The combat system is incredibly repetitive, although active due to needing to do timed button presses. Ultimately, though, literally every fight becomes attack -> attack -> special -> repeat. Battle Stamps, the game's only equipment, don't alleviate this issue at all - some of the stamps offer side abilities that Stun or Slow enemies, but you're still doing the same attack/attack/spell trio the entire game.I'm giving the game a positive recommendation because the repetitive and dull combat system ultimately wasn't enough to dissuade me from completing the (relatively short: 4-6 hours) game. It's still fun running around, collecting candy, and trick or treating, and seeing what the costumes look like in fights. If the game was any longer, the combat system would start to do real damage, but thanks to how short it is, it's not that big a deal.			"

I am never going to get far enough to weigh in on the story though, this game is unplayable.  In combat sequences you need to hit a specific key at just the right time to do bonus damage or dodge an enemy's attack.  This key is constantly changing, and I can't read it.  Shift or Space?  I can't tell.  The font size is smaller than what you see for this review, it's practically a squiggle.  I am not running this on a laptop either, I have a 20"" screen.  This combined with no map and gameplay that is already becoming repetitive ensure that I will not be continuing with what could have been a charming adventure.			"

												Costume Quest is another great game made by Double Fine Productions. Set in a Halloween setting, this game brings forth both RPG elements and strategy, while not making the game too hard. This game isn't too long, but it isn't too short either, with the game duration being around 5-6 hours for the main story. The goal of the game is to rescue your sister from the clutches of an evil witch, and stop monsters from taking all the town's candy by trick-or-treating door to door. Along your way, you'll pick up allies and use many costumes with different abilities in and out of battle to progress through your journey. Completing side quests not only help you, but everyone else as well as you strive to finish your journey. Watch as your Halloween costumes come to life in Costume Quest.ProsOver 14 different Halloween costumes to try on with different roles, abilities, and special moves. Some costumes help you in situations outside of combat.Very simple and straight forward turn-base, RPG battle system, that often provides strategy at times.Many Battle Stamps to collect that give you an advantage in battle (healing after every turn, additional damage, counterattack, poison, etc.)Great, cartoony graphics and atomospheric music that helps set the environment of the gameAlthough they serve no real purpose besides unlocking achievements, you can collect trading cards from winning battles and trading with NPCs.Occasional mini games that are not only fun, but are great when you want to take a break from fighting or finishing quests.Additional story to play after the main that's equally as enjoyable as the last.ConsDodging and attacking quick time controls often don't respond, but it's not a huge issue. At only $10 and an average playtime of around 5-10 hours, this game is all-around great to pick up, and can be enjoyed at any time, not just Halloween. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG games or are just casual gamers. "

												This is such a cute game. I got it as part of a bundle I purchased in order to get another game I wanted and never really intended to play it. But I did. And I ended up loving it.It's definitely a pretty casual game and you can breeze through it pretty quickly so it might not appeal to the most hardcore of gamers but I thought it was a blast. The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.Since all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.There are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.The only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level. The top tier of that level just looked all the same to me and I kept getting turend around. At least your main costume comes with rollerblades so that you can just zip right along.			"

												7.5/10Pros- Just oozes style and charm, with a great Halloween theme- Very polished finished product- Enjoyable timing-based combat (think Paper Mario)- A large number of playable “characters” (13 combat costumes + 1 noncombat)- Funny at times- Includes the DLC episode for freeCons- Not a lot of variety in the locations or enemies (3 main story levels + 1 DLC level)- Fairly short for an RPG (about 8 hours to finish)- Simplified RPG combat leads to very few options and a lot of repetition- The story isn’t exactly gripping- Very linearI actually really enjoyed this game.  It’s a very simple and short turn-based RPG that hit a lot of the right notes.  It just has a certain charm to it that is hard to describe. The combat contains a timing-based component where if you perform the correct action at the right time, your attacks will do more damage or you will take less damage on defense.  This helps keep you engaged in all of the battles.  Thankfully this component was included, because otherwise you have very few options in combat (attack, use a special if it is charged, or use a battle stamp which gives a combat ability).  In terms of battle stamps, these are reusable and basically replace items in the game, and can either confer an ability in combat (e.g. stun a single enemy) or a passive ability (e.g. more health).  The other source of variety in combat is the inclusion of 13 different combat costumes, each of which have their own abilities and play style (single target DPS, AoE, defense, healer, etc.).  That being said, even with these additions the combat can still drag at times.  Fighting a limited variety of enemies in the same environment over and over can become tedious.  Overall most battles are quite easy, but a few boss battles require strategy when selecting which battle stamps and costumes to use.  The story doesn’t contribute much, but the writing is good and there are some funny moments.  If you enjoy RPGs that don’t take themselves too seriously, this is a good game.  In addition, the simplified and streamlined nature of the game would make it a good option for someone who is new to RPGs or a younger gamer.			"

												Costume Quest is a game that unexpectedly won me over completely. While I still have not played all of Double Fine's games yet, this particular game is near the top for me, and also one of my favorite games in general for recent years.There is a lot of heart in the design and story of Costume Quest, which is a wonderfully funny kids' adventure. You begin the game on Halloween night for a brother and sister, which quickly evolves into a gigantic quest beyond any normal realm, as you must fight monsters that sweep in to take over the night.As a whole, Costume Quest is indeed a quest. As you control a set of kids going on their adventure throughout the game, you will do a variety of things from actual trick-or-treating to exploration for hidden items to performing role-playing battles. The game is indeed an RPG with main and side quests, special equipment and power-up items, along with general collectibles. Most fitting to the game is that candy is your currency.Each new area that you enter, you generally must trick-or-treat at a set number of houses or doorways. When doing so, you will literally get a trick or a treat. The treat is simply candy, as expected. The trick, however, is a fight with the monsters that are the main enemies of the game. When battles launch up, your characters have mini-cutscenes where they turn into the beings that they are wearing as costumes, e.g., a robot will suddenly stand up very tall and be prepared to fight.The style of the battles are turn-based, though you only have three options - normal attack, special power, and Battle Stamp power. When you perform normal attacks, each costume has a different style of ""timing"" that you can use to perform extra damage if you hit the right buttons in the proper manner. Special powers cannot be used until enough energy (essentially MP) is accrued, which will generally happen after a few turns in battle. Battle Stamps are part of the equipment of the game, where each character can wear a single stamp to add extra strength or a new capability. Some of the Battle Stamps just affect stats, like increasing attack power. Others will give an ability for that third battle option, such as stunning enemies temporarily.As can be seen both in and out of battle, the game has a very interesting, 3D cartoon art style showcasing the environment and characters. As already mentioned above, the battles have mini-cutscenes related to the costumes, and there are also special effects for the power attacks or for certain bosses that you fight along the way. Altogether, everything truly screams Halloween. Even the costumes that you are wearing will allow you to perform different capabilities in the ""real"" world, as you will need to switch between them to access certain areas or complete side quests on the map.The story itself is also very well-done, having both a cheesy style but also a mapped-out purpose. As you continue through the game, you will learn more information about the beings that you are fighting against and what their end goal is. Take note that once you finish the game, the story is not done. The game has a free ""Grubbins on Ice"" DLC which continues from the end of the game. And even further, there is a Costume Quest 2 which continues from the endpoint of that DLC.I highly recommend this game to just about any person. The adventure of the children is filled with fun, charm, humor, and a number of other qualities, combined into a very enjoyable game.			"

												It's no secret that people enjoy spooking themselves throughout October. Some may dabble into the horrific imagery, the classic monsters, the eldritch horrors or the psychological drama of fear. All of these qualities are what many would consider as connotations of Halloween.Halloween for me, however has never been about the scares. While I may sound to be admiring the commercialism itself, I've always been reminded of Trick-or-Treating, Halloween cartoons/specials, and of the creativity/love for the holiday, especially the costumes. These are the qualities adults and kids alike treat themselves to every year.These sentiments are why I find myself revisiting Costume Quest as a tradition. It provides a light-hearted, four to six hour adventure (with the DLC and all the extra quests) that captures the qualities I enjoy the most. Its shortened length and kid-like spectacle perfectly shows the forgotten fondness we have for the holiday of fears.Something ""Wicked"" This Way ComesCQ itself has nothing unique that hasn't been seen in TV specials, movies or games. Its set-up is that you play as the brother/sister of a family, and you must rescue your sibling from the clutches of an evil witch bent on taking over Halloween with all the candy. (Also possibly not to get grounded). However, what the plot lacks in originality, the game's humor and execution provide something that shows its charm for being derivative of all the things kids and adults love about Halloween. If you grew up in the '90s like myself, then you probably are familiar with the trick-or-treat game from Cartoon Network. You walked around an small map with magical costumes, collecting candy from doors and obstacles in a time-limit for high-scores. Costume Quest shares the basic idea of a magical realism setting where the costumes themselves provide supernatural powers for kids. Instead of a competitive, high-score game, CQ is a traditional JRPG game with Paper Mario-like mechanics and various HUB maps to explore.Compared to the Cartoon Network game, the maps are much larger along with providing mini-games and alternative quests for hidden rewards. Outside of combat, every costume provides an ability that varies in its utility. The quests are basic fetch or talk quests, and the level-design is a linear set of checkboxes given some player freedom to wander off. You won't be breaking the game's order of events or getting late-game costumes early.When in combat, the kids transform themselves into a larger-than-life representation of their costume in what can be thought of as a Power Rangers mech fight. Enemies' designs are dramatized as well to make the combat more visually interesting than watching a blue-box robot fighting demons in bath-robes. That visual alone is how the fighting mechanics should be thought of: Absurd and simple.  Like Paper Mario, the turn-based battles are broken up by quick-time-events that add/lower the damage you deal. The player's team and the enemy's take turns trading hits, and while you are on the defensive you can block attacks to lessen the blow. Some costumes have unique abilities like the Knight's Shield (defense buff), the Robot's Missle Barrage and the Lady Libery's Anthem (healing skill). To say that the combat system is basic would be stating the obvious. There are eleven costumes in the main game, and three new ones in the DLC. Each costume has its one-tailored playstyle and set of skills, separated by one of three costume types like rock-paper-and-scissors, and they each provide enough lasting appeal to keep the game from getting too stale with a limited roster. The game knows its combat isn't its greatest suit, so the variety and short length go a long way to keep the monotonous gameplay as low as possible.There's Only 364 Days Til' Next HalloweenAs far as the game's other problems, if the game's charm doesn't sell you on it right away, then the gameplay, in and out of combat, won't sell you on the rest of the experience. The writing isn't Double Fine's best as it relies a lot on tropes, especially the protagonist and his/her companions, but the subversions from the player's character towards not carrying about the plot helps mitigate that issue. (Kind of like how Doomguy doesn't care about the plot in his recent game.) This is something the DLC as well as CQ2 fail to grasp as the plot relies on characters explaining the techno babble of wormholes. Neither one captures the same charm as the original. While Costume Quest is certainly not one of Double Fine's greatest successes it is an experience I would easily recommend to others. Usually I would have something more profound to say to end a review but CQ is simply a decent game.  It's nothing innovative in its gameplay, story or even its basic idea, but the way everything comes together nicely makes me longing for next Halloween to replay it again.			"

A Halloween EpicBecause of this game, I now have a soft spot for Double Fine and will be keeping an eye out for future projects. It's a turn-based RPG that kids will enjoy but adults will understand some of the more subtle humor. I couldn't help but be reminded of The Nightmare Before Christmas—you even get to battle as a Jack Skellington-like pumpkin—but less manic. If you're looking for difficult, intricate gameplay, this isn't your game. It's got a lot of charm, funny dialogue, feel good narrative, and a cute art style. What other game would let you duke it out as a vampire, unicorn, and a pirate all at once (my favorite in-game trio)? Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to relax with a nice story about sibling bonding and friendship.10/10 - JUNEBUG'S FAVORITES			"

												I recommend this game if you can get it on sale and get it knowing there's virtually no replay value. I got it on sale and it was a fun 6-7 hour game. You can do everything in the game in just 6-8 hours, so be aware of that. The story is silly and nothing to boast about. The combat gets kind of repetitive, but the new costumes throughout the game and having to use the costumes outside of battle to access certain areas of the map for secrets and collectibles (and game progression) was fun and intrigued me. If you're looking for a complex or challenging game, this isn't it. But if you or perhaps one of your kids is looking for a nice, simple RPG to play for an afternoon-this is a good one to get. (again, provided it's on sale. I can't recommend spending $10 on a game that only takes 6-7 hours to beat-regardless of how much you might want an easy to perfect game)			"

												Costume Quest is a really fun to play Halloween themed, turn based RPG.I recently have been getting into playing alot of smaller indie type games as opposed to the larger AAA games because im finding those bigger developers nowadays are just money grabbing Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V all their games and sequels. Small games like this for me are far more exciting and interesting to play because they can be so random.Costume Quest is clearly a Halloween themed game where you play as a child whose brother/sister has been taken captive by monsters (Grubbins) that think he/she is a giant piece of candy. Progressing through the game, there are 3 or 4 main quest areas/neighborhoods that you 'Trick or Treat' for candy and do various quests such as trading collectible Creepy Treat Cards with other kids, bobbing for apples and finding 6 children that are hiding to get a reward.There are of course Costumes that you find materials for and use to fight your enemies, you can buy Battle Stamps or receive them after winning a fight which improve your damage, hp, attack power or chance to dodge etc. Each costume has its own unique ability and attack moves which really adds a little strategy as to which costumes your characters wear to a fight.All in all, i really have enjoyed playing through this game! It has a very South Park: Stick of Truth feel to it, in the sense that you are playing as children, exploring the neighborhood, fighting other children in turn based fights, finding collectibles, doing certain quests to unlock access to new areas, having boss fights and so on. The only difference here is that Costume Quest is a fraction of the price and isnt quite as content filled as South Park: Stick of Truth, but it is worth the price by far in my opinion.I have been uploading all of my gameplay to Youtube if you would like to see some gameplay but there are of course spoilers if you do watch them :steamhappy: Costume Quest Youtube Playlist "

												Double Fin Productions offers a fun little role playing game, but its simplicity can be its one flaw. The simple combat makes Costume Quest seem rather dull, but the interesting story, amazing concept, and the crazy costumes create an epic game. Costume Quest:This game tells the story of a family who move to a new town right before Halloween. Their mother sends her two children out to trick-or-treat: Reynold and Wren. You get to choose to play as either one of these two children, but after the start of the game whoever you don’t choose is taken away. Your mission is to retrieve the other sibling and save this town from the monsters who are trying to destroy Halloween forever. Grubbins on Ice:Grubbins on Ice is the expansion for Costume Quest which extends the story to enter the world of Repugia. Continuing the tale that Wren, Reynold, and their friends started this expansion offers a summary. The Grubbins are experiencing a takeover by an evil crew of monsters who are raising the taxes and steeling the candy. Can you save the foes that originally caused you so much distress from a fate worse than death, a world without candy. Gameplay:Just beat this game, other than the final boss on Grubbins on Ice being slightly challenging the overall game was incredibly easy. This game has a fun an interesting story which makes me wonder if all that occurred was just a child’s imagination or in fact was supposed to have really happened. The game drifts between reality and fantasy creating a world through the eyes of children. The game offers elements of questing, puzzle solving, and combat all without a single bit of bloodshed. The gameplay is interesting, but incredibly simple. The characters wear costumes which allow them to enter into battle with their opponents gaining the power of their outfit. The costumes have one attack and ability. No matter which costume you where the basic attack is essentially the same (doing the same amount of damage only visually different). The costumes differ based on their special ability, which makes each costume slightly unique. Results:If you are interested in an RPG that’s not a page turner, but rather just a fun little side project then this may be for you. This game has simple gameplay, relatively easy to follow plot, and very basic questing; all which adds up to a game which you can play for a while, put down for a while, and come back to without feeling like you lost a beat. Overall it’s a fun little game that doesn't offer too much on your plate, but just enough to fill you up. Pros:+Simple basic combat system which requires no real skill+Friendly characters and interesting story line.+Relatively friendly controls+Very basic puzzles which require not mental skill.+Good game for all ages as there is no gore or inappropriate dialogue. Cons:-Gets very repetitive-No replay value. Once you have completed this game there is no reason to try it again (which is fine if you can get this game at a good discount)-Cannot cycle through characters and thus must play as the first character in line; this can be really annoying if you want to quickly cycle through costumes rather than continually opening the menu to change the costumes between characters. Which results in you then have to change the costumes back to the previous setting if you want your main character to wear a specific costume for its exploration ability.			"

												This is a fun retro-style RPG that does not eat up all your time to finish, but that is completely rewarding for being so whimsical and full of interesting content. I think you'll find that certain aspects are repetitive. For instance, the monsters one fights look similar and some of the minor quests are identical--e.g., apple bobbing. I think the turn-based fighting lacks strategy once you pick up a third friend. Also, you might want to adjust the in-game brightness because I had a hard time seeing at first. Still, all of these cons are mitigated by the fun content. I just loved collecting items, which was such a key component to playing the Costume Quest games. New costumes give you new powers. My favourite costume was the Eyeball from Grubbins on Ice. Hilarious!I purchased the game in a bundle with Costume Quest 2 and Grubbins on Ice for $5 on Halloween. The price was unbeatable, although I would have probably accepted paying $20 for all three games. This won't be the game you'll be playing for an entire year, but it will be a game you'll look back on fondly for sure. For me, it filled in the void after I beat South Park's ""Stick of Truth.""

												I played Costume Quest many years ago on the xbox 360.  Now replaying on Steam for the second time the game still holds up very well.  In my opinion it is a very light hearted RPG, simple and short enough to relax with.  The story is short and cute but has enough to pull you in.  You start by picking one of the twins to play as your main character the other u did'nt pick is part of the story as a NPC.  What caught me to the game was the battle system.  The whole game is about Halloween and how different Costumes you obtain through the game will allow you to transform into whatever the costume is about ( Robot Costume allows you to trun into a giant robot that shoots a rocket fist and bombs).  As i said earlier the game is light hearted no complex battle system here which means you dont have weapons or armors no list of magic spells or skills...Each costume can attack and has one special move (which can only be used after two turns).  When attacking each costume has a different button or prompt that needs to be push within seconds in order to get a critical hit...same goes for when a monster attacks your characters you must push a button in time to reduce the damage.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a short, simple, fun RPG.  My Rating: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED "

												When a game has as much charm and attention to presentation as Costume Quest does, you don't really mind that the RPG mechanics are incredibly rudimentary and simple. The only thing I really found irksome about this game were a couple of moments where DoubleFine let its history of creating Adventure games show, and the player is forced to perform tasks in particular sequences or in ways that nobody in their right mind would think of. While it's probably the easiest and shortest RPG I've played since Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, it's a really fun and light-hearted way to kill a few hours while getting into the Halloween spirit.

												I smiled and chuckled a lot while playing this one. The story and music is nice, but without voice actors I really felt the little ""extra"" was missing. The text bubbles you're left with sometimes disappears too fast before you can read them, other times you can press a button when reading them, and this should have been implemented in a better way, if not for all of them. Also, there are too many unnecessary battles; because of the battles being very simplistic in nature, the game would benefit greatly if these encounters were cut in, say, maybe half. Or barring that, having a more advanced fighting system. Nevertheless, it's a really nice ""cozy"" game that I recommend getting on a sale.			"

												Your Mission: Save Halloween (and your brother)  behind the backs of your loving and oblivious parents. This is a JRPG with a graphic style that evokes Saturday morning. The combat system is repetitive, but active as it requires timed button presses on a rotation. The story is cute and endearingly nostalgic. Whumping goblins on the back of the head with a pail, Trick-or-Treating and sibling rivalry are all present. And where else would you see a crab made of French fries, a unicorn and Lady Liberty team up to take down the bad guys? Best enjoyed with a bowl of Captain Crunch.			"

I found the gameplay to be easy and repetitive like most RPG games, in Costume Quest this is easily excused as it is all about levelling your characters (A bunch of mischievious kids!) trick or treating and knocking on doors, creating and finding new costumes, collecting battle cards to enhance your characters and most of all, collecting candy! Costume Quest is two games in one, you can play the normal Hallow'een storyline, then afterwards the sequel: Grubbin's on Ice, which has a winter orientated theme. If you have kids they will love this game, if you are a big kid at heart, yes you will love this fun little game too!			"

												The trailer for this definitely does not do it justice. I heard quite a few times this game was really good, and after watching the trailer numerous times over a course of forever and thinking that it looked terrible, i brought it anyway seeing as it was on sale. And I’m glad i did, this game really is amazing and the trailer doesn't do it justice at all.You play a small child, who is in fact a twin. You pick your twin (female/male) and then the story unfolds. Your parents let you out to trick or treat one night on Halloween, but due to a turn of events you find yourself trying to rescue your twin. We all know children have vivid imaginations, and this really throws you back into the mind of a child. The ""combat"" in this game is amazing. You have various different costumes you collect along the way, and these are you're ultimate weapon against the bad guys. It’s extremely fun, you use abilities and do quick time events to beat your enemies and the friends you make along the way builds your team of defence, each having their own abilities which with the right combinations can make really good teams.Going into the combat mode really reminded me of when i was a kid, back in the days where i watched power-rangers, it was a great experience, and i really enjoyed it.Like most of Double Fines games, there are various things to collect to make the game that little bit more fun for people like me that just can't resist collectables.

												A fun, accessible, bite sized ""RPG"" with a creative concept and a beautiful artstyle. I would say don't play for the gameplay, it's basically a 'Fisher-Price: Babies first turn based combat system'. There's actually more strategy in trying to not win a battle, as the game makes it extremely easy for you. Instead, play the game for it's hilariously written story and enjoyable feel. A great way to blow off some steam.			"

												Costume Quest is a really wonderful and fun adventure for kids and adults, who still remember how it's - be a kid. It's simple, funny, touching, it's make you laugh a little and smile a lot and there aren't many things, that can do so, so I appreceate the experience. You should know though that the game is very repetitive: rob some shop, fight with monsters, do it again and again. Still, it doesn't mean that Costume Quest aren't enjoyable - quite the opposite actually, but I just give you warning.Now for the main part: it's a Halloween adventure and we have two siblings, who want to celebrate and take all sweets for themselves. They are boy and girl, it's your choice who you want to play with (hint: the choice happens, when your mother decide who will be in charge). But quite quickly events become much more difficult - the big green monster steals your sibling and now you HAVE to find him\her. Or take the wrath of your mother. Monsters just don't look so scary now, come to think of it...Gameplay is very simple: you must take sweets from shops and homes, you must fight monsters that come your way and take some side quests and exploration if you like. It may sounds boring, but actually it's pretty fun because of battle system, story and dialogs. Battle system looks like a Dream world, where your nice costume (i didn't mention this? Come on, the game has a ""costume"" in title!) becomes a powerful weapon. Like, robot costume transforms into actual fabulous robot. There are also ninja, Statue of Liberty, Space warrior, magic unicorn... and french fries. Where else you can fight with your enemies, using your french fries powers?! Okay, to actual battles. Little warning: you need some reaction for this, because you will need to quickly press some buttons while you attacking or defending to make better results. And yeah, each costume have it's own special powers for battle. Like, healing allies or making a powerful attack, or shielding the ally or yourself. It's your choice what combination to prefer (hint: you aren't all alone, there will be friends, some from the very beginning, some later).As for the story, I just don't want to spoil it for you, but it's wery fun and enjoyable with all jokes, references for popular culture, dantists's twist plots... You'll see many absurd situations and many exapmles of wonderful wrinting. Seroiusly, it's good and not only for child's taste. I highly recommend to complete every quest and talk with everyone - dialogs are pretty hilarious here, really, you will have a good time. So, if you are kid in your heart or at least can be, try the Costume Quest. Despite all its humorous self, it tells a story about siblings, about people, who may fight and tell a pretty bad things, but they're still family. They still love each other, even if it take a monster invasion to understand such a simple fact. And if you still wondering: of course adults don't help children to fight monsters. When they ever did? *sigh* Adults.P. S. If you encounter sudden perfomance problems (characters move very-very slow), try to reboot your computer. Strange advice, but it helps me.			"

												I really enjoyed this game because it really captures a lot of the fun of the Halloween spirit that can be so easily ignored in favor of Christmas, especially for us adults who don't get much to do on Halloween unless we want to go to a bar or club.  Starting off, I'd say what builds this Halloween concept so well is all of the different nods to Halloween activities throughout.  This ranges from the bobbing for apples mini-game, collectible cards you can trade and swap for, gathering random household objects to build different costumes, going throughout different areas in town to attend various events (costume contest, various neighborhoods, etc.), dealing with a random bully/jerk, and of course going Trick-or-Treating.  I thought it was fun going to random doors, not knowing if you would receive a treat, in the form of gobs of candy, or a trick, in the form of a random battle.  A nice variation on the random battle aspect you normally get in RPGs.Battles are fairly straightforward and simple, with different costumes providing the player with options on which combat style and ultimate move they prefer to use.  Don't like trying to time your attack or hit the right button prompt once it appears on screen?  Then you will likely have an alternative to use instead, once you unlock enough costumes.  Sometimes different combat situations will require the player to mix and match to get the right combination, but since this game lacks grinding (since enemies don't respawn) there is always some way to get through your current fight.  Early and mid-game fights were sometimes hard to get through since I'd need to avoid making any mistakes (especially when going against 3 baddies at once), since it was so easy for them to just kill off one of my guys and make it so I couldn't win the fight at all.  Otherwise though, I saw nothing wrong in the combat as it had just the right balancing, for me at least.The game has fun and witty dialogue, which compels the player to explore and talk with various NPCs.  Sometimes navigating the map can be a bit annoying, but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad.  It does help having the robot roller skates on to zip around at turbo speed, a thankful addition since most games like this have you plod around at a constant speed.  You even get to pick between being the boy or girl, without one or the other being obvious eye ""candy."" *pun intended*Overall, I would recommend this game.  It doesn't offer much for replayability, but it's worthy of a full playthrough.			"

I played it straight through, and then once more because of a missed achievement.It only takes a few hours to complete really, but you won't notice.The animations are good, lots of attention to detail, funny dialogue and overall just a good story with a sweet message.Most of us became our costumes as kids so it's a concept that'll appeal to your inner child, without being an overly childish experience.Love it.

												I had some good fun with this game. You can either play it casually or just dive into it and go full Costume Quest. I like the idea of the game and the different costumes that they used. With the first area you also get a very nice Halloween feeling.The game looks pretty for the size of the game and the animations are nicely done. It obviously repeats very often and you might  find that more variety would have been good but its not the case here.The normal fights are not that hard and you should be able to win them with not much problems. Except if you are like me and forget to use stamps. The bosses can be tough without a strategy but are manageable.All in all I liked playing this game and can recommend it.			"

												So, I watched the video, looked at the screenshots and figured this might be a good game for the kids but I'll never get around to playing it....boy was I wrong!  Upon giving it a go I was stunned to find an incredibly simple yet thoughtful and FUN (remember when games were more fun than work?...well that is Costume Quest in a nutshell) game that provided a good few hours of entertainment and the closest the kids made it to the controller was watching Dad play as this is a game that I just had to devour all of the content for.The combat system is ridiculously simple for all bar a couple of big boss fights (which had me thinking about team dynamic and offensive/defensive strategies) but it was only starting to feel too repetitive as I was nearing the end of a full play through for 100% in a day.  A great game, well worth the money, love changing costumes - it's fun & I even found myself taking screenshots to look back and enjoy the costume battle transformations :)			"

★★★☆☆I almost feel bad for not joining the love the people - including friends and family - share for Double Fine and so also for this game, because I don't think this is perfect. I think its the best looking Double Fine game to date, with its very refined cell-shaded graphical style, but I think it's just too easy, and too short. Perhaps that's what this game is not about, as it seems that the festive atmosphere and the charm the world inherits from what Double Fine games are known for.My problem is that it's a short game that feels long, in a bad way. Of the 7 hours I spent playing this game (including the DLC), I felt like I was watching the same 3 battles play over again and again, without any feeling of commitment since the battles are so easy and simple. Each character has one  basic attack and a special attack that is usable in the 3 turn. But by the time I can use it, I most likely don't even need to use it, since one basic attack is enough to be succesful. You do get the option to add another action, like stunning or poisoning, but I found those not necessary, even after using them. In fact, I used the buffs that would increase attack power and the ability to counterattack so the fights are over within 2 or 3 turns.Another small quirck, that some other reviewers also mentioned, is the fast-crolling, automated dialogues (though, mostly just in cutscenes). The is no voice-acting, but only texts. The problem that you can easily miss parts of the text when you're destracted at all. I don't read fast or slow, but I was still somewhat annoyed with this text speed.Despite the lack of difficulty and the monotonous combat, I still enjoyed the game for the look and character. Try it out when you feel like taking a break a night or two from the stress you might endure from your regular life.Edit: during a sale you can get this game (including the DLC) for a mere 1 buck. Though I wouldn't recommend this for a full 10 bucks, I do think it's definitely worth it for such a low price.			"

												Costume Quest is easily one of my favourite games. It's a very simple game, doesn't take very long to 100% completely finish it  (I wrapped the main game and its DLC in 12 hours - and I tend to fool around in games a lot). The gameplay is great, the story and dialogue are fun and engaging, and the simplicity of it all is very refreshing in a sense. It is such an enjoyable game that I wish it gave you 50+ hours of gameplay, but it doesn't, and that's okay. It's fun, well made and written, and I enjoyed every moment of the experience. That's what matters. It really is a gem, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to the most hardcore of gamers.			"

												Double Fine is a bit like Pixar. They bring a certain magic and charm to all of their products. Most of their games are quite humorous and the stories are creative and unpredictable.So if Double Fine is Pixar, Costume Quest is Double Fine's ""Cars."" It's not a bad game. The premise is nifty and the jokes will make you grin, but there are just better showings if you want the Double Fine experience. Costume Quest takes place on Halloween, and you are a kid who has to rally some friends to trick-or-treat your way through town to save your sibling. It's colorful and delightful, like playing an old-school Nickelodeon cartoon. But after about an hour the old school Nickelodeon is overshadowed by the old school RPG game mechanics, which are repetitive and don't provide much actual decision-making or challenge. The story is divided into three beautiful set pieces, but again, the game play in each set piece is identical. Same main tasks, same exact sidequests, and the costumes you collect for monster fights aren't varied enough in their abilities to matter.If you love Double Fine and you're very tolerant of JRPG-style gameplay, you'll probably have fun, but I wouldn't make this your first Double Fine game. Psychonauts is the one to go with.			"

												I almost bought Costume Quest 2 this past sale -- before playing Costume Quest 1, which I've had in my library for quite some time. I'm glad I didn't buy the sequel which is billed as much of the same. After playing Costume Quest 1 to 100% completion, I have no desire to ever revisit it or play the sequel.Is it a bad game? No, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of turn-based fights with QTE-like button presses. The art style is cute, the Halloween theme whimsical, the story is sufficient. However, the turn-based combat with unskippable animations gets very old very fast. In addition, the surprising lack of voiceovers is very disappointing; the game's story and interactions would have been much improved with spoken dialog.If you're on the fence, watch a few Let's Play videos on YouTube in order to get a feel for the plot and the combat. My mistake was simply buying on the strength of the studio (Double Fine) and the majority of positive reviews. All-in-all, I'd say the game is like Halloween candy: it's sweet but ultimately will make you sick if you have too much of it.			"

												Ahh, Tim Schaffer's company ""Double Fine"" creates a ""light"" RPG adventure game revolving around kids and Halloween. Crossing the style of South Parks ""Fun with Weapons"" episode with Final Fantasy, the powers come from the costumes that each wear. A Robot with strengthened attack power, a knight with heightened defense, the statue of liberty with powers to heal the whole team. There are a total of around 9 costumes, but each only has one ""ultimate"" power.The ideas behind the game are great, the setting really puts the player in the minds of the children, how they think- even there is no voice acting, the feeling and emotions are brought out wonderfully.Story lacks depth, idea being that some witch or other is stealing candy to help her get to some other country where she can take over. It felt something that a kid thought up. At the start of the game, your twin gets kidnapped, and this is the only time I ever felt any kind of real connection to it.The art-style reinforces the setting of playing in a kids world, big eyes, very cartoony.Gameplay is either adventuring around looking for cases, hitting anything for candy (even getting candy from trash cans!), or spent in the battle sequence, where very ""Final Fantasy"" style gameplay commences. Unfortunately, both modes get old very quickly.The adventure part feels like a very ""dark"" Zelda game. It's not bad, but not great either. There were times where paths were too difficult to be seen, or understood. Finding the cases in the Mall, or even the hill on the final stage, where I thought fallen trees had stopped me walking up. (took me 3-4 hours just checking online as I thought it was a bug, or checking if I missed something). ""Trick or Treating"" became old in the first half of the game with no variation, which brings me to the...Battle sequence. This is where the action happens. Unfortunately, each costume only has one ultimate, as stated earlier. Also each person has one ""battle stamp"", which gives them a ""counter"", ""stun"", etc. Basically one trait that helps the character regardless of costume worn. Like the adventuring part, this becomes very stale from the second stage and begins to feel just like a waste of time for the player.All in all, for the experienced RPG player, this is very lack-luster. An even SIMPLER version of ""Final Fantasy Mystic Quest"" on the Super Nintendo comes to mind. So for children, this game would be a great purchase to introduce them to the genre of RPG.Other reviews stating that this game is ""too short"", may be correct. But with so little variation with Gameplay, AND a lack-luster story, I'd have to say it's a little too long.Pros:The universe is nice and well brought out by its use of graphics and sound / music.Great ideas put on the table.Nice bits of humorCons;Adventure sections too dark and sometimes difficult to navigateLacking gameplay and depth, game gets old very quickly.Overall;I give this a very average 50-60%It feels that with all of the great ideas that were put onto the table, about half of the potential was made. I'm not sure if it was a rushed project or anything, as the music and sound was perfect, but it would be nice to see what would have happened if the developer had gone the extra mile.As it is, I can only recommend this game for younger gamers who you'd like to introduce the RPG genre- outside the world of Pokemon			"

												I'm not saying that this is a horrible game. It's a great fun game. The art, animation, story, audio and style are all great. I just don't like how much gameplay there isn't.The gameplay is repetive and I'm the type of person who loves gameplay and nudges off everything else.When you play in the starting area, the town, you go around to houses trick-or-treating, and fighting a monster every now and then. You buy upgrades/perks, do some side quests and progress through a story. I feel like that part is really repetitive, fighting monsters. I guess if you like the Final Fantasy series, then you'll like this game.But after playing through the first area. the neighborhood, then you already have an idea of how to game is going to be like till the end, gameplaywise.

												A little more than half-way through the game I realized that all I had ever wanted out of life was to be a unicorn. For however short a time, this game made that possible. Every time I went into battle, I said the words, ""♥♥♥♥ you, I'm a unicorn,"" out loud in the dark stillness of my apartment. I didn't want to, but it was a compulsion I could not ignore. That's an experience worth having. So buy this game because ♥♥♥♥ you, I'm a unicorn, and other reasons as well.			"

												Super linear with the illusion of choice and control. It's like an extremely dumbed-down version of any of the Final Fantasy games. Plays like a game made for kids but designed for grown-ups. But you like this one not for the way the game plays. It's about the story and the atmosphere. (I mean, this is a Double Fine game after all). But it's a very good time, definitely. Don't get me wrong. I love the trick-or-treating atmosphere. The fighting. The odd humor. And the fact that there is no voice-acting, just silence and text (this is really creepy, in a good but unintentionally Lynchian way). Get the expansion/DLC too. It's loads of fun!			"

												CQ is another great game from double fine.The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt  to save their little town from monsters at halloween. It is all told through the use of ""speech bubbles"" around key characters. The game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs. I've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.The 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the ""feel"" of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.The soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.This game includes both CQ and it's DLC ""grubbins on ice"". GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.			"

												This game was a heap of fun! It puts a nice little twist on traditional turn-based RPGs, the story is simple but the dialogue was hilarious, I was cracking up the whole day just couldn't put the controller down!Speaking of controllers, the main problem with it was how obnoxious the rumble in it is when you play with a controller, and the fact you don't have the option to shut it down. I don't have anything against rumble itself, but it kept disconnecting my controller everytime it rumbled over and over, until finally the other day I was able to make it stop disconnecting my controller, had to use x360ce and such to do that. That's all though, nothing against the game itself can't wait to play the sequel ^^			"

I grinned like an idiot throughout much of the entire, just-long-enough experience.Broken down, you and your annoying sibling go off trick-or-treating until suddenly, MONSTERS! When your brother/sister is nabbed, you must retrieve them at all costs.Set against the backdrop of a neighbourhood on Halloween, you travel across a town battling no-goodniks in a modified turn-based battle system. The powers you have in each fight are determined by the costume you're wearing. Costumes are acquired through standard adventure gameplay, but some cool ones are secret... can you find everything the game has to offer?			"

												Custom Quest is a short adventure with a noticeable mark for cheesiness and some sort of humor. It's an enjoyable game, the thing is that both due the mechanics and plot choices the game really shows which kind of system it was developed for (consoles/mobile consoles). Overall the gameplay is kind of very repetitive, you end doing the same kind of thing in a few different levels (+1 with Grubbins on Ice). The chars skills do vary and the plot somewhat works but in the end you tend to: loot around-> knock at the houses -> start a fight -> and again loot around. In the end it's fun, the visual style is remarkable, and the animations are funny. It's worth playing, but it could've been better.			"

												A game about the fantasy of children who can use ""special abilities"" and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented.Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy.The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at.You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.

												Simple, charming RPG. Lighthearted story, if rather simplistic and borderline repetitive, but not long enough to warrant complete burnout. This would make an excellent first RPG for a parent to introduce their child to the genre and play alongside, if they so desire.To those looking for something a little more involved, there's not a whole lot beneath the surface, so it may not be your cup of tea.

												CQ is another great game from double fine.The story follows a brother and sister as they attempt  to save their little town from monsters at halloween. It is all told through the use of ""speech bubbles"" around key characters. The game is pretty reminiscent of JRPGs, but without any specific classes or skills, just leveling and different constumes with different abilities. When playing the game, you're penned in to one of a few key areas. These areas are pretty large though, so there's always a fair amount to explore, such as finding hidden coffins [rather than chests], and quests to complete. When you encounter a monster, you'll be thrown into a fight scene very similar to those used in JRPGs. I've played this game with a controller and with keyboard/mouse. Given my experiences, and the fact that this was originally for consoles, I would definitely recommend using a controller to play it. However, keyboard/mouse also works well.The 3d model graphics are very cartooney, but very good as this fits well with the concept of using speech bubbles when characters are talking. They give a very nice impression of the ""feel"" of halloween. The design of the kids is also very good, although there could have been more diversity in the adult characters. It would have been nice if the camera wasn't locked in to a specific angle, however.The soundtrack to this game is simple and not very overbearing when you're in the environment, which us good, but the music during cutscenes can get a bit repetitive. There is a distinct lack of voice acting, and I did feel that the game was a bit let down by this lack, but this didn't detract too much from my enjoyment. You may be in trouble if you can't read speech bubbles.This game includes both CQ and it's DLC ""grubbins on ice"". GOI is much of the same high quality, but set in winter.CQ is a very good game, if quite short. It's not extremely challenging, but it has a very good story and art style. Definitely worth playing if you want a simple JRPG type game, or are a fan of double fine.			"

What it does have is a nice atmosphere, great tongue in cheek humor and a story line that is fun and didn't were out its welcome. I'd say I was only a slight bit bothered that you are unable to skip the combat intro's, which get somewhat repetive after a while. Definitely give it a try when you can get it in a sale!			"

												Costume Quest is a good game and definitely worth $10. This game reminded me A LOT of South Park Stick of Truth to the point that I actually wondered if the South Park team had used Costume Quest as an influence when they created their game. That being said, obviously the actual story and dialogue is very different to Stick of Truth. For one, the kids aren't swearing constantly, for two nobody is getting anything shoved up the rear region and for three there is no spoken dialogue. I was really on the fence about there being no voice actors in this game. What I enjoy about Double Fine Production games is that their characters are really likeable and they take the time to show you a little bit about everyone in your world, even the guy that you see for one second will have a funny line and a nice costume. Here I felt that was not necessarily absent but not as prevelent when compared to other Double Fine games like Psychonauts. I wanted to hear the kids voices especially in cut scenes where the dialogue is bouncing between 5 different people. It just would have made it easier to follow. Obviously it's not like you're constantly reading, this isn't a visual novel, it's just something that I would change. The characters are still likable and the story keeps you motivated to continue to the end.What I liked the most about this game is that it's funny! It's fun! It's lighthearted! The art style is great. The world is detailed and immersive. The turn-based fighting avoids becoming repetitive because every now and then you get a new costume and a new set of awesome moves that come with it. Everytime I got a new costume I would call my boyfriend over so we could watch it's ultimate ability and high 5 afterwards because 90% of the time it was FREAKIN AWESOME! Heck I even took one of the ultimates and put in on 9GAG because it rocked my world.http://9gag.com/gag/aLPeW75What's more, you get Grubbins on Ice which is about an extra 1 - 2 hours of gameplay after you've completed Costume Quest. It's equally as fun and provides a great ending leaving you wanting to purchase Costume Quest 2 so you can see what happens. To complete both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice should take 7 - 10 hours depending on how into unlocking achievements you are. It's also the type of game that you can play again after a year or two. Oh and also, if anyone from Double Fine reads this: Thanks for adding the Psychonauts music in the Camping Store at the Mall. It made me smile <37.5/10			"

												A game about the fantasy of children who can use ""special abilities"" and fight monsters with their Halloween costumes. The idea is great and very well implented.Basically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy.The game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at.You could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.

												Utterly charming. I grinned like an idiot throughout much of the entire, just-long-enough experience.Broken down, you and your annoying sibling go off trick-or-treating until suddenly, MONSTERS! When your brother/sister is nabbed, you must retrieve them at all costs.Set against the backdrop of a neighbourhood on Halloween, you travel across a town battling no-goodniks in a modified turn-based battle system. The powers you have in each fight are determined by the costume you're wearing. Costumes are acquired through standard adventure gameplay, but some cool ones are secret... can you find everything the game has to offer?			"

												Probably the cutest game Double Fine has ever made, with a fantastic premise and decent execution. It's short but the length is nice for what it is, there are numerous laugh-out-loud moments with the dialogue, the environments are detailed and look quite nice, and the plot, while simple, is pretty enjoyable. The game is very easy in terms of its turn-based battles, so if you're looking for a challenge, look somewhere else. I do think it works very well as an ""introductory RPG"", though, and can be used to teach newcomers to the genre about basic RPG tactics like prioritizing enemies, diversifying your party's classes, making strategic decisions about abilities, and choosing when to use special moves so they will be most effective. A solid game that makes for a fun Halloween night.			"

It's a full on RPG with a charming artstyle, great music, fun gameplay, and a lovable team of monster slaying children (seriously, the idea of putting on an adorable costume and then transforming into the the actual thing it was based off of was an epic idea :P). If you're sick of playing horror games during the Halloween season and just want a cute and fun game to play, look no further than Costume Quest!			"

												Costume Quest is one of my favorites - unique and dripping with the innocence of halloween most of us are too old to experience anymore, it's the type of game that makes you smile on its premise and presentation alone. Throw in fun - if simple - game mechanics, good humor, endearing characters and a plot out of a saturday morning cartoon: it's a really good package, and as something I can replay every year, it's more-than worth the TEN dollar asking price.At its core it's a super simple turn-based RPG, but even its RPG mechanics have fun mechanics much like those from the original Paper Mario. You can fare better in battle with timed button presses to increase damage and defense. There are battle stamps that work like the badges from Paper Mario, which give each character a boost or a special command. It's really not that deep, but the fights are just difficult enough to require some kind of strategy. Not because they're complex or anything, but because the enemies will simply overpower you with force if you don't have a battle stamp equipped and aren't successful with the timed button presses.For example - the Statue of Liberty costume has a special attack (which charge up through using regular attacks) that heals the party a small amount. It's a very small amount, but it can make or break a fight. The game is good about pitting you against enemies that are just a little bit tougher than your party, so you can't just breeze through them. There are also no random battles: all enemies appear on the screen, unless you meet them through trick-or-treating, and they don't regenerate - so there is a set number of battles per zone. This works well with the mechanics, as there are set items and experience you earn from the enemies you fight. That means you really must fight every enemy in the zone to get the full amount of experience, candy (currency) and items afforded to you. You move between transitional dungeons and hub zones, where you have to trick-or-treat at houses or stores to progress through the story. You won't be able to do that all right away, though - you'll need to do random quests for kids around the zones, collect candy, bob for apples, trade stuff, and find parts to make new costumes which grant you new field abilities, so you can progress further. The zones are really detailed and oozing with character - they're fun to run around and don't usually outstay their welcome. My only gripes are without a map, it can be hard to find that one last house you need to trick-or-treat at to progress the story, or that one last enemy you need to fight. Also some of the dungeons drag on a little bit - but as I write below, if you're finding the game to drag, you probably just need to take a break.The plot is simple - your sister is kidnapped and you have to find her. There are goblins running around, but the adults think they're just kids in costumes. The goblins want candy for some reason, there's a main villain witch, etc. etc. It's really cute, and serviced by some great humor. The game is almost south-parkian in the way that the kids have gotten over their heads in a very real situation to which the adults are totally oblivious. It makes it funnier when the adults names are all literally ""grown up"". Costume Quest is a game to play in small spurts, as otherwise the mechanics will begin to get repetitive and you'll lose sight of the charm and atmosphere that makes the game so enjoyable. When I say repetitive, I mean the combat and actual field exploration can, yes, get really samey. It's best to play maybe half a zone at once and then take a break. You really owe it to this game and yourself to enjoy every minute of it, and that can't happen if you're just going through the motions. Costume Quest is a gem. It captures the feel of Halloween perfectly and if you're in the right mood, it can make you feel like a kid again. Like you really are out trick-or-treating with some friends, in a world of make-believe. Buy this, play it (during halloween), and then play the Grubbins on Ice DLC (that comes with it) during Christmas. I haven't actually played the Grubbins on Ice DLC yet, but I've heard great things about it. Albeit - it's a short little extra side-story that only take a few hours.			"

												The Paradox's review on: Costume Quest NOTICE: Verdict on bottom of this review. My quick notes to the devsWhere to start...  first, I must say that I got this game by a coupon and stumbled apon it quite randomly.  I MUST  say that this game is  AMAZING!  This game brought out my inner childhood of pretending that I was a Jedi or a ninja on halloween and you guys put all of it in a game! One of the best games I've ever played! Thank you Double Fine! Summary Costume quest is a cute animated game that is a turn-based RPG Halloween game! Your goal, to save your (brother or sister, your choice) from the evil candy stealing Grubbins! You may free-roam around the (actually) large 3 areas that the game provides you to search for your sibling, collect battle stamps, trading cards, costumes, Trick or Treat (A MUST :)), battle Grubbins, and find new friends! There is all sort of neat little things that the creators put in for you to find for yourself! The dialog is absolutely a belly-rumbler and the controls are crisp and easy to use! At the end of  Costume Quest  the creators decided to throw in the DLC Grubbins on Ice which adds on to the orignal quest and is also quite entertaing as well! If you are a teen or an adult, this game will surely touch your childhood in one way or another! The good!  Controls are on point for this game, even with a controller! The graphics are very cute and clean! This game his it's own style on graphics and runs very well on  ANY  Computer. Gameplay and storyline gets right into action immediantly and never declines in action during the whole game! Although the game does not come with voices, the dialog is quite funny! Very good setting! Music helps improve the mood and the atmosphere. No doubt makes up for the lack of in-game voice-overs. A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! Achievements are real easy to achieve if you finish the story carefully. A  TOTAL  bang for your buck! The Bad!  Although dialog is good, in-game voices would help A short campaign and DLC will only put you at about 20 hours to 100% completion. Familar battles may get a bit annoying, but no too much. The  Ugly  AMAZING A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! The Verdict Overall this game is amazingly entertaining and fun to play for all ages! While the game may have a few minor flaws, like no voices and it's length, it makes up with no doubt with good graphics, sounds, entertaining storyline, neat details, and epic quest! It's a must have in your steam library! Good job Double Fine!

												Costume Quest is a carefully distilled J-RPG with a well written, light hearted story and solid gameplay. It's a good pick-up-and-play game in a genre that usually requires days of investment, with likeable characters and just enough depth. Normally, quick-action sequences ruin the pacing of a game for me, but they are well implemented here in a way that feels almost intuitive, if still a bit repetetive, after a few battles. When the main storyline wraps up, the included Grubbins on Ice add-on storyline lets you start with all your stuff from the main quest, and includes new costumes (character classes) and stamps (bonus abilities). I'd recommend this for kids or adults who don't need dimension-spanning save-all-of-time-and-space plots, ridiculously complex leveling systems, or spiky-haired, ambiguously gendered anti-heroes in their J-RPGs.

												Don't let the Saturday morning cartoon art and story fool you (this game is not really suitable for most young kids), this is pretty close to an old school turn base JRPG, albeit a lite version. Think FF3 with it's job system and a dash of QTE for DMG/DEF and you get an idea of what to expect. Finding the right combo of costumes and battle stamps that compliment the party is key (to boss battles mostly), although I did find one combo that was a little to OP. Also fast QTE reflexes can be a boon for survivability.That said, sadly since it's not a high budget game, it's pretty short and not very deep in story and the battle system, but all in all it was fun and I had more than a few good laughs. I literally had a smile on my face the whole way through. So, if you like old school JRPG gaming and enjoy silly/zany cartoons do yourself a favor and check it out.			"

As per usual, the design is drawn in a slightly infantile fashion, but makes it all the more adorable. The story is enjoyable for children and adults that still are part child themselves. The combat is turn-based and can be varied by wearing different costumes and some other power-ups. Fans of Double Fine games will be pleased by allusions to other of their titles within the game. I won't give it away, so play it yourself. It counts about 5 hours and the DLC is another approximate two hours. Really enjoyable!			"

There is all sort of neat little things that the creators put in for you to find for yourself! The dialog is absolutely a belly-rumbler and the controls are crisp and easy to use! At the end of  Costume Quest  the creators decided to throw in the DLC Grubbins on Ice which adds on to the orignal quest and is also quite entertaing as well! If you are a teen or an adult, this game will surely touch your childhood in one way or another! The good!  Controls are on point for this game, even with a controller! The graphics are very cute and clean! This game his it's own style on graphics and runs very well on  ANY  Computer. Gameplay and storyline gets right into action immediantly and never declines in action during the whole game! Although the game does not come with voices, the dialog is quite funny! Very good setting! Music helps improve the mood and the atmosphere. No doubt makes up for the lack of in-game voice-overs. A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! Achievements are real easy to achieve if you finish the story carefully. A  TOTAL  bang for your buck! The Bad!  Although dialog is good, in-game voices would help A short campaign and DLC will only put you at about 20 hours to 100% completion. Familar battles may get a bit annoying, but no too much. The  Ugly  AMAZING A rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! The Verdict Overall this game is amazingly entertaining and fun to play for all ages! While the game may have a few minor flaws, like no voices and it's length, it makes up with no doubt with good graphics, sounds, entertaining storyline, neat details, and epic quest! It's a must have in your steam library! Good job Double Fine!

That happened to me and then I thought that I should probably play the game. So I did and I found it to be an immersive RPG that should not be over looked. The whole concept of this game is great its something original combining turn based strategy with humour and Halloween. It is something that is definitely worth playing.			"

												Costume Quest is a very cute RPG-like game by Double Fine, the makers of Psychonauts and Stacking. As per usual, the design is drawn in a slightly infantile fashion, but makes it all the more adorable. The story is enjoyable for children and adults that still are part child themselves. The combat is turn-based and can be varied by wearing different costumes and some other power-ups. Fans of Double Fine games will be pleased by allusions to other of their titles within the game. I won't give it away, so play it yourself. It counts about 5 hours and the DLC is another approximate two hours. Really enjoyable!			"

												Costume Quest is a carefully distilled J-RPG with a well written, light hearted story and solid gameplay. It's a good pick-up-and-play game in a genre that usually requires days of investment, with likeable characters and just enough depth. Normally, quick-action sequences ruin the pacing of a game for me, but they are well implemented here in a way that feels almost intuitive, if still a bit repetetive, after a few battles. When the main storyline wraps up, the included Grubbins on Ice add-on storyline lets you start with all your stuff from the main quest, and includes new costumes (character classes) and stamps (bonus abilities). I'd recommend this for kids or adults who don't need dimension-spanning save-all-of-time-and-space plots, ridiculously complex leveling systems, or spiky-haired, ambiguously gendered anti-heroes in their J-RPGs.

												This is a SUPER cute and charming RPG. It's short but sweet, the battles are pleasantly paced and aren't random, and it's got a lot of personality and funny dialogue. The battles have a lot of quick-time events, but you can generally afford to whiff them, and it adds a nice ""visceral"" feel to the flow of combat. The battle system is simple, but still engaging, and there's a decent variety of costumes to switch between. I also appreciate the music and the art style and the lack of voice acting. Has some nice puzzly aspects to it too. Exploring and collecting candy and bashing everything with your Halloween bucket is very addictive and satisfying.And the free DLC, Grubbins on Ice, is a great addition that adds another, say, 2 hours to the game in the form of a new area to explore that continues from the base game.Overall, if you have an RPG itch you want to scratch but without having to dump 70 hours and endure long introductions/expositions/worldbuilding, or if you want to get into a festive mood, this is a simple and fun game for that. This is a perfect example of an RPG without a bunch of padding, short, sweet, simple fun, and a good game for all ages that really captures the spirit of Halloween and childhood imagination.			"

												I didn't know exactly what to expect when I installed Costume Quest. I was a big fan of Tim Schafer games when I was a kid (Grim Fandango and Full Throttle are some of my favorite 90s video game memories), but found Double Fine ventures like the much-loved Psychonauts to be marred by either clunky gameplay or hideous art decisions.  But Costume Quest proves that Tim Schafer's still got it, and within 20 minutes I was a fan again.Sure, the game doesn't employ high-end graphical techniques, the traditional JRPG style combat moves can take too long, and the game is quite short. It doesn't have a ""deep"" story, and doesn't really try to say much, either. But the subtley perfect art, the cute-but-not-sickeningly-so character designs, and witty dialog overcome any shortcomings.It's not complex, but it's one of the most ""perfect"" games I've played in years.Recommended to anyone with good taste, and essential to any gamer who remembers what the 90s was like.

												I liked the theme for this game. It did a great job on showing what it was like to celebrate Halloween as kids. There are a lot of collectables, but the only ones you can use are the costumes and battle stamps. The combat is very basic for a RPG. You have 1 normal attack and 1 special attack. No items, spells, or anything else. The only things you can influence the battle with is what costume you pick and stamp you have equipped. It is also one of the easiest RPGs ever made. I never got a game over and 1 of my characters might of died twice in the whole game.The game lasts about 7 hours; including the free DLC that comes with the game.			"

												This is one of the few games I've played through multiple times and enjoyed the ride each trip.It's a short, turn based RPG with quirky characters, Psychonaut-esque graphics (yay, Double Fine!), and a fairly entertaining story.The combat system isn't all that exciting and if you're a person that doesn't like to switch between costumes/character builds, odds are it'll grow tiresome quickly.Still though - if you like Double Fine, weird characters, good humor, and decent gameplay, you can't go wrong.

It's cute, funny and occasionally touching and you should definitely watch a gameplay video to see how it plays before you decide if you want it....			"

												Costume Quest is a cute little casual game with a great sense of humor. Although the gameplay is very simplistic and the fighting system is fairly boring the short game length and funny dialog makes it forgivable.The game starts you as an aspiring trick or treater. Unfortunately disaster strikes when your sibling is abducted by goblins and you have to go rescue him/her. The game plays quite simply, you have to goto various house to trick and treat which gives you candy, the game's currency. You battle goblins and other monsters as you go along and through completion various quests you unlock new costumes.The combat plays quite simple. Yourself and 2 companions go into battle each wielding a costume that will grant them different powers and you then take turns attacking the enemies until one side is killed off. Each costume has only one regular attack and one special move they can perform every three turns but to try and break up the monotone a little each attack requires you to perform a quicktime event to maximize your damage.The graphics are fairly simple but the style is sharp and the locations have a great Halloween look to them which really helps. The sound and music is nothing impressive but it doesn't detract anything from the experience either.All in all it's a cute little that gives you a few hours of fun however the simple gameplay and short length means it's only worth getting as a bargain title.

												So, I'd like to say I've been putting off buying this game for ages.Literally, ages. What happened was with the recent summer sale in June, I bought the bundle of both games for 6$.Heres what I have to say,++ GREAT humor and storyline, (""Gus from section 5, your wife is worried SICK."" and the kid in a banana suit who said, ""This is a total banana-fest"". LOL.++ really lovely backgrounds, ++also you get to choose if you wanna be a girl or boy, which was not what I was expecting when I saw ""your sister does this"" and etc.,The game itself is really short which is a bummer to me. It has four levels, but they're all long in their own way. You have to trick or treat and solve an issue in each level, and you can play hide-and-seek (well its optional actually), and they'll upgrade your trick or treat bags to cuter and cooler things, you can make optional costumes in the game which can have a big effect on your battle; (I'm not a battling kind of person, but this game was fun and cute.) Battle stamps are the best. The Grubbin's on Ice was really interesting too, its an add on to the game's ending.I just feel sad its a bit short for me.Just a bit over 8 hours and I've finished it with all with all achivements to boot with no guide.You shouldn't need a guide for this game! It's fun and good like that!			"

												I was extremely surprised that one of the least discussed Double Fine games would end up being this good. The strength of the title resides in this childish innocence that enthralls the player, making him see the world behind the awe-inspiring lens of youth. Even if the rpg elements are barebone (à la Mario RPG), I also enjoyed the small gimmick of using the equipment to solve adventure-like situations. Suggested for a fast, laid-back experience.			"

It plays like a really simple stripped down JRPG, just set around halloween instead of around the coming of the great big evil that wipes out the world. You pick up party members, extra outfits that change play style, and it's a nice simple story with some half-decent mini-games. If you've already gotten a few RPGs under your belt you'll likely be bored out of your mind, but as I said a great ""my first JPRG"" for kids around 8-12 yrs old.			"

Combat is turn-based, and consists of attacking and defending. It's a very very simple turn-based RPG. You have quests, you have an item slot and you can level-up but it's all so very shallow.

												This game features some big problems. The biggest two being there is no map screen, and the battle system is so stupidly simple, it's actually pretty offensive.Map screen however, is the biggest issue with this game. The neighborhood is LARGE, and is VERY easy to get lost in. With no easily accessible way to see where you're going, it's too easy to get lost in. Do you need to make it so that objectives are on the map? No. But a way should be included so you can at least figure out where you currently are, and where you have already explored.The Battle System litterally consists of 2 buttons... A basic attack and an ultimate attack. That's it. There's no strategy, no extra abilities, nothing.The story is at least interesting and the graphics are pretty good.If you're an older gamer, I would stay far away from this. There's nothing there for you. However, if you have a younger gamer you'd like to introduce to the RPG genre, this would be a good game for them.			"

												I always wanted to experience the Halloween when I was a kid. This game gave me exactly that. Because of this it is a very special game for me. Oh, also it's really funny, cute and cool (you'll see what i mean during your first battle). Recommended!-What is the opposite of giving up?-Taking down! (from Grubbins on Ice)			"

												I didn't ejoy too much this game for some aspects of it. First of all, this game is the same always, turn-based battles, looking for sweets, but battles are always the same. i haven't completed the whole game but I'm quite sure that if in 4 hours it doesn't change, it will not change after that...  Also for me is frustrating that sometimes even thought you do everything well in a battle you cannot win in any way because enemies are too high level. Apart from that, I loved how this game is designed, graphics are beautiful, costumes look great and abilities and powers from these are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend this game just because I felt so frustrated playing it and i quited. Maybe some day i will finish it but i think i will not do it at the moment...			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review I really enjoyed this game. The story and characters are fun and pristine. The creative art-style works well with the beautiful cell shaded graphics. And as a plus the PC version comes with the DLC Grubbins on Ice for free. The only issues that I have with the game is that the frame-rates are capped at 30fps and that ending of Grubbins on Ice is a cliffhanger. Double Fine Productions have stated that the game engine can't handle 60fps but they may one day have an update that fixes this. All in all this is a great game for all ages.  "

												Costume Quest is much like Halloween candy: fun-sized and sweet.  Though it’s not a long game, it’s very enjoyable and it doesn’t overstay its welcome.  It employs JRPG elements that are reminiscent of the Paper Mario games and the mechanics are simple and accessible.  But the big draw is the charm that is stuffed into every aspect of the story and characters.  I thoroughly recommend joining Reynold and Wren in saving Halloween no matter what time of year it is.

												I've first played Brutal Legend, and now Costume Quest. Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings.Costume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid! Essencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister. So, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way.That sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.The game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat. In combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks. Each costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them. There are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle.You have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.I didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow.To its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.Outside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests. There are quite a few ""secrets"" and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!Besides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat.The various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!The graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for.Music was up there as well, really enjoyed it!Most of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!So... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well.But that's my biggest complain with this game. Other than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.It looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively. It's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist!I'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!			"

												Costume Quest is a classic RPG with turn-based combat mixed with Double Fine style. You play a child out on halloween teaming up with other kids and fighting monsters, all while trick-or-treating.  Instead of the usual RPG equipment, the halloween costumes you wear transform into full size versions during combat, providing their associated powers to your characters.  It all meshes together perfectly, as you would expect from a Double Fine game.I'm not sure what else there is to say.  It's cute, charming, and a solid RPG experience that doesn't feel dull and repetitive like many of these types of RPGs do.  My only complaints are that the controls are a bit sluggish and the game is locked at 30 fps which will hopefully be addressed in a patch now that Double Fine has the rights to the game back.			"

												So before I start, THIS GAME IS MEANT FOR CHILDREN!! And I'm recommending it on that behalf, If you are a hardcore gamer THIS GAME ISN'T FOR YOU.Story (8/10)The story isn't bad for a children game, but it's a bit lame for older audience. A kid saves his sibling on Halloween night. a bit long and unrealistic (for one night), but it's fiction, so who cares. As an adult I liked the story at the beginning, but for a game meant for children it wasn't that simply put and the lack of audio narration makes a barrier between the child and the story.Sounds (6/10)This is one of the worst aspects of the game, and the reason for that is the lack of narration or sounding for the characters.In a game heavily based on story with a lot of dialogues, FOR CHILDREN I think that is a huge problem. What takes me 7 secs to read might take a child 1-2 mins to read, and that's a deal breaker.Other than that, the game has good in-game music, and atmospheric music when entering some danger zones made a good time for me, and I think will more for a child.Graphics (8/10)For a casual children game, the graphics are very good, I won't say they are mind blowing ones, but they are colourful enough to catch children's eyes, and decent enough for this type of games.Gameplay (8.5/10)I think the most interesting aspect of thi game -for children- is the gameplay. It's way complicated than the ordinary children game, but it's way simpler than a MOBA or RPG. I think this game might be a nice introduction for children to use controller (I haven't used one to test it to be honest). Also there's a lot of side objectives those are pretty interesting and the different interactions between different costumes (although it's not that great of a deal) may be one of the most challenging aspects for children.If I have a kid and I want him/her to start hardcore gaming this is where I might start.BUT... it's so repetitive in fights that for a hardcore gamer it'll be extremely lame. so be aware of that.Overall (7.8/10)If you are getting this game for a kid, I think it's a good gift, just be aware of the repetitiveness of it. And the kid may suffer because of the dialogue if the kid reads slowly. Other than that, the game is good. It has sequel that I haven't played so I don't know how much it has improved, but I hope they have fixed the issues I mentioned.I'll definitly recommend it for a child.P.S. I say this again... If you are hardcore gamer that only enjoys AAA games you shouldn't even consider this one....			"

												Take the worst Paper Mario game you can think of. Remove all of the items, character skills, partners, and so on. Limit your party to only one customization badge each. The combat is now reduced to only ""attack"", ""run away"", and ""limit break"".No specific enemy types to regret using a specific move on, no special properties to watch out for, just straight up hit, be hit, and occasionally get the rare opportunity for a one-shot heal or all-enemies attack, for hours on end.Sound like fun? No? Well somebody thought it was a good idea and made it anyway. That's this game. And sadly, this is one of the last games DoubleFine has made that was actually ""decent"" in any way, shape, or form.			"

												Costume Quest is a ""small"" INDIE RPG Game with a huge lovely atmosphere of Halloween. The game is short (you can enjoy it around 6~8 hours for both stories) but the story and the quests are so well made that you don't mind the shortness. Only the battles are boring after playing awhile, but for a INDIE RPG game they are still enjoyable - and you can press the animations away if you have seen it a 100th time. So if this game goes on STEAM Sale 75% you must buy it! Even for the full price (8,99€ at this time) it's worth of its money.Best INDIE RPG Game I've played so far			"

												Well after playing the game for a while I had to change my recomendation because I was lost in it's Cutzi ways. Well sometimes it was a bit to tough for my taste but only because I misunderstood the battelstamps, you have to assign one for each character or they do absolutly nothing. So it is an easy and charming game with some twits and nice sets of ceneries. So in all if you look for a satisfying game that is just like a vacation from all the hard games around here, pick this one. Expecially if you search for something cute to play over Halloween.The Negative Aspects:The problem is that the controls feel stiff, and that is pretty rare for a PC game. It feels more fluent with a controller with analog sticks but it is ruined by the quick time events. While in the keymenu where you can rebind the keys they are labeled with 1, 2, 3 and 4 and so on (Also some keys are not bindable and just bindthemselve as they feel like) in the game they are indicated with xbox360 controller keys. Which makes this game impossible to play with a PlayStation controller or any other not xbox360 controller, (except maybe an SNES controller but no analogsticks so the stiff feeling is back). And you may think, it can't be that bad with the keyboard, well you have to precisly manouver trough seom ramps while speeding up.Also I am very disapointed that there are no voice actors. I mean it is fine but the text scroles to fast and also the big bubbles block the view.			"

 An amazingly cute turn-base rpg with charming designsThis game is just to cute that it deservs a lawsuit, my heart almost melted of joy, not just for its charming level design, but for the storyline too.The story is pretty much about two brothers(twins) that only want to have THE best halloween of their lives by filling their little baskets with treats, sadly they stumb upon a candy theft operation set by a witch and her group of creeps who wants to steal all the candies to feed an evil lord, so she can be granted passage to their world.But an halloween wouldn´t be an halloween without good old Trick or Treat right?In this game, you dont just fight monsters, you are also able to knock doors and say the magic word for some extra sweets, but what i really REALLY love in this game is the dialogs, its funny and just adorable, also these kids have some balls, i remember being scared of monsters and adults in my childhood, but these kids face danger head on with cute foul languages, its funny to see them pick on each other.Definitely a must buy if you´re into turn-based, RPG or just down cute adventure games, i promise you wont regret it.Money well spend.

												Costume Quest is a Halloween-themed and RPG-ish adventure game with adorable graphics, detailed levels and thoroughly humorous dialogues.The story is rather simple: Your brother/sister gets kidnapped by candy-stealing monsters, so it's all up to you to rescue him/her and save Halloween.Over the course of the game you collect various costumes, each with it's own special ability, which you can equip on any of the 3 characters of your 'squad' to be as efficient as possible during the combat sequences.By collecting candy that is scattered throughout the levels you can also purchase battle stamps, which work as perks for your costumes and can enhance them with various abilities to make you even more powerful.The quests lack quite a bit of variety so, even though the levels vary, the quests themselves feel pretty repetitive after a while, but all in all it is a widely enjoyable game which sould keep you entertained for a solid 7-8 hours. I recommend to play it with a Xbox360 pad.			"

												I really love this game. It's cute and quite addicting. The combat is simple, yet sometimes I have to repeat a match quite some time cus I mess up on the combat/dodge. It's definately worth the money especially since I got it when CQ1&2 bundle was on sale for $1.99. Can't go wrong with that!			"

												Really enjoyed this game.Nothing amazing on the mechanics front, combat is essentially quick time events (not so bad as a core mechanic), so the skills is choosing a decent load out with your parties costumes. However, one will already be chosen for most fights due to it's main screen ability. This doesn't become much of a problem though, as nearly all the fights (bar the final) are rather easy.This joy of this game is that it's cute and funny, and enjoyable to play. Not the longest game, but I wouldn't have finished it if it had been, so is a welcome length.And that came off REALLY negative considering how muched I loved this. Let me stress, the style of this game is fantastic, and well worth a look. Will be more enjoyable if you enjoying hunting in corners for candy and costumes :)			"

												If you're a fan of RPG's and Halloween, then this game is a must play. I played and beat this back when it was released on PS3. In spirit of this year's Halloween, I decided to play it again. I was surprised that the expansion campaign was added for FREE, kudos. This isn't some complex RPG, but merely an ode to when we were kids. Imagine how a kid feels and sees the world when he's wearing a cardboard robot costume, only to transform into a huge robot in battle that can fire missles! It's a cute idea and implemented well. That combat system is very simple, but it'll keep your attention since you need to complete various tasks such as ""press button X"" at the correct time. Small sense of accomplishment when you finally gather all the materials for a new costume and test out their special attacks. Took me about 8 hours to complete, still very much worth the 2nd time around. A kid would have a blast with this game, yet it is also for the adult that is also a kid at heart.			"

												Well after playing the game for a while I had to change my recomendation because I was lost in it's Cutzi ways. Well sometimes it was a bit to tough for my taste but only because I misunderstood the battelstamps, you have to assign one for each character or they do absolutly nothing. So it is an easy and charming game with some twits and nice sets of ceneries. So in all if you look for a satisfying game that is just like a vacation from all the hard games around here, pick this one. Expecially if you search for something cute to play over Halloween.The Negative Aspects:The problem is that the controls feel stiff, and that is pretty rare for a PC game. It feels more fluent with a controller with analog sticks but it is ruined by the quick time events. While in the keymenu where you can rebind the keys they are labeled with 1, 2, 3 and 4 and so on (Also some keys are not bindable and just bindthemselve as they feel like) in the game they are indicated with xbox360 controller keys. Which makes this game impossible to play with a PlayStation controller or any other not xbox360 controller, (except maybe an SNES controller but no analogsticks so the stiff feeling is back). And you may think, it can't be that bad with the keyboard, well you have to precisly manouver trough seom ramps while speeding up.Also I am very disapointed that there are no voice actors. I mean it is fine but the text scroles to fast and also the big bubbles block the view.			"

												Okay, I'm not gonna judge the game unfairly since I haven't even played it for a full hour. But let me quickly list the pros and cons from what I noticed so far from that short gameplay:Pros: Cute original story, great to play during October or even Halloween if you wanna show off to your friends the game. It's hard to find decent RPGs out there that are unique and fun to play really. I give this one a 9/10Cons: The one problem I have with this game, reason why it didn't get 10/10 is on some scenes, the text bubbles go by automatically, and at some points, sometimes fast. I'm a fast typer, but my reading isn't bullet-fast. If this game could make it to where you can press ""Spacebar"" on ALL text bubbles (or at LEAST add the ability to enable or disable it in the Options settings), then this game would get that 10/10.Other than that, that's it. I'm sure I'll get around to finishing this game at some point, but I may just wait till next year around October. Have too many games on my plate as is I'm trying to knock off.			"

												If you would have asked me if it was possible to turn trick-or-treating into a fun video game, I would have laughed. But after playing Costume Quest, I'm simply left in awe. It is so clever, witty, and charming--a perfect game for kids or just the kid in you. The look, feel and gameplay is somewhat similar to On the Rain-slick Precipice of Darkness. There's a lot of thought that went into the costumes, quests, battle stamps, and the special attacks. I challenge all doubters to say they can't find an enjoyable game in here. Two thumbs up.			"

												Adventure/RPG-lite where, on your quest to save your little sister, you must find patterns and components used to make over a dozen costumes with useful battle powers and overworld effects that will get you further in the game.  You'll knock on doors and defeat baddies for candy you can use to buy powerups, bob for apples and eyeballs, and complete quests to earn rewards from the townsfolk.  Battle takes place on another screen where your characters are morphed into giant awesome versions of their costumes and combat is turn-based with timed button presses for bonus attack and defense. Difficulty is quite casual, but enough that your costume and powerup choices do have an effect on the outcome. Fun game to 100% and get the achievements for and a great port apparently because I didn't even realize it was a port.  The graphics are nice; didn't even have AA set up and someone asked me how I got AA working in my screenshots.  The game's about 6-8 hours long with DLC included.			"

												Costume Quest is a charming, heart-warming, hilarious, and well-crafted game. It is a nice little semi-RPG romp that can be completed in about 5 hours. The graphical style is extremely pretty and atmospheric. The sounds and music conjure up whimsical spookiness. The writing and story is superb, always giving a laugh yet pushing you forward. The gameplay consists of fun exploration around locales, attempting to trick-or-treat and also find all the secrets. There is also a fun but simple JRPG turn-based battle system implemented with wonderful “epic” battles on gorgeous set pieces. The only downside to speak of is that much of the dialogue automatically forwards itself, resulting in many missed lines unless you are a speed reader. Also, none of the dialogue is voiced, but that is only an issue because of how easy it is to miss certain lines.Overall, the game so perfectly captures the spirit of youthful exuberance and the pursuit of much candy! I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun, charming, and memorable experience!			"

												A very quite and simple game that flows very well. The text dialogue is quite funny (cute child-like humour). I get a chuckle everytime as my character transforms into the statue of liberty, and Lincoln's face floats across the screen. Overall, I'm satisified with my purchase, especially the cute humour that comes with it. The biggest con about the game are the controls. Moving your player feels very awkward. And it will not be very smooth if your computer uses the first generation Intel HD graphics.			"

												It's simple, addictive, short and sweet (pun intended) If you're looking for a compelling story, raw challenge or innovative game play... please look elsewhere.This game is meant as an introductionary game for RPG noobies. It takes elements from Mario RPG / Paper Mario with timed attacks, so the game tricks you in to thinking you're doing more than selecting ""Fight"" from a menu. The costumes are fun to change up, half of them are useless and impractical but they look cool.The challenge does ramp up a bit at the very end and the final boss can be very obnoxious if you don't bring a healing costume in with you. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy for it's job system and Paper Mario for it's timed button strikes, you'll enjoy this game.Only downside is how slow the game can be at times, having to watch repeated animations over and over before a battle begins... also it can be a tad clunky especially when using the dash feature from the Robot costume... This brings me to final point that it was bad game design on Double Fines part to allow this costume to dash and none of the others... It makes it manditory for you to utilize this first costume at all times meaning it doesn't give you much in the way of variety... Thankfully this was fixed in CQ2 with an actual dash button.The DLC Grubbin's on Ice is around the same length as one of the in game core chapters, 2 hours in length. Worthy addition to the game and links the events of CQ1 and 2 so it's basically manditory to play if you intend to continue your Costume Quest. :P			"

												5/10Costume Quest is a sweet looking little game, but you need to know what you're getting into. If you're looking for a Halloween themed ride, mostly being held by the hand and just relaxing, you might have fun. The problem is that the game offers no challenge, and grows very repetitive. There are three areas, each of them consisting of the same goals. There's a turn based fighting component but it's so easy that it's little more than an annoyance. It's a cute game for kids but I wouldn't recommend it to a 'gamer.'			"

												Great adventure/FF-combat hybrid from the amazing people at Double Fine. It is to Final Fantasy (and adventure games) what games like Deathspank are to Diablo: simplified, humorous, and story-driven derivations. Costume Quest may not necessarily be the hardest game out there, but it is thoroughly enoyable all the way through. Especially if you have fond nostalgic memories of trick-or-treating.The free dlc/expansion called ""Grubbins on Ice"" that comes with it is also fairly good (it is a sequel, so play it after), however I feel much of my personal enjoyment of the original game came from the accurate recreation of what Halloween used to feel like. I still think there is plenty of room for sequels, but I'd personally like to see a return to Halloween in a town as the primary theme next time. Neighborhoods still have a ton of room they could grow in terms of varying atmosphere and style, so I wouldn't say a sequel back in town would feel redundant.Both the original game and the expansion are full of DF-style humor, as well as lots of side tasks to keep you entertained. This is not a massive game, however, and can be 100% completed in less than ~8 hours (much less if you skip all the cutscenes). Still definitely worth the money, as the experience will leave you satisfied and wanting more.Also, as a diehard DF fan there were a few fantastic references (the Psychonauts shop music at the mall, the Stacking dolls in the mountains), not to mention all the pop-culture jokes.

												The premise of this RPG from the makers of cult classic Psychonauts is simple: You are a child whose halloween night is ruined when your twin sibling is abducted by monsters. In order to save them, you must utilize your never-explained ability to transform into whatever thing you are costumed as. Mecha, unicorn, vampire, a big box of french fries.. there's quite a selection to pick from.The combat itself is simple, traditional turn-based RPG fair with minor quick-time elements to get the most out of your attacks (and the least out of the enemy's) clearly intended to be accessible by players of any age, but anyone will enjoy the dramatic visuals and Double Fine productions brand of humor. The game's length is short, enough to occupy a couple days or one extreme halloween marathon. I finished the main content in six hours, and the included expansion in another two and a half.Expect to see the game on sale again next halloween for the pre-sale price of a big bag of candy.			"

												This is essentially a casual RPG for kids, but I'm reviewing it anyway as an adult.Costume Quest is a very short turn-based RPG, but the highlight of its features are what it doesn't have. It's devoid of pretty much any interesting game system. The slim turn-based combat system present is similar to the Final Fantasy games, but you'll get more depth out of Final Fantasy games or 99% of their copycats. All of the combat uses Quick Time Events as well, which gets old after the second or third combat encounter. Game balance is simple and a little skewed. The game can be difficult (but hardly) when you only have two party members, and its trivially easy once you have three.The overworld is linear. There's a tiny bit of exploration to be had, but not much. There are roughly four quests in the entire game, each repeated several times for each phase of the game: find a card off a monster (combat encounters), bob for apples (simple mini-game), trick or treat houses (random combat encounters), and find six hiding kids (semi-hidden on overworld).The game crashed a few times, and since there is no manual save feature at any time, I lost 15-20 minutes of progress each time. The game plays the same every time.There are costumes to get, which are your battle suits or ""classes"". Variation here is only relevant in the costume's ""special ability"" but the game is so easy that once you have three party members, battle strategy matters little.Graphics meh, sound meh, witty dialogue is OK but not astounding. No voice acting.I don't recommend this game. You can find much better games in all of its genres for cheaper.  If you insist on wanting it, it's worth $2-3 on a sale perhaps. My playtime says 16 hours but that included a long idling session by accident. It's a 5-7 hour game. I'm surprised this game has a sequel. It's popularity seems dependent on the Double Fine brand, which hasn't been the same for me since Spacebase DF and the Broken Age Kickstarter mishandlings.			"

												Although Halloween have passed this is game that must be played, and would say going to 'trick or treat' would be funny and challenger. So Costume Quest is a Action RPG with a nice concept on it. As you guys already figure it this game takes place on Halloween, where two siblings, Reynold and Wren, will go ask for candies. The player at this point will choose which sibling to play as. One of the siblings will be kidnapped - depend what siblings you choose - and our missions is to find out her he/she is. During our mission, we will make some quest, and personally this was the worst part for me, because the quest are always the same. Costume Quest has 3 levels, the neighborhood, the mall and a carnival, and on all level the quest are the same, go ask for candy, do eat apple game, find some cards, get the costumes, find kids playing hide-and-seek, same thing happens on the DLC despite the level design is different. But if you put that behind your backs the game is really enjoyable, the game's graphics are a cartoonish style - thing that i love - and are well designed and very colorful, Costume Quest is more than colorful, is nice piece of art! The neighborhood and the others locations can make ous dive on feeling, is like we are on Halloween. And since is a Halloween Theme we will have lot of costumes to wear. Now to get the costumes you need to, get three different materials. When we get the costumes, besides changing our appearance we can go through places we didn't can before and will also gives special skills to use in battles. This battles can arise in two different ways, when you are searching for candy's or on street when you find a troll. When such things happens the scenario will completely change and your suit power will be activated, the battle style is a turn-based + quick time events.  When you do three attacks you will have a change to make the special attack, that can be a offensive or defense move. The special attack will be different according to the suit you are wearing. Since this is a RPG make sence we get XP for doing things, well when you complete the quest, defeat the trolls you will get some XP that will raise your level as well your defenses and your attack. Besides, you can buy in-game booster to help raise your attack and defense, although this is not very important because your enemies don't give a strong fight. Although this is a soundless game, contains a decent amount of humor there, some nice jokes and the dialogues between the characters is funny to read too. Costume Quest really grabbed me from the moment i installed, so is totally recommend! ~ 8/10  "

												I strongly advise people playing custom quest 2 over this base on its repativeniss. Both games are like that it’s just those is 3 times as bad compared to 2..Not just that it does not mettle what screen you have I trend this on 20"", 17"" 15"" even 13"" screen. And you most do space or E.; to dough and hit the attack just right to have more demise that might be couse a problem it’s just it is so smell you need to do it just right. Custom quest 1 story was O.K. I built like custom quest 2 was bitter. Base on dentist white is the child her wanted revise for having no cander.In custom quest 1, the watch want's to have some human's and gousts to wake together, Like any other story or movie for intense ghost busters. Even tales of the dark side the movie.For bottering gamblins. Even feather this game has no map you can refice to see of what horses you missed. Even whish you go to 2 worlds with the same with less many tasks, by helping them with there cards.I’m not shying this game is bad, bad I believe psych notes, even go so far; that brutle legend is bitter base on story line.Please do your self a fever, and skip this and buy custom quest 2. Trust me you will not regent it.Thick from Wright Micah			"

												Just a very boring game. It lack any real depth.  Combat gets stale very very quickly. Story is just mediocre, tried-and-true. Items, a staple in any RPG, for whatever reason is omitted, where Double Fine could have added some 'tongue-in-cheek' elements. The only faint sense of utility or customizations is from the 'Battle Stamps"", which are 'added bonuses' like an extra skill or stats, which seemed meaningless other than the counter-strike or stun skill -- the only one which would give me a chance in battle.The costumes did not offer any stat changes other than the obvious battle mechanic changes. Personally, I was expecting the 'knight' to have a more 'tank-like' role in addition to the 'shield' ability like More HP and lower attack. I'm expecting some differences. You can find yourself very easily overwhelmed in a 2v3 battle with no 'usual' / 'crutch' mechanic to swing the battle in your favor like Items or some OP one-time use ability. Instead you are greeted with persistent in battle costumes (which could have been changed like that of FFX-2 dynamic) and 1 every three turns ""super-skill"" that aligns with the costume chosen. Oh, and the battles consist of you pressing a button to do more dmg or take less damage.I got as far as the mall and just couldnt careless. The story is unique-ish, but the gameplay is just boring and rather... lame.			"

												Costume Quest is a charming, fun take on the turn based RPG genre. Sort of condensed. Instead of individually swapping weapons, spells, attacks, and actions you choose costumes that change your appearance, battle abilities and attacks, and help solve free roam puzzles with various actions. On top of that you can choose one additional action or buff for each character and swap them as you choose. Instead of finding and swapping party members you can instead choose their costumes. It really is sort of a ""My First RPG"", which may sound dull to an adult but it works well enough to engage. My one issue with this system is that there wasn't enough difference between the costumes to incentivise change. You are forced to change to solve some puzzles but I would always switch back before a battle. The battle system is turned based and pretty simple with only a few options each turn. This style lends itself to a little repetition but I tended to enjoy them since they typically don't drag on. One twist (Maybe, I don't play a lot of turn based RPGs) is that to land more powerful attacks you have to complete a QTE. There are several variations but each attack only has one. Things like press at a certain time, wiggle a stick, or repeatedly tap a button. Personally I didn't find that it detracted from the experience and actually makes sure you're paying attention to the battle and lets you contribute in some way. In true Double Fine fashion the writing (literally because there is no voice acting. Not a problem, just a statement) is top notch. Funny, witty, and endearing with jokes for both adults and children. Don't write off Costume Quest because of its apparently juvenile theme, you'd be missing out. It's fun, funny, and really is a nice departure from what you've probably played last. It doesn't over stay it's welcome and is well worth your time.			"

												Such a charming game. The graphics are cute and, even though the gameplay is the same as pretty much all the other RPGs, it still feels refreshing. Why ? Because most of the battles are based on trick-or-treating. And the gear you can collect are Halloween costumes. It's a cool idea, I really enjoyed it. But it does get repetitive near the end (it's about 5 hours long); the quests are the same in every new area. Apple bobbing, card collecting, finding hidden kids. It's a great game, but I just wish there was more variation.Still, if you love RPGs, or charming games in general, this is a must play.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												Another 30FPS locked game from Double Fine. I looked for a way to fix this defect, (and 30FPS IS a defect, anything below 60 is unacceptable on PC) and there doesn't seem to be one. Every thread I found about it had Double Fine, (often the exact same developer, DFnathan) LYING to their customers, saying ""we're looking to remove the cap in a future update"" all from threads from like 3-4 years ago or more. Every time they release a game it has this ridiculous framerate lock, and every time they say a fix is ""coming in a future update"" that never arrives. Vote with your wallet and don't buy this, it's just another console port.			"

Funny and engaging dialogue, simple (but more complex at later stages) and customizable combat, and baased in a world of puzzles, secret chests and exploration, Costume Quest excels itself as both a children's game and one for adults.I am six hours through at the moment and just finished the main story. There is an expansion so I'm expecting total playtime to be about 10 hours. Not bad at all for the price.If you are a fan of RPGs, levelling up, area exploration, turn-based combat, or completionist gaming, there will be something here for you. I highly recommend it.			"

												Double Fine Productions (makers of Brütal Legend, and Psychonauts) have created another masterpiece in their latest game, Costume Quest. Costume Quest is a turn-based RPG by Double Fine. You play as a child on Halloween night in search of your twin sibling.I’d recommend this game to everyone who’s mature enough to look at it for the first five minutes and dismiss it as a children’s game. The story, while well written is fairly predictable, and the grinding towards the end really detracts from the experience. [8/10]			"

												Where to even begin with this one... Costume Quest is something special. The setting is superb and the RPG elements are interwoven brilliantly. The dialogue is really fun to read and I found myself laughing aloud quite often. All of the costumes are really creative and super fun to play around with. This game just gets so many things right that you really owe it to yourself, especially if you enjoy RPGs, to play it.  "

												Costume Quest is an amusing, anime style, adventure game with some unique dynamics. Firstly, costumes you pick up become useful in the game world in two ways. One, they each have a unique ability, like the robot costume to boost your speed and let you jump off ramps, and secondly, they become genuine fighting equipment, changing your character into what the costume represents. Be it a knight, or a fancy big robot, the costumes have incredibly power in this fun and quirky game by the creators of Psychonauts. Definelty a fun little game to play, and a get a fresh taste of Double Fine on PC.			"

												Short but wonderful, only a handful or so hours long, you won't be playing Costume Quest for ever, but its still a great treat.A traditional JRPG at its heart, CQ really nails  the comedy of Holloween as well as any nostalgia for it you might have.  The characters you play as and meet are more than interesting and its a great story that makes you want to see it through.			"

												This one was a surprise. When looking at some pictures, I wasn't expecting much, but was surprised by it. This game has what you can expect from Double Fine, very funny and well written dialogue, fun combat system and a nice world to explore. The biggest flaw of this game, is it's length and scope. It's a short game. But the 6-8 hours it will take you to complete it, will be fully enjoyed. The story, although quite simplistic, is fun and entertaining. The combat system is  very nice, it's a JRPG turn based system with some quick time events thrown in between. When you enter battle, you'll transform into the costume you're wearing, so if you're using a cardboard robot costume, in battle you turn into a full laser shooting robot. The game has a lot of costumes and all of them very different from each other so you'll have to consider what costumes are best for each character and each situation. To add even more diversity, you have battle stamps to collect and use. These give some additional passive abilities, and make a lot of difference in combat. The game has a very simple level system and currency (candy). You can use candy to buy some upgrades and stamps to further develop your character. All in all, this is a very good bur short RPG, and I recommend it to everyone who likes the genre.			"

After my fourth fight, I found myself avoiding enemies whenever possible. Not because of the difficulty, but because each fight is another 2-3 minute delay from that quest item that I was looking for in the game world. I challenge anyone to convince me that this style of combat makes the game fun.If there were a quarter as many enemies, and you used puzzle-solving to overcome them, this game would gel a lot better.

												The whole game takes place on Halloween night where you must rescue your twin brother (or sister, depending on who you choose) who has been kidnapped by candy-stealing monsters. You have to trick-or-treat at every lighted house to unlock other areas in the game world. If a monster opens a door you will engage in a random turn-based battle where your costume powers will come in handy. On your quest you will meet other trick-or-treaters and pick up more followers for your search party. Collect candy from trash bags and smashed pumpkins which can be used to purchase perks in monster battles. Complete mini-quests to earn experience so you can level up. Do classic Halloween activities, like bob for apples and compete in a costume contest. Collect Creepy Treat trading cards and materials to unlock more costumes that have special abilities.It's a unique blend of rpg-ing and casual gameplay that perfectly captures the spirit of Halloween. A must-have for those too old to trick-or-treat.			"

												I like the idea for costume quest. The visional style fits very well with the game. The game has some fun characters too.What I don't like with the game is that it is extremely repetitive. The first area you are in was pretty fun. But it feels like the game might as well has ended there. Because you then get to another area where you have basically the same quests again, just at a different location. The quests aren't very fun either. The combat is very repetitive because only have one normal attack and a special attack that you get after two attacks. So every fight is: regular attack which follows with a quick time event to get the maximum damage out of your attack, do this for every character. Then quick time event to reduce damage from the enemy. Then repeat this to get special attack, do special attack. if the enemy isn't dead do it again. The concept for the game is very good. It could have been an awesome game. But sadly it's too repetitive and it kind of falls flat. Even though the game is very short is feels far to long for what the actual content of the game. It feels like they made the game longer by just using the same quest again with a new background texture.			"

												I usually try to stay away from stuff that is cute and kidsy, but this game is actually not really like that. It is a charming little game with really great graphic design and a good turn based rpg combat system like Final Fantasy style. You go around a town map doing quests and it is so far a lot of fun. Double Fine ♥♥♥♥ed up Iron Brigade bad which was really unfortunate, but they have a gem on their hands here with this game. The huge flaws in this game though is that it is very short (I beat the main game + the dlc in 7 hours), there is no replay value: once you beat it there is no reason to ever play it again, and it could also be more difficult. One of my favorite short playthroughs that I have played in a long time. I don't know why exactly but it just strikes a chord with me and I love it. I think because it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time, Earthbound on the Super Nintendo. A very good game, just way too short. Catch it on sale and only on sale.			"

												High concept, bad executionLike all of Double Fine's games, this product is very stylish, but the actual gameplay is frustrating and glitchy. A turn-based battle system where you have to press keys to avoid attacks? I could never time them properly. So there you have it––a game themed around children and Halloween, that's too difficult and glitchy for kids to play. Do not buy.			"

												This game is just fantastic! It's a fun little halloween RPG by the amazing team at Double Fine, which are responsible for masterpieces like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend. This game does not disappoint at all. It's a short and sweet game that i enjoyed from start to finish, even though the combat can get a bit repetitive in the start of the game, Once you get out of the first area of the game the combat becomes fresh again. Introducing new enemies, new costumes, and new abilities.It also has quite a bit of challenge, i didn't die a lot, but nearing the end of the game it really gets difficult.Overall it's a really good game. 9/10 "

												It's rare to see a game made by double fine with bland characters, obnoxious gameplay and boring story  however this game has all three. The combat system in this game is turn based with no strategy, that however I can stand I enjoy games like Final Fantasy or Pokemon, however Double Fine decided to ""innovate"" by mixing in Real Time Events which just completely ruined it for me. Similarly to Psychonauts and Brutal legend this game features collectibles, however unlike these 2 games - collectibles are not a side-quest but are the main quest of the game and you cannot proceed until you have searched every last corners for those collectibles. I don't know what happened to double fine but their earlier games were much better.			"

												Do you like classic JRPGs? Yes? Then you will surely like the innovative reaction games, quick-time events and whatnot, that are required for actually winning the battles! Costume Quest really requires the hard tactical experince of a person that can understand the difficult concepts of ""a monster that heals other monsters"" and ""a monster that deals high damage"". If those terms sound difficult to comprehend and you cannot understand why they should be the primary targets, you might be more at home with some lighter strategy games.			"

												Here is another beauty that I got thanks to that Double Fine humble bundle. Every time I start thinking of going back to console gaming these bundles and steam sales just drag me right back in the glorious world of PC gaming and the silly and serious experiences it has to offer.Costume Quest is a game that I read and saw a decent amount of before I played it from the various videogame news sites that I follow. As a result I went into the game with a certain amount of expectations which were not entirely met if I am being honest.Costume Quest is a pretty mediocre game. Its definitely not bad, but its not that good either. If you are hoping to find a game that can be used as an eight to ten hour distraction then you should be fine getting Costume Quest. If you want something that is more than a distraction then you need to look elsewhere. Because while this game has a lot of charm, its very superficial in some major parts of its design leaving the experience of playing this game feeling boring and repetitive in more than one instance. This is something I feel pretty strongly about, to that point that I'm not looking forward to the sequel that Double Fine recently announced. Unless there are some major changes being made to the gameplay aspect of the game which I don't think is going to happen to be honest.If you feel like reading a more detailed review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/costume-quest.html.

That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my honest opinion. Why you would try to make an exact clone of the last game and try to pass it off as dlc/expansion is unforgivable.

												I have been enjoying Costume Quest a lot actually. The cartoon look is visually appealing and when you can play in 1080p it makes it even better. It is a quirky kind of RPG yet it does not fully present itself as an RPG, you can roam around and complete quest without even looking at your quest log. It's battles are fun and attacks involve timing and require you to think fast on which key to press when blocking attacks. I strongly recommend this game, worth its money, you may want to wait for a sale if you are money conservative.			"

												This is a game for kids, not kids-at-heart. I'm an adult, that likes Halloween. I like dressing up in costumes, and both handing out and having candy. I try to host a Halloween party every year.I got this game because I was hoping that there would be the same level of dialouge and characters as in Psychonauts. It's not.It's a very, very simplistic game, with choose a button and some QTE stuff. The costumes change things a bit, but anyone who has played any RPG type games at all can probably figure out the two damage dealers, one healer, or one tank, one damage, one healer, and not ever really need to switch costumes, besides to look at the different attacks.It's not a bad game for kids at all. The writing is still decent, and some of the jokes were amusing, but as an adult fan of Doublefine who purchased it for myself, I feel let down. It's also a very short game. Again, one that would more appeal to a kid audience.There IS a market for more adult-based Halloween costume style games out there that don't need horror or sex. I just wish Doublefine had realized that.			"

												Short but sweet game coming from the creative mind of Tim Schafer, who is best known for games like Grim Fandango, Psychonauts and The Secret of Monkey Island. This game is a perfect play for Halloween (and the grubbins on ice during the holiday seasons). This turn based RPG is good for all ages. During the 6 to 7 hour game you go on a quest to save your brother/sister that has been mistaken for candy by monsters. The only way you can save him/her is to go around town trick or treating, getting candy and build costumes.			"

												This is a really fantastic light RPG. It has that signature Double Fine dialog and in general the feel you expect from them. Just like I mentioned in my Stacking review this has reasonable achievements and very good accomodation for the completionist type. Appropriate since both this and Stacking was written in either 2 weeks or 4 weeks (I forgot the story) as part of a company creativity exercise.It's really a shame that EA and LucasArts are such inept pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥that they didn't capitalize on Double Fine during this period and allow them creative freedoms or the sequel to this would have came out much earlier and a Psychonauts sequel might actually exist. But oh well, great game overall and much of what I said about Stacking can be applied here. Double Fine knows you love to collect things and it knows that you love to 100% things, and they love you for loving those things and so accomodate you well.			"

												This game is all about the charm. The story isn't the same ol' derivative RPG story. The characters & setting are very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed playing this during Halloween, It put me in the holiday spirit.As an RPG there's nothing truely ground breaking here. The combat is ok, It's a class based system. Classes are selected through a series of costumes. Some costumes have healing abilities, some are damage/crowd control & others are defensive. It may sound unique & interesting, but the battles generally all go the same way due to the fact that your abilities are not able to be activated till the 3rd round. Damage for 3 rounds, if the enemy is still up, stun heal & damage battle over.I'm a fan of Tim Schafer's work, but I'm going to rate his work on it's own merits. This game is fun & charming & I would recommend it, but I would say wishlist it & wait for a sale.			"

This review explains how Double Fine's Costume Quest is a shallow, repetitive, featureless example of the RPG adventure game genre.[. . .] You do 1-3 identical attacks, then 1-3 identical dodges, and on every third turn special moves. That’s the only combat rhythm, and you’ll be doing it until every battle is a chore. There are no combos; no combat varieties; no difficult build decisions; no in-battle items; and, except for ‘go for the priest first,’ there is no strategy.

												One of the better examples of why indy developers should be allowed to exist, unfortunately several flaws in this game prevent recommendation.Technically, the game has limited resolution modes and generally doesn't behave like a PC game.  Being unaware of foreground windowing prevents foreground switching and causes the game to crash... that's ok, developers probably weren't aware that DirectX 3.0 was introduced in 1997, so it's understandable they wouldn't have bothered to test the game under Windows. Artwork is 3D which at least beats going 2D platformer, but it's still extremely low effort.Gameplay quickly becomes stale and repetitive, which is the only chance the developers had in way of apology for their negligence on the artwork and on making the game compatible with Windows. Simply too hard to approve.			"

												Wow.   Looked so great.  However, after playing for an hour I'm done.  To start with, the controls are counter-intuative and difficult to control.   They feel like they were ported from a game controller game.  Anyways, on a PC they don't work well.The plot is text based and the text bubbles move by -very- rapidly even for a fast reader..  Don't even try to read them outloud if playing in a group.    If you are distracted for a moment, you don't get to read what each character says.  Durning game play you must complete some tasks that require you to move accurately and quickly.  If you fail the task you start again.  Nothing spells ""fun"" like repeating a task that is only difficult because the controls are poor.In any event, after less than an hour's game play - this feels like a quick and dirty port of a console game with little testing for the PC market.  Shame, look fun, good concept, nice graphics.Horrible game play due to a quick, poorly done port.  Wish I could get my $10 back. "

												Yeah, I'm really going to suffer through a bunch of idiotic tutorial dialogue one speech bubble at a time with no option to skip to the next line when I'm done reading. It's really good and well-thought-out that all the ""important"" conversations give me two options: 1) stare at text bubble long after im finished reading it or 2) skip entire conversation by pressing escape. I'm using sarcasm btw. I'm being sarcastic. I am utilizing a sarcastic tone to convey the opposite meaning of the literal definition of my words. In truth, the instant the last Steam Trading Card drops I'm going to be quitting and immediately deleting local content.If the dialogue was at-all interesting maybe it'd be worth sitting still through the horribly-paced cutscenes, but every conversation is Nick Jr. level garbage, dripping with that awful, condescending slime of Idiotic Childrens' Programming for Idiotic Children. It's patronizing, unimaginatively hokey, constantly condescending and utterly unbearable.It's also really insanely good that the unimportant ""flavor"" conversations CAN be skipped one bubble at a time, thus proving that the designers were capable of implementing this feature, but for whatever reason they then decided all the Extremely Important Cutscene Dialogue needed to be read at a speed of approximately one speech bubble every thirty seconds.Also the overworld control is pretty clunky (with a strange ""momentum pause"" when switching directions 90 degrees at a time) - probably feels a lot better on a controller, but WASD for life. Thankfully I'm probably not going to end up being horribly horribly frustrated by it because I don't plan on actually playing this game. The battles are moderately cool I guess if you're into Final Fantasy and/or QTE-styled fights (press key to select thing, press key when slider is in the sweet spot to do thing) and maybe the costume mechanics are good, maybe they're terrible, I'm unfortunately never going to find out because every two minutes I'm interrupted by a cutscene that I end up completely skipping once my patience runs out, so I end up further and further separated from the most ""important"" plot elements or story goals or whatever these cutscenes are intended to convey.In the interests of pointing out the positives: The graphics are very nice and colorful, and since there's no voice-acting there's no terrible voice-acting to either disable or bîtch about the inability to disable.Recommended for slow readers, fans of terrible cinematic pacing, and lobotomy patients.

Because, she jumps and shouts as eagle (it is behind her), and Behind her appears USA flag and on the right side Abraham Lincoln, then she heals all allies.

												I like this game, but I honestly can't recommend it. I like the concept, I like the costumes and how they are represented in combat. But this game has a sucktacular camera system (that made me run around in circles and check around town for about forty minutes trying to find a ♥♥♥♥ing quest item that the game HIDES for no apparent reason) and not enough meat on the bone to make conflict interesting. This is essentially Final Fantasy light, complete with quick time events and pedantic combat. I don't see myself wanting to play this for more than an hour.			"

												costume quest is a pretty neat rpg done in the spirit of halloween. i must say this is a great rpg for gamers new and old. there is no item managing that hardcore rpg games have which means young and old both can enjoy this game without worry of having to run back to the store. there is a store in game though which has battle cards with varying effects u can use equip each charecter with 1 card swappable outside of battle.  healing wise there is none other then in battle so no worrys of dieing from being unprepared.one of the toughest parts about this game is prob the boss battles aside from that the trying to get every defense and attack perfect by pressing the right button. also to talk about the battles pretty simple just attack and defend before the enemy hits you u try to press the correct button if hit the correct one critical attack and in defense better defense or a dodge and if right card equiped counter. after 3 turns ur specials charged which they are pretty nice addition. but do not take the game lightly u can lose battles if ur not careful. but there is no such thing as gameover in this game it just places u in the area right before the battle <3also to note there is a varity of costumes which u have to find the parts to make them each comes with a special ablity which is pretty neat. oh and there is special ablitys for some of them useable in the field which adds to the fun.now if u like rpgs that arent that tough yet still fun give costume quest a go as its worth a play and i would say a replay <3   oh and did i mention candy? TONS OF CANDY!so grab costume quest and help stop the evil witch and the monsters from stealing all of the candy before its too late and halloween is ruined!   ~ will be updating after finish the dlc quest grubbins on ice that came with :3just finished the dlc grubbins on ice make sure u collect every costume before playing it and load same slot u finished in, as u will have all of the orignal costumes then ^w^ its like costume quest turned christmas quest. basicly the same gameplay new areas and new costumes and areas. also do note finish costume quest then the dlc as seems it leads into game 3 ^w^if this review is not helpful, please leave a comment as to why u feel that way so i may make changes if needed ^w^			"

												I bought this because a game based on trick or treating sounded really great. However, trick or treating has never been so lame. The game gets off to a good start and is plenty of fun, but there's nothing to keep it interesting. Going door to door collecting candy even got horribly boring after a while. The combat system was easy but it was also a snore. It was so over done that I started just avoiding enemies. The whole thing is so tedious and repetitive, performing the same actions again and again (trick or treating and fighting enemies), that by the time I got to what would be considered the first boss, I was sick of this game and thoroughly done with it.

												I wish I'd waited a week - this was 11.49 when I got it and now its 5.74. But, didn't know it was going to happen. In relation to the game itself, its probably worth more like the 5.74. The characters are adorable, the premise is clever, but the gameplay is bad. I appreciate that this was done during studio downtime to waste some time but knowing how awesome Double Fine are, it surpised me just how bad the gameplay was.  I got it because I love Tim, I love Double Fine, and I ADORE Halloween. But this is pretty painful. I can't tolerate it anymore and I am afriad that I have wasted 12 quid. Shame. Maybe nearer to Halloween I can give it another go but I doubt it.			"

												This game does some things wonderfully. It's a fantastic portrayal of the way a costume transforms you from a kid wearing a bucket or a cardboard box into a powerful figure who kicks♥♥♥♥♥and stands up for justice. The moment of suspense after you knock on the door when you don't know who or what is behind it is a really nice touch. The cel-shaded models in the battle scenes look great.But do be aware this is a very _simple_ game. It could be a good introduction to the CRPG genre for younger players, but there's not much depth to be found here. The story is charming but simple. There is some variety in the abilities you get with the costumes and accessories, but there's no skill progression to speak of, and each party member may only have a single accessory. The tactically-minded will find there's an accessory you can get mid-game that lets you cheese your way through fights for everything except bosses.So the thumbs-up here is a potential thumbs-up if you're looking for a game for your kids. If you're old enough to have your own Steam account, you've probably outgrown this.			"

												Costume Quest, like any Double Fine and Tim Schafer game, is just great. It has that sort of charm that games like Psychonauts, Monkey Island, and Grim Fandango all have. The writing, characters, and story in CQ is what draws you in and keeps you in. The gameplay/combat is very interesting at first, but after maybe halfway through the game, I stumbled on a method of conducting battles that had a very rinse & repeat feeling to it. You may not experience it, and it can easily be avoided simply through player choice, so I wont harp on that too much, but the combat is the game's weakest point. It's a fun little ride and well worth it at any price.4/5			"

												A cutesy, simplistic RPG?  Meh.  Tell me Tim Schafer's had a hand in development?  Well, as little of Psychonauts that I've played, that's an interesting factoid but doesn't sell me.  All the moves in battle have action commands a la Super Mario RPG?  Now I'm listening.This is an engaging game.  Cute, but Tim Schafer cute with adult overtones.  Like Psychonauts, the landscapes are built for exploration and look great.  Battles couldn't be any more basic, but the need to react to quick time-esque button presses to either boost attacks or minimize incoming damage keeps you on your toes.  Each costume you acquire is unique and works differently in battles, making it fun to experiment and find the perfect combination for your play style.  It's short, no more than six hours, but it's actually the perfect length.  Maybe it's not worth the full asking price, but if Costume Quest comes up in a Steam sale...  grab it.

												This game simply oozes with charm. I enjoy the turn-based combat, although it, and a lot of the concepts, can get a bit repetitive. The levels are really fun to explore despite their small size, and the costumes are a nice mechanic. But, really, it's just so darned cute.			"

												Another fun title from the folks over at Double Fine.  Costume Quest has a lot of charm, as well as some fun silliness just in overall premise.  Quite nostalgic to play this game and look back at the Halloween costumes the kids are wearing, Halloween parties, and trick or treating... while trying to hunt out actual monsters/demons who have entered our world.  A fun 8-10 hour play through.			"

												Game is a lot of fun, especially at first when everything is new.  I love the scenery and feel to the game, so I usually play it around halloween to get into the mood.  Combat is pretty simple, missions are simple, the overall game is simple.  This isn't necesarrily a bad thing, but it does get extremely repetitive after a while.  Most of the missions feel the same.  Honestly I enjoy the game mostly for the feels and the setting.  If you are wanting to get into the halloween mood, grab it. If you are looking for an RPG with much depth, you might want to avoid it.			"

If you don't have siblings or kids of your own, some of that magic dissipates as you age. Costume Quest does wonders to bring back some of that nostalgia of the best night of the year.			"

												It's been a long time since I truly enjoyed an rpg, and Costume Quest was no disappointment. I'd been waiting a long time to play it and I'm glad I finally did.  It took me about 10 hours to beat the base game and then the dlc.  The best part of this game was the imagination of the kids that allowed them to use their cardboard Halloween costumes as amazingly deadly characters in battle.  Truly a unique game.  I recommend this game to ANYONE of any age, whether you like rpgs or not.			"

												A nice experience, but the main story is very short, like about 6 hours on average. It does not have a complex item or battle system rpg (quick time events for critical hits and defending) so its real easy to dive in and not get confused, but still remains challenging and involving.  My main annoyances is the fixed camera, which makes it annoying because youll sometimes find a large prop hiding your character on screen, and there are only 3 map areas.			"

												Remember when you were a kid and you played pretend in a costume, especially around Halloween? Well in this game you really do become your costume to fight off monsters and save your twin sibling from an evil witch and her army of candy-stealing grubbins on Halloween Night.Cutesy and silly, but with some clever jokes and some really fun combat. You unlock new powers by making new costumes using found items. Whether thats a Giant Robot that shoots chest missles at monsters, a unicorn that heals it's allies with rainbow magic, or a french fry crab (note: I'm serious) that stuns enemies by shooting superheated salt crystals at them there's lots of neat combinations for every battle.Double Fine is one of my favorite game companies these days and the unique and unusual titles they come up with are the reason why. In an industry mostly dominated by gritty realistic shooter games, blood soaked sci-fi shooter games, and football its nice to see a company that goes against the norm.			"

The combat sequences change with each battle which keeps you on your toes, and it is a great deal of fun questing for the patterns and costume pieces, then trying them all out to experience the various special abilities of each one.  There is a lot of humour in the dialog and the art is also very good.Costume Quest is a bit like Final Fantasy in the battle sequences, but the rest of the game is pretty unique and I definitely recommend it.

												Want to play a eastern style rpg but can't be having with all that spiky or multicoloured hair? Want an rpg with a sense of humour? Like Halloween?You, Sir, have very specific tastes. Thankfully Costume Quest ticks all those boxes.Costume Quest is by Double Fine, the company that brought Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Stacking and, more recently, Broken Age. It's a pretty good lineage to come from.You play as one of a pair of siblings, the sister Wren or the brother Reynold. Whichever of the two, you choose the other will get kidnapped and it's your job to rescue them.Along the way you will collect companions, complete minor quests and collect items to construct other costumes. Why would you want to do that you may ask? Well, beside acquiring the achievement for doing so, it will also give you some more options for combat and exploring the game world.Each costume has abilities when you go into combat wearing them. They can roughly be divided into three types (though some will span multiple types); Offence, Support and finally Defence.As you complete quests and fight your characters will level up and gain Battle Stamps. These stamps add extra abilities or buff your characters and winning the game is near impossible without them.The combat is in the style of an eastern style rpg. Your enemies stand on one side of the screen, you on the other and you take turns attacking each other. You defend yourself through a QTE (quick time event), which if you press the correct button on time will lessen the damage taken. Basic attacks are similar to the defence, you wait  for the prompt to mash a button, wiggle a stick or or just press the right button at the right time and if your successful you'll be rewarded with a critical hit. As you fight your costumes special abilities will charge up (usually around the 3rd turn). These attacks don't have a QTE and, depending on the costume, do great damage with an added effect, heal or protect.Try as I might I can't really fault the game. It's a little short but it's not exactly breaking the bank when it comes to buying it. You could easily complete the game and it's DLC (complete with all achievements for those that care for them) in a weekend.I recommend this game very highly, it's asking price isn't even that high for what it provides you.

												The art, story, atmosphere, and combat in this game are great. It's overall good.However, I have a few gripes. When something is in the foreground it's at just the wrong level of transparency to hurt your eyes. The level of difficulty is a little low for my liking. The gameplay gets progressively more and more linear as the game progresses, especially in character progression. Which isn't a good thing in a psuedo-rpg.Overall it's definitely fun and I find myself pretty addicted to the combat system. Worth a buy.			"

												Another fun and offbeat game from the folks at Double Fine. Its Halloween and hi-jinks are afoot, you play a group of kids out to rescue the main characters sibling who has been captured by an evil witch. Combat is of the turn based variety you are used to seeing in Japanese Style RPG's, your party on one side and the enemy on the other. Hey, come back here, its not dull at all, you see, the kids you have in your party? They can transform into the costumes they are wearing, dressed as a knight? Bam you are a knight in shining armour dealing blows with your sword. Dressed as a robot? Suddenly you are as huge as Voltron and dealing some serious harm. Its the kind of wish fulfilment any kid has when they dressed up as a kid and Double Fine tap into that nostalgic vibe with their usual charm and whimsy. If I have a complaint its minor and its simply that the combat can get a little repetetive, but thats more a flaw in the nature of this style of combat than any glaring fault on Double Fine's part. That little gripe aside, the humour and tongue in cheek Halloween take make this another good addition to Double Fine's stable. That said, pick Iron Brigade or Stacking first if your Double Fine collection is lacking those, this is a fine game but those are musts.			"

I found the combat system reminded me a lot of Final Fantasy system, which I really enjoyed with this game. Pros : - Great gameplay- Funny commentary- Great feel to the combat system- Story-line was interestingCons : - (Seems) like this game could be difficult for the younger crowd.- Too short! Wish I could have more to play!!Over and all; if you are considering this game...Get it! Well worth your dollars!9.5/10			"

You could easily complete the game and it's DLC (complete with all achievements for those that care for them) in a weekend.I recommend this game very highly, it's asking price isn't even that high for what it provides you.

												This is one of those games that's really really easy to enjoy. Humour runs through the entire experience and just when you think it's getting repetetive it switches up. Considering the price there really isn't any good reason to not own this lovely little gem of a game. Death to the Banana!

												As one of two twins, who are new in town, you set out into the Halloween night to trick-or-treat your neighbours - just to find your sibling abducted by REAL monsters! And, 'cause it's Halloween, no adults realize it's real monsters. Collect candy, trading cards, costumes and explore three rich and exciting areas to rescue your sibling, before your parents get all up in yo biz.So, now down to brass tacks. Is it any good? Well. The graphic style of this adventure RPG is stunning, the level design is flawless, the gameplay is great fun and the battlesystem is thought through. Sure, the battles can be quite monotone in the last half hour of the game, but it's manageable due to exciting skill tree choices; your skills in battle change depending on what costume you have one. The achievement are challenging but manageable, which makes the game replayable. It's an hommage to the imagination of kids and to Halloween. I really recommend it.8/10, the only downsides are the repetetive combats.			"

												Short and Sweet. While the storyline isn't much more than a pleasant buzzing noise that filled the space between running around for quest objectives, Costume Quest pivots on a single charming idea and does it extremely well; what if little children could actually become the things they were dressed up as for halloween? The amount of enjoyment you will derive from this game is largely influenced by how much you'd like to have a ninja, a unicorn, and The Statue of Liberty form a ragtag tagteam against hoards of derpy looking demons.

												Alright, Costume Quest. Pretty charming. It is a JRPG set in a halloween theme. As it seems to be the usual thing about Double Fine productions, the artstyle and designs of pretty much everything in the whole thing is very good pretty and nice for the theme. That is very good. You gotta love Double Fine for that pattern by the way. The story is also funny and children friendly, no voice actors, so you have to read, which is not bad, except if you are foreign. However, it is a JRPG and that is a genre, that seriously is pretty old. Something not that good. They have to be congratulated however for not putting in linear corridors or random encounters, but the combat is still really simple, gets boring and gives not really any punishment for defeat. I wonder why they even put in a run away button. So the combat is pretty much just padding, but since Double Fine is, as far as I know, an indie game company, it can slide. It also has a lot of side quests and collectibles. Nothing for me, but you might enjoy it. The innovation is the costumes, which is easy to change between, and it gives a lot of different fighting styles and problem solving. The puzzles are however pretty much told how to solve, so no bonus there. In conclusion, Costume Quest is nothing ground breaking, but as someone who does not like mainstream JRPG it is alright. It will be the same for people who likes JRPG. It is like a little nice twix bar, that you eat fastly, and it is alright, but you will very soon forget it. If you have kids, buy this to them, because there are not that many good kid games, besides lego i suppose. If you want it for yourself, you can do a lot worse, but if you have not played Psychonauts, save the extra buck and buy that first, because it is a lot more ground breaking and creative.			"

  What better way to spend a few hours than pummeling monsters as a giant rainbow unicorn?  Costume Quest is a fun, youthful, and humorous adventure that utilizes overworld exploration, puzzle solving, and a simple turn-based combat system. I would recomend it to children, people looking for a not-scary halloween game, and anyone who would like to nostagically relearn some of the magic of halloween.This game does a lot of things well and a few things not so well. Good Stuff:  Concept  - I love the sheer idea of this game. A group of kids must use their costumes that ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THE WEARERS to fight monsters, save a sibling, and collect tons of candy along the way. It sounds like all of my childhood halloween fantasies at once. Story  - Less predicatable than one might image. It has just enough twists to keep it interesting, but manages to keep it simple enough for a younger person to enjoy it. Characters  - Likeable child characters are comparable to black republicans nowadays: maybe there's one or two here and there, but overall they're pretty rare. The children in this game are highly likeable and funny, which is a metaphorical breath of fresh air. Humour  - My inner 10 year old got a real kick out of this game. The jokes are silly and childish, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh quite a bit during my playthrough. I wish more games could imbue such a good sense of humour into their games. Stuff That Was Ok:  Music  - It wasn't exactly a synphonic masterpiece, but it does add to the immersion. My only qualm is that the battle music can get a bit repettitive. World/Map  - Again, it wasn't mind blowing or pioneering or anything like that. Each area is pretty different, which does well to break up any monotony. Some environmental objects (specifically, ramps) can feel really clunky, but all-in-all it doesn't affect the enjoyment of the game. Stuff I Wish Was Different:  Character Progression  - I believe that the Devs wanted to create a simple RPG that was less about combat and leveling up and more about the story. They absolutely succeeded, so props to them. I do wish that there would have been a slightly more in-depth character upgrade system, but that's just me. Combat  - Like I said above, the game isn't really combat or skill focused. The combat is simple and easy to learn, which is good. The problem with simple combat is that it can get very, very repetitive. I was actually somewhat sad when the thought ""ugh, do I really have to fight these guys?"" came to mind, because to me it meant that the combat had gotten boring. It's worth noting that I was admittedly about 3/4 of the way through before that happened. Lighting  - My last minor complaint is the lighting in the game. For the majority of the game, the Devs did a great job of keeping the overall lighting pretty low, but bright enough to see where you were going and to find the things you needed to find. However, the  first part of the 2nd act and the upper two floors of the mall area  are just too dark. There is a brightness option in the menu, but amping up the brightness seems almost to be cheating, since part of the game's charm is the comic-spookiness of low lighting. That's really my only complaint on the world design. Final Summation:   I really did enjoy this game. It was a fun way to spend a few hours, and it made me think back to my childhood dreams about being the costume I wore on halloween. Would recommend.  "

												This game is about kids trick-or-treating on Halloween night. But something happens, and kids will save the night by the power of their COSTUMES and IMAGINATION!!!!! Nuff' said. All right, let's make it brief:Pros:-Graphics and animations-Music-Level Design-Unique Concept-Atmosphere-CharactersCons:-It's TOO EZ. -Battles will become repetitive-Criminally short. It took me 8.5 hours to 100% both main and DLC campaigns(6 - main, 2.5 - DLC). I expected more, tbh.Overall, CQ is a great indie game! It's like Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and Psychonauts: It's unique, clever and fun. I enjoyed the **** of it! However, I'd suggest buying it on sale, not because it's best for you and your wallet, but 10$ for approx. 9 hours of gameplay isn't worth it. No offense, Tim Schafer! :)			"

												A cute, turn-based adventure from Tim Schaffer's company Double Fine, known for humor-ful games like Psychonauts, Monkey Island, Brutal Legend, etc.While a bit short, it is just the right length for what it is. The combat is a mix of standard turn-based RPG fare, with a twist. You can make different costumes with materials you find which alter your fighting style.If you want to relive your days of trick-or-treating, playing make believe, and grabbing all the candy you can, try this one out.

												Excellent game, especially for classic j-rpg fans. Great humor throughout, this game is equal doses badass and adorable. Definitely recommend playing with a controller, as the keyboard controls can be a little tiresome in this case.It bears some resemblance to the new South Park game. I do not mean to say that the South Park guys have ripped Costume Quest off, as they both pay homage to older turn-based rpgs, but anyone who loved playing one of the two should play the other.Personally I would love to see a sequel and more games like this. Make a sequel Double Fine!			"

												I don't fancy myself a guy who calls things ""cute"" but this game definitely was.  While so simple someone with an IQ of 10 could play, I found myself engrossed.  Maybe it was my mind harking back to a simpler time and the premise of kids just simply trick R' treating.  The battles were very simple, they had some interactivity but not much.  They were the standard JRPG style battles we all know and...love/hate.  There were a good selection of costumes, all fun and simple.  My favorite had to be the ninja...for obvious reasons. Not to mention the decent selection of power up cards that helped you along the way.If you enjoy simple fun and miss the imagination of your childhood then this could be the game for you.			"

												Another amazing game from Double Fine!  It's a nice mix of exploration, combat, mini games and funny jokes.  The combat is simple, turn based, and each of the different costumes you collect gives you different fun abilities.  The story is charming, and all the side quests add to the fun.  The main campaign took me around 5 hrs, and I did every quest.  It comes with a free DLC which adds another hour and a half or so.  If you haven't played Stacking or Psychonauts, do that too!			"

												A great little game with adorable characters and an endearing Halloween-themed story.  The combat gets a bit competitive once you figure out what works for you, but fun nonetheless and the different costumes provide a solid amount of different combinations to play around with.  Definitely going to play through it again!			"

												I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.			"

The witty dialogue and lovable cast are icing to teh magnificent cake taht is the gameplay. Simplistic in its turn based form different stratagies and play styles arise from choosing different costumes and battle stamps to use.While the game felt like you were grinding at times and the light hearted environment was free from teh burdens of indepth, heart-felt moments, the game itself is short enough that it does not over stay its welcome.The art style alone in fun but the game itself will leave you wanting more.8/10			"

												I've played the demo for this on the Playstation Network and thought it was great. Not only is the artwork simplistic, it still seems to go over the top with plenty of Halloween spirit. Look up in the dictionary the word 'fun' and the definition will read 'Play Costume Quest'. The game is designed with children and simplicity in mind, but that doesn't hold it back on being a one-of-a-kind experience. If you're just starting to play video games or trying to get someone into RPG(role playing games) this title is meant for you. With plenty of humor and enterainment abound, 'Costume Quest' rises above the rest.			"

												A mediocre RPG propped up by the considerable charm of the writers of Double Fine Productions. Combat is often agonizingly boring, with almost no options but requiring timed button presses that doesn't let you just blur it all out like you would Final Fantasy or Pokemon battles. Still, the game is adorable and features wonderfully written dialogue all the way down to the NPCs, making you want to explore the world and all of it's crannys, even if the battles frequently make you want to put it down. Hopefully some depth will be added to the upcoming sequel, but until then this is a cute, if slight, addition to the rich Double Fine canon.			"

												It's Halloween.  You're out trick or treating, and your brother/sister gets kidnapped!  It turns out that there is a plot by real monsters to steal all the candy in the world, and only you and your friends can stop them.Your costumes have different abilities to use while you're walking around town.  One has a flashlight so you can cross dark areas.  One has a helmet so you can cross areas with dripping water or debris.  One lets you roller skate and jump off ramps.  Another lets you into a secret club in your neighborhood.The costumes become REAL during combat, and each has a different fighting style.  So if you're dressed as the Statue of Liberty, you can use a healing spell to restore HP to the whole group, or you can hit the enemy with your torch to set them on fire.  If you are the robot, you can rocket-punch a single enemy or use your missiles to attack all the enemies.  And the other costumes have additional things going for them.  As you play more of the game, you will find parts of new costumes.  Only if you find all the parts can you make the costume.  In addition to changing costumes, you can also buy badges that give additional abilities.  One lets you add a little poison to your attacks.  Another adds a bigger poison with splash damage to nearby enemies.  Another boosts your HP so you live longer.  Another boosts your damage, but only if you make a critical hit.  You make a critical hit by getting good timing when you push the button displayed on screen.  Critical hits are very easy, I think I only ever missed two.  The first was because I didn't know how to do it yet, the second was because I sneezed and it messed up my timing.This game is not particularly difficult.  It is also not very big or long.  Still, it is fun for a little while.  It also has an expansion pack (standalone) where the kids visit the monster world at Christmas time and help the monsters overthrow a dictator.  New costumes are available in the expansion.  You can load your end-game save from the original game and start with the same characters, badges, and costumes when you boot up the expansion.Bottom line:  it's cute and fun, but don't expect too much from this one.

When I first saw it, I thought it'd be something childish, but I gave it a try, so I bought the CQ1&2 Bundle for a low price.I couldn't have been more wrong... Costume Quest was awesome!When I realized it, I was extremely immersed in the story and the gameplay... Though I thought some maps and objectives were a little repetitive, but no harm done.One of the things that made me really like this game was the costume system, the need-to-get-that-costume feeling is really engaging!This game is really good for those who want a not-so-difficult but fun and good RPG experience.

												At first this game seemed to childish, and I thought it would be rather lacking in gameplay, but I was proven wrong. The gameplay is fun, the item collecting is relatively challenging, and getting all the achievements made the entire experience feel rewarding.-PROS-*tons of characters to play as (as in costumes you can use to fight in)*an exciting reflex-style version of fighting (hit the commands to execute criticals)*humorous dialogue*wide explorable levels with interesting obstacles and secrets*references are abundant in many places, if you keep your eyes open!-cons- (and constructive criticisms)*The characters walk a bit slow, and to speed them up you need to use the Robot's skate-shoes. Only problem is, while doing this (if you find the robot not to your liking during combat) you can end up stuck as the robot during and upcoming fights.*Switching between costumes on the main character can be a bit annoying. It would make gameplay a little less annoying if you could equip different costumes to all 3 characters, then switch between characters for fast exploration trait usage.*Lack of facial animation. While it may have been intentional, and there are some emote-style expressions, it feels as if the animations aren't quite as developed in the real world of the game as they could be. There are many expressions used during combat for enemies, and for the costume fighters, but it doesn't really make up for the lack of facial animations in the game's explorable world.All in all, I rate this about an 8.5/10    -  Great game, could use some minor improvements, but all-in-all a great game.I highly recommend people play this if you like RPGs with a twist.

												Another Double Fine game that lives up to its developer's name. The game comes with a second quest so you're really getting two games in one. Costume Quest is an exploration game with turn-based battle segments. As a kid fighting goblins to rescue their twin, yoou go door to door trick-or-treating trying to clear an area of candy to advance ot the next. It's very much like a ""my first RPG"" kind of game, but it's still a rewarding experience. You'll feel like a kid again.			"

												Usually when you think of a Halloween game, you think of a scary game, and those are all well and good; but what about a game that really brings the magic of Halloween itself? You know, costumes, trick or treating, having fun with your friends? Costume Quest somehow does it and does it very well. The first level already brims with nostalgia of days gone by (for me anyway) of walking the neighborhood at night and going door to door with a pale for the candy. You may wonder what the gameplay is like - well, first off the story is not serious, it's a light-hearted romp that'll make you smile for all ages. The overall story begins as your brother or sister (depending on who you choose to play as) gets kidnapped by strange monsters who love candy, and you are going to rescue them. The gameplay itself mostly is you going door to door in various places, and sometimes you get an adult with candy (which is like a currency in the game), or it could be a monster, which whom you have to fight.The fighting is done like a turn-based RPG, and you can get little things to help you out, called Battle Stamps. Each stamp has a unique ability you can use, each of your character gets one stamp per person, but you can switch them out if you don't care for it.There's no real dying in the game, you lose a battle, and you can just try again. The settings are really fun, like a neighborhood with various decorations, or a mall etc. The humor is really good, and adults and children will enjoy it, it's really a game for the family. Sadly, there's no co-op but it's fun on its own.There's also the DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"" included which adds 1-2 hours more. The core game isn't TOO long even getting everything, maybe 4-5 hours? But it's a lot of fun, and if you want to feel that Halloween nostalgia, this is the perfect game for you! The sequel is also very good, and worth checking out if you like the first one.			"

												Costume Quest, like any Double Fine and Tim Schafer game, is just great. It has that sort of charm that games like Psychonauts, Monkey Island, and Grim Fandango all have. The writing, characters, and story in CQ is what draws you in and keeps you in. The gameplay/combat is very interesting at first, but after maybe halfway through the game, I stumbled on a method of conducting battles that had a very rinse & repeat feeling to it. You may not experience it, and it can easily be avoided simply through player choice, so I wont harp on that too much, but the combat is the game's weakest point. It's a fun little ride and well worth it at any price.4/5			"

												Its a damn fun romp of a game but a touch short (100% in 7odd hours). But Schafers crew's comedy comes through wonderfully. Very simple, so less for hardcore RPG players, more for younger players. Prob a good game for parents and kids. But I'm an old sod and I enjoyed it.			"

												I'm old. I like old things. My car is 50 years old and my house 125. It goes to figure I like old games.I'm crabby too. I hate things, like my car and my house. BUT this turn-based RPG is so adorable and precious I cannot hate it. Not challenging, (I beat it in one 11 hour playing session) but entertaining. A good waste of my time.			"

												Fun little baby RPG. Double Fine brings its trademark humour to keep it interesting for all despite a childish theme. Were it any longer, it would be unbearbaly repetitive, even at this length, the feeling creeps in.Animation of the battle costumes are are quite likable, especially the patriotic powers of lady liberty.Good Intro to RPG for newbies, and fun to kill a few hours if you're in for a family friendly adventure. Decent overall.			"

												I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!			"

												Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.And the long one:Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.9.8/10			"

												I am completely in love with this game.  It's rather fun and just enough challenging to make you think a little without being realy hard or trying.The main game has all sorts of chances for achievements and the costumes you aquire are really neat.I enjoy the battle system.  It's a straight forward turn-based system, very old school RPG.  There's a little strategy involved, deciding what costume to wear and some are on by necessity along with what 'battle stamp' to use.It's also nice that losing in a battle kicks you out of the battle, you're not 'dead' and go back to a previous point.Only exception to this are boss battles but they point they send you is more to give you a chance to rethink your costume and stamp combos more than making you re-play levels.My only real frusrtation is the graphics.  While fun and interesting, the level of detail lags my computer like crazy.  Even turning off shadowing and other features, navigating the leves and timing events in battle.			"

												Bought Humble Double Fine Bundle as an impulse buy last week. I knew what to expect from Psyconaughts and Stacking, but did not have a clue was Costume Quest was even about. To my surpises it's a solid game with mixture of quests, collectables, and solid combat. Basically the combat is baby's first Final Fantasy, yet for a person that never really played a Finaly Fantasy I had a blast playing Costume Quest. The each costume changes your abilties idea is done well and loads of fun. Only sad thing is that the game is a tad short (9 hours with all achievement unlocked) but hopefully one day it gets a squeal. Would recommend and I give it a DEN OUTTA DEN!			"

												This is a great little game.You can finish it in 7 hours easily.  3 hours for the Grubbins on Ice add-on.  This is not a con.In fact this is proof that a great little game with lots of personality can be a good product.  Not everything has to be a 50 million dollar epic 100 hour RPG!  Don't let this fool you though, there are lots of cool things to find, collect and do as you play through the story.This game has all the great traits of a Double Fine game.- well written- personality- good mechanics- highly enjoyableIt is the perfect length for the story and mood of the game.  Any longer and the mechanics of the fighting would have been too repetitive.This is good example of a smaller downloadable game executing really well.  Check it out for some light hearted fun!			"

												If you've ever wanted a game that's almost exactly like Paper Mario, only themed around Halloween instead of the Mushroom Kingdom, you're in luck.  The gameplay is nearly identical in most respects (run around completing simple tasks, gain stamps/costumes/badges/levels to improve your characters, start combat with monsters by whacking them on the main screen, then go into turn-based battles with timed attack/defense commands), but it's fun and light-hearted, not too difficult, and has a good sense of humor, i.e. Double Fine Halloween Paper Mario.  Play it with a controller, or you'll be sad.  And not that the art style doesn't look good already, but if your video card can handle it, enable the ""secret"" command-line SSAA mode (-ssaa2x or -ssaa4x) and it looks fantastic.			"

												Costume Quest is incredibly adorable. Although it took an extra year to get it from the consoles to the PC, I don't think anything was lost in the transition. Heck, it comes with the DLC, too!Gameplay's kind of a little repetative; you trick or treat, you kill some Gomoblins, do some puzzlin' here and there, sometimes there's a boss fight. There isn't much to break up the formula, but it works well enough on its own.What stood out to me was how charming the game itself is. It's very much a trip back to childhood, with memories of homemade box robots or giant-headed felt unicorns. It's really cute and to me one of it's big selling points.If you have any sort of childhood nostalgia, this will be a game for you.			"

												An RPG with combat similar to the paper mario series and some clever mechanics: your costume descides what class you are, and almost all of them have some out of combat ability. While it's not very hard or complicated, It makes up for this by being very cute and a lot of fun, with a very silly sense of humor.Not much else to say really, If you want a nice, quick game to play to get in the mood for Halloween, this would be it.

												   One word to sum it up? Charming.   Costume quest is a turn-based RTS at heart and enjoyable from start to end. I honestly can't think of any con except maybe the low difficulty.   Costume Quest comes with achievements, collectibles, spells, monsters,costumes, bosses. What else does a game need in the end?   Also comes with a free DLC and the promise for more and while not trying to spoil the end, it does offer an opening for future development.   My advice, get it, buy it, play it. You won't regret it. Worth every penny.			"

Controls & combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.Highly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce. Very short, 6 1/2 hours to beat game & DLC but the length just kind of feels right for the game.			"

												From the makers of Psychonauts, Costume Quest is an interesting and creative Halloween-themed RPG. You play as a group of imaginative children trying to stop the monsters of Repugia from stealing all of the candy on All Hallows' Eve. The battles are turn-based and simplistic enough so that even those who are new to the genre can get a hang of things quickly. The Cartoonish visuals are well done and perfect for this style of game. The writing is also quite humorous and exactly what you'd expect from Double Fine Productions. As long as you don't go into Costume Quest expecting a full-fledged RPG with a deep combat/inventory system, I think you can have quite a good time playing it. It's a fun and original game with entertaining battles and a lot of charm.			"

												At first this game seemed to childish, and I thought it would be rather lacking in gameplay, but I was proven wrong. The gameplay is fun, the item collecting is relatively challenging, and getting all the achievements made the entire experience feel rewarding.-PROS-*tons of characters to play as (as in costumes you can use to fight in)*an exciting reflex-style version of fighting (hit the commands to execute criticals)*humorous dialogue*wide explorable levels with interesting obstacles and secrets*references are abundant in many places, if you keep your eyes open!-cons- (and constructive criticisms)*The characters walk a bit slow, and to speed them up you need to use the Robot's skate-shoes. Only problem is, while doing this (if you find the robot not to your liking during combat) you can end up stuck as the robot during and upcoming fights.*Switching between costumes on the main character can be a bit annoying. It would make gameplay a little less annoying if you could equip different costumes to all 3 characters, then switch between characters for fast exploration trait usage.*Lack of facial animation. While it may have been intentional, and there are some emote-style expressions, it feels as if the animations aren't quite as developed in the real world of the game as they could be. There are many expressions used during combat for enemies, and for the costume fighters, but it doesn't really make up for the lack of facial animations in the game's explorable world.All in all, I rate this about an 8.5/10    -  Great game, could use some minor improvements, but all-in-all a great game.I highly recommend people play this if you like RPGs with a twist.

												This game is a tricky treat, in that the good, bad and ugly all relate to how Costume Quest definitely is not aimed at the ""core gamer"". If you spent tons of money on the latest gamer periphery, value your kill stats above all else and enjoy tons of gore - look elsewhere.After all this story is about kids and  seems fairly suitable for kids. In fact, I was thinking about giving this a Halloween run this year with a nephew of mine, but then realized one of the game's biggest shortcoming may be that it isn't voiced. That'll limit it's utility as a fun scary story for younger kids. Oh well.The game features some pretty nifty concepts (such as Trick-or-Treating being basically a core game mechanic), offers a combat system that is modern (with various abilitites and quick time events), yet fairly accessible (casual gamers will get the hang right quick), and a scary-cute graphics style that really is key to making it work. Okay, the game isn't perfect (if some of the costumes have any use beyong unlocking that 21st achievement, I haven't stumble across it; they simply feel bad in combat), and is more adventure than RPG length.Still. Costume Quest is well balanced for more casual gamers, has a very unique story and some nifty ideas. It may not quite be for ""core gamers"", but beyond that, it's for everyone.			"

												A ~6 hour adventure/RPG that's fueled by a Halloween setting and the cutest of art direction. Enter combat by trick or treating or just by approaching enemies in the world as they stroll. Combat takes place on a battleground where your costume 'comes to life'. Due to how hackneyed and simple the combat is it does get repetitive quite quickly. In saying that, some of the abilities are hilarious. The costumes are fun and interesting but shout-out to the American costume for having one of the best abilities i've ever seen which gets a giggle out of me every time. All in all it isn't a revolutionary game. It's repetitive but it's one of the most endearing, charm oozing games out there.			"

												8/10Nice little casual game.This is a cute halloween story. Even though it is aimed at younger people I still thought that this was a fun little game.  The combat is turn based and the rest of the game is open world made up of smaller areas. This game has a cutsey and cartoony art style which makes the game look as though you are playing through a cartoon. There are multiple halloween costumes each with their own special abilities in both the open word and combat. The story itself is very simple. You have to save your sibling from monsters by collecting halloween candy. It really incorporates the festival into it's gameplay. It's not just set during halloween, but there halloween activities to do: knock on doors for candy, apple bob puzzle and more. There are also some collectables to find which adds some extra play time. The characters are fun and engaging. At the beginning you can chose whether to play as either the brother or the sister.Overall I enjoyed this game. It was short and it was casual. Pleasent to play when you want to relax. I reccommend this to  younger people and children, however I believe that you can still get fun from this game, regardless of age.			"

												A fun, turn-based game centered around a group of children on Halloween. The story is about you trying to rescue your sibling from a race of monsters who are robbing the world of its candy. There are a variety of costumes to choose from that all have unique attacks and abilities.  The dialogue is funny and the characters are interesting.  It was shorter than I wanted it to be, but it was still very fun and entertaining.  Try it out if you get a chance to.			"

												Wow, what a great game.  It's a sleeper hit, in that it hits you under the chin like a sock puppet over a mailed fist.  Unexpected.  Total surprise. Sure, the gameplay is a little simplistic: poke around for candy, knock on doors, trip up monsters, turn-based party fight; rinse, repeat (with the occasional break to equip interesting items or use a cool costume power).  It is more than enjoyable enough to be forgiven any repetitiveness, and indeed serves to grease the wheels of the game's main attraction -- the fantastic story!Buy this game.			"

												Costume Quest with its add-on Grubbins on Ice is a nice Halloween-themed almost-RPG. It's, in one word, candy. I like candy.I highly recommend using a controller with this game. Keyboard controls felt pretty odd.Achievement Hint: The game doesn't know the date. It asks your machine for the date.+ Creepy Treats (collectibles) design+ Non-irritating but forgettable music+ Back To The Future discovery sound+ Costumes with exploration effects in addition to battle effects+ Costume battle action design0 no map0 Mostly inconsequential Battle Stamps (buffs)0 Level caps- Incorrect Battle Stamp descriptions- Pretty linear- Almost consistently no challenge- No description on save slots when loading- After the main game we see the credits headlined ""Grubbins on Ice""Technically the game is about quasi-isometric exploration with battle intermezzi.The battles are similar to those associated with RPG-Maker games or for example Final Fantasy 7 but instead of action meters there is simply a battle order. Without fail, first your up to three character attack, then the up to three enemies - repeat until defeat.Although this may sound dry, the game is surprisingly fun. I played the game for maybe 11 hours, got stuck twice for a total of about 90 Minutes (misunderstood game mechanics in the beginning + final boss in the add-on) and it was entertaining enough to feel like around 4 hours.This is mostly due to a number of good design decision. For me, the game wasn't so much about the main storyline but more about your party of characters speaking with each other, other inhabitants of the area and enemies, and it was about the battles. For some reason those things made me think, I'd like to play this in a Spongebob Squarepants world, at one point.In order of relevance the advancements in the game are: gaining companions, completing new costumes and getting Battle Stamps. Ultimately progress in the game requires the player to win fights (actually you go trick-or-treating but half the time that results in fights) but there are a number of obstacles that require you to explore beforehand.*Companions*Companions come with a new costume and provide an extra action per round in battle.*Costumes*You get costumes with characters or you are given a blueprint which sort of tells you, by way of a somewhat indiscriminate outline, which three components/materials you need to complete the costume. Components are unique and can be found in more or less hidden treasure chests, given to you by inhabitants of the world, and maybe, I don't quite remember, be part of battle spoils. Once a costume is complete, it can be assigned to any of your characters.Half of the costumes come with an Exploration Ability, i.e. an ability that can and (with the exception of one  costume in the add-on) must be used in the exploration part of the game. The most important ability is the Boost that you get with your very first costume. The Boost allows your party to speed across the area and is essential to the pacing of the game. At one point or another, the player is likely to miss something plus there is a little back and forth in the game anyway. Without the Boost ability that could have easily turned into a chore - very good design decision.All of the costumes but one have a Combat Ability, i.e. a special that needs two battle rounds to load and can be executed instead of a normal attack.Apart from having an effect on game-play the costumes just look cool. Even if there wasn't an achievement connected to that I'd still recommend to take every costume into battle at least once. I simply like the progression of the costumes from the materials you have to collect over the (not really) crappy ""not quite there"" or ""Dad did the best he could"" design of the costume as the characters are wearing it in exploration mode to the awesome ""this is how the kids see it"" (or maybe ""this is what adult think how the kids see it"") design in battle, character design and attacks.*Buffs*Battle Stamps are buffs that can be assigned to your party's characters, one each. Buffs include boosts to health, defence, dodging, counter-attacks, the over-powerful stun and the underwhelming auto-revive - usually buffs are passive. I basically stuck to the same buffs throughout the game, occasionally upgrading when a better version of the buff turned up.Unfortunately, some of the buffs have misleading descriptions, most irritatingly the auto-revive is supposed to revive a character after one round. While this is technically correct a more apt description would explain, the character is revived after two rounds (one round after one round, see?). I only ever tried the buff when I had trouble with the final boss in the add-on and having a character inactive for two rounds is just unacceptable in that fight.*Collectibles*The Creepy Treats are mostly just nice-to-have. You collect them mainly as battle spoils and sometimes trade them with inhabitants. I guess they are mostly original ideas, e.g. Licorice Cables, Chocolate Hamburgers, Coconuts & Bolts, Misfortune Cookies.*Battles*As said before, each round in battle has your character(s) act first, then the up to three enemies. Usually, rounds go on until one side is defeated. In theory, there is an option to run away but I haven't tried it yet.Each round each character chooses one of standard attack, the costume's Combat Ability (if ready) or the Battle Stamp buff (if active). Standard attacks have QTEs connected to them. There is a number of different QTEs, i.e. hitting a specific, dynamic button in time, hitting a specific, dynamic button on time, moving the left analogue stick around, and repeatedly pressing a specific, dynamic button. The type of QTE is dependent on the costume. If you pass the QTE, the character deals 50% more damage.Combat Abilities need two rounds to load so they can be used every third round. They are usually a tactical option and it's not always useful to use them right away. For some reason, attack buffs do not affect Combat Abilities. This may even make the standard attack a preferable option overall.Some Battle Stamp active buffs can be executed instead of a standard attack. Of those the most powerful are likely the different stun abilities which can take a single enemy out of the fight for up to two rounds. Except for bosses, the later game can be played without ever getting hit by an enemy. This is very powerful since even a ""failed"" enemy attack can take as much as 25% of a characters live away.Some Combat Abilities can prevent almost all damage to characters.Enemies mostly do standard attacks which lead to a defensive QTE which, on success, prevents half of the damage to the character. Magically inclined enemies can heal, buff attack or defence of one of the enemies.Battles are pretty short and easy but fun, largely because of the costumes. *Game Experience*A few more words on the game. One of the rather negative aspects about the game is its linearity. Bring me this and that or you cannot go on, fight those guys or you cannot go on, complete a costume or you cannot go on. But this is well compensated by the entertainment factor.Even though of limited use, I'd have liked a map to come with each area. This was sort of addressed in the add-on where you gain the ability to zoom out a bit with a costume.The game was a bit on the easy side.When loading/continuing a previous savestate the game doesn't tell you anything about the progress made. The game simply lists ""Slot 1"", ""Slot 2"" and ""Slot 3"". There isn't even an indication whether the slot actually contains any saved progress. This is a minor ugliness.I had a lot of fun with Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice and highly recommend the game. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.			"

												Usually when you think of a Halloween game, you think of a scary game, and those are all well and good; but what about a game that really brings the magic of Halloween itself? You know, costumes, trick or treating, having fun with your friends? Costume Quest somehow does it and does it very well. The first level already brims with nostalgia of days gone by (for me anyway) of walking the neighborhood at night and going door to door with a pale for the candy. You may wonder what the gameplay is like - well, first off the story is not serious, it's a light-hearted romp that'll make you smile for all ages. The overall story begins as your brother or sister (depending on who you choose to play as) gets kidnapped by strange monsters who love candy, and you are going to rescue them. The gameplay itself mostly is you going door to door in various places, and sometimes you get an adult with candy (which is like a currency in the game), or it could be a monster, which whom you have to fight.The fighting is done like a turn-based RPG, and you can get little things to help you out, called Battle Stamps. Each stamp has a unique ability you can use, each of your character gets one stamp per person, but you can switch them out if you don't care for it.There's no real dying in the game, you lose a battle, and you can just try again. The settings are really fun, like a neighborhood with various decorations, or a mall etc. The humor is really good, and adults and children will enjoy it, it's really a game for the family. Sadly, there's no co-op but it's fun on its own.There's also the DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"" included which adds 1-2 hours more. The core game isn't TOO long even getting everything, maybe 4-5 hours? But it's a lot of fun, and if you want to feel that Halloween nostalgia, this is the perfect game for you! The sequel is also very good, and worth checking out if you like the first one.			"

												It feels more like an internet game than a full game, but the game itself is pretty nice. You have to gather different costumes, which have different abilities. It gives the game a slight RPG feeling, even though the possbilities are very limited. Once you get used to the graphics (kiddy look), it's really playable and if you like to collect achievements (counting on the fact that you're already bored), this makes it a very interesting game. The creators want to show you every cutscene though. That's boring. 7/10			"

												I recommend this game to certain types of gamers.  It's very charming and sweet, but it is a little formulaic and tightly scripted and linear.  As someone who only started playing video games again a year or two ago, this is really in my wheelhouse and I can totally see others would find it somewhat tedious.  It's a pretty standard but minimal RPG: every encounter is planned, there are no truly random encounters, there is no way to grind and there are few real choices, except finding out what costumes and battle stamps work best together.  But there are all kinds of neat stuff, such as the trick-or-treating aspect and all the cute themed side quests like bobbing for apples and trading cards with other kids.  The dialogue and the whimsy are its strong suit.  I loved finding out what costumes would look like in battle and what their special abilities would be.  I personally loved the collecting candy aspect.  I could pail-bash as many garbage cans as they put in front of me!  After completing Grubbins on Ice, I highly recommend you play it after Costume Quest because I think the story works better that way.  I liked that environment especially.			"

												After trying Stacking and being disappointed, I wasn't sure if I'd like Costume Quest. Psychonauts was good - if not limited by platforming - and Costume Quest is right up there with it.The style is a charming, delightfully-quirky one that puts you in the role of a child on Halloween, trick or treating with their sibling. The pace spirals beautifully until you're facing off against giant monsters in a twisted maze, firing rockets.One of this game's seeling points is its fantastic humour; like Psychonauts it puts you in the position of a child and throws referential and meta humour at you, barrelling on whether you get the jokes or not. This is one of its strongest aspects as it's funny to those who get it and doesn't slow down those who don't.The combat is surprisingly deep considering the simple controls and is very balanced...except for the final boss in the extra adventure, Grubbins On Ice. The final boss of that doesn't follow the rules established in all the rest of the combat.Despite this little hiccough, it is a easy to grasp, QTE-based combat with scope for personal preference.One last thing to note is that it isn't very long; 9 hours to 100% it with all the achievements. There are shorter games out there and there are certainly longer games, but this is one of the funniest.			"

												Costume Quest is an interesting RPG with a few minor flaws that keep it on just the wrong side of the greatness. Pros-Amazing Art Style, very cartoony and friendly.-Halloween Theme is awesome.-Manages to be appealing to kids but enjoyable for adults.Cons-A little too simple in certain areas. -Lack of combat and customization variety -Rediculous difficulty curve So firstly as I said the style is amazing, a lot of greens, oranges and blacks mix well to give the game a nostalgic feeling of halloween's past. You use different kids halloween costumes to have different powers and they change form between the overworld and the battles, both of which look great, almost cell shaded and comic like in places. The story is similarly charming and cartoon-like with a lot of effort put into appealing to the child in you and the nostalgia that part of you holds. I won't give out details but needles to say it is certainly interesting and although it doesn't take you to many 'new' places it will probably give you a fair few chuckles while playing it. However gameplay wise is were problems start to happen. It has solid enough combat, basically lifted directly from super mario RPG, with an extra damage/extra defence mechanic which has you playing very brief mini-games with each hit. Although the combat is solid it is also a little same-y, you'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over again but as you constantly get new costumes and abilites it doesn't really get boring. A big plus that helps remove some of the repetative nature of the game is a lack of grinding. Although you have to fight a certain number of fights in each area (sort of) you don't usually find yourself grinding to gain XP as you will rarley find yourself outstripped by enemies...until the ending. Okay so I'm not going to give the ending away or anything but between the last normal enemies you fight, groups of 3 level 10 enemes, and the final boss there is a 10 level difference. Meaning that although you can blitz through most of the game up until this point (completeing all quests is seriously not even a chore if you keep your eyes peeled) you will have to go back to previous areas to grind up at least 5 levels before you are even remotely ready to take on the final fight. This isn't helped by the final boss' ability to clone itself into 3, although that is the least of the issues. One final annoying point is that the ability to hold a button to go fast in the overworld is tied to a specific costume which means your main character has to wear it the entire game if you want to be able to move with any decent amount of speed, a very poor decision. Overall not a bad game, a little short and a huuuuuge difficulty/grin wall right at the very end but it has a lot of charm and if you can get past the issues you will find a great little experience. Worth picking up for such a low price and sure to be someones nostalgic memory in the future. 8/10			"

												Quick and fun, and funny. The story is cute and satisfying. Exploring each Halloween themed level is the best part. Trick or treating gets a bit repetetive but collecting cards, candy, battle stamps, and costumes keeps it rewarding. The Grubbins On Ice addon while short is equally as enjoyable, though its Christmas vibe isnt as strong. Double Fine quality!			"

												Costume Quest is a amazing way to have some halloween fun! If you like the idea of a game about trick or treating with quests, a system with property boosting items a.k.a. Batle Stamps, monsters, transforming costumes for a final fantasy like combat, AND CANDY! This is the perfect game for you! The story is at sometimes stupid because why would there be a medival style town right next to a carnival about colors and fun?! But if you don't worry about what's wrong with the game, it's a very fun 8 - 10 hour experience with a very cool comical art style!			"

												Costume Quest plays like an introductory JRPG: classes are mapped onto interchangeable costumes that are unlocked by finding materials in the environment, equipment comes in the form of 'battle stamps' that can be purchased from vendors, and there are no consumables or 'game over' moments. Combat is simple and turn-based, but made slightly more interesting by requiring the player to press a random button at a given time to maximize or mitigate damage.It's a Doublefine game, so humor is a big part of the presentation. It's suitable for younger players, though some of the jabs at consumer culture and common RPG schticks will probably go over their heads.Between CQ and its (included) DLC, there's roughly eight hours of content.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/08/12/costume-quest/Costume Quest is an adventure game by Double Fine Productions. It takes place during Halloween and you are either a twin sister or a twin brother who has to save your sibling from evil trolls.Unfortunately, when you start the game you can instantly tell that it's made for console. I gave it two minutes of wobbly movement using my arrow keys until I gave up and plugged in the Xbox-controller. You can also tell from the gameplay that this is a definite console game. One part of the game is basically to smash as many objects as possible and to solve easy quests to collect candy, the currency used in game. (And, for me, that becomes hopelessly monotonous.)The other part is to fight enemies, which is done with a classic turn-based fighting system. There's quick-time events here and you have to be fast on your xyab-buttons to get bonuses when you fight. (Something that also enhances the feeling of this being a console game.)In the end I can summarize the experience with saying that the graphics and the story gives some charm to the game, but that the gameplay becomes repetative. On the other hand, with an Xbox-controller, it would work great as some casual entertainment on a sickday or when you're a little hung over.Costume Quest will also be great if you can't get enough of collecting stuff in games. There's a long list of quests, achievements, halloween clothes, trading cards, and stamps that you can try to collect.4/10 candy corn "

												Interesting concept that's been nicely implemented. I have to admit that I didn't think much of it the first few times I tried playing with keyboard + mouse. Playing it with a controller made the experience far more enjoyable and natural, especially the combat.Graphics were pleasant overall. There were bits of animation and character design that just really stood out for me and made the game addicting to play. Same with the music. There were definitely moments where the music was just spot on and really amplified the experience.The one con I have is that one of the costume powers made me really hungry. Don't play the last area on an empty stomach!			"

												While the graphics and atmosphere are invitive, the game is very repetetive. In each area you have to trick-or-treat all the houses, Fight in about half of them.

												Costume Quest is a game about capitalism and the futility of fighting the system. You play as Wren or Reynold, fraternal twins locked into a system in which happiness is always kept at arm's length. Your twin, the object of your worldly fulfillment, is taken from you, and you are forced to incorporate yourself into the capitalist consumer machine in order to free them from bondage - i.e. willfully enslaving yourself even deeper in order to cast off perceived oppression. The erstwhile heroes are indoctrinated into consumerism through perceived need. Costumes and battle stamps are tools by which they can defeat their perceived oppressors, and candy and creepy treats are the currency by which they can obtain them. The creepy treats only award a special costume upon completing a full set, forcing the consumer-hero to seek out other members of their in-group to trade with and developing a reliance upon victimizing the out-group in order to obtain more. The same is true for candy, but on a much larger scale: widescale destruction and abuse of natural resources is encouraged, and upon reentering a zone the supply magically replenishes itself. Candy is ultimately spent on battle stamps, an entirely extraneous commodity that the game can be won without, but is marketed as invaluable and a means by which to constantly sink the children's personal supply of wealth.The true capitalist hero of this story is Sadie, a brave young entrepeneur with a monopoly on the battle stamps market who is happy to aid the heroes in their fight against the villainous 'monsters.' She allows her customers to develop a dependence upon her product before beginning to dramatically ramp up the price to obtain newer and better versions of the same - designed obselescence at its finest. By the end of the game the player is lucky if they have several hundred pieces of candy in their bucket, while Sadie sits on thousands that the player spent to constantly upgrade their battle stamps. The 'monsters' of the game are cast as villains bent on hoarding all the world's candy for themselves, when in reality they are collecting it in order to save their own lives. Sadie, on the other hand, is motivated purely by profit - lying, expanding, and price-gouging to drive it ever higher.The harsh reality is that this game is designed to indoctrinate the player into heedlessly reaping the world's resources and victimizing their competition in the name of achieving fulfillment. They are taught to at the same time fear and trust the two heads of the capitalist serpent, sybomically mirrored by the twin heads of the Doublefine logo: the Repugians, who are the face of foreign investments, and Sadie, the friendly face who is always there to help. 10/10 illuminati confirmed.

												I've only just started this game, and I can't get enough of it. I will hopefully update this review once I am done with it, but as of right now, I just need to go ahead and wholeheartedly recommend this game.The plot, artwork, and dialogue are cute and fantastic, and very immersive. The combat and gameplay are extremely easy to learn and fun to do. Though it may be simple, it does not come across as monotonous because of the quick variations there are to the combat, the randomness of encounters (both for going to houses and what children are around each street corner). There is a ton of mini-quests to give this game a sense of purpose, though it is still rewarding to complete them.Go ahead and do yourself a favor, and get this game. It doesn't even take up a lot of data to download!			"

												Short answer, yes, i higly recommend it.And the long one:Costume Quest is a light-hearted rpg game, made by one of my favorites developers, Double Fine. The game mechanics are really nice, there are a great variety of costumes and somewhat variable enemies. My only complaint regarding the gameplay is that the fighting mechanics get a little bit repetitive due to some unskipable animations, but nothing too big. Some peaple reported some bugs, but i haven't found any in my playtrough. The game story is light-hearted, but good and there are some really nice jokes. The game's graphics are a cartoonish style and are really well polished and beautifull. I really loved the game, it's a really escape from the same repetitive game formula of nower days, It is somewhat short, I took about 5 hours to finish it, and i'm usually slower than the average to beat a game (It took me about 4 hours to beat the DLC grubbings ice). That being said, I highly recommend Costume Quest for all players.9.8/10			"

												Costume Quest is another fun game that brings back memories of childhood, especially during the nights of Halloween. This game is full of goofiness and humor, and has a great feel to it compared to most other RPG's that are gloomy or depressing. However, the lack of variety of enemies this game has to offer can make the combat seem a bit stale after awhile. Also, the game really only gets difficult towards the beginning of the second area, and becomes progressively easier from there on out. Overall, the game was still fun for what it was worth. 7/10			"

												Costume Quest is a child's fantasy turned into a real game. You follow the protagonists as they have to fight a menacing threat on Halloween and their costumes will help them. I will give a short explanation concerning several aspects of the game.Gameplay:The gameplay is pretty solid, though it can get repetitive after a while. Each costume brings with it a certain power or ability that can be used to get past certain obstacles (Such as entering a location, passing an object and more). This means that every new costume you unlock will be used, one way or the other, to acquire new adventures, enemies, candy and secrets.The combat is turn based, but it works. The idea behind it is simple. You have to press the attack button (E for keyboard) and then time the same button again at the right moment (A small bar appears) to gain an effective attack.  After you have attacked, the enemies will attack your group. Defense works the same. The enemy goes into slow-motion, you get a chance to press the right button to defend yourself. Succeed and you get less damage, fail and you get more damage. On the third turn of the battle you unlock your costume's special abilities. And last, but not least, you can augment your costumes to enhance your performance in battle or cause status effects to your enemies by battle stamps, which you can purchase. Candy is the currency in the game.Story:The story is simple, but fun. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, it's pretty much a child's fantasy turned into a game. You have to fight monsters, your Halloween costumes give you super powers and you get to save the world. There's not really much to tell in this part.Sound:Same as with the story, the music is simple, but it works. It's not the type of soundtrack that starts to get annoying after a while and it does give you the proper atmosphere for the game.Style:The game has a very colourful appearance and you'll see this in-game as well. From the small houses in the comfy neighbourhood to the big, shiny, blasting super costumes, everything just screams fantasy. Total:If you're looking for a fun game and you don't mind a bit of repetitive combat, a simple story with a rich fantasy style attached and you can miss a few bucks/ euros, then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're looking for a game with engaging gameplay, a rich story, a good challenge, this game won't be for you.Personal:I recommend it, I liked it, finally got around to finish it shortly before writing this review. A thumbs up from me.			"

												Want to play a eastern style rpg but can't be having with all that spiky or multicoloured hair? Want an rpg with a sense of humour? Like Halloween?You, Sir, have very specific tastes. Thankfully Costume Quest ticks all those boxes.Costume Quest is by Double Fine, the company that brought Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Stacking and, more recently, Broken Age. It's a pretty good lineage to come from.You play as one of a pair of siblings, the sister Wren or the brother Reynold. Whichever of the two, you choose the other will get kidnapped and it's your job to rescue them.Along the way you will collect companions, complete minor quests and collect items to construct other costumes. Why would you want to do that you may ask? Well, beside acquiring the achievement for doing so, it will also give you some more options for combat and exploring the game world.Each costume has abilities when you go into combat wearing them. They can roughly be divided into three types (though some will span multiple types); Offence, Support and finally Defence.As you complete quests and fight your characters will level up and gain Battle Stamps. These stamps add extra abilities or buff your characters and winning the game is near impossible without them.The combat is in the style of an eastern style rpg. Your enemies stand on one side of the screen, you on the other and you take turns attacking each other. You defend yourself through a QTE (quick time event), which if you press the correct button on time will lessen the damage taken. Basic attacks are similar to the defence, you wait  for the prompt to mash a button, wiggle a stick or or just press the right button at the right time and if your successful you'll be rewarded with a critical hit. As you fight your costumes special abilities will charge up (usually around the 3rd turn). These attacks don't have a QTE and, depending on the costume, do great damage with an added effect, heal or protect.Try as I might I can't really fault the game. It's a little short but it's not exactly breaking the bank when it comes to buying it. You could easily complete the game and it's DLC (complete with all achievements for those that care for them) in a weekend.I recommend this game very highly, it's asking price isn't even that high for what it provides you.

Even though the story itself is short, but it's refreshing!I've never play this kind of casual RPG before so it's so good to know that there's a game like this.The game itself is like JRPG with turn based element, but the whackiness of the game is the element in it.The puzzle is good, not hard (well it would be somewhat hard for kids) too.The graphic is 3D cartoonized.For the story, if you want to know how kids feel in Halloween, then you must buy this game.I really hope that there is another type of RPG like this in European game, simple but make you refresh to play it.Overall 8.5/10. I really recommend it for the casual or hardcore gamer out there to play this game!			"

												Remember when you were a kid and you played pretend in a costume, especially around Halloween? Well in this game you really do become your costume to fight off monsters and save your twin sibling from an evil witch and her army of candy-stealing grubbins on Halloween Night.Cutesy and silly, but with some clever jokes and some really fun combat. You unlock new powers by making new costumes using found items. Whether thats a Giant Robot that shoots chest missles at monsters, a unicorn that heals it's allies with rainbow magic, or a french fry crab (note: I'm serious) that stuns enemies by shooting superheated salt crystals at them there's lots of neat combinations for every battle.Double Fine is one of my favorite game companies these days and the unique and unusual titles they come up with are the reason why. In an industry mostly dominated by gritty realistic shooter games, blood soaked sci-fi shooter games, and football its nice to see a company that goes against the norm.			"

												A nice experience, but the main story is very short, like about 6 hours on average. It does not have a complex item or battle system rpg (quick time events for critical hits and defending) so its real easy to dive in and not get confused, but still remains challenging and involving.  My main annoyances is the fixed camera, which makes it annoying because youll sometimes find a large prop hiding your character on screen, and there are only 3 map areas.			"

												This game will make you feel like a child again. You play as a child whose sibling, dressed as candy, is kidnapped by gremlins who steal candy on Halloween for their gremlin overlord. You collect a series of costumes and candy to work your way towards your kidnapped sibling. During a tedious RPG-style battle system, you become a Power Rangers-style gigantic form of your costume, each with a unique ability. Using the powers of your costumes, you defeat the gremlins, collect the candy in the area, and move on to the next. The humor is charming. There are many childlike jokes told as you communicate with other trick-or-treaters, but not in a sense of immaturity; the jokes will make you laugh like a child, fully encompassing the character. If you're a fan of the way Nintendo makes you feel when playing their games, or any of Double Fine's other imaginative productions, this game is a definite pick-up.			"

												I had caught this game on a steam sale, and had kept it shelved until recently. Needless to say I was caught off guard by just how good of a game this is. It has a turn based combat system which, while simple, is effective at avoiding repetition due to the amazing combat animations. The story while not ground breaking, has an original flair to it managing to mix in some dark humor in it's seemly childlike charm.The game with the DLC is a total of around 8 hours for 100% completion, and I have to say the game is worth full price for it's entertainment value. Should you find it on sale for 50% or 75% I would say this game is a must buy.			"

Look up in the dictionary the word 'fun' and the definition will read 'Play Costume Quest'. The game is designed with children and simplicity in mind, but that doesn't hold it back on being a one-of-a-kind experience. If you're just starting to play video games or trying to get someone into RPG(role playing games) this title is meant for you. With plenty of humor and enterainment abound, 'Costume Quest' rises above the rest.			"

												Costume Quest is a game that is both a lot of fun and incredibly gripping. This is the kind of game that wisks you away back to your childhood memories of roaming the neighborhood going door to door trick-or-treating and the whole adventure feels like the kind of 'adventures' I went on as a kid. The gameplay itself was also pretty interesting, despite most of it being completing quests and turn based battles. The ability to construct new costumes and gain different abilities in the overworld and the battle system was great. Plus I feel that some of the quest objective help reinforce the Halloween theme, as each part of the world has trick-or-treating at every house in the area, much how as a kid I made sure to hit up every house. My only real complaint is that the battle system can get a bit repetitive and it feels just a bit to easy to do well with, but other than that I had a great time playing Costume Quest. It took me a little over 5 hours to play through the main story, but I still have yet to play the ""Grubbins on Ice"" story, so I would have to say that this is one of the few games where I feel it is still worth it if you pay the full $10 for it.

												Alright so I just finished this game and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this from start to finish.  The combat system feels a lot the Paper Mario series, so timed attacks were pretty simple to figure out on the fly.  The costume battles made me think of Ultraman in a way (except that our heroes didn't need a Beta Capsule to grow) and well it wasn't a long game, the trek itself felt like it was though. I mean considering that what I did was a 100% blind run and just kept going with it, well..it brought the kid in me and this game really was an experience.  I'd say get this game for those who want a good laugh and something that makes us remember the good ol' days of Halloween and for the sheer reason that all we wanted for that day was CANDY!! So at this point in time, go check out my LP of it over on my channel and enjoy, I'll be taking the rest of the day off! TENKAI MUSOU!!			"

												This game is great for those that are looking for a casual experience. Even better is that it's suitable for all ages, so don't let the name or theme fool you.I particularly liked the humor in this game. The variety of costumes and abilities however, is offset by the fact that soon after you get the basics of the game, battles become very tiresome.The game also offers a bit of strategy... no seriously, combining the correct costumes with the correct abilities (battle stamps), and choosing who attacks what and with what is pretty enjoyable, challanging, and evenrewarding once you reach the harder enemies.All in all, this game is casual, so if you're looking for adventure or action, you've com to the wrong place.

												I've played a coupld Double FIne games and they have yet again made a well rounded game.The game itself is simple yet at the same time can be complex in its own right with the simple RPG elements. The combat for the most part boils down to timed button pressing and selecting the right Battle Stamp for each character(these are basically special stat boosters) and earning xp to level up and Candy as currency to buy Battle Stamps to use in combat.Graphics alone are what really help to sell the game since the art style is so quirky and unique that it suits the comical style of the game.As for story and characters its almost like Tim Shafer took the Peanuts comics and made his own twisted version of it(in a good way) but for the most part the story is VERY simple but you don't notice that because the characters are the selling point honestly.10/10 Overall it was a fun little game that you can beat in around 6 to 8 hours depending if you're a completionist or not and regardless if you're a little kid or a 30+ something adult you will enjoy this little game.

												All right, Costume Quest was a fun little game. To sum it up in three words: ""Baby's First J-RPG""The strongest point of Costume Quest is the writing. The banter reminds me of old Cartoon Network shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. It pretty much carried the game for me.The gameplay itself is familiar from Chrono Triggers and Final Fantasies. Turn-based hit point reduction. I don't see anyone who has played a turn-based game being challenged by the combat.But in the end, the game is clearly developed for children. And unlike most children's games, this one has intelligence and wit behind it. I would recommend this to people who would like to give their child or child-like entity an easy and painless foray into the wondrous world of turn-based games.			"

												Costume Quest is an extremely charming Halloween-themed turn-based battle adventure. You collect candy, fight monsters and complete quests and it is really a joy to play. While the world you travel through is quite varied, the gameplay mechanics are not. Especially the fighting can become tedious. The saving feature here are the costumes that make your characters use different attacks. If you switch the costumes around a bit before entering new battles you can make it a little more interesting. Each character just has one basic and one special attack and you can only alter the damage you do a little by successfully pressing a certain button or button combination, in short: a quick-time event. I enjoyed it nevertheless.			"

												This is a great little game by Double Fine, and when I say little, I really do mean little. It took me about 6.5 hours to beat the game, plus its free (on steam) continuation of the story, Grubbins on Ice. There will no doubt be another added on continuation of the game, sometime in the future.The combat system is very similar to Super Mario RPG's, in that you time a button press to both do extra damage to an enemy, and to take less damage from an enemy. But this also has the addition of Battle Stamps, which act as battle-enhancing items. Stuff like applying a poison DoT to an enemy, or recovering some hp after each round in combat.All in all, even though I bought this the day before it went 50% off for halloween, I am very glad with this purchase, and still have the next chapter to look forward to. Buy this game, especially while it is on sale.			"

												Costume Quest is an RPG about trick-or-treating. You control a group of kids tasked with defeating a small army of monsters led by an evil witch in order to retrieve whichever of the sibling protagonists you don't choose at the start.Did I mention that it's by Double Fine Productions? Because that would explain that previous paragraph, for you.There's a weird division in imagination and reality in this game. The monsters are real. The plight is real. There's actually a witch ordering giant crows to steal candy to further her mysterious plans. But then once you enter battle, it becomes imaginary. I believe. I could certainly be wrong, but nobody else seems to notice when the heroes transform into colossal and more impressive versions of the things they're wearing costumes of. Even the monsters look much less doofy once battle commences. This all brings up an interesting point to consider, though, which is what the final boss looks like in reality - it's only ever seen in battle, you see (Grubbins on Ice notwithstanding, as that doesn't seem as married to this rule as the main game).Gameplay mostly consists of exploring, collecting, and fighting. You'll be searching every nook and cranny for various items to complete various quests, as well as to further the plot. Battles are launched by knocking on doors for candy (and later by encountering roaming monsters, as well), and abide by a turn-based system which encourages timed button presses, a la Mario RPG. There are also, notably, a limited number of battles (except maybe in the upper floors of the mall), so you're not expected to sit around and grind levels for hours to proceed.Different costumes give the kids different powers. Outside of battle, they're useful for overcoming obstacles or completing objectives. But inside battle, costumes are essentially classes. The robot is all attack, while the knight can defend himself or his teammates. Lady Liberty can heal the entire team partially, but the unicorn can heal one person to 100% HP.Movement is kind of odd, at first. If you point in a direction, your kid swivels in place to face that direction before setting off. Once in motion, you can make smooth turns, but pointing in the opposite direction will cause them to stop, turn, and then go. You get used to it by the second area, but it'll feel pretty wonky at first.The console releases of Costume Quest eventually received the paid DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"". You'll be pleased to hear that the DLC is now included at no additional charge! This bonus Winter-themed adventure sends the kids to the Grubbins' home... world? Dimension? Something. There are new costumes, stamps, and abilities to be found, and new monster types to fight. It's a quality addition, and worth the attention once the main game is complete.Costume Quest has become something of a Halloween tradition for me now. It's just short enough to invite such replayability. There are three major areas in the main game, and one more in Grubbins on Ice. Each one will likely take about two or three hours to complete, giving the game an 8-12 hour length for each playthrough. Just perfect for a run-through once every October, and the perfect game for the holiday. Costume Quest captures the spirit and imagination of trick-or-treating spendidly. Which suits me fine. I'm too old to go out trick or treating, anymore, but you're never too old to fight monsters in your underwear at 2 in the morning.			"

												This has become my wife's favorite video game of all time, giving a new meaning to Halloween.  Gameplay is simple, with just a few mechanics that are repeated almost to the point of boredom, but the story is what really sells the game.  Everything is cartoonishly fun, down to little touches in background characters.  Quick reflexes help in combat situations, but aren't strictly essential, so even kids will be able to play.  (Those who can't or won't read might need help understanding what to do, though, particularly in the first combat.)It's short and fairly easy to complete fully, so the replay value is limited to perhaps once a year.  Fortunately, there's a fairly obvious time of year to play it.Oh, and yes, don't try to enter the tent in the camping store.  The multitude of waist-high fences can occasionally be annoying, but only there are they truly game-breaking.			"

												Alright so I just finished this game and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this from start to finish.  The combat system feels a lot the Paper Mario series, so timed attacks were pretty simple to figure out on the fly.  The costume battles made me think of Ultraman in a way (except that our heroes didn't need a Beta Capsule to grow) and well it wasn't a long game, the trek itself felt like it was though. I mean considering that what I did was a 100% blind run and just kept going with it, well..it brought the kid in me and this game really was an experience.  I'd say get this game for those who want a good laugh and something that makes us remember the good ol' days of Halloween and for the sheer reason that all we wanted for that day was CANDY!! So at this point in time, go check out my LP of it over on my channel and enjoy, I'll be taking the rest of the day off! TENKAI MUSOU!!			"

												Recommended because it's one of the funniest games ever. Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst battle systems ever. Although you can change costumes (effectively classes) outside of battle, once one starts you're stuck with what you went in wearing. And that's where the problem begins. Each class only has one attack and a timed special ability, none of which are particularly interesting. Worse, because there are only two costumes in the game with healing abilities, every battle had to be designed around the possibility that the player would be totally unable to heal. The end result is that every battle is exactly the same thing whether you're fighting a boss or a basic encounter. They tried to add a bit of variation with equippable Battle Stamps. Unfortunately, you're limited to one per character, can't change in battle, and some of them are objectively better than others. They don't solve the problem. If you're willing to put up with the awful battles for fantastic writing and some unique scenarios, it's worth the sale price of $5. I'd struggle to recommend it at much higher of a price, unfortunately, because this is a game that hits its peak early. It's a fantastic first 90 minutes, a pretty good second 90 minutes, and a third that I didn't finish because it had become primarily battles rather than laughs. Minor note: This game has terrible mouse acceleration that can't be turned off. It doesn't affect gameplay at all, but it makes menu navigation annoying.			"

It took me about 10 hours to beat the base game and then the dlc.  The best part of this game was the imagination of the kids that allowed them to use their cardboard Halloween costumes as amazingly deadly characters in battle.  Truly a unique game.

												This game will make you feel like a child again. You play as a child whose sibling, dressed as candy, is kidnapped by gremlins who steal candy on Halloween for their gremlin overlord. You collect a series of costumes and candy to work your way towards your kidnapped sibling. During a tedious RPG-style battle system, you become a Power Rangers-style gigantic form of your costume, each with a unique ability. Using the powers of your costumes, you defeat the gremlins, collect the candy in the area, and move on to the next. The humor is charming. There are many childlike jokes told as you communicate with other trick-or-treaters, but not in a sense of immaturity; the jokes will make you laugh like a child, fully encompassing the character. If you're a fan of the way Nintendo makes you feel when playing their games, or any of Double Fine's other imaginative productions, this game is a definite pick-up.			"

												Tell me, you ever play a game called Paper Mario? Well, this game is kinda like that, only instead of playing as a plumber in a world made out of paper, you play a child during Halloween with an overactive imagination.. Or, is it in his/her mind? I suppose that is a mystery for yourself to solve.Costume Quest is a charming, yet sadly short, turn-based RPG with an amusing story about two siblings who used to bicker with each other on a daily basis.. Until one of  them gets kidnapped, leading the other on a quest to get their sibling back, and in the process making new friends as well as learning to get along with the sibling they once disliked. As I said, the game is kinda like Paper Mario, where there are no random battles, and combat is based on timing button presses to get the highest damage as well as reduce incoming damage. What makes it different is the game's main gimmic: Costumes.There is a decent selection of outfits one can aquire throughout the game, some earned during the story, others by completing optional quests. Depending on the costume you and your friends wear, it'll affect how fights play out. The costume YOU wear is also important, because some outfits have abilities that'll allow you to progress or make your game easier (Such as lighting up dark paths or sneaking around in plain sight).Of course, this game isn't just about costumes, but also trick or treating. In each chapter, you will be required to do some trick or treating in order to unlock gates. This is a rather amusing system, because behind each door lies a, of course, a trick or treat. If it is a treat, you get some free candy, which can be used to buy upgrades and abilites that can allow you to customise your style of play beyond just what costume you prefer to main. However, if you stumble across a trick, you get tossed into a simple battle. Anyone who played Paper Mario probably has a good idea how these battles work for the most part. They are quite fun, but after awhile it does get repetitive due to the simple combat system. Doesn't mean it is boring, though, because some battles really are quite engaging (and in a few cases, really hard unless you make use of a certain outfit or stamp).At first, combat is challenging and thrilling, but as you progress in the game, it does start to get a bit anti-climatic (At least, until near the end), where you are able to effortlessly mow down anyone who crosses your path. Doesn't help that the highest you can level is up to 10, which brings up another sad thing about this game: It is short....At first, the game will seem quite epic, your expectations probably being that it'll be a decently sized venture.. But then you reach level 10, and discover that you cannot level any further.. it is at that point that you discover that the end is near, and when I discovered this, I was a bit disappointed... I had gotten so invested that I was sad my adventure was almost over. At least the game ended with a bang, and I liked that, but it left me wanting more. Thankfully, there is a bonus adventure for those willing to brave it that are not totally satisfied.Is this game worth checking out? I'd say so. Despite its flaws, it is a charming title that I am glad I had the pleasure to experience, even if it was a short one.			"

												Costume Quest is a child's fantasy turned into a real game. You follow the protagonists as they have to fight a menacing threat on Halloween and their costumes will help them. I will give a short explanation concerning several aspects of the game.Gameplay:The gameplay is pretty solid, though it can get repetitive after a while. Each costume brings with it a certain power or ability that can be used to get past certain obstacles (Such as entering a location, passing an object and more). This means that every new costume you unlock will be used, one way or the other, to acquire new adventures, enemies, candy and secrets.The combat is turn based, but it works. The idea behind it is simple. You have to press the attack button (E for keyboard) and then time the same button again at the right moment (A small bar appears) to gain an effective attack.  After you have attacked, the enemies will attack your group. Defense works the same. The enemy goes into slow-motion, you get a chance to press the right button to defend yourself. Succeed and you get less damage, fail and you get more damage. On the third turn of the battle you unlock your costume's special abilities. And last, but not least, you can augment your costumes to enhance your performance in battle or cause status effects to your enemies by battle stamps, which you can purchase. Candy is the currency in the game.Story:The story is simple, but fun. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, it's pretty much a child's fantasy turned into a game. You have to fight monsters, your Halloween costumes give you super powers and you get to save the world. There's not really much to tell in this part.Sound:Same as with the story, the music is simple, but it works. It's not the type of soundtrack that starts to get annoying after a while and it does give you the proper atmosphere for the game.Style:The game has a very colourful appearance and you'll see this in-game as well. From the small houses in the comfy neighbourhood to the big, shiny, blasting super costumes, everything just screams fantasy. Total:If you're looking for a fun game and you don't mind a bit of repetitive combat, a simple story with a rich fantasy style attached and you can miss a few bucks/ euros, then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're looking for a game with engaging gameplay, a rich story, a good challenge, this game won't be for you.Personal:I recommend it, I liked it, finally got around to finish it shortly before writing this review. A thumbs up from me.			"

												One really great achievement of Costume Quest is the combination of childhood fantasy stories filled with knights, robots, pirates and such ; the classical gameplay of japanese adventure rpg and the whole spiced-up with humor.Sure the game might seem short for a grown-up, even too easy or too linear, but that's the kind of game I'd have loved to play when I was a child and one of the most enjoyable I've played recently. Costume Quest was so refreshing after a trail of damn-too-serious or damn-too-hard-core games, I just can't wait to play the second one !Thanks Double Fine !			"

												halloween-themed rpg with simple turn-based combat. gave me billy and mandy vibes at times. felt like an rpg for kids with its simple quests and directions, but i love halloween too much to feel any shame. not that i don't think adults won't enjoy this.the story doesn't take itself seriously and was good enough to make me want to find out what happens next, the funny dialogue and cute cartoon artstyle mix well to create a comfortable halloween feel.the combat has quick-time events for offense and defense. classes (attack, defense, support, and special) are determined by the costume the character wears. costumes are changeable and each has its own stats (health and attack) and unique special attack that is charged every 3 turns. there are also equipable ""battle stamps"" that modify health and attack. the battle stamps can also give a unique ability such as resurrection, poison, or dodge chance. the combat was easy enough to where i rarely felt the threat of defeat. the camera is impressively cinematic in battle with pans, zooms, and letterboxing.gameplay outside of combat has literal trick-or-treating, fetch quests, bobbing for apples, playing hide-and-seek, defeating specific enemies, and doing-this-to-be-able-to-go-there's to progress in the story and collect items. some costumes have an ability outside of combat that allow you to access otherwise inaccessible areas. the dialogue and atmosphere keep the overworld entertaining despite the simplicity. there is a quest log to help you keep track, but there is no map. however, the areas were not so complex to where i felt lost.there are three levels that you can teleport between, so don't worry about missables. you also can't jump. this is frustrating when something you want to get is just out of reach, but look around enough and you will find a way to get to it.

												This was sort of a ""Child's First RPG"". There are attack, magic and support costumes that you can choose from as you work your way around Halloween in the American suburbs to defeat the candy-stealing monsters and their witch boss. It is ridiculously easy - there is no challenge to the turn-based combat as long as you take out the healers first - but I still enjoyed the two evenings I spent finishing this game and the add-on. If you're looking for something serious, this probably isn't what you want, but it has some fantastic charm in both the world-creation and the writing. Also the magic fry-crab/spider thing is pretty hilarious. I played as that for ages.Edit - I got this game a long time ago, but found playing with a keyboard completely unworkable. A controller made the game playable.			"

												For me, Costume Quest is the archetypal current Double Fine game. It has a great idea, nice presentation, and tedious, repetitive gameplay where you do the same thing over and over again until the designers thought it was long enough to satisfy the minimum game length people want. SomehowCostume Quest manages to distill and concentrate the absolute worst elements of JRPG design into a seemingly endless grind mitigated a little by the cute plot and presentation.The basic idea is that you have a Final Fantasy style RPG where the protagonists are children on haloween and classes are replaced by costumes, each with their own special abilities. This is, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. The problem is the game consist mostly of combat, and you are actually required to fight most of the enemies in order to proceed, against a small number of enemies, using a tiny number of attacks that you use over and over again. Worse, the attacks also incorporate a timing minigame, so you can't even get through the grind it by hammering the attack button while you read a book or something, because you have to pay attention to the events in the game in order to get the timing right.

												I recommend this! For starters, its just so freaking adorable. The dialogue and the characters are so cute, haha.The game itself is pretty fun though. I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm quite enjoying myself. The fighting style is something sort of similar to Paper Mario in that you have to press the right button at the right time to use moves effectively. It's more fun that way, in my opinion.Also, you get to go trick-or-treating. I can relive my childhood every time I play, lol.The concept is fun too. Being able to try different costumes is a cool idea, and watching them transform into incredible heroes is quite entertaining. 11/10 woot			"

												Ahh, Double Fine. A fine purveyor of interesting and atypical games. We can always count on you.8/10 - A fun, refreshing, and original RPG with enough complexity to keep it interesting. It was rather short and might not be worth multiple playthroughs.The battle system has similarities to Super Mario RPG, essentially using quicktime events to keep you active during combat. I would say that the game is too easy. A combination of the Egg, Rotten Egg, and 2-Ply T.P. made me effectively invincible. I would suggest the Black Cat, Pumpkin, and French Fries costumes on normal fights and the Robot, Vampire, and Unicorn for the bosses. For the DLC bosses I swapped the Robot for the Yeti.Get it on sale and love it.			"

												Costume Quest is a nostalgic rpg/adventure game hybrid with a great art style and aesthetic. The combat is similar to South Park: The Stick of Truth or any of the Super Mario RPGS (SNES/M&L/Paper Mario), with timed button presses integrated into traditional JRPG mechanics. The costume system is fun, but the difference between certain costumes is minimal. Good fun, and with the DLC it will last you around 7-8 hours. I'd reccommend picking it up during the next sale.

												Costume Quest is an RPG about trick-or-treating. You control a group of kids tasked with defeating a small army of monsters led by an evil witch in order to retrieve whichever of the sibling protagonists you don't choose at the start.Did I mention that it's by Double Fine Productions? Because that would explain that previous paragraph, for you.There's a weird division in imagination and reality in this game. The monsters are real. The plight is real. There's actually a witch ordering giant crows to steal candy to further her mysterious plans. But then once you enter battle, it becomes imaginary. I believe. I could certainly be wrong, but nobody else seems to notice when the heroes transform into colossal and more impressive versions of the things they're wearing costumes of. Even the monsters look much less doofy once battle commences. This all brings up an interesting point to consider, though, which is what the final boss looks like in reality - it's only ever seen in battle, you see (Grubbins on Ice notwithstanding, as that doesn't seem as married to this rule as the main game).Gameplay mostly consists of exploring, collecting, and fighting. You'll be searching every nook and cranny for various items to complete various quests, as well as to further the plot. Battles are launched by knocking on doors for candy (and later by encountering roaming monsters, as well), and abide by a turn-based system which encourages timed button presses, a la Mario RPG. There are also, notably, a limited number of battles (except maybe in the upper floors of the mall), so you're not expected to sit around and grind levels for hours to proceed.Different costumes give the kids different powers. Outside of battle, they're useful for overcoming obstacles or completing objectives. But inside battle, costumes are essentially classes. The robot is all attack, while the knight can defend himself or his teammates. Lady Liberty can heal the entire team partially, but the unicorn can heal one person to 100% HP.Movement is kind of odd, at first. If you point in a direction, your kid swivels in place to face that direction before setting off. Once in motion, you can make smooth turns, but pointing in the opposite direction will cause them to stop, turn, and then go. You get used to it by the second area, but it'll feel pretty wonky at first.The console releases of Costume Quest eventually received the paid DLC ""Grubbins on Ice"". You'll be pleased to hear that the DLC is now included at no additional charge! This bonus Winter-themed adventure sends the kids to the Grubbins' home... world? Dimension? Something. There are new costumes, stamps, and abilities to be found, and new monster types to fight. It's a quality addition, and worth the attention once the main game is complete.Costume Quest has become something of a Halloween tradition for me now. It's just short enough to invite such replayability. There are three major areas in the main game, and one more in Grubbins on Ice. Each one will likely take about two or three hours to complete, giving the game an 8-12 hour length for each playthrough. Just perfect for a run-through once every October, and the perfect game for the holiday. Costume Quest captures the spirit and imagination of trick-or-treating spendidly. Which suits me fine. I'm too old to go out trick or treating, anymore, but you're never too old to fight monsters in your underwear at 2 in the morning.			"

												Costume Quest is so much fun. Probably one of-- if not /the/-- most fun small-ish games I've played in 2013. It's just so charming and witty and it never failed to make me smile the 8 or so hours I put into it and its little expansion. A fun little distraction, its cuteness betraying its deeper gameplay mechanics and secrets.			"

												Great game if you have a little time on your hands.  It streamlines the RPG experience with a simpler exploration feel that keeps the user involved until the end.  The biggest drawbacks are the repetive, three button combat and length.  Sadly, you can 100% this game in less than 8 hours if you care to.  What it DOES provide though, is a unique take on a RPG system that does not really require grinding.  The game does a great job of facilitating just enough combat to keep you at the appropriate level without the need to do extra legwork.  All in all, I'd give it 4/5, and a high recommendation.			"

												I really loved this game and had loads of fun playing it. I absolutely love the unicorn and the eyeball costumes. I'm not a hardcore gamer but I managed to get all the achivements and complete the game so its not exceptionally challenging but there is enough content to keep you going and the battles are fun.The humour keeps you engaged so you want to come back for more and its not a chore to get to the next part of the story. As well as the main story quests there are various side quests (that sometimes involve minigames) that arent essential but are really fun so I'm sure most people play them.Overall I would give 8/10 for having  a fun story and battle mode but it could be a little more challenging outside of the battles.

												When buying this game I was unsure what exactly to expect, but I am very satisfied with the game. Every zone may seem repetitive, but with the new challenges and quests, it makes up the same act of going door to door to receive candy or engage in a battle with a monster. I would recommend this game as it provides hours of fun gameplay while still keeping it fun to play through.			"

												Halloween has always been the only holiday I've enjoyed. As a kid it was my favourite by far, and as an adult it remains so. If you don't have siblings or kids of your own, some of that magic dissipates as you age. Costume Quest does wonders to bring back some of that nostalgia of the best night of the year.			"

												It's been a long time since I truly enjoyed an rpg, and Costume Quest was no disappointment. I'd been waiting a long time to play it and I'm glad I finally did.  It took me about 10 hours to beat the base game and then the dlc.  The best part of this game was the imagination of the kids that allowed them to use their cardboard Halloween costumes as amazingly deadly characters in battle.  Truly a unique game.  I recommend this game to ANYONE of any age, whether you like rpgs or not.			"

												A simple, yet very fun RPG made by Double Fine Productions. Not very surprising, since the company is known for making pretty fun games. Costume Quest uses a simple turn-based RPG battle system, so there isn't really any kind of learning curve to it. The story is pretty simple and not deep, but the characters are likeable. The costumes you wear decide what you fight as and what attack and special ability you have. It can be pretty fun to mess around and decide what the best team to use is. The game isn't really hard, but if you don't have a good team set up, it can be easy to lose. Even if you lose, there is no penalty or anything of that sort, which is sort of nice. If your a fan of simple turn-based RPGs, I fully recommend you try this game. (Note: If you aren't very good with quick time events using keyboard butons, I fully recommend you use a controller, preferably an Xbox 360 controller.)			"

												This game brings back the feeling of childhood wonder like few games can. Mechanically, half of Costume Quest falls firmly into the JRPG genre with a very simple battle system and overworld exploration where you open chests and talk to people and fight monsters and bosses.The other half is basically an adventure game. Each costume your kids can wear has its own abilities both in and out of combat, and the non-combat abilities will be crucial to solving the environmental puzzles your team will run into throughout the game.Both halves of the game are excellent and easy to learn, and the magic of Halloween is fully preserved in the game's environments and presentation. Play it!			"

												This video game inspired me. I was once the empty shell of a woman you see in my profile picture, but the light and childish motifs of this videogame has awakened me to a new philosphy of life in this late capitalist society. The rapid switching of costumes spoke to me. BE FREE! LIVE YOUR MOST AUSPICIOUS REALITIY! If you want to be a robot BE A ROBOT! Just go for it! Take off your shirt! Lather yourself in auto oil and coolant. Install factory standard wiring between your nerves and muscles! MAKE YOURSELF INTO THE BEST YOU YOU CAN BE! My daughter, Nancy, once said to me, Mom, you're spending far too much of the money from the college fund for all these body modifications and Costume Quest™ brand costume pices. She seems to think that I ought be spending my money on Goobles on Ice™ merchandise, but this game teaches me the same thing so I told her I am her mother and I brought her into the world I can take her out LOL !!Great game, my only complaint is that you can't design your own characters. 8/10.

												For a game designed for younger players in mind, I still found this rather enjoyable to play. The combat is rather simplistic, but still felt challenging in some of the boss fights. For most fights, chain-stunning the foes turned out to be the most effective play to buy time to build up your costume special attacks. The story is rather predictable, and the quests are more  or less repeated in each location, but it didn't seem to be that much of a turn-off as it should have been. For the price of the game, I really felt like I got a good deal of value from the game, considering the 'Grubbins On Ice' DLC that comes with the game is effectively another few hours of content that expands the story of the game (or can be a hard-mode if you just start it w/o using a save that had main game data). I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to play a fairly easy RPG to kill a few hours between more serious RPGs.			"

												I don't know about other people, but I think Halloween got me more excited than any other holiday, even Christmas. There was something fun about ""being"" something else for a night. Also, the pails full of candy. Double Fine does a wonderful job portraying the things I loved about Halloween as a kid while also giving me things to appreciate as an adult.The art direction is top notch. There is a very consistant design aesthetic that carries through the entire game, one that would look right at home as part of a Halloween cartoon special. The character design eschews realism for expressiveness - not quite to the completely distended extremes of Psychonauts, but still not aiming for ""realism"". The main characters are kind of chibi, which is great because it allows for a remarkable expressiveness. Par for the course in a Double Fine title, the dialogue (all written, no voice acting) is really sharp and loaded with humor both obvious and subtle. The background music tends to be fairly repetitive, but it's atmospheric and compliments the visual design. Shades of Danny Elfman, which is a *perfect* choice for Halloween.The game itself is a turn-based RPG but with active, timing based offense and defense boosts. It's very similar to Super Mario RPG (which, if it didn't innovate that style definitely codified it) in how it plays out. Actually, of any game to compare the gameplay to, I'd compare it to Hothead's Penny Arcade Adventures. It's funny, Ron Gilbert came over from Hothead just a month before the game was released - he didn't actually have any direct impact on the game, but given Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert's long-term association, I can't but help think he cribbed from his friend's design. Which is fine because it worked then and it worked in this game. Add in a dash of Earthbound, in being able to engage with enemies on screen before the turn-based battle begins, and you've got a tried-and-true formula.The costume transformations are fun and the special powers associated with the costumes are anywhere from ""useful"" to ""hilarious"", in the case of the Lady Liberty costume. One thing the game could be dinged on is a lack of variance in combat. There's only one special power per costume, and a handful of optional ""third powers"" that can be added. In actual practice, a lot of combat could be completed by just attacking, waiting for the special attack to power up, unleash the attack and if anything is still standing repeat the process. The combat is thankfully fast-paced for a turned-based RPG, but it can get somewhat repetitive.I could harp on a few other things. The game is short - even if you explore and find everything, expect 5-6 hours at most if you're able to win most battles (and you probably will). Of course, as an adult with a job, short isn't a crime for me, but those who hear RPG and expect 99 hours of playtime will be sorely disappointed. The story is simple, which fits a game about a bunch of kids on Halloween night turning into their costumes and saving their sibling and their candy stashes, but there could have been a little bit more meat on the story's bones. Characterization was strong and it goes a long way, but the world of Costume Quest is charming enough that I felt like I was missing something to not get more. The environmental ""puzzles"" are barely a challenge and the solutions are nearly flat out stated by some NPCs who might as well add ""GET IT?"" to their obvious, pun-based solutions. Then again, it's a great entry level title for children. For adults, you'll probably find the puzzles and their solutions too, too easy.But those are quibbles. Costume Quest is one of the most charming games I've played. It's got a great atmosphere and  great idea for a game that ends before the shtick gets old. The game also, I might add, is fairly diverse in its characterization and does not limit costumes amongs the PCs by gender. Yes, Double Fine, I noticed, and it's an awesome thing to see game designers implement.I definitely recommend this game to people tired of gray-and-gritty, guns-and-guts gaming. The game will make you smile. It's no challenge at all, if that's how you want to measure ""worth"" in a game, but the wit of the game and the clever concept will make the game worth the price of admission in my opinion. It's a perfect compliment to the season and if you have even the barest interest in RPGs - or have never played one before and want one to try that isn't going to overwhelm you with entirely new gaming concepts - you'll enjoy the game. And just like Halloween candy, don't rush the experience. Savor it instead of gobbling it all down at once. I get the temptation, but you'll just get a tummy ache if you do!			"

												Costume Quest is a very short RPG can be beat in 3 1/2 hours pretty easily. Although that being said it is still a very fun game especially for this time of year (October). It gets you in the spirit of Halloween and takes you back to being a kid again. The game can get repetitive, but there are enough costumes and cards to collect that change your moves and play style, although not nearly to the extent as I would like, but for a 3 1/2 hour RPG it's enough. Overall good game, Buy it if its on sale especially 50% off or more then I would say it is definitely worth the money.			"

												Costume Quest and Costume Quest 2 are adorable Halloween themed games. You can feel a bit of that ""made for kids"" theme, but it's still enjoyable by adults. The controls are easy to manage (but an official Xbox/Steam controller is a must), the art is wonderful, the music is good but not overbearing, the story is cute, and there are a few chuckle moments. While I recommend them both, I do think 1 is the better of the two, but that doesn't make 2 any less good.			"

												A fun little RPG hidden in children's clothing. There's more depth to the battle system than is initially evident (finding just the right combination of party members, costumes, and battle stamps can eat up time), but can still be rather shallow when actually in combat. This combined with a lack of variety of enemies can lead to some redundancy, but nothing too aweful.  Good humor and likable characters keep the player invested through to the end. Virtually no reply value since most collectables can be found in the initial play through.Recommended for fans of: Simple RPG combat, cute and child-like humor, kids who have grown old but never grew up.

												When two twins end up getting separated on a Halloween night due to a mysterious invasion of candy-hogging trolls and their wicked witch leader, it is up to you to reunite them on a well spirited RPG-style adventure harnessing the power of vastly varied classic Halloween costumes!The story has a cute enough heart to it as it is, but I feel the short length left out *a lot* of potential such as more character development, also with the theme of Halloween and the obvious influence of Nintendo's Mother/Earthbound-titles, I couldn't help but feel like the tale could've been spicier with a little more daring, genuinely frightening moments. The all around atmosphere still holds up well in the graphics, cute character design and the fitting soundtrack.The costumes were fun, in both putting together via finding the necessary items and just plain seeing them in action during the turn-based battles, their own limit-attacks especially! When not fighting you spend your time searching for either candy, treasure-coffins, sidequests or the occasional minigame, all of which are also classic RPG features and were splendidly Halloween themed, but even during such short run some of them began feeling a bit repetitive. Trick-or-treating around the field was an exciting way to either treat yourself to most of your candy or get tricked into an enemy encounter!All in all it doesn't take too much (or enough, more fittingly) of your time and is slightly flawed, but still had me and will surely have any other RPG and Halloween lover invested all the way!

												I actually at first wasn't that interested to play this. I got this as a part of humblebundle, which bought cause of Brutal Legends. But Brutal Legends disappointed me( that is a different story). So I tried out this game.And to my suprise, the game turned out to be quite fun that I completed it in the same day. The game is cute and fun to play. Although I think there isn't much replayablity in this game, unless you want to unlock full achivements.However to make long story short. This game is quite enjoyable.			"

												Great for younger gamers, and for those who want something different then the usual.  Extremely simple concept but can be challenging in some places.  The combat consists of button presses to match what is indicated on screen, repeating to fill a meter, rotate a stick, or push a button.Playing with a gamepad, it is a good experience, otherwise it is tough to deal with.

The gameplay, unfortunately, is a mix of creativity and dullness. The different costumes and their unique powers are unique and cool, but the fighting get so overly repetitive. It's very repetitive and not deep at all. Still, everything about Costume Quest makes up for it. "

												A cutesy, simplistic RPG?  Meh.  Tell me Tim Schafer's had a hand in development?  Well, as little of Psychonauts that I've played, that's an interesting factoid but doesn't sell me.  All the moves in battle have action commands a la Super Mario RPG?  Now I'm listening.This is an engaging game.  Cute, but Tim Schafer cute with adult overtones.  Like Psychonauts, the landscapes are built for exploration and look great.  Battles couldn't be any more basic, but the need to react to quick time-esque button presses to either boost attacks or minimize incoming damage keeps you on your toes.  Each costume you acquire is unique and works differently in battles, making it fun to experiment and find the perfect combination for your play style.  It's short, no more than six hours, but it's actually the perfect length.  Maybe it's not worth the full asking price, but if Costume Quest comes up in a Steam sale...  grab it.  And let candy gluttony take you on a fun little journey.			"

												Well Double Fine you made another good game, I applaude you. See Double Fine continues to make good games, something few companies can do, much like RareWare in the 1990's, Tim Schafer's Double Fine seems to be dishing out game after game of quality. He is of course well known to the people who have heard of him, but that is shockingly few people. His games like Grim Fandango, and Phychonauts are glimmering underappreciated diamonds, and his lastest game Costume Quest does nothing to tarnish that reputation.Now why do I compare Double Fine to Rare? Easy, they both made a multitude of games that made them very popular, Double Fines biggest issue is it is still the unknown company, thier games come out, they look cool to some people, I play them, love them, then I tell other people how good they are for just being 20 bucks or less, then no one plays them. But I hold no resentment towards those people because I grew up with with Tim at my side, a man that made good games, I do hope that someday I can say 'Hey, you know that game that everyone likes that just came out, try this it's made by the same guys.' Then we get people playing Double Fines old catalog of games.But about Costume Quest, it's good, it's charming, it has a few pop culture references, most don't seem out of place unless you know them. But the big thing is, it shows that Double Fine can make a decent Role Playing Game. Now don't get me wrong it's not as in depth as some major RPG's, but it does what you want it to do. There are no voices, just text, which is fine, the dialouge makes me chuckle, and brings out the little things in characters. It's just enough exploration, it is a little limiting, but it cuts down on annoying long term searches, and overall the game keeps at a fairly difficult stance. See it's these types of games that I like to see game companies make, they normally make puzzle games or platformers, but then they release an explore centered RPG and then it's actually good. That is what I like to see, I like to see companies improve and expand thier game base with more than platformers, because really I will lose intrest eventually, but it is safe to say Double Fine is keeping another fan interested and excited for the future.

Definitely recommend playing with a controller, as the keyboard controls can be a little tiresome in this case.It bears some resemblance to the new South Park game. I do not mean to say that the South Park guys have ripped Costume Quest off, as they both pay homage to older turn-based rpgs, but anyone who loved playing one of the two should play the other.Personally I would love to see a sequel and more games like this.

												I don't fancy myself a guy who calls things ""cute"" but this game definitely was.  While so simple someone with an IQ of 10 could play, I found myself engrossed.  Maybe it was my mind harking back to a simpler time and the premise of kids just simply trick R' treating.  The battles were very simple, they had some interactivity but not much.  They were the standard JRPG style battles we all know and...love/hate.  There were a good selection of costumes, all fun and simple.  My favorite had to be the ninja...for obvious reasons. Not to mention the decent selection of power up cards that helped you along the way.If you enjoy simple fun and miss the imagination of your childhood then this could be the game for you.			"

												Alright, Costume Quest. Pretty charming. It is a JRPG set in a halloween theme. As it seems to be the usual thing about Double Fine productions, the artstyle and designs of pretty much everything in the whole thing is very good pretty and nice for the theme. That is very good. You gotta love Double Fine for that pattern by the way. The story is also funny and children friendly, no voice actors, so you have to read, which is not bad, except if you are foreign. However, it is a JRPG and that is a genre, that seriously is pretty old. Something not that good. They have to be congratulated however for not putting in linear corridors or random encounters, but the combat is still really simple, gets boring and gives not really any punishment for defeat. I wonder why they even put in a run away button. So the combat is pretty much just padding, but since Double Fine is, as far as I know, an indie game company, it can slide. It also has a lot of side quests and collectibles. Nothing for me, but you might enjoy it. The innovation is the costumes, which is easy to change between, and it gives a lot of different fighting styles and problem solving. The puzzles are however pretty much told how to solve, so no bonus there. In conclusion, Costume Quest is nothing ground breaking, but as someone who does not like mainstream JRPG it is alright. It will be the same for people who likes JRPG. It is like a little nice twix bar, that you eat fastly, and it is alright, but you will very soon forget it. If you have kids, buy this to them, because there are not that many good kid games, besides lego i suppose. If you want it for yourself, you can do a lot worse, but if you have not played Psychonauts, save the extra buck and buy that first, because it is a lot more ground breaking and creative.			"

The theme and mechanics of the game fit together perfectly but I can see how it might get repetitive and dull for other players. There is a pretty steep difficulty curve later in the game if you don't take a well rounded party. Don't just take my word for it, I might be biased because I feel Double Fine can do not wrong but I would give this game a solid 9/10.			"

												Costume Quest is a cel shaded RPG with a sense of humour. The game is short and gameplay is fairly linear, though the game's style and dialogue are entertaining to keep you playing the game. The story, while seemingly childish, works well for a game where cardboard costumes morph into towering avatars during the turn-based battle scenes. The game takes a certain appreciation for silliness to fully enjoy, otherwise the lame jokes and outlandish characters might become grating. The battle sequences are repetitive and not particularly challenging, but the real fun is in exploring the world for costumes and hidden items. Definitely worth a playthrough.			"

												This reminded me of the fun I had playing Psychonauts, granted this doesn't have the same depth, character development, or even voice acting. It was still great fun.Gameplay is essentially going around trick-or-treating while fighting off monsters that the adults can't seem to see. Imagination kicks in when the battles start, and this is where it can get a bit hilarious. You can form powerful teams with different focuses for each enemy type, or boss type, and it'll either work or fail.The one thing that frustrated me about this game was not being able to equip your team before a fight started. I found too often that my fights accidentally engaged with the costume I was using to travel with.			"

												A great simple game about trick or treating. Knock on door, get candy or fight a monster. Uses a JRPG-style battle system, which is straightforward enough to work well cinematically, but gets a bit tedious over longer sessions. Very funny dialogue, as expected from Double Fine.			"

												I love this game. I did not expect it to be so well made. The puzzles are fun and the battle system is awesome. Lot of hidden things, which I love. It's not very long, so that made me sad. But it came with another Grummins On Ice game that is cool. It's a short version of Costume Quest. I was very addicted and the costume effects in battle are great. I can't wait for the sequel.			"

Fun game to play over the halloween period if you're feeling seasonal but you've already had your fill of scary stuff. "

												This is a very cute game that also can be a little challenging sometimes. If you love collecting things, there's a lot to do! All of the battle costumes look very cool. I found that I had to use even the defensive costumes (in most games, I prefer just to attack constantly instead of defend), so theres a bit of strategy as well. I liked this game a lot... but I must strongly advise using a game controller instead of mouse/keyboard. I hated the game before I used the controller and almost gave up on it. It's obvious this game was made for consoles first.			"

I'd suggest this game for children and any person who loves halloween theme. For me, it's one of the best games I've ever seen, it stands in the same row as Bioshock, Gothic, Syberia, each of which was complited many times, and will be completed again and again.			"

												This is a really silly and charming little game aimed mainly at kids, but just as fun for an adult. It's easy and relaxing, perfect for playing while home in bed sick - or if you just want a change of pace - since it doesn't make too many demands of the player besides some simple quicktime responses, and doesn't drag out with too much grinding or pointless sidetracks.The humor is a bit kliché-USA, but if you don't take things too seriously the warmth of Costume Quest gives it definite replay value, especially around the later parts of the year. Both this game and its sequel are worth a chance!			"

												""Costume Quest"" is a fine opportunity to get into the Halloween mood. Or even deeper.It is a one-player RPG game involving two twin siblings getting separated by candy-greedy monsters from Repugia and two friends of theirs. So one sibling gets kidnapped and the other three children (including you as the twin brother or sister) set off for the rescue while fighting monsters, bosses and having fun by collecting Halloween stuff (costumes, candy, candy cards, battle stamps) and solving quests that get in your way.The gameplay: Most of the time you will walk around places like your hometown or the town's mall and search for items and quests. All of these help you progress in the story and getting stronger. One quest you must complete a couple of times in order to progress is to knock on every available door to ask for treats. Either you just get them or have to battle a monster (that has occupied this house). So the other part of the game are the battles. The children use their costumes they've achieved (pumpkin, black cat, vampire, statue of liberty, etc...) and their special powers to fight the different monsters. And because it's an RPG you wait for your characters' turns and choose the actions they're suppoused to do now while the monsters get their turns, too. You can loose battles but never die. You just would have to try again. Every win is rewarded with experience points, candy and other items.During all this you have your note book with you in which you have an overlook of your status, quests (and their status), costumes (with description), candy cards and a variety of battle stamps which can be used for battle by your characters.I found ""Costume Quest"" very playable, the controls are easy to learn (and they're changeable if you really can't operate with them). I played with the keyboard and it worked just fine. It's a fun RPG with a good mixture of exploring, collecting and fighting. It's also easy to play, so also RPG beginners shouldn't have trouble to finish this game sooner or later.The cartoonish 2.5/3D graphics are mostly sweet and lovely designed, that goes especially for the settings you go to.  They're colourful but not rainbow puking bright, they mostly match the Halloween season. When it goes to the characters, I find the children, their battle characters and the monsters were designed okay. I can't say that about the adult characters who either look like obese puppets, lifeless big-nosed humans or stick figures with grotesque heads and faces. They don't only look strange but also quite lifeless. I wished that a bit more effort would have went into their designs. But to the game's credit: the adults play a very minor role compared to the children.The sound is so-so: I enjoyed the musical score very much. But the sound? It completely containts sound effects (which are fine), no voices (outside the occesional grunts of monster characters and human background mumbling in more crowded places). This means that the dialogues are all text bubbles and there are even no simple sounds expressed by the characters, wether a ""Gasp!"" or ""Huh?"" or ""Ouch"" or something. I find this negative since at least a bit of voice acting brings extra life to these characters but here, everybody is totally quiet. What about extras? There are achievements, trading cards, one minigame about apple bobbing and there is also an additional chapter included called ""Grubbins on Ice"" that goes on right after the story of the main game. I can't say it's that exciting or so much fun, you practically do the same things and collect new costumes but without Halloween going on. Still, it's worth for a bit of fun and the achievements.So, can I recommend ""Costume Quest""? Yes, absolutely. It's a sweet, fun game all around Halloween and the fantasy of children celebrating it. If you can't stand Halloween or just don't care about it, then I guess this shouldn't stop you from trying but you might have less joy with that game.And if you're into RPGs or starting this, you definitely should check it out.

												For a game designed for younger players in mind, I still found this rather enjoyable to play. The combat is rather simplistic, but still felt challenging in some of the boss fights. For most fights, chain-stunning the foes turned out to be the most effective play to buy time to build up your costume special attacks. The story is rather predictable, and the quests are more  or less repeated in each location, but it didn't seem to be that much of a turn-off as it should have been. For the price of the game, I really felt like I got a good deal of value from the game, considering the 'Grubbins On Ice' DLC that comes with the game is effectively another few hours of content that expands the story of the game (or can be a hard-mode if you just start it w/o using a save that had main game data). I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to play a fairly easy RPG to kill a few hours between more serious RPGs.			"

												A very fun, easy and charming RPG that takes place in Halloween.You control as a few children going from door to door to get candy, or find candy anywhere in the area, to become more powerful in order level up and to unlock more costumes(abilities). The combat is very Final Fantasy like, and as you get into combat depending on what your costume is, you become that creature/character/thing, literally! The game has the whole cute-ish estatic to it, while also giving you the feeling of the festive feeling of Halloween, which they succeed completely. The game is very imaginative, pretty good story, good controls and some pretty awesome fight animations.The game is pretty short though, and the combat is too easy. Like, if you have a clear idea where your keyboard keys are, or even where X Y B A on your controller is clearly ( which most gamers do ), then you will have no problem with the whole fight at all. I wish there were difficulty settings so the game would be a little more challenging.Nevertheless, good little fun game that would play again on Halloween.			"

												A fun game, despite itself.The combat is boring, the quests are repetitive. You will only end up using a few of the costumes once you've figured out a good build...But darn it! This game is just too charming! I want to hate it! But it is just so loveable!So, my recommendation: Buy it on sale. (Last sale it sold for $0.99)  "

												Super cute game! The fighting sequences become incredibly repetitive and easy towards the end, but the game is just so charming (and, at times, hilarious, the Statue of LIberty special move never gets old) that I don't mind. As a side note, this would likely make the game more accessible for younger players (i.e. kids). "

												Very original, cute and charming game. Although the turn-based battles may get a bit boring after a while, the exploration parts of the game are always entertaining. Tons of items to collect, and tons of fun to be had. I'd rate it an 8.5/10.			"

  What better way to spend a few hours than pummeling monsters as a giant rainbow unicorn?  Costume Quest is a fun, youthful, and humorous adventure that utilizes overworld exploration, puzzle solving, and a simple turn-based combat system. I would recomend it to children, people looking for a not-scary halloween game, and anyone who would like to nostagically relearn some of the magic of halloween.This game does a lot of things well and a few things not so well. Good Stuff:  Concept  - I love the sheer idea of this game. A group of kids must use their costumes that ACTUALLY TRANSFORM THE WEARERS to fight monsters, save a sibling, and collect tons of candy along the way. It sounds like all of my childhood halloween fantasies at once. Story  - Less predicatable than one might image. It has just enough twists to keep it interesting, but manages to keep it simple enough for a younger person to enjoy it. Characters  - Likeable child characters are comparable to black republicans nowadays: maybe there's one or two here and there, but overall they're pretty rare. The children in this game are highly likeable and funny, which is a metaphorical breath of fresh air. Humour  - My inner 10 year old got a real kick out of this game. The jokes are silly and childish, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh quite a bit during my playthrough. I wish more games could imbue such a good sense of humour into their games. Stuff That Was Ok:  Music  - It wasn't exactly a synphonic masterpiece, but it does add to the immersion. My only qualm is that the battle music can get a bit repettitive. World/Map  - Again, it wasn't mind blowing or pioneering or anything like that. Each area is pretty different, which does well to break up any monotony. Some environmental objects (specifically, ramps) can feel really clunky, but all-in-all it doesn't affect the enjoyment of the game. Stuff I Wish Was Different:  Character Progression  - I believe that the Devs wanted to create a simple RPG that was less about combat and leveling up and more about the story. They absolutely succeeded, so props to them. I do wish that there would have been a slightly more in-depth character upgrade system, but that's just me. Combat  - Like I said above, the game isn't really combat or skill focused. The combat is simple and easy to learn, which is good. The problem with simple combat is that it can get very, very repetitive. I was actually somewhat sad when the thought ""ugh, do I really have to fight these guys?"" came to mind, because to me it meant that the combat had gotten boring. It's worth noting that I was admittedly about 3/4 of the way through before that happened. Lighting  - My last minor complaint is the lighting in the game. For the majority of the game, the Devs did a great job of keeping the overall lighting pretty low, but bright enough to see where you were going and to find the things you needed to find. However, the  first part of the 2nd act and the upper two floors of the mall area  are just too dark. There is a brightness option in the menu, but amping up the brightness seems almost to be cheating, since part of the game's charm is the comic-spookiness of low lighting. That's really my only complaint on the world design. Final Summation:   I really did enjoy this game. It was a fun way to spend a few hours, and it made me think back to my childhood dreams about being the costume I wore on halloween. Would recommend.  "

												This game is about kids trick-or-treating on Halloween night. But something happens, and kids will save the night by the power of their COSTUMES and IMAGINATION!!!!! Nuff' said. All right, let's make it brief:Pros:-Graphics and animations-Music-Level Design-Unique Concept-Atmosphere-CharactersCons:-It's TOO EZ. -Battles will become repetitive-Criminally short. It took me 8.5 hours to 100% both main and DLC campaigns(6 - main, 2.5 - DLC). I expected more, tbh.Overall, CQ is a great indie game! It's like Full Throttle, Grim Fandango and Psychonauts: It's unique, clever and fun. I enjoyed the **** of it! However, I'd suggest buying it on sale, not because it's best for you and your wallet, but 10$ for approx. 9 hours of gameplay isn't worth it. No offense, Tim Schafer! :)			"

You should play it for yourself.The kids are cute, the atmosphere is kiddy and everything is beautiful. One thing that they could improve however, is voice acting - There literally...

Gameplay isn't particularly challenging but it is enjoyable, if you are struggling at any point then you have most likely missed some upgrade or other.			"

												It feels more like an internet game than a full game, but the game itself is pretty nice. You have to gather different costumes, which have different abilities. It gives the game a slight RPG feeling, even though the possbilities are very limited. Once you get used to the graphics (kiddy look), it's really playable and if you like to collect achievements (counting on the fact that you're already bored), this makes it a very interesting game. The creators want to show you every cutscene though. That's boring. 7/10			"

The story was surprisingly elaborate and funny as well. I deeply appreciated the fact that the clues were easy to follow and that I didn't get stuck anywhere. I have to admit that, originally, I thought this game would be silly and childish, but it actually has much more depth to it than what you see on the surface. The writing and art are superb.

												Not badStoryYou are a kid that goes Trick and Treating with their sibling who is swiftly kidnapped by monsters. Now it is your job to go door to door trick or treating, complete quests, and fight monsters. It’s pretty much a standard RPG with a halloween theme painted on it. The story isn’t bad and it follows Double Fine’s formula well (kid looking game with often adult adventures that is eccentric). There are some dark elements to the game which come out really well and the whole game has a theme of child wonder to it. You fight as real transformers, unicorns, and vampires while facing daemons. It sounds like a kid fantasy. However, the story isn’t flushed out as Psychonauts for example and I don't really remember muchGameplayIt’s a standard RPG (with a twist). The main point is to go around to all of the stores/houses and trick or treat. Different areas are blocked out until you can unlock certain areas. This is mostly done through monster fights. Overall, this system is nice as it moves the plot along via your actions but gets very repetitive near the end as you just end up going from monster fight to monster fight. Speaking of which, the monster battles are a bit simple. You can have up to 3 characters each of which has a regular move and a special ability with a long cool down. Additionally, you have different patches you can apply which are absolutely necessary to stand a chance. It took me a while to find a pair that worked for me but in the end, it was all just the same thing over and over until the end. Overall, I found the system a bit simple and I don’t play RPGs muchPerformance:With a 4790k, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram, it ran at either 30 or 60fps for me. It didn’t vary in between those two numbers but rather certain scenes and areas were stuck at 30. The game isn’t aiming to be realistic so the graphics are cartoony.Overall, the game was OK. I’m reminded of South Park: The Stick of Truth a lot and honestly, I would recommend playing that over this game. It’s not bad but just kinda meh to above meh.			"

												I went in expecting (and hoping) Costume Quest would be a ""light"" RPG. Most RPGs leave me dreading them, honestly. 40 hours of game play for 2 hours of storyline. Tons of meaningless sidequests. Mass amounts of combat, leaving you feeling more like a mass-murdering psychopath than the hero of any book or movie.Costume Quest sounded ""light"" in all the ways I was looking for: doesn't try for an ""epic"" 40-hour plot, doesn't have thousands of items and customisations, doesn't have hundreds of sidequests.After a few hours of play, I just found the game (especially combat) to be too repetitive.Only 38% of players have even bothered to beat the first boss in the game. Only 27% stick around to the second boss. I get the feeling that most people think this is a neat idea and a cute looking game but don't stick around for very long.			"

												I am new to gaming, and I kind of suck at it. I received South Park SoT for PC as a gift, and really enjoyed it, and am now hooked on games. What awesome stress release!  I needed a game that was fun to play and attainable for a newbie. This one does the trick. I was able to beat the game and had fun with it too, plus, it helped me gain controller skills. It would be a great game for a kid who is starting into games, or even an adult (of which I am one). I really enjoyed the turn-based combat style that is like South Park, but it wasn't TOO easy. The bosses are challenging, but not impossible.  I purchased this game as a package with the 2nd game, and have moved on to that one now. Highly recommend!			"

												One word to describe the whole game : CUTEJust finished literally a few minutes ago and I LOVED every second of it.Costume Quest is an adorable game about kids on adventure in their Halloween costumes which give them super powers. This is the dream of every little kid (and grown ups) that ever played make-believe. Plot : really straight-forward. Team up with the neighborhood kids to save your sibling. A classic good vs evil in a comedic way. Grubbin on Ice is like a mini-sequel or a spin-off and it's highly recommended to play it AFTER the main CQ.Gameplay : I highly recommend using a controller. I can't imagine the battle sequences using a keyboard and mouse, but if you're comfortable with them then maybe it'll work for you. The walking around was a bit tiresome, but worth it.Quests : all the quests are really well-thought, and a good way to grind, though you can't get past level 10 for the main CQ and not past level 14 for GOI. Puzzles : it's not as frustrating, as long as you're EXTREMELY thorough in searching and walking around.Graphic : I love the character designs, the monsters, the battle sequences.. The backgorunds are pretty smooth. I didn't enjoy the dark areas, but I generally don't like dark areas in game anyway so I guess it's a matter of preference.Sound : it's fun and adds up to the atmosphere of going on an adventure.Characters : I really like how all the characters have names, even the NPCs (though not the monsters). The enemies are not EVIL evil, and as lovable as the protagonists.I give this as 10/10. Just need one more achievement to fill but that'll have to wait.. literally..MOVING ON TO CQ2 !!!			"

The costumes are fun to use and have unique abilities, the dialogue is hilarious, and the story is well-thought out.

												As a fan of Double Fine's earlier efforts, especially Psychonauts, it's no surprise Costume Quest drew my attention with little effort. Given I'm also a fan of costuming and Halloween, this was pretty much an instant sell. Having fully completed the game, I can assure you it did not disappoint.Right from the get-go, Costume Quest shows efforts to include every possible player, as you can choose to play as either the boy (Reynold) or girl (Wren) of a pair of twins. Soon after the twin you didn't select is kidnapped by monsters for dressing like a delicious-looking candy corn, you meet up with other trick-or-treaters your age that match your level of imagination and your desire to get your sibling back.Costume Quest feels like an RPG stripped down to its essentials, with timing-centric, turn-based combat and set amounts of spawns in most areas. This, along with the enemies' leveling along with you, eliminates the need for experience grinding. Wiping out everything is still necessary for 100% completion and makes getting costume upgrades and some secrets easier, but you can get by if you stick to story-necessary encounters.The game itself feels a bit small, area-wise, but there are plenty of tasks in each section to keep your party busy and searching for hidden items and secret costumes. A great balance is struck between backtracking through each section and forward progression, so it rarely, if ever, feels like a slog.The variety of costumes is also nice, especially their in-combat forms. Due to the children's imaginations, whatever costume they're wearing transforms into a majestic, towering version of its mundane representation, all featuring beautiful animations and unique, often hilarious special attacks. As touched on before, combat is straightforward, with timed button presses coming into play on top of the base mechanics to lessen incoming damage and stack combos with your own attacks.All in all, Costume Quest is relatively short, super sweet, and great for any time of year. Just remember that a couple of achievements (for the game and for the Grubbins On Ice DLC) are time-associated, so be ready to fire the game back up when more seasonably appropriate. You could just wiggle your PC clock a bit, but that'd be lame.			"

												Fun at first but then becomes very repetitive. The game isn't all bad it deffinitly gets points for style and writing. If there was a little more depth and less repetitive this could be a better game. Stopped playing when I realized I was doing the same thing over and over.			"

												Costume Quest is what i would call an example of a light RPG, because the player has little too no input on what effects and happens too the world and the mechanics are a little simplistic. Despite all this, the game is amazing. The writing is extremely funny and the art style will make you wish halloween was everyday just so you could have an excuse to play this game just to look at it's amazing art style every second of your life.

												This game is short and simplistic. The RPG combat is kinda like Paper Mario, in that you do QTEs to deal more damage. However, you usually only have the option to do a basic attack until your special is charged up (always after 3 turns) or you have a special stamp equipped. There are about ten costumes in both the normal game and the DLC, and only about half of them are worth using in combat compared to the others.Outside of combat, there are four enviroments to explore and solve puzzles in using costume abilities. You can hit basically anyone and anything with your candy pail, which is amusing. The dialogue isn't laugh out loud funny, but I smiled from time to time.The game really shines graphically. The characters are cute, the environments are given a lot of detail, and the battles look amazing. It's all very colorful. Music is average, however.All in all, playing this game is like playing a cartoon from Cartoon Network long ago. Worth buying if it's on sale.			"

Fight casual RPG style while you kick candy stealing monsters out of your neighbourhood in awesome costumes you piece together on your quest. With lots of little things that will make you laugh, charming moments that let you appreciate the game and enough of a game to leave you satisified when your done. Costume Quest is definately one of those games you have to play and experience.I give it a must play 9 out 10.			"

												I went in expecting (and hoping) Costume Quest would be a ""light"" RPG. Most RPGs leave me dreading them, honestly. 40 hours of game play for 2 hours of storyline. Tons of meaningless sidequests. Mass amounts of combat, leaving you feeling more like a mass-murdering psychopath than the hero of any book or movie.Costume Quest sounded ""light"" in all the ways I was looking for: doesn't try for an ""epic"" 40-hour plot, doesn't have thousands of items and customisations, doesn't have hundreds of sidequests.After a few hours of play, I just found the game (especially combat) to be too repetitive.Only 38% of players have even bothered to beat the first boss in the game. Only 27% stick around to the second boss. I get the feeling that most people think this is a neat idea and a cute looking game but don't stick around for very long.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Costume Quest is an adventure game developed by the wonderful people behind Stacking, Brutal Legend and Grim Fandango: Remastered. Double Fine Producitons once again hits the nail again with their cleverly designed and well thought out gameCostume Quest is an adventure game where you play a brother and sister who go out during Halloween to do trick or treating but they find out that there are monsters known as Grubbins who are stealing all the candy, you have to stop them!Across the game's worlds you have to go and knock doors to ask for candy. Sometimes you will get regular human beings who give you candy, sometimes its the nasty Grubbins which it will send you into an RPG button prompt combat system. The combat system is sort of fun but can get very repetitive and boringThis game, the same with Stacking, is meant for people unlike me who are known as completionists. Completionists will have a ball playing Costume Quest and leveling up. The game's graphics are really cute and well designed, the music is nothing special but it is good neverthelessCostume Quest is very repetitive. Expect to enter the boring combat system multiple times and doing the same thing which is trick or treating can get boring and repetitive too. The game's difficulty is good but the game experiences a huge difficulty spike at the end, so much so, that many people I know who have played the game cannot beat the boss battle. I had a hell of a job trying to defeat the boss battle, but the game forces you to level up by completing other side missions and entering more of the boring combat system, which for me, I don't like... the game is okay at first but it can be impossible to finish if you are not leveled up properlyCostume Quest also offers an additional story through a free DLC known as Grubbins on Ice, I tried playing the DLC story, but sadly, I just gave up when the offered the same things as the original game...Don't get me wrong, Costume Quest is a wonderful game to play, however, with the game's repetitiveness, boring combat system and huge difficulty spike can put some people off, but overall it is a nice RPG adventure game to play RECOMMENDED :)  "

												If you don't care about achievements this review doesn't really apply to you.The game is OK and has some good humor (especially the Creepy Treat card names), but in all honesty it's very simple and pretty short, making it for many people just an easy achievement mine/perfect game completion... that is it would be.""Tisn't the Season"" for Double Fine developers to do their jobs apparently.  Adding an achievement that is a pure gimmick like to ""Play Costume Quest on Christmas"" (which has a a description that in the first place is ambiguous to people in other countries that celebrate more on the 24th), and which siad gimmick achievement prevents people from 100%ing the game is a slap in the face.  Many people on Mac and Linux systems are discussing this today and on Community guides so this is not an isolated occurance.  An achievement that is ostensibly only available one day in a year being broken on that day is unacceptable.  There are also reports that this has been a bug since 2012 and still hasn't been fixed.The game is released for Mac, Linux, and PC, DF devs... you don't get to support them unequally and not get called on it.Having steam link to the ""game's website"" and get a ""server not found"" error is a nice touch too.  Par for the course it seems.  Only real option if you don't have Windows is to write DF at support@doublefine.com "

The combat was interesting, using turn based events as well as quick time events. All the character designs were really adorable, but the costumes turned honestly badass during combat.

												Costume Quest is a lovable adventure you will never forget and if you do forget it, you are dead to me. This game is a superb JRPG with great level designs which sometimes want you to get a walkthrough (I had to use a walkthrough about 3-4 times). The story is a bit short but if you did all side quests (like me), you would at least have about 6-7 hours put in this. If you didnt do all side quests, you would have approximately 2-4 hours put in this. The game is beautiful for a halloween-themed game. Coffins are chests, you can trick-or-treat houses for candy or enemy encounters, battle stamps which improve your character in fights and several comedic speeches for all ages. I absolutely adore this game. Just like in every RPG game, there is a leveling up system. In order to level up, you defeat enemies (just like every RPG). It does take quite a while to level up in this game but that made me want to farm enemies and destroy bosses. Every game (excluding racing games) contain bosses (I think). These bosses were rather time consuming but if you had the right costumes for your team, it would be a piece of cake. I did find one boss in the game rather annoying but dont want to spoil it. I would say something about the boss, but just wait till you fight her. There are costumes you find from side quests or just main quests. These costumes play a big part of the game not just because its the games title, but you actually get different move sets aswell. The costumes I found made the final boss a 1 try victory for me. The game can be a bit easy if you get guides on where the costumes are located and its pieces. There is another playable DLC you get automatically if you purchase this game on steam, called Grubbins on Ice. It's not extremely long, its about 1/3 of the games length. I did enjoy it though because it gave me three costumes, several battle stamps and a nice adventure. I would prefer playing this after the base game because everthing from your first save in Costume Quest, gets sent over into the DLC. It's pretty helpful. It is recommended to do that because enemies are about lvl 13 and your cap is lvl 10 (in the base game). This game is a master piece literally. I love it so much and for the price I got it for (99 cents in the 2015 holiday sale) it was worth it. If you see this game going for about $5 or less, purchase it immediately. THIS TITLE IS A MUST-BUY. I LOVE YOU DOUBLE FINE PRODUCTIONS!			"

												Not badStoryYou are a kid that goes Trick and Treating with their sibling who is swiftly kidnapped by monsters. Now it is your job to go door to door trick or treating, complete quests, and fight monsters. It’s pretty much a standard RPG with a halloween theme painted on it. The story isn’t bad and it follows Double Fine’s formula well (kid looking game with often adult adventures that is eccentric). There are some dark elements to the game which come out really well and the whole game has a theme of child wonder to it. You fight as real transformers, unicorns, and vampires while facing daemons. It sounds like a kid fantasy. However, the story isn’t flushed out as Psychonauts for example and I don't really remember muchGameplayIt’s a standard RPG (with a twist). The main point is to go around to all of the stores/houses and trick or treat. Different areas are blocked out until you can unlock certain areas. This is mostly done through monster fights. Overall, this system is nice as it moves the plot along via your actions but gets very repetitive near the end as you just end up going from monster fight to monster fight. Speaking of which, the monster battles are a bit simple. You can have up to 3 characters each of which has a regular move and a special ability with a long cool down. Additionally, you have different patches you can apply which are absolutely necessary to stand a chance. It took me a while to find a pair that worked for me but in the end, it was all just the same thing over and over until the end. Overall, I found the system a bit simple and I don’t play RPGs muchPerformance:With a 4790k, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram, it ran at either 30 or 60fps for me. It didn’t vary in between those two numbers but rather certain scenes and areas were stuck at 30. The game isn’t aiming to be realistic so the graphics are cartoony.Overall, the game was OK. I’m reminded of South Park: The Stick of Truth a lot and honestly, I would recommend playing that over this game. It’s not bad but just kinda meh to above meh.			"

												This game is utterly adorable. It's has Final Fantasy style combat and exploration that is very well executed, with a few very clever twists from the Halloween theme. Seriously, I just about died from the cuteness when I saw the unicorn costume has a box attached to the wearer's butt to represent the back legs. It's just too dang cute.			"

												Costume Quest is a game about capitalism and the futility of fighting the system. You play as Wren or Reynold, fraternal twins locked into a system in which happiness is always kept at arm's length. Your twin, the object of your worldly fulfillment, is taken from you, and you are forced to incorporate yourself into the capitalist consumer machine in order to free them from bondage - i.e. willfully enslaving yourself even deeper in order to cast off perceived oppression. The erstwhile heroes are indoctrinated into consumerism through perceived need. Costumes and battle stamps are tools by which they can defeat their perceived oppressors, and candy and creepy treats are the currency by which they can obtain them. The creepy treats only award a special costume upon completing a full set, forcing the consumer-hero to seek out other members of their in-group to trade with and developing a reliance upon victimizing the out-group in order to obtain more. The same is true for candy, but on a much larger scale: widescale destruction and abuse of natural resources is encouraged, and upon reentering a zone the supply magically replenishes itself. Candy is ultimately spent on battle stamps, an entirely extraneous commodity that the game can be won without, but is marketed as invaluable and a means by which to constantly sink the children's personal supply of wealth.The true capitalist hero of this story is Sadie, a brave young entrepeneur with a monopoly on the battle stamps market who is happy to aid the heroes in their fight against the villainous 'monsters.' She allows her customers to develop a dependence upon her product before beginning to dramatically ramp up the price to obtain newer and better versions of the same - designed obselescence at its finest. By the end of the game the player is lucky if they have several hundred pieces of candy in their bucket, while Sadie sits on thousands that the player spent to constantly upgrade their battle stamps. The 'monsters' of the game are cast as villains bent on hoarding all the world's candy for themselves, when in reality they are collecting it in order to save their own lives. Sadie, on the other hand, is motivated purely by profit - lying, expanding, and price-gouging to drive it ever higher.The harsh reality is that this game is designed to indoctrinate the player into heedlessly reaping the world's resources and victimizing their competition in the name of achieving fulfillment. They are taught to at the same time fear and trust the two heads of the capitalist serpent, sybomically mirrored by the twin heads of the Doublefine logo: the Repugians, who are the face of foreign investments, and Sadie, the friendly face who is always there to help. 10/10 illuminati confirmed.

												Wow, what a great game.  It's a sleeper hit, in that it hits you under the chin like a sock puppet over a mailed fist.  Unexpected.  Total surprise. Sure, the gameplay is a little simplistic: poke around for candy, knock on doors, trip up monsters, turn-based party fight; rinse, repeat (with the occasional break to equip interesting items or use a cool costume power).  It is more than enjoyable enough to be forgiven any repetitiveness, and indeed serves to grease the wheels of the game's main attraction -- the fantastic story!Buy this game.			"

												What's not to love about Costume Quest? 1) It's Double Fine. 2) It's related to Halloween. 3) It's epic! If you love well written turn-based combat adventure games with a twist then you'll love this. Played it originally on Xbox 360 and it was awesome, played it again through Steam and it's still awesome! Really pleased the Grubbins on Ice DLC was included too, a nice addition!			"

												Costume Quest is a quirky, easy little RPG aimed for a younger audience. As an adult I enjoyed this game thoroughly and highly recommend it to anyone who want to play a relaxing, casual game. Be warned that it is a turn-based game - so if you don't like the battle style, I'll say give this one a miss.			"

												Not badStoryYou are a kid that goes Trick and Treating with their sibling who is swiftly kidnapped by monsters. Now it is your job to go door to door trick or treating, complete quests, and fight monsters. It’s pretty much a standard RPG with a halloween theme painted on it. The story isn’t bad and it follows Double Fine’s formula well (kid looking game with often adult adventures that is eccentric). There are some dark elements to the game which come out really well and the whole game has a theme of child wonder to it. You fight as real transformers, unicorns, and vampires while facing daemons. It sounds like a kid fantasy. However, the story isn’t flushed out as Psychonauts for example and I don't really remember muchGameplayIt’s a standard RPG (with a twist). The main point is to go around to all of the stores/houses and trick or treat. Different areas are blocked out until you can unlock certain areas. This is mostly done through monster fights. Overall, this system is nice as it moves the plot along via your actions but gets very repetitive near the end as you just end up going from monster fight to monster fight. Speaking of which, the monster battles are a bit simple. You can have up to 3 characters each of which has a regular move and a special ability with a long cool down. Additionally, you have different patches you can apply which are absolutely necessary to stand a chance. It took me a while to find a pair that worked for me but in the end, it was all just the same thing over and over until the end. Overall, I found the system a bit simple and I don’t play RPGs muchPerformance:With a 4790k, GTX 970, and 16GB of ram, it ran at either 30 or 60fps for me. It didn’t vary in between those two numbers but rather certain scenes and areas were stuck at 30. The game isn’t aiming to be realistic so the graphics are cartoony.Overall, the game was OK. I’m reminded of South Park: The Stick of Truth a lot and honestly, I would recommend playing that over this game. It’s not bad but just kinda meh to above meh.			"

												Costume Quest is a lovable adventure you will never forget and if you do forget it, you are dead to me. This game is a superb JRPG with great level designs which sometimes want you to get a walkthrough (I had to use a walkthrough about 3-4 times). The story is a bit short but if you did all side quests (like me), you would at least have about 6-7 hours put in this. If you didnt do all side quests, you would have approximately 2-4 hours put in this. The game is beautiful for a halloween-themed game. Coffins are chests, you can trick-or-treat houses for candy or enemy encounters, battle stamps which improve your character in fights and several comedic speeches for all ages. I absolutely adore this game. Just like in every RPG game, there is a leveling up system. In order to level up, you defeat enemies (just like every RPG). It does take quite a while to level up in this game but that made me want to farm enemies and destroy bosses. Every game (excluding racing games) contain bosses (I think). These bosses were rather time consuming but if you had the right costumes for your team, it would be a piece of cake. I did find one boss in the game rather annoying but dont want to spoil it. I would say something about the boss, but just wait till you fight her. There are costumes you find from side quests or just main quests. These costumes play a big part of the game not just because its the games title, but you actually get different move sets aswell. The costumes I found made the final boss a 1 try victory for me. The game can be a bit easy if you get guides on where the costumes are located and its pieces. There is another playable DLC you get automatically if you purchase this game on steam, called Grubbins on Ice. It's not extremely long, its about 1/3 of the games length. I did enjoy it though because it gave me three costumes, several battle stamps and a nice adventure. I would prefer playing this after the base game because everthing from your first save in Costume Quest, gets sent over into the DLC. It's pretty helpful. It is recommended to do that because enemies are about lvl 13 and your cap is lvl 10 (in the base game). This game is a master piece literally. I love it so much and for the price I got it for (99 cents in the 2015 holiday sale) it was worth it. If you see this game going for about $5 or less, purchase it immediately. THIS TITLE IS A MUST-BUY. I LOVE YOU DOUBLE FINE PRODUCTIONS!			"

												Costume Quest did a great job of scratching my Final Fantasy itch without requiring the hundreds of hours your average FF game requires. The combat can be a bit repetitive, and the skill level is defnitely geared toward more novice players, but the game is short enough neither of these stuck around long enough to bother me. As one would expect from Double Fine, the art direction is fantastic, and the Creepy Treats cards are a great blend of Garbage Pail Kids-style art and trading cards with some of the best puns and just weird candies you can imagine. As a short treat or break from the norm, Costume Quest is sure to satisfy.			"

												This game is brilliantly nostalgic, combining engaging mechanics with the essence of Halloweens of yesteryear - before sugarphobia, when a bit of duct tape and cardboard could fire a kids' imagination, when All Hallows Eve was a time of innocent play and kids above a certain age were temporarily allowed out of the sight of their parents (who, in that ancient time, lacked the built-in helicopter blades which today eviscerate children's marrow).

												It's Halloween.  You're out trick or treating, and your brother/sister gets kidnapped!  It turns out that there is a plot by real monsters to steal all the candy in the world, and only you and your friends can stop them.Your costumes have different abilities to use while you're walking around town.  One has a flashlight so you can cross dark areas.  One has a helmet so you can cross areas with dripping water or debris.  One lets you roller skate and jump off ramps.  Another lets you into a secret club in your neighborhood.The costumes become REAL during combat, and each has a different fighting style.  So if you're dressed as the Statue of Liberty, you can use a healing spell to restore HP to the whole group, or you can hit the enemy with your torch to set them on fire.  If you are the robot, you can rocket-punch a single enemy or use your missiles to attack all the enemies.  And the other costumes have additional things going for them.  As you play more of the game, you will find parts of new costumes.  Only if you find all the parts can you make the costume.  In addition to changing costumes, you can also buy badges that give additional abilities.  One lets you add a little poison to your attacks.  Another adds a bigger poison with splash damage to nearby enemies.  Another boosts your HP so you live longer.  Another boosts your damage, but only if you make a critical hit.  You make a critical hit by getting good timing when you push the button displayed on screen.  Critical hits are very easy, I think I only ever missed two.  The first was because I didn't know how to do it yet, the second was because I sneezed and it messed up my timing.This game is not particularly difficult.  It is also not very big or long.  Still, it is fun for a little while.  It also has an expansion pack (standalone) where the kids visit the monster world at Christmas time and help the monsters overthrow a dictator.  New costumes are available in the expansion.  You can load your end-game save from the original game and start with the same characters, badges, and costumes when you boot up the expansion.Bottom line:  it's cute and fun, but don't expect too much from this one.

												I was expecting much less about Costume Quest... When I first saw it, I thought it'd be something childish, but I gave it a try, so I bought the CQ1&2 Bundle for a low price.I couldn't have been more wrong... Costume Quest was awesome!When I realized it, I was extremely immersed in the story and the gameplay... Though I thought some maps and objectives were a little repetitive, but no harm done.One of the things that made me really like this game was the costume system, the need-to-get-that-costume feeling is really engaging!This game is really good for those who want a not-so-difficult but fun and good RPG experience. The achievements are very easy to get, too.Extremely recommend it.			"

Also props to the battle system: honestly I think all turn-based games should have some timing elements in them.  That way you get the best of both worlds:  some tactics and action.It's not overly complicated or difficult, and the variation of costumes adds some fun to the mix.  Definitely a game worth getting so you can have something to do to help build the halloween spirit before the holiday.			"

												Pretty good game, well...according to the reviews. I never actually played this game. I forgot about it and just let it run for 100+ hours.			"

												Such a fun little game. The art style is cute but creepy, and matches the overall theme of  silliness.			"

												A too-easy RPG themed around Halloween. It's very cute and quite short. Fun to play at Halloween time for sure!			"

												Sweet & Simple (but maybe a little too simple). If you need a fix for a relaxing, turn-based RPG adventur with a childish charm to it then this game is for you. Just don't expect it to be the deepest experience you've ever had.			"

												Another great Double Fine game.  Short but still deilvers with the characters, story and gameplay. Just the feeling of beating monsters with my unicorn Costume is just down right fun.  Now I just wish that I can be in the Costume Quest universe a bit longer.			"

												I was brought up in American suburbia, and Halloween was always my favorite holiday growing up, probably because I was kind of a dork. I just loved the idea of one night where all kids, regardless of their popularity or class, got to assume fun new identities, put on cool costumes, go to their neighbors, and ask for candy. It was magical. I never liked the scarier parts of the holiday because I was always kind of a timid kid, but the dressing-up, the friendship that you could feel on Halloween night, was very special.With that said, this game is great. It's a love letter to suburban Halloween, with none of the scares and all of the fun and fantasy. I was a little skeptical of it before playing it as I had heard somewhat middling reviews upon its initial release, but after grabbing it in a Steam sale, I could not be happier with my purchase. Double Fine's characteristically thoughtful and funny writing is here in spades, and the characters you interact with are just delightful. That's a word I could apply to a lot of things in this game, actually—delightful.			"

												Costume Quest and it's sequel are colorful rpgs, with the usual mechanics. Press - here and such. However, they also have a sense of humor (And as always humor is subjective) The games are generally fun to play, the writing is funny, but there are a few reundancies in the script, as well as some sloppy writing. But that will only bother you a little (Or not at all if you're not a person particularly attached to grammar, and spelling. (I didn't notice any spelling issues)) The designs of the costumes, and of the in-fight character designs are pretty cool, though out of battle the costumes' design is more cute than anything else. The control scheme is a little difficult compared to console versions, but not so much so that it ruins the game. (Unless you have bad arthritis, than get a controller.)I got these games for a two for one sale for a dollar ninety-nine. Frankly, I think that this is terrible. These games aren't bargain bin garbage, they truly are worth playing.Mechanics: Pretty much the usual, costumes offer new methods of traversal. -+Graphics: Cartoony, but generally this improves the game. +Story: Written with humor, and generally enjoyable. Although, there were times where the script could've been refined, I quite enjoyed the story as a whole. +Gameplay: It was quite fun to play, maybe a little tedious if you can't find all of the houses, but this didn't bother me. + (That said this is the second game I ever fully completed, more commonly phrased as one hundred percenting)Controls: A little difficult to use, compared to console versions, but this doesn't ruin the game. And you could always get a controller. -Miscellaneous: The game was cute. But not overly cutesy, so you would have to punch a bear to get your manhood back after playing it.			"

												I wish more games were like this:  inexpensive (writing this during a sale), fun and finishable in short amount of time.  I wouldn't have such a huge backlog otherwise.  Also props to the battle system: honestly I think all turn-based games should have some timing elements in them.  That way you get the best of both worlds:  some tactics and action.It's not overly complicated or difficult, and the variation of costumes adds some fun to the mix.  Definitely a game worth getting so you can have something to do to help build the halloween spirit before the holiday.			"

												At first, this looked like a lot of fun. it has an interesting concept that, for as far as I know, hasn't been used all that useful. now that I've played it, I came to the conclusion that it is a rather boring game. it certainly loses it appeal rapidly over time. In the end, I don't even find it worth finishing the game. I'd say its a let down and should not be played.			"

												I loved this! It took me way too long to get it to work and I was even thinking of getting a refund at one point but I'm so glad I didn't. It's a family friendly Stick of Truth kind of game and the style feels like a blend between a ps1 and nds game. You only need one hand and a keyboard to play it so it's definitely a casual game.  Also I loved the little Stacking easter egg. Stacking was the first Double Fine game I played but apparenly it came out after Costume Quest and they announced the main character in the GOI part of this game.  Anyway, you should disable that sticky keys pop up because some of the costumes require you to press shift repeatedly. If you don't the pop up will crash your game. Never tab out of the game or you will get the callstack error and your game will crash. Don't try to change the resolution either. If you're on Windows 10 run this in Win 95 compatibility mode so the combat cutscenes don't crash your game. The FPS is capped at 30 and you probably shouldn't try to mess with that either. If you're ok with all of that then you'll probably love the game.			"

												Cute game! Easy enough for a casual gamer without it feeling too simple. Amusing dialog with cute graphics. Honestly had fun playing through it. It is short, which can be a plus or minus for depending on what you want out of a game. For me, I enjoyed the short little game as something quick to play through while also having fun.			"

												I really enjoyed this game. It was bright, fun, and full of hidden items and quests. The characters were great, and the writing was clever - I particularly liked the really accurate twin rivalry, and the depth the monsters and villains were given. The battles were my least favorite bit, though. While the stamps and costumes give the characters a range of powers and tactics, I'm not fond of the hit-one-of-four-random-keys timed events. But then again, I'm used to puzzle games, so to each their own.Overall, excellent game, and I definitely recommend it!			"

												A fun little game. It's not really replayable and gameplay could become a little boring since you have to repeat all your actions over and over again in every area  but the idea is interesting, the style is cute and you sure will spend some good time playing this game(it's short anyway). I recommend to try it.			"
