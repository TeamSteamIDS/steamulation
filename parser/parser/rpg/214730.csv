												This is a damned good game.  Damned good at being multiple games, and succeeding at it.  Turn based space combat, real time space combat, text quests, real time strategy, other games would settle on a mere one or two of these, but Space Rangers HD: A War Apart is essentially the swiss army knife of space gaming.  With its consiterable polish from the previous versions, and new content, this game is a must have.  It is a perfect entry point into the game if you've never played it before.  That said, if you've played previous versions of the game, you might consiter waiting for a slight discount.  Even still, it's a bargain at any price, and will keep you entertained for literally hundreds of hours.			"

												""What is this crap?"" - will ask a lot of people. Well it is one of the best games out there. Good game is a game that has a ""soul"" or somethign that captivates players and  make them think about it when they are at work, at camping, eating hot pockets or sitting in the restroom.This game is very unique and will bring you much joy, due to its diversity. Strategy, great  loot, well written and logical text quests. Even unbalanced 3D planetary fights make you think and try new angles. The game is like a fresh breath in the age of action games with big booms and big boobs.Think about it as game that was polished by almost indie developers. If you can't wait for all these new big space games to come out, give this baby a shot. You will be surprised what it got for you.			"

												I have to admit it...This game...is amazing. I have been playing now for about 6 days since I bought it.This game truly shines in every aspect. The thing I find most amazing is that the DEVELOPERS STILL SUPPORT AND UPDATE THIS GAME REGULARLY!!!!!YES! You heard me. THEY STILL UPDATE IT WITH NEW PATCHES AND STUFF. 7 years old?Doesn't matter. This game is such a classic and well worth it. I hope they come out with some DLC packs because they do such a great job and I would totally pay for it. But guess what? THEY RELEASE EVERYTHING FREE!!!These guys deserve 100% to be supported. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!			"

												This is the kind of game that, had it received proper financial support, marketing and translation back in the day - could now compete on the market with such titles as Grand Theft Auto and Sims. Or, at the very least - with X-com, for the top TBS. The reason is that the game is purely unique - not only in its gameplay that has no analogue, but also in the mixture of genres that together present a picture of indescribable detail. Sure, the game is pretty much old 2006 version(which was old even by that time), because that's the best fans and SNK can do with their resources, but its value is not in the shiny graphics. Well, what can it offer?1. Turn-based RPG\Strategy Space combat. Advanced character development system, both focusing on polishing your ship and your skills: many ways to customize and affect your gameplay with acryn items, stimulants, artifacts, micromodules etc. Various settings to influence space environment - from total sandbox to hardcore survival. The only probable downside(which is also a ""trademark"" of the game) - is the reverse difficulty. Most RPG\Strategies give you an easy headstart. Enemies are simple, you just walk over them. Even if not all RPGs get difficult in the end, the case of Space Rangers is that the enemies and survivability is hardest in the beginning, and is gradually made easier as you advance. There are ways to balance it, either with custom settings or cheats, but for those who had troubles beginning or look for endgame diversity... you might be a little disappointed.Edit: As noted in the late-written section below, there is now Advanced Adjustment, which does help you establish a harder and more intense gameplay. There are also new enemy ships to offer some challenge. But my point remains - the game isn't about ""endgame grind and bossruns"", for better and for worse.2. Magnificent text quests. Yes, this is something of the Stone Age of PC\console gaming - the process of READING to entertain. And what's worse - with all due respect to translator team, they could only do so much. There is a a big gap between feeling the linguistic marvel of text quests in russian and english versions, and it is something that should've been worked on by translators from Blizzard. But nevertheless, translation is understandable, humor is interpreted - and for a person that doesn't get off on constant graphical action - adventuring through certain stories and solving quest puzzles will provide hours of relaxing and thrilling entertainment. Even if you take a break and return, it never gets old to drop laughing at something that got you unprepared some time in the past.3. Real-time robot strategy battles. Although there are many guides and even basic strategies that allow to pretty much faceroll most battles, for a beginner that doesn't want his game spoiled, deciding how to outfit your robots and how to control their stupid-a** AI to win the *very rewarding* mission - will be something to put your nerve into. Graphics aren't catchy, but it's as much as needed for 3D gameplay, all the while keeping the game low-standard.4. Arcade hyperspace battles. Now that's something even more ""oldschool"" than even text quests. If you are a battered veteran of arcade games of 80ies - this little game mode will be met at least as a pleasant surprise. For anyone else - it's totally optional and changeable in settings to make it easy as a cake if you so desire. However, for more hardcore blokes, especially previously mentioned veterans, there are many bonuses that can make or break the game as well as ways to utilize your weapon to survive even a certain death scenario. A properly adjusted arcade battle isn't one easy bite.5. Record Table and hardcore replayability. There used to be a tremendously big russian forum dedicated to the game, with so much community, brainstorming and theorycrafting that could rival even those of Blizzard. Why do I say it? Well, because some people could never stop making strategies, finding shortcuts and exploits, glitches and tech. details of the system and code - and they needed a place to post it all. With system revamps and time, both many of such ""glitches"" and the forum are gone(archived), but the idea of hardcore replayability, as well as Record Table are still up. While it is still purely single player, if you can devote hundreds or thousands of hours of grinding in any other game - perhaps you will be interested in researching this game's nature to it's fullest.What can be the downsides? Well, if you are a more casual PvE gamer, like me, who enjoys mostly boss-encounters and casual gameplay - you won't find that much endgame or replayability here. However, I've played this game for over a decade, from the very Space Rangers 1(which was fatefully introduced to me by a classmate) to this HD. And even if the game remained similar, this is the game that you will always remember and keep getting back to... just to submerge into this universe, a universe that could be as big as modern standards allow... but that is forced to remain Indie. Oh, and of course, if you don't prefer to pay for singleplayer games or just have too many friends to spend your time alone - this also isn't a game for you.One thing I can say for sure: this game totally fulfils it's modest price of 25$, if you meet at least half of above-listed quotas. With all the beta accesses and indie game market, this isn't triple A. This is an old legend that has been released in HD for modern systems. It's a historical game that you are allowed to explore.Edit:I'm glad that my zealous review has helped some people, and I've got a request to post differences from Reboot. So now I am addressing not only aspiring new players, who are not afraid to play indie games, but also english-speaking veterans, who had the opportunity to play Reboot back in the day.Main difference, which is widely announced - is the introduction of pirates, a side-faction. What should be understood about them - is that they aren't a faction per se. They aren't quite the coalition that you can play. If Coalition loses, so do you, and they are unable to build certain bases. Their addition is virtually a different(or additional) path for you to advance in you space contest, and it comes with a vivid questline, taking players through various types of gameplay... and having quite spectacular rewards.Another addition, which was patched in after the release - is reworked weapon customization. New weapons, brand new weapon effects - new ways to perform beautiful 2D combat. Hulls have received resistance types, so you'll have to be ready to adjust your choice of opponents.What's more - there are new Dominator ships. Long have people asked for something really tough besides Brain Centers, so now you will have to think twice before rushing with AoE weaponry.What can be better than that? Advanced game Adjustment! Want dominators to be even more aggressive and scale better? Want Coalition to hold to their undies for the majority of the war? Want pirates to be almost nonexistant? Or even want to skip all the technological progress and jump in the middle of high-tech galactical war? All that and much, much more. One downside, games with Advanced Adjustment are invalid for leaderboards.To top that off, modding has been greatly expanded, thanks to Evilcoward, so enthusiasts can finally tweak the game for their own likes. Unfortunately, I don't know how modding works for english community, and I doubt that russian mods were localized, but SNK team knows English, they can at least get you in touch with russian modders and maybe think of something.Of course, more planet battles, quests, government missions - that doesn't have to be mentioned.Personally, I'd say the changes are worth a try, especially the Advanced Adjustment for those veterans, who always wanted harder endgame or even more intricate sandbox.

												TL;DR: Great space 2D RPG with an arcade minigame and an RTS minigame and a whole lot of text quests for the extra retro feel. Really addictive, if you liked FTL, buy it. If you didn't, buy it anyway!      I must say, this game is great! I've had tons and tons of fun with the previous installments of this little franchise and the newest one, A War Apart is definitely the best of them. The basic gameplay which will make up most of the time you play is a top-down 2D turn-based RPG, although the turns can run smoothly without a pause unless something happens or you chose to change the course of your spaceship or the unfortunate target of your weapons. It offers a great variety of weapons, equipment and ship hulls both you and the AI can use. You can upgrade and enhance every piece of equipment you have and alter its stats using rare items called micromodules.      This variety also brings a great number of different playstiles, you can trade, complete missions for governments of different planets, be a pirate (ARRR!) and rob trading ships for money and goods, be a warrior and slay hundreds of pirates and aliens or chose any combination of those and others. Anything goes! You can also literally do nothing, just sit back and watch as the universe goes on without you, every ship pursues its own goals regardless of player's actions.     The standard quests are pretty dull, either it's a parcell delivery, guard star system, kill this one guy and so on. The quests are quite silly and can contain nice little references. But they pay you in much needed cash and some rare items, if you get lucky.     Then there are two kinds of special quests. Planetary quests bring up old-fashiond text quests which are really nice and fun, every single one of them is different and it really is a time machine that brings you a few decades back.     The other kind is the RTS strategy ""minigame"" that lets you test your strategic skill against one to three AI armies of robots. There are resource factories you can capture and even destroy. Those can be protected by 4 kinds of deffensive turrets. The units you and the AIs control are modular robots. You can customise every single robot you make, you chose the hull, chasis, head and weapons. All these have different characteristics like speed, HP, damage, range, resource cost and so on. You can also take manual control of a robot you created and move and shoot with it as in a third-person-shooter. But I'm bad at RTS games and always get my butt kicked by the AI so I never really appretiated this game mode.     On your journeys through the universe, you can also stumble apon a Black hole (should be called a wormhole, though). Going through it lets you a play an arcade top-down minigame where you fly your ship using arrow keys in an arena-like area, pick-up power-ups and shoot enemy ships with your weapons. After you deal with the ships that are inside, you get a random, usually rare item and appear in a different star system. The minigame is quite fun and is a nice, simple addition to the game.     Both the graphics and the GUI are a bit outdated and lack customization options, and some stuff gets too repetitive pretty fast. Same thing with the soundtrack. While the soundtrack is quite good, every single track is very distinctive and in a game that offers a great amount of playtime, it all gets very repetitive and a music mod would come in handy.     The developers updated and balanced the game after release and the game turned out to be pretty balanced and additional content can bring the veterans of the franchise back to play and actually offer something new to the old players, which is really nice and I hope that one day, Space Rangers 3 will see the light of day.To sum this up, once you get into it, it's a lot of fun and you can spend hundreds of hours with this game. There are some issues but the good qualities prevail. I give this fun little russian game 8 bottles of vodka out of 10.			"

												A-God damn this game is for mega nerds. Flying around, playing space, getting rich via capitalism -- it is all here. You can go to Venus and buy drugs. You can get a sailor-themed prison tattoo. I'm pretty sure for my latest quest I delivered the One Ring to Mount Doom in space. There are text quests galore. There are RTS missions of questionable quality. There are arcade-style shooting minigames that kind of suck but it doesn't matter because they are all optional. I started out as a wussy trader who got picked on my space pirates non-stop. Now I am a seasoned Space Ranger who kills for fun. It is a pretty good game. It was made by Russians.			"

I spent hours doing and caculating trades for maximum profit, I digged all the text quests like a crazy miner, I blew the whole galaxy up.

												I played Space Rangers 2 : rise of the dominators to death. I played it to death because it's awesome. What about Space Rangers HD: A War apart? Any better?This isn't just an upgrade but a complete overhaul. There are a lot of little changes and some very big new mechanics. If you're used to the older games I think some things you may find frustrating, but it's a good frustration not a bad one. Like being check-mated unexpectedly, it makes you want to play again, try something different and adjust your strategy.The developers don't work in english, so communication is sometimes a little brief and intermittent. There have been regular updates but I can't tell you what half of them did as they drifted in undocumented. That minor quibble aside it's well worth your money. It's a classic that keeps getting improved so hopefully those little translation problems will be tackled eventually. Even if not it's a great game and well worth the money.			"

												To put it short. A very nice and smart turn-based RPG-strategic game about a space adventure. Great music.  A bit of arcade and RTS (you can ignore these part). Trade, quests, interesting well-written and smart text-quests. Highly addictive.Gameplay is simple. Possibilities are endless. World is open to be expored. Setting is original and pretty colorful - each nation is unique. You actions do impact everything. Balance is sound. Ship could be improved. Even when you find youself in a prison, you've got much to do.Wish there were a mobile version of the game.... "

												Back in the day I stumbled across Space Rangers 2, played it, and totally loved it. Only after that I played Space Rangers 1, both of which I have on steam. And yeah, the older Space Ranger parts were once on steam, but for some reason they've been taken down from sales. That is if you already bought them you can still install and play them from steam.Strictly speaking Space Rangers HD is a remake of Space Rangers 2. It started out rather similar, but with time I feel that HD has really become a new game. There is a HUGE lot of more content than in Space Rangers 2.Pros:-Intrinsicate and tactical space combat-Massively varied hulls and equipment-The general difficulty, primarily space combat, ranges from easy (the galaxy will eventually mostly fix itself) to nightmare (the galaxy is totally doomed unless you are constantly there to protect it)-The difficulty can also be adjusted very precisely-The galaxy is truly alive, and nothing centers around you, unless you get the power to make it so, but even then life will always go on, whether you're there to witness it or not-Great and emotionally immersing music (this is obviously subjective, I've also seen reviews that claim the music is subpar, something I'd never agree on)-The addition of planetary battles, black hole arcade battles and text quests makes the Space Rangers universe feel much more complete and immersive, and you're mostly not forced into either of them-The devs are still active some 2 years after the game has been released and it is very polished, I guess I don't have to mention that this can't be taken for granted nowadays-Interesting story and you're not forced to approach it in one single way, do whatever you feel you have to doCons:-Planetary battle difficulties range from almost impossible to lose to almost impossible to win, some of the maps are so hard I don't see any casual gamer ever winning them (not without like 24 hours of practice and/or guides at least), and here you have no say in the difficulty of the maps you get, except for taking more resistant bots or more reinforcements on hard maps, which reduces your rewards-The AI behaves mostly intelligent and acceptable, but there are some exceptions, military ships will sometimes pick their targets so badly they can't even kill one enemy before dying, and your robots in ground battles are in constant danger of committing suicide if you're not there to prevent it-The devs thought that having ships simply shoot and destroy wares in space is a good way of keeping sectors clean, so you see something really valuable in the system, you're on your way and you see a civilian ship flying by? You can almost certainly expect it to shoot down your loot, the same counts for military ships when you fight dominators, always keep a save handy in case some of the military ships decide it's important to shoot down your most valuable drops (ships will start shooting wares after there are 7 objects in the system... which happens very fast because even the passing asteroids will easily litter 7 mineral pieces into the system)I might've descibed the negative points in details, but don't let that fool you, the pros vastly outnumber the cons. Is it worth getting this game? If you like turn based space RPGs the answer is: Hell YES!			"

												BASICALLY, A STAND-ALONE EXPANSION OF SPACE RANGERS 2 / SPACE RANGERS 2: REBOOT""REBOOT"", fixed a ton of issues with the original SR2, added some stuff.In this game, you are a Space Ranger, at war with the ""Dominator"" machine-ships, and in AWA, at war with the Pirates too now. You can go do whatever you want. Trade between planets, star systems, explore, help the Rangers, help the Military, help the Pirates, help yourself, whatever. The game world goes on BY ITSELF. You can Hail any ship, recruit other ships, or raid and loot transports, liners, whoever. You're on a 2D map while a 4X game basically goes on without your help. Help or don't. Up to you. You can do 3D RTS style missions. Or text-based/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type missions. There is even a shooter-arcade type mode.SR:AWA fixes a few things, adds higher-res, and adds a lot more stuff.Stuff? What stuff? That is what I always wanted to know.But no one ever would say. They'd be like ""they added a few things"".OK, like what?WHAT?Not even the game developers explain all that they have added.SO HERE IS THE JIST OF IT:-You can join the Pirates FOR REAL.  Before, you would be a pirate by ACTING like a pirate. You can be a good guy or bad guy and land at their bases. They didn't care. NOW, you can still do that, but now you can OFFICIALLY join them.So you are a Ranger but you can join the Pirates. To advance, you have to ACT like a pirate, earning pirate ""points"" for doing various nefarious things (attack transports, get them to give-up cargo, extort money from them, or blow them up, etc.).-In the Pirate faction, there is a ""rank"" system, like the Rangers have. Once you earn enough pirate points to reach the next rank, they don't just give it to you. Rather, you will be given a quest to complete. This can be a frustrating chore. Given Pirates are ""take no kraaap!"" types, you have to take it from them to complete a quest to ""rank-up"". One quest, I had to land on a planet and do something, but since I'm a pirate, and the planet hates me, I get captured right away and they try to throw me in jail. LOL. The only way out is to pay $$$$$ in fine (racks up as you raid/destroy ships to rank-up in the Pirate faction) or destroy a bucket-load of Dominators (who are they? Imagine if Skynet from Terminator built spaceships to conquer the galaxy). SO, what are really ""non-pirate"" activities, that must be completed, really make the Pirate-rank-progression thing a real buzz-kill.-Destroy stations. The Dominators in the other games could do it. Why couldn't you? NOW YOU CAN. So when you go ""full-Pirate-aggro"" in the past games, all civilian ships, military ships, and some Rangers are hostile to you, and you can battle them to all you want to blow them out of the stars.Now you can blow all their precious space stations out of the stars too.I always wanted that in the game. Stations always have a huge impact on a star system, and the ability to drastically alter a system, So are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the Rangers? The Military? Scientists? Medical? Business Centers? Etc. BLOW THEM UP. You can take out any station now.(Maybe next they should add planets? lol.)-New ships models/types, new weapons, new devices/ship-parts. This is the best. SR2:Reboot always needed MORE stuff. More gear is better. You always reached a point where you're like ""This is all?"" and hoped there'd be mods or something that added new stuff. The game could seriously benefit from a Diablo/Drox Operative-type loot system, in my opinion. They developers tried to expand on this as best they could without ruining the game. They split up ship's abilities into Energy, Shield, and some other thing. Unfortunately, it's never really explained, you have to go online to figure out what ""E:"" ""S:"" and stuff means. Pretty stupid. But it's not imporant. What you look at is the item description and what it will do for you and your ship. ""This weap will do 10-20dmg and has range of 300"". That's pretty much all I need to know.A bunch of fans of the game are REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the new changes to items/weapons.I'm sure they had a ""routine"", to start-up, progress, and which ships/items to go for, with each game they play (or just used to same game. On SR2:Reboot, I've been playing the same character/game for like 4 years. lol.).SO, the developers coming in and changing things, ""messes up"" the routine.Overall, I didn't find it that drastic or distracting. It did seem to make progressing a bit harder, and drawn out.The game is a ""long game"" in that sense anyways.-New ships for Dominators too. I like have they might have a command/flagship in their fleets now sometimes.-New songs (not too many though)-High-Res available, and new graphics/effects. There are new combat-FX which look better than SR2/SR2:Reboot. Not THAT much, but it's more fluid and more tight. A very welcomed change. As for the HD/High-Res....FORGET IT. While the game runs great maxxed-out, everything looks too small anyways. Like watching beetles zap each other all over the screen. NAH, I'd rather be able to actually see the ships closer than this, and not with a magnifying glass. You can adjust the font but it looks stupid when playing at max res and each letter is the size of an ant's behind.Still, if you have a really humungous monitor, it would be better suited. Even with lower-resolution settings, the game looks great. It always did before so why should it not? It seems the whole ""high-res"" just really serves to make everything ""smaller"".It doesn't appear to me that they tightened the graphics at all, but rather, made it to where you're more ""zoomed out"" and slapped ""HD"" on it.Seriously, if you play on highest SR2:Reboot res, the game looks totally the same.That's not a bad thing. Like I said, the ""high-res"", is really just the game more zoomed out and not suffering from graphical anomalies as best I can tell.-I can't remember anything else that stood out as different. Tons of small improvements here and there, like stations do a better job shooting down asteroids passing by, that spawn more minerals.-ONLY SERIOUSLY BAD THINGS: I hate that ships run away super-fast, if they are losing a battle. The game still has problems with ""targeting"". Like, you can't target anything outside your weapon range, but you can fly within range once the ""turn-based/simulatenous-real-time"" starts. So why not be able to set the ship to fire automatically at a designated target? If you use the default option to ""attack target"", the ship flies moronically.Your ship will fly away from the enemy, because the enemy might be flying on a path to where doing that manuever will put your weapons in range.....BUT IT DOESN'T WORK HALF THE BLEEDING TIME. In SR2:REBOOT, this happened, but it actually appeared to work effectively 75% or more of the time. Now, it'sl ike 40% of the time. That's REALLY frustrating.OH YEAH, and while I appreciate that ships ""realistically"" try to flee and land somewhere to get away and repair, when this happens though, they have some sort of magicaly ""turbo-boost"", where they fly off at ""cheat"" speeds. They land.They know if you are camping them.Once you fly far away, they will launch, and attack, or fly away.So you play a ton more of ""cat/mouse"" in AWA. They ran away too in SR2:Reboot, but not with some super-turbo-boost like that. So it really ruins combat in the game, drags it out endlessly, in fact.I seriously believe they need to release a patch that nerfs this.OVERALL:Personally, I'd want to recommend SR2:REBOOT instead.That was the best of the SR series.BUT...AWA streamlines the game and adds stuff, and despite its issues--they aren't much, so I'd have to go ahead and recommend SR:AWA. If you play SR2:REBOOT, and then play this new one, you'll be like ""Dude, this has more stuff to do, more things? Why didn't you tell me? WHY?!""Now you know! :D			"

												Space Rangers is one of the greatest and most unknown video game series of the past 10 years. An obscure offering from Russia, the second game, now released on steam, is remastered and well worth a couple dozen... Hundreds of hours of your time.You play as a solo ship captain and choose how to advance your way through the galaxy--will it be trade? Piracy? Military conscription? Courier work? Bounty hunting?Obviously. But what makes this game so different is that the galaxy is being slowly taken over by ""Dominators"", a Borg-like machine race with 3 factions which annihilate fleets and conquer star systems. To fight them is futile. At first. As if that were not enough, the game also incorporates text-adventures for fun and profit, as well as planetary battles ala Starcraft. The ambition and scope of this game has to be commended.This is the closest that any game has ever come to advancing the genre began by games like Star Command, Rogue and Wing Commander: Privateer.

												I had played the original Space Rangers 2 Reboot, which this HD release improves upon. Despite it's faults, I really enjoyed the game and put a lot of hours into it. A War Apart adds new content and some bugfixes which makes for a better experience. The Pirate clan added to the game gives it more depth and makes it much more fun to be an actual pirate in the game. You may join them, or you may use their territory as a safe zone. The original game made it very difficult to pirate efficiently. Still, the Dialog remains a little on the dodgy side, not much has changed there. If you played the Reboot and enjoyed it, this is a recommended purchase. For someone new to Space Rangers however, this is a solid game with quite a few modes of play. Whether your quests can take you to do an RTS section or a Text adventure, you aren't forced to do them if they're not your cup of tea. I will say this is a game for an older gamer, and it shows it's age even in this re-release.			"

												An excellent game. One of the best space shooter-trader games around. A sandbox in essence with voluntary random quests and the main goal to fulfill sooner or later. Although it is 2D and turn based, its combat is really thrilling and you need to plan your moves well. What is more, even looting is thrilling, since competing NPCs may steal what's dropped off your precious kill. You can do the same to their loot too, luckily.Trade in this game works great, unlike in most other space shooter-traders. You can get more and less subtle hints from planetary profiles, galactic news, business centers.Plenty of options what ship hull to buy and how to equip it. Oh, and checking on shops for ship equipment is fun too, because these items are semi-random, ie. random within their class range.And then, there is this heaps of subgames. Y'see, we have this Czech saying, ""It's like, as if a dog and a cat baked a cake together."", but this is not the case. It all fits together nicely. It feels refreshing. The wormhole arcade battles in realtime, the 3D RTS battles (those are real tough), and the most marvelous greatly designed text adventures for all you retro fans out there.Want an alternative to the common good guy plot? Playing a pirate has equally fine options here.I've already finished old SR1 and SR2 and keep coming for more with this HD gem.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time, this HD 'revival' of SR2 makes it even better (unless you dislike the new Pirate faction, which you can disable using a mod).The game presents a ton of features that can suite a wide-range of playstyles. The living and dynamic universe is probably the best one I've seen in a videogame, where NPCs actually have their goals, agendas, skills, equipment and all that. If you don't fight the war, it will fight itself. If you don't improve, your adversaries will.The space (main) part of the game is played in a turn-based fashion, but there are also 'arcade arena' battles which you fight in real-time in a top-down view, RTS missions and text missions of different types and styles.Ironically, I tend to dislike turn-based games, I don't play the text quests (unless I'm REALLY in the mood) and I never bothered with the RTS battles much..still, it's one of the few games I've replayed many times.If you're interested in space games, or in games with dynamic worlds..most definitely try it out!It's a shame there's still no plans for a Star Rangers 3, or for some space sim games from the same developers.

												Please ignore the Steam time played. I bought this back in 2006 as an actual physical product and before the HD version. This gem is a little bit of everything and will bring a smile to veteran gamers and introduce console folk looking for more substance to a world fun not possible on consoles.Some reading this will remember things called text adbventures. Well, they're back in this game! Want some RTS  battles on a planet's surface? It's in there! Space combat that is tactical? Check!Every new game is randomized ad you can choose what components to include. If you don't fancy the text adventure component, just uncheck it. (You'll be missing out however on some great fun). The game is quirky and many have compared it to SPAZ and I think the comparison is spot on though it is more accurate to compare SPAZ to this as SPAZ is clearly a love letter to games like Space Rangers HD.

												Multi-genre, Space RPG, land RTS, Text Quest, Arcade action in sub-Space and a universe of other things to do.Be a pirate, a mercenary, ranger, trader or all of the above. Alien races, planets, Screw the universe or help it. Take it easy and relax or crank the difficulty and go hardcore into the battle.Battle or evade enemies and find artifacts, make your own fleet or go solo. Buy, upgrade, and sell ships, weapons and modifications.Lovely atmosphere and exploration, great music, classic sci-fi themed tunes and great humor across the board. The game got its own style.Redone in full HD glory, with new tech support and insane ammounts of content over the course of 11+ years of updating, by loving developers and now, by a team of fans. Massive. Impressive and a true testament of a love for the game by Developers and Fans. Overall, a unique experience, highly recommended.			"

												Metascore of 68 is a joke.  They seem to be coming to the bizarre conclusion that most people playing this will have also played the (incredibly obscure) original Space Rangers, back in 2002 (Russia) or 2004 (w/ the, eh, ""somewhat decent"" English translation). Right.If you never played the original Space Rangers and don't mind a learning curve of a few hours, this ranks amongst the best of the genre.  The only gripe I had with it was that the land invasion missions tended to carry on late in the game (then again, I had already been playing something like 50-100 hours..).			"

												Space Rangers is at its basics an adventure/RPG set in space. The game is centered around a galactic struggle with a mechanized race known as the Dominators which showed up out of nowhere to give the five main galactic races a pounding. The Space Rangers are the first line of defense against these invaders and are pretty much an autonomous organization built as military and trade support. Players will need to climb up the Ranger ranks, gain new equipment, kill lots of dominators, help research thrive, and eventually take out the three main Dominator command units. How that happens is very open for interpretation.			"

												A good game overall, i've played the space rangers 1 and 2 and 2 is definitely worth your time and money.  A few new weapons and gear variants set this expansion/revamp apart from its predecessor, which allows you to give your ship a bit more flavor.  Being able to search for gear more effectively makes it INFINITELY easier to track down that better engine you'd otherwise spend hours planet-hopping to find. My only complaint is that they added a bunch of new planetary robot battles that were poorly thought out and wildly unbalanced.  These were my favorite part of space rangers 2, they were wildly lucrative, and with a careful hand, completely winnable.  This is not the case in the expansion, several of the maps i've played in (that i dont remember from previous playthroughs) are unwinnable in my opinion/experience.  You start out with absurdly limited resources and no defensible positions, or the map setup is such that what should be a free for all with 3 or 4 opponents ends up being everybody bumrush the PC.  Dealing with that kind of onslaught (30+ robots vs your max 8 or 9) early in a match isnt an issue of skill, its just poor design/planning.  Additionally, it seems to me that robot AI is even poorer than it was before the revamp; these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s cant fight their way out of a wet paper bag.  You cant depend on them to attack targets effectively, and they either stand around and refuse to help your controlled robot, or charge off and engage the enemy 2 screens away.  The kind of situation not conducive to keeping ones blood pressure in check.  Also, i feel the new pirate faction (which was an awesome idea) are very overpowered.  You can build a ship that can waltz into a dominator controlled system and ""liberate"" it solo, its not easy to put that ship together, nor cheap, but it IS possible.  The same cant be said for a pirate held system (in my experience so far, this could change) damn near every pirate ship comes equipped with missiles that will knock out all of your electronics (repair droid, shields, targeting, etc.). Obviously this makes killing anything a wee touch impossible.Overall a great game, but i feel that the revamp lost some of the polish of the original, and has some significant balance issues which, while avoidable, are detrimental to gameplay			"

												This is basically one of my favorite rpg's of all time, if not THE. why? i honestly don't know but let's try to find out...My first impression with the game came from a cracked release before even the steam version, as i heard the game's music (coolish electronic most of the time) it made me feel like i was 8, and playng with my amiga 500, graphics did the same (but don't let that fool you, while it looks oldschool it's wuite stylized). It was like the scene in rataouile when the food critic tries the peasant dish and it transfered him back on his childhood. so i gave it a long shot. so more about the game: It is a space open-universe rpg. you create a char from various classes and races, and you start. there are two basic plots in this edition, but you can follow your own path as well. you can get a party as you progress and theres a cool way of communication between pilots or other npc that makes it easy to control them. Mini game modes for planetary battles reminded me of Z but with customized mechs, text based quests such as prison escapes or even races (WIN-WIN MUD LOVERS) and an arcade style shooter in black holes. combat system is semi-turnbased, lots of little stuff to buy for your ship, lot's of ships, and many times many quests planets npc. Oh also you get to die in this game sometimes as well, it's THAT oldschool. Friends of true rpg or strategy games, space simers or simply rave-dancing drug abusers unite!!!			"

												I was introduced to Space Rangers 1 by my father, we sunk approximately 100 hours into it, he was staying up at night playing it. It was such a great game at the time! Space Rangers 2 managed to keep the feel of the first one, and add a bunch of other great stuff to it! This is a game made as a shared dream, it's made with love, you just can see the devs sitting there late at night brainstorming, adding everything they think they are capable of to the game.


YouTube™ Video: Under 5 Min Review: Space Rangers HD: A War Apart 

			Views: 24,541		

			Space Rangers HD is an awesome 2D tactical space sim that also includes a 2d arcade shooter, planetside RTS and text-based quest events.		

What you get when you buy this game: - A world, inhabited by 5 races, a world that doesn't really need you, as it can solve most of it's problems itself, sometimes even winning the game doesn't require your input. - A plethora of space quests: deliveries, bounty hunting, escorts, guarding a system, etc. - Space trading, that requires you to analyze the galaxy's markets and the margins you can profit on. - Turn-based space travel and combat, diplomacy even, there's usually several ways to resolve a conflict. - A 2D arcade space shooter. - Planetside RTS, around 40 different maps, 4 sides of the conflict, mech constructor, ability to take control of a mech individually in an FPS-like fashion. - Text-based quests, ranging from solving ancient mysteries, to exploring planets, to baking pizza or running a gaming magazine. - A lot of customization, you can improve your ship as new tech is researched and better devices are unlocked, and then improve some more by adding the artifacts, micromodules and science station upgrades. - A simple talent system, you can also level up your followers' or space stations' talents. - Diseases and stimulators - Great space themed music, although the compositions added in A War Apart are not as good as the original ones. The negative stuff: - Older graphics can be a turn off for a lot of people. - Most of the positive things were there before A War Apart, this rerelease just adds some more variety and feels very fan-made (and it partially is). - More scripted situations were added, and they seemed to crash me a lot. - Subpar A War Apart music. - Making the pirates a third force worked out in a strange way. A War Apart seemed rather raw to me, compared to the original SR2 and SR2: Reboot, if you can get either of those, then it's better to go for them. Rating it 8/10 - A strange iteration of a 10/10 game, no way to get the original off Steam though, so still worth it. "

												Overall, this game improved on a lot of the older glitches that occurred in the previous versions. I would say that most of the gameplay is still roughly the same, however, it is still the wait and see approach. Meaning you have to slowly build up your cash stack + artifact stack + micromodule stack + ship + equipment, before you're strong enough to solo. Cheats are severely nerfed in this version, so I suggest not using them. The planetary battles are fun, but some of the newer ones really just involve luck. However, you can get so much money from planetary battles at the end. I would rate it a 4.5/5.			"

												I'm really happy that they rereleased this game. It's getting new attention and the dev team has been consistantly patching and adding new features. This game if not familiar is a mashup of a bunch of mini games that complement eachother and work together to form a varied universe... Mostly varied anyway. At times you will be doing the exact same thing, but maybe the names and locations changed. That part of the game starts to get old. I do always seem to make my way back to this gem.The game that comes in to mind that would be more familiar to gamers is FTL, Faster Than Light. This game shares a lot of the same elements, but has a lot more going on, which isn't always better. It's also more of a time investment to complete a single playthrough. Like FTL this has roguelike elements and is randomly generated.Give it a try... bake a pizza that satisfizes every alien the universe has to offer while fighting off the machines trying to destroy it.

												Space Rangers is one of those bargain bin games that you stumble across then end up spending an unhealthy amount of time playing.It adds a lot of variation to the game with the many different types of ""minigames"" from your old school text based adventures, to RTS ground combat to turn based space combat. While the actually quality of the minigames are medicore, RTS ground combat is simple and the text based adventures can feel as if it turns into reading a novel, the ability to have have over the top adventures breaking out of prisons, searching for subs, piloting a fallin craft into orbit etc can make up for it.The game has a semi-serious with a decent amount of comedic events and references, as long as you don't require someone to tell you what to do being adventurous can allow many hours of gameplay with your selfmade goals created from the spur of the moment.3.5 out of 5 chiliwigs			"

												Unlimited freedom, sandbox and hardcore are the main features of the space simulator. Unlike typical representatives of this genre, ""Space Rangers"" - arcade simulator. If severe MMORPG ""EVE Online"" is necessary to consider the impact of each weapon on energy, the ""Space Rangers"" everything is easy - just watch the weight of the ship and, if possible, buy equipment easier and better.However, the arcade has never been synonymous with ""bad game."" On the contrary, Space Rangers became a successful for Russian Game Development. Both parts.Several years passed. Developer Studio collapsed. New OS, combined with the lack of support of the game, do SR unplayable. Is this the end? No. SNK-Games, a small modding studio, enlisting the support of publisher 1C, released a reissue of the game, ""Space Rangers HD: A War Apart"". Besides of removing technical flaws and achieving good optimization, they decided to surprise us with new content. First of all - pirates.Pirates are a new faction, a belligerent with the Coalition led by a mysterious leader. Pirates were in the original, but now they are joined together, and pose the same threat to the Coalition as Dominators. Unlike robots, in pirate space systems player can fly safety. Even if the player - the captain of the coalition forces. Become a pirate group is easy: just find any pirate base and adopt a ""special offer"". What will change? Nothing. Membership in the pirate gang has no advantages, though the hull as a present is really good (at the start of the game). But it's interesting.And. .. That's all. Yes, all new features are pirates, new text quests and new hulls. In all, this is the same Space Rangers 2. In 2013, with a good graphics and new content, but still the same. If you have never played SR/SR2, you must have. This game is worth the money. But those who have played in the second part can miss this. It'll be better to come back to the second part. The main thing is to run it on your computer. To honour of game, HD-Publishing has no problems with compability.7.0			"

												I still remember the day when I first heard of the Space Rangers series. It was 2002, the first chapter of the game came out just recently, and my school buddy and I spent days upon days discussing the weapon loadouts, strategies and ways to earn money. He even succeded in getting his father into it, and the old man became quite a prolific trader (unlike us, two 13-year old hotheads who saw piracy as the only valid way to play). Good old times... And ever since, in every patch, every expansion and the sequel, Space Rangers did their best to improve on the well-established formula.There isn't much to be said that hasn't been mentioned in the previous reviews already, so I'll just tell you why I love this game so much and keep playing its iterations even now, 14 years later. Space Rangers manage to be many things at once without donwgrading into mediocrity. The turn-based top-down space RPG is the ""main"" part, and there's enough diversity there already - it boggles my mind just to think of all the possible paths you can take, be it an explorer, a trader, a mercenary for hire or a nasty pirate. But there's also so much more to it than that! Arcade style combat in hyperspace, text-based quests that will make you grind your teeth trying to solve all the logical challenges, 3D real-time strategy with high-octane action and the ability to control your own individual units, turning the game into something akin to a third-person shooter... None of these constituents feel unpolished, none feel rushed or out of place. Add a good chunk of humour, magnificent music, gorgeous space sceneries and an insane variety of components, spaceships, artifacts and other neat little customization details, and you've got yourself a game that can be played forever without becoming boring.One final thing I'd like to mention is how SR2 (and all the rest of SR games, really) manages to be ""mathematically precise"", so to say. The galaxy you live in acts and develops in a very specific pattern - randomized every time, for sure, but still governed by procedural rules. I saw strategical geniuses who lured various factions of enemies into pre-determined sectors by the clever use of the in-game technology and formed a ""defensive"" belt around their inhabited systems by putting less-aggressive fleets closer to them. I looked in astonishment at how the great tactical minds of SR2 managed to free entire segments of the galaxy from aggressors while armed with nothing but a bunch of missile launchers and a small yet maneuvrable ship. I witnessed with my own eyes how experienced players figured out the procedures responsible for generating the quest rewards and comprised the ""schedules"" of the artifact rotation - something that allowed you to know exactly where to go for that particularly juicy reward when you need it.All in all, it's a great game and great concept, one of the reasons that I think so highly of the Russian gaming industry. It might be old, but it doesn't show any signs of aging, and with its high customization and astonishing variety it's a solid investment of your time and money.			"

												Simply put, this is the best game ever made.It tells a thoroughly entertaining story without big voice talent or ""epic"" writing. It looks pleasing to the eye even nearly a decade after its first release without making your GPU catch on fire or applying seventeen layers of bump mapping to every object. It lets you be all you can be and it never puts an invisible fence in your way. Its universe lives and breathes, not merely pretends to do so. Its gameplay manages to be complex without being complicated, intuituive without being dumbed down and have amazing variety without devolving into gimmicks. It's genuinely funny, it's endlessly replayable and it's increasingly more customizable.Space Rangers is a relic from the silver age of video games that reminds us all that the backing of a soulless juggernaut of a publisher, budgets larger than those of an average central African country and obsessive pandering to the vocal minority of the week do not make a great game. Talent and passion do. And Space Rangers, despite having been in the hands of no less than three different groups of developers, never had a shortage of either.			"

												Absolutely loved it. I didn't know what i was getting in to but 64 hours i'm just starting my second play-through. Like every space sim, SR HD involves grinding in one way or another. A fan of the genre would attest to it being part of the allure.  SNK games have managed to package up and streamline the grindy elements as well as possible and imo they've done a fantastic job.Enjoy the learning curve! If you're looking for a new space sim with varied mini games and activities then you've come to the right place.Unfortunately the RTS elements of this game could use a major polish, luckily you can opt out of them without totally ruining the experience.P.SThis is my first ever written review. First time i ever felt like leaving a review in the hopes that it would support these devs. A direct sequel would have a lot to live up to.			"

												A short and to the point review:I can not believe this game is still recieving updates. I have the original store bought versions of Space Rangers 1 and 2, I think I got them back in 07 or 08. And the game is now in the best shape it has ever been. Regualery updated and new content shows up every so often.Its immersive and expansive and can be severely difficult if you choose it to be so. Space Rangers HD is just.... Unique. You will not find another game like this anywhere, nor, will you find one as well maintained.There are text based quests, there are RTS based missions, there artifact hunting via scannable planets and moons, theres a living enviroment that moves on its own and interacts with everything around it.Space is alive and unexpected things will happen when you leave your planet and attempt to make your way to defeat the threat of AI controlled robot race that was to destory everyone. They capture their own systems, and will wipe you out if you let them.You could just choose to ignore them too and go about your buisness trading, and pirating or whatever Hans Solo attitude suits you.If you want an immersive space themed game with lots to do and customizable ships and weapons, then get it. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												Perfect blend of space simulator, RPG, FPS, real-time strategy, turn-based strategy, text quest and so on. Now, let's take a look at separate parameters of the game.Gameplay - 10/10You can do a lot! Universe is alive and noone in this game will tell you that you are ""the world saviour-superhero-lasthope"". If you want everyone to respect you have to work hard and do a lot of good (or bad, so that everyone is afraid of you). If you  play on the difficulty above high you will need to explore all different ways to earn money for leaving. And you also have planetary battles and text quests, which is like a game within a game. There is no way to explain all of it without writing a 1000+ symbols post.Music - 9/10Nothing special here, just a really good music which matches the game perfectly. I'm giving it 9 instead of 10 just because they change end credits song in this expansion, and it is worse in my oppinion.Graphics - 6/10Let's be honest, this game doesn't look good today, and didn't look good back in a day. Some people cannot play it because of that, but in my oppinion it's not terrible. On the other hand, this game will run on a very weak PC.Price-to-hours - 8/10Price can jump from one to another, but you can easily get 100+ hours on this game, so paying something around $15 is not that bad.Story - 7/10Story itself is not that interesting, but game world in general, with all the different races and history behind that. It also links perfectly to the previos chapter of the game, which you don't have to play, but just knowing that is pretty cool.In a summary, I'll definately recommend this game to you if you are a fan of sci-fi space RPG.

												Can't recommend it enough. It provides much more value than any other title in the same price range. (especially if it's on sale). Gameplay varies greatly: 1) Fighting (Turn based space combat, arcade black hole skirmishes, RTS planetary battles)2) Trading, albeit not very complex is still pretty decent for a quick buck here and there (and can be used to advance yourself further without firing a single shot). There's also a possibility of getting into jail (quite an adventure) for peddling banned goods.3) Questing like everything else in the game is optional and mostly consists of your usual fedex/kill/escort bs, but on occasion you can get a Text Quest or two, they are very well made and add much needed variety to the stale formula. 4) World feels alive for a change. NPCS are not relying on you to win (not completely anyway, though at harder difficulty things might get tricky) and can (and will) wage war on each other and dominators, succesfuly conquer systems, build bases, colonize worlds and such. You are just one of the rangers (there are many more roaming around, doing same things you do).5) Some light rpg elements are also in (though i guess it depends on what you consider to be an RPG, but w/e), xp, skills, promotions, various gear, usable limited items.Still looks good, even though its fairly old. (Planetary battles on other hand are not very pretty, but you can opt-out of them whenever you want).Don't look at my 'hours played'. I own a cd copy and clocked in a few hundred hours out over the years. "

												Really great classic nostalgia here. The old time graphics are the only hump to get past. Once you do, you'll enjoy (what feels like) endless gameplay. Game has multiple ways to play and multiple endings. The only downside is that you can't really ignore enemies for long and just have fun trading goods or exploring planets. It has a nice array of text adventures that is a really great throwback to even older gaming.			"

												Long time ahead, in the Milky way galaxy there were Rangers, Dominators, Pirates and space... Discover, fight, trade, upgrade, quest for and have pure fun.Great 2D gameplay with:
2D space roaming; lots of beautifully drawn backgrounds - systems, suns, planets, asteroids, ships, personalities; no campaign, just general optional goal of fighting ""dominators"" and many side quests including the big one for pirates; the giant world that lives without you - the AI could even free all systems from dominators for itself (you will wait for looooong though); scientists deliver new equipment types, pirates/dominators/rangers free and lose star systemslots of ships with upgrade possibilities - change guns, engines, radars, etc. (you need to wait till local scientists invent new types though ;) ); experience and skills; five playable races and possibility to switch for a price in game - some quests are available only for specific race; create your own fly-squad inviting other pilots; be a pirate/hero/trader/all-at-once.CHERRY ON THE PIE TOP: full 3D planetary battles where you can construct your robots from available parts, capture the resource plants and enemy bases;And last but not least. The game is full of good old text quests of unbelievably high quality: IMHO those make the entire game so special. You will have to successfully manage mountain resort, win the speeder race, gather a band and play the rock concert, participate in the ""Tornament for office managers"", become a truck driver and carry out the spy operation - several dozens of such quests with lots of humor and joy.Do I recommend this game? Oh yes, I do.P.S. The game is originnaly in russian and text quests originate in this language - it is a great possibility for those, who want to study russian as you will have 150 % pleasure in this case (well, if not - no problem either, the translation is not so bad after all).

												When I saw the new Space Rangers HD game, immediately wanted to buy the game and evaluate innovations in relation to the old version of the game. I am a veteran of the Space Rangers serie, I played hundred hours of first and second parts of the game, so I can say that I am disappointed by this re-issue of the game.   Rather than create something new in the game – the developers, frankly, went most wrong way – they made totally endless game: previously, one game took on average 30-40 hours, and most high rank of ranger warrior class I have after whipped around 300 spaceships; but now I kill 900 spaceships for the highest rank, and the game took about 80-90 hours.   The only significant innovation – the emergence of a new faction – pirates. The presence of this faction – is primarily an attempt to make life easier for players, which play for pirate or corsair class.   The situation with game – save the game community – thanks to it, was added a large number of different content, such as empire ship from Star Wars, or the ship ""Normandy"" from Mass Effect games; all this game community solutions make Space Rangers HD more diverse. 7/10			"

												Its is good game slight upgrage from original SR2, but the pirates makes it more dynamic and harder. You really can stay neutral for the defeat of the Dominators but you can fight with the pirates or coalition which is more dangerous enemy (normal difficulty). The game can be sometimes frustraiting to do some bidding. For example killing keller in hyperspace.+New equipment with that affects other load+New faction you can switch between factions to make game more interesting and create one more hostile faction-can be sometimes really frustraiting like hunting some ♥♥♥♥-I hate the amount of missiles that the dominator uses.the planetary battles i awful i didnt done them (but you are fine without them)also the game is long one			"

												This game doesn't feature billions of randomly generated planets. It doesn't have elegant ship controls. It doesn't have epic 3D space battles spanning hundreds of ships. Yet this is, hands down, the best space game I've ever played.Featuring RPG, turn-based strategy, 4X, text adventure and RTS elements, Space Rangers: A War Apart provides an endlessly changing universe where you can truly do whatever you'd like. You can be a brave warrior, fighting an endless war against the enemies of the Coalition. You can be a tycoon, using the interstellar economy to make huge profits. You can be a mercenary, drifting through the universe and engaging with alien life in many interesting interactions and quests. Or you could turn rogue, join the pirate fleet and prey on unsuspecting civilians for their loot. (For the first few hours, you're going to be a delivery boy, though.)So come on and join the ever-growing ranks of the Space Rangers and begin your journey to become the best Ranger who ever lived. The Coalition needs you!			"

												So most of my friends will note that I don't make a lot of recommendations for things.  It's not my style to recommend.  That being said, this game hit on all the right notes for me.  The little aspects of trading, the little quirks with the A.I., the ridiculous adversity that is the main antagonist(s), the two little bonus games are great and helpful, but strictly bonus (and very likely to beat you.)For people who like trading simulators (but not specifically trading empire simulators), I'd recommend this one.  For people who like a little bit of classic injected into their games, I'd recommend this.  And for those who just want to break out of the mould and shoot everything in sight?  Well, it's likely to be short-lived, but play this anyway.			"

												One may be a bit suspicious that the game advertises so many features, but it does execute them very well.First off, I recommend reading the only english speaking guide as a good primer on what settings make a good beginner game. Also, sell your starting shields (if your ship has any) because they are complete crap that takes up too much space at the beginning. Shields in this game only block percent damage, and starting shields block next to nothing. Missiles/frag cannons are very good weapons early to mid, though missiles must be manually reloaded. Finally, find a pirate base and join them for a free, VERY good ship. It doesn't matter if you don't want to go pirate, you can always go grab the ship and just fight dominaors for pirate favor/backstab them and hunt them down. Ironically the one segment of the game that is the most obviously advertised, space combat, is also the most infuriatingly obtuse to figure out without the help of a guide or google.Starting tips aside, the trading in this game is dynamic and well done. Planets each start with governments/econmies that are geared towards importing/exporting certain goods, and events such as famines, pandemics, or a change of government will occur that shake up prices. One can make a fairly good amount of money by keeping check of the news and moving large quantities of goods in a freigher. you can own multiple ships, so if you have a fancy fighter you can just park it on the planet.Speaking of which, in the lower left tab quests, assets, and any news blurbs you flagged are kept there for your future reference, making it easy to keep track of assets you store on different planets/stations, or where you were supposed to ship your cargo hold full of medical supplies.Quests are offered at government centers on each planet, and are by and large FedEx delivery missions. Asking for easier/harder missions only affects the amount you earn and the amount of time to complete the delivery. You are paid whenever you complete a delivery, making it very easy to simply FedEx you way into riches (if you have the patience)Some quests end up turning into text adventures (and are usually indicated rather obviously as not your standard delivery). Judging by the ones I've played, the text adventures are rather well done and fair. In the event of player death or failure, you are rerolled back in time to try again/give up whenever you want.The RTS segments are somewhat simplistic, with the complexity coming in purely through how you choose to build your combat units. Simplistic doesn't mean bad however, and for the most part they were rather fun. With the glaring exception of several missions that are hellishly difficult.What I find most attractive about the game is its sense of immersion. Events happen around the player, and it is up to them how to respond. The Coalition, Pirates, and Dominators will all launch attacks/defend star systems, other Space Rangers will fly around doing their thing, more Rangers will be recruited to expand/replace losses. Research into better technology will happen (and can be funded by the player), militaries will build new ships/garrison systems (can also be funded), and overall it gives of a good sense of ""Hey, you aren't the only hoshot out there getting things done"". Heck, on the easier difficulties, the Coalition (the rather obvious good guys) can very well defeat both their enemies without any player intervention. (It will be a VERY long game, with the player doing absolutely nothing in the mean time)			"

It boasts fun gameplay, a sense of humor, multi-genre gameplay, procedural genearation, warring factions and an interesting story.

												I replay this game every once in a while. Don't go into it thinking that you will be able to win fights right off the bat. It takes a while to build up to it. -the puzzle/text based quests are my favorite part-the realtime strategy missions progressively get harder but are super fun-I have never played another game with so many different modes (text based puzzles, rts, arcade style shooter, turn based strategy)The only con this game has is that it is translated from russian and sometimes the things people say don't make a lot of sense.

												Guys, if you haven't nominated any games in the recent Steam Awards, give this game a chance at ""Game Within A Game""!Space Rangers HD has so much mini-games in the game, it's the only game worthy of this title! Inside a seemingly sandbox space RPG are Real Time Strategy planetary battle, text quests, and mini shooter game!---Several game types all packed into one great game.+ Combines several game genres including turn-based space combat / trading, text quests, and planetary RTS battles, all merged flawlessly+ Except the main component (turn-based space combat) all others are (kind of) optional+ A variety of difficulty choices: you can even customize parts of game components such as quest difficulty and enemy strength+ Customizing your ship with random loots is fun+ Ability to interact with (and even command) some NPC ships+ Lively world that would work itself out, even without your input. NPCs go about their businesses that can have as much impact to the world as the player.+ Despite the seemingly simple combat mechanic, those with a tactical mind can still gain an edge- AI could use some work, but has improved quite a bit since release- Outdated (but workable) 2D graphic- Text quests is sometimes confusing due to poor translation (even though it has been improved over the previous release)Now if further improvement to AI is implemented...

												 This game is an amalgam of Ur-Quan Masters, text adventure games, space sims and RTS. The main game is a space sim: you're taking control of a space ship in a semi-turn-based 2D space environment. You can fight, trade, hire companions and do various tasks like patrolling sectors or delivering valuable goods. You can also enter black holes, which changes the game to an Ur-Quan-esque arcade shooter. Sometimes the quests you get on planets or stations are text adventures or RTS missions of varying difficulty. Some are balls-bustingly hard. Space Rangers is self-conscious, funny — hope they didn't lose their jokes in translation — and most importantly, Space Rangers is thoroughly enjoyable in every facet.			"

												I have played this game for years without steam, and this I can tell you:this game can keep you playing for a bit, you have many things to do, like keeping the Coalitions planets alive and modernize your ship buying new equipment and example for that you need to earn some money :D and raising the galaxies tech-lvl by defending the right planets.It is a game for casual gamers for it is easy to learn and you can easily see all weapons damge, shield strength and stuff,but is also a game for advanced players and hardcore players,here are some points that may catch your interest or dissapoint you, but will defenitly help you making your mind:Graphics and planetbattles:-complete graphic is in 2D-only planet battles are in old 3D but they are very very F.U.N. for your robots are super stupid if not controlled by player, planet battles are a kind of having fun and seek you strategy to win while you struggle with the nutty of all the robots at the battle (Dominator Robots are also stupid) (I personally love love love the planetbattles, they are awesome!)-at planet battles you have to plan your behavior very very for there are 4 kind of resources and you can easily run out of them, but there are robots to repair bases and so it won't become to hard to at least stay alive-you don't have to take planetbattles! it is additional, you will receive a lot of XP and cash and special equipment and honour for winning them-you can restart a battle if it doesn't walked well or you just see a better way of winning one-10/10 for they are awesome!Graphics and textmissions:-there are also textmission, in fact they are a lot of text!!!-most of them you don't have to take, BUT one of them you have to take, will explain later-there are always some very very nice pictures beside the text, so that you always will have at least a small idea of what is happening, and these pictures are very well made-IT IS IN ENGLISH! (or russisch if you want)-you will always have a lot of oppurtunities and you can make your own way through the mission-some missions are very very funny and all of them are charming-they will catch your mind and may bring you to smile :D-it is like a story written in a book, but you will be influencing it so so so the whole time-BUT IT IS A LOT OF TEXT, AND IT IS IN ENGLISH, very very well written and with a lot of vocabular used!!! BUT IT IS A LOT OF TEXT-there are very much textmissions that you don't have to take BUT IF YOU GOT CAPTURED AS AN CRIMINAL then you come to prison, what is in fact a textmission and this can be very very annoing if you don't want to play a textmission in this moment.-but a good point is ; ) there will be space-races, pizza-championchips, and robot-fightings, and politian-meetings and xD super-spy and save-the-nature textmissions and all of them can be realy fun, if you like to make a textmission at this moment, as I said, super cool books, written by you, and they will be rewarded like planet-battles-BUT IT IS A LOT OF ENGLISH!(10/10) for it is very well made, but this doesn't mean that it is nice to play or I recommend this pointdifficulty, tutorial, keys, GENERAL:-The difficulty, and galaxie-settings are full controlable and you can set them before your game starts, this will influence the way of playing AND the points you got for your 'ranking'/'Rangerranking' directly and you will have to start a new game if you wanna change the difficulty. There are settings like strength of enemys, difficulty of Hyperwarp-battles (is like a fast 2D-shooter and blow your mind up), intelligence of the scientist, durability of the equipment, luck of the player (wich will defenitly help you in the whole game, especialy in prison), quality of buyable equipment, difficulty of missions all in all and more, there is always a 'easy' mode a normal, hard, and very very hard,also there is a Hardcore mode for the Hardcore once of us.-There is a very good tutorial wich want to activate itself in the first dialogue after start a new game, you can skip it by saying: ""No I already know everything.""  xD-In Fact in the whole game is a lot of english text so this may won't be your game-In Fact all texts are very funny and always glitter in very well written english, so you may easily can improve your english if you got a dictionary by hand xD-the keys are well placed, but till now I didn't found that they where changeable, so I guess it is just not possible.last words:In general it is a very very fine game with many stuff to master and also easy enough for casual gamers or beginners, it may has not the future-effects of modern games, but it is charming, funny and will keep you playing for some time. especially the mix of the game, there is the standart and then the speciall-stuff (planet-battles,textmission,hyperwarp-fights) are realy working this out!And there are so many hidden Jokes and so many crazy stuff, you will see what I mean, this is realy A Game and worth of playing.I got one hidden hint for you. The pirates banner say:Vigeneré! <-hm???jrihm vhkwitb cwbmt <-hahahaUnification <-with a key symbol??xD and the hidden message is:Unificationpeace through power!And there is a lot more to dicover, awesome!

												A really great RPG experience. The universe is huge and the new additions of the HD version make the game a lot more interesting. The game is however, nothing for graphics junkies: Spacebound action looks okay, nothing special, its perfectly playable, but dont expect much. There are also a lot of text-based quests. They are really a great and at times hilarious read if you give them a chance, often they are also really tricky and demanding.The real strength of this game lies in its incredible strategic depth. You will have a great fun upgrading your equipment, searching for new weapons etc. If you are not a fan of this, you should reconsider, as you will spend a lot of time doing exactly that. The game also has a unique sense of humour, that however doesnt degrade the atmosphere at all (for example a quest where you have to deliver an old MS Windows Version to some planet). Combat is turn-based and in my opinion incredibly well done, as it allows for a lot of tactical possibilities, while being fast paced and satisfying aswell.Also the world is extremely open, you can choose from five races, you can be a pirate, a merchant, a fighter, whatever you want. You can visit any planet you want, you can look for secret equipment on unpopulated planets with research probes, you can explore black holes, which throw you into an oldschool arcade shooting style world, IMO great fun.You can defeat the different dominator races in a multitude of different ways, you can support the governments in many different ways. You can be a lone wolf, or you gather the strongest rangers you can find under your command. Theres just so many ways to play this game.The only two drawbacks that I can think of: The pirates are somewhat overpowered if left on normal pirate aggression. I recommend tuning them down a little in the advanced difficulty settings (thats right, the game allows you to adjust the difficulty of pretty much anything in it seperately). They are more like some super-well financed, organized cyber-rampage crew, rather than a bunch of outlaws.The second problem is that you now have to repair dominator weapons with nodes. This is on one hand really annoying, on the other hand somehow fair, because they are really, really strong.The game has a steep, but fair learning curve and a lot of replayability value. I highly recommend it.			"

												Space Rangers HD has been a great surprise for me ever since I played this back in 2008. I've never touched a space sim in my life, and boy, did this game opened my eyes. From charting uninhabited space to getting bullied by pirates, and finally one-upping them and at last facing against the three mighty AI's bent on civilization's destruction: this game rarely disappoints and bores.And it's not just a space sim: there are text quests which are quite entertaining. The one I've really enjoyed was the bathysphere quest. There are also RTS quests, but I'd rather say it is quite underwhelming, probably the weakest aspect of the game for me. But if you enjoyed Warcraft 2 or the original CnC, you might find some enjoyment out of it.Everything in the game seems to just fit in place. A true triumph of Russian gaming. You'd be a fool not to get this game.			"

												Space Rangers 2 is one of the best games no one seems to know about. A weird mixture of 4X, RPG, text adventure and RTS with what's arguably, even now several years after the original release, the most impressive example of dynamic universe changing and evolving regardless of the player input.A War apart is just an updated version of the original that doesn't seem to add much, but since as far as I can tell this is also the only version of the game available right now on Steam, it's easy to suggest it to anyone new to the franchise. Don't be fooled by the mixed reviews, most likely focused on the lack of significant improvements over the vanilla game.This is a criminally overlooked masterpiece.			"

												Note that I have never played any of the other Space Ranger games before I played this on Steam.A truly remarkable game with many options and choices, deep and interesting mechanics and simulation with a very unique gear system. Every other coalition/pirate ship out there follows similar rules as you. Think they are being overpowered? You can do that, too! Their hull, their equipment... it is all highly varied and customizable.In short, you start out a nobody in a galaxy with tier 1-2 gear available. You run some measly errands or try to make a profit with goods until your equipment is up to par with the latest tier currently available (increases over time up to 8, one of the wonderful things of this game) after which you can start picking fights. Note that on higher difficulties progression is VERY hard, with the coalition losing ground rapidly (because all Rangers lack the experience/gear to fight Dominators effectively until around tier 5+). The few negative complaints I have seen mostly revolve around either the lack of information when starting out (read the tips at the bottom bar!) or because they cannot win alone against 5+ ships following similar rules as yourself (doh!). But the fun part is, that there is almost always more to discover, some mechanic you did not know about, some option you did not try... Just remember the game auto-saves every time you leave a planet/station, and you can load this (bottom save) when you screw up and get your ship blown up. You know, for all those times you think you can take on that wretched pirate that tries to rob you ;)Despite some minor issues with English, I'd still give this game the full 10/10.Especially since it's relatively cheap, but then you don't exactly get the latest in graphics either.

												Space Rangers 1 and 2 are two of my favorite pc games, perhaps my favorite space-themed game. This game is an HD reboot of Space Rangers 2 with an enhanced pirate faction. It is every bit as fun as the original Space Rangers 2, just with better graphics and a more powerful pirate faction. The game is two parts turn-based tactical space combat, one part text adventure, and one part rpg with a tacked-on rts-style sidequest that occasionally pops up for good measure. Some of the quests actually require a bit of intelligent thought to solve (or else trial and error). In addition to blowing up enemy ships, interstellar trade, drug and contraband smuggling, collecting loot, and buying better ships and equipment, there are a huge variety of frequently humorous sidequests ranging from helping to destroy the last copy of the ""Windows"" virus that wreaked havoc on computers in the 20th century, managing an interstellar resort,  to actually becoming a small alien rodent. 9/10			"

												Awesome game, with a decent learning curve.  I didn't play any of the previous Space Ranger games, but apparently this was an olderish game, that was remade (think GOTY edition) with a lot of added features (I think Pirate Faction is new) based on the guides I've read.I've had a ton of fun playing this game.  Its full of surprises.  There are different types of missions.  RTS (Command and Conquer / Starcraft base building) missions -- These are pretty rare.  The RTS isn't anything special, the ai is terrible, but its a fun change of pace.  Typically if you can survive the first 3-5 minutes of one of these matches, its a guaranteed victory.Courier missions, are the majority of what you do early on.  Go here with this -- and you're giving the option of how long you want to do it in.  The faster you get it there the more money you make, but you have to choose this at the get go.  If you take too long, you fail and get nothing, and you ♥♥♥♥ off the people/planet who you were working for.  Expect to 'save scum' a lot.There are also, assassinate missions -- These are often pretty hard solely because they usually want you to kill pirates, and unless you have massive damage / fast ship, the enemy will just fly off and land on a planet.  (I really wish there was some sort of -- land on planet with them, and convince the government to turn the person over to you, so you can kill / bring them in) -- or if you are supposed to go kill someone, and they are in jail.  You have to pay to bail them out of jail, then they fly off scott free, then you have to chase them down to try and kill them.  Kinda dumb.  Really missed an opportunity there.  -- Let me pay a little extra... maybe under the table... and this guy will just disappear, ya know?Escort / System Defense. -- Make sure this guy doesn't die for x number of turns, or make sure no ships (merchant etc) get destroyed by pirates for x number of turns.  These are the most boring imo, at least with courier missions you can stop at planets along the way and make some money.All in all, its a great older gen game, with surprising a lot to offer.PS -- Good luck finding an updated 'guide' to this game that's not in Russian though.This is the closest thing I've found, and its missing a ton of stuff.

												As far as 2D space sims go, I would vote Space Rangers to be the best of all time, even better than Star Control 2.Space Rangers offer a great variety of gameplay: combat, trading, piracy, exploration, salvaging, upgrading ship and skills, text adventures, planetary battles, arcade minigame. There is always something to do, and all playstyles blend nicely together for a complete and satisfying game experience.This game has a living and breathing world, where every NPC has a purpose. Traders carry goods from one planet to another, pirates try to convince them to offload those goods to them, diplomats and transports fly between planets doing diplomat-y and transport-y stuff (gameplay-wise, they are either used by pirates to extort money, or fight the said pirates). There are also rangers, like yourself, who can be pirates, or traders, or warriors, and who behave accordingly. Each of these NPCs is persistent, which means they don't just disappear forever when you leave their star system. In fact, you can use the in-game search functionality to track any NPC across the galaxy, by simply typing its name (you could even play it as a stalking simulator).I want to mention that Space Rangers have a very flexible game difficulty setting. On the lower difficulties, your enemies don't control many star systems, so you can freely fly across the galaxy, trading and completing government missions. On the highest difficulty, the enemies control most star systems, and you are left with half a dozen (or less) systems that you can visit without getting annihilated by a swarm of enemies within a minute. This adds a kind of ""fighting a losing war"" desperation feeling, when you must fight for the very survival of your species, which I personally find enjoyable.If you are not averse to the idea of turn-based space battles occuring on a 2D plane, you should definitely give Space Rangers a try. And even if you are averse to 2D space battles, Space Rangers HD offer the option to play text adventures, planetary battles and arcade fights separately from the main game, so you can buy it just for that. Speaking of additional content, this game also includes a MP3 soundtrack (no DLC necessary) with 33 awesome space-themed tracks - you can find them in the ""Soundtrack"" folder in the game's installation directory.P.S. ""Space Rangers HD"" is actually an updated version of ""Space Rangers 2"". If you, like me, prefer to play games and watch movies starting from the first part, there is also ""Space Rangers 1"", which you can probably find somewhere on the Internet (it's not on Steam, sadly). It's a bit rougher around the edges than the second part, but it still possesses the same qualities that make it a great game.			"

												The main reason I am not reccomending is for two reasons. The first is that pirates and the weapons Lirecron and Esogapher are completely OVERPOWERED. After spending 60 hours in game with the best ship possible I am still UNABLE to defeat them. As things stand the only way to combat the pirate threat since you can't engage them yourself is to fund the construction of warships. In other words you need to take it upon yourself to construct the military fleets of the ENTIRE UNIVERSE since the creators of this game had the brilliant idea of creating weapons that can shut down all of your systems. You've created the best defensive ship in the game? A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your shields and negate your cladding. You've got the most offensively capable ship in the game? A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your weapons radar and scanner. You are now unable to shoot weapons.Maybe you've got the fastest hull in the game. A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your engines leaving you dead in the water for pirates to prey upon. In my current game pirates have taken over the vast majority of coalition systems and I am powerless to stop them despite having the best ship in the game Who's IDIOT idea was it to give the pirates a weapon that negates every possible in game advantage. This is not even mentioning the Esophager which has similar negative effects. Furthermore the additional content is fairly horrible. It consists of a few more text adventures and a few more hulls. The new text adventures are needlessly opaque. I was trying to take the direction that would allow me to get rid of the pirates but ended up becoming their leader and helping them win against the coalition. Pirates are the most OP faction in existence for reasons mentioned earlier. In Space Rangers 2 reboot eventually you would be able to take out entire military fleets by yourself but the advent of the Lirecron makes that impossible. The second reason I am not reccomending this game is that the creators have nerfed all end game content. Space Rangers 2 reboot had 3 beautiful unique ships obtainable in the end game. If you enable these ships in Space Rangers HD you are unable to get achievements. Furthermore they have nerfed all end game content. Shield generators now have a maximum of around 50-55 percent whereas in Space Rangers Reboot you could have 87 percent. The default version of the game does not include the unique ships from reboot which are infinitely better than any of the new hulls. The third reason I am not reccomending this game is that all of the problems that existed in Space Rangers Reboot exist in Space Rangers HD. Repair costs are still way too high and nothing is done to negate this. With end game gear expect repairs to cost 300000 credits which is a small fortune. The only means of earning enough money in the end game to offset these costs are planetary battles which is a trial in and of itself. Every time I a planetary battle mission instead of seeing it as an opportunity to earn 10+ million credits I see it as an extreme annoyance especially since so many of the maps are poorly thought out.Good micromodules like Universe and Shell are still impossible to get leaving intact the previous crappy system of getting micromodules. Furthermore the good micromodules like Panzer and Broing have been nerfed and instead of giving 16 cladding the Space Rangers HD equivalent of the panzer now gives only 8 cladding. Good points:There are some good points to Space Rangers HD. I like the idea of weapon modifications. Also some of the new gear is decent like nanobrolite engines or upgraded shield generators.I like the new bertor dominators since dominators were ridiculously easy in space rangers reboot. Now they have adequate difficulty because of the new bertors.However in spite of some steps forward the fact that Pirates are totally game breaking is a major leap back. There are three versions of this game. Space Rangers 2, Space Rangers 2 Reboot, and Space Rangers HD. The one I would recommend is Space Rangers Reboot. Fixing this game so that it would be the best of the three is easy. Just get rid of the Lirecron and Esophager or give the player some means of defense against these weapons. As things stand pirates are way too OP. They can shut down all of your systems relatively easily and the coalition can't stand against them without regular investments in new military vessels. These issues NEED to be fixed. "

												I have played the previous version - SR 2 with Reboot DLC for almost 3 months straight. I have recently went back to ""A War Apart"" after some time and I'm shocked that it still has updates and new content is released. It's an awesome game. There are so many options to choose from and the game has replayability. Although I don't do planetary wars quests - I just don't feel them (though I like RTS games) - yet still I find a lot to do in game. If you like Space sims/rpg you will definitely love it :)			"

												I've been playing Space Rangers for many years - i even remember playing its first part in school. Looking from the retrospect i can say that Space Rangers 2 made a great progress. A lot of new things were added, at least new equipment, battles on planets, an ability to choose any of the game's text quests for re-passing, the coalition of pirates and even an ability to choose any side of the opposition. Its graphics is simple, but well designed, so it looks very nice. Your eyes will have a rest while looking at it. I liked its musiс set very much too, and it doesn't differ from the 1st part very much - i've noticed just some changes in tone and that's all. But it doesn't mean that some new pieces of music were not added. I should mention its manner of text presentation. While reading just try to stay calm, because the texts are composed in a humorous way. When i was trying to play its text quests for the first time, my sister wondered what had happened and i asked her to come. We, two adults, were laughing as children. The humor is really Russian, but this humor is simple and it will make you happy. The only thing which makes me melancholy is the critics' rate of this game, though it has a lot of positive recalls, given by the players - much more than some modern ""best sellers of the game industry"". Do you need a game, which will make think how to earn your living? Do you like space? Do you want to have a good time? Don't be afraid to buy this game.10 stools out of 10			"

												Excellent game, warts and all.  My only real complaint are about the text quests, some of which are capriciously random (I'm looking at you, fishing quest!).  The rest of the game is quite fun, so long as you keep in mind that the universe is not a nice place and if you ♥♥♥♥ off certain factions it has a noticeable impact on galactic events.Edit: The game also has the npcs keep up with your tech level, so if you upgrade several pieces of gear, expect the npcs to gain better shields or weapons (in my case, it typically shields, which made chasing pirates a chore).

												I love Space Rangers 2. You can be a pirate, a trader, a bounty hunter, its wide open. And it doesn't matter what your starting stuff is, you can still be anything.  As you get more advanced, the search feature in this game becomes very useful, you can search out rare equip, or prices on goods, etc. This is a redone version with added content, added equipment, quests, etc. It also has added graphical features, and more. NOTE! Seriously, the RTS part of this game just plain sucks. Which is why they allow you to skip it. I believe all RTS elements in the game are skippable, or you can decline the missions with them. You will hate the game if you play the RTS part. Thats NOT what this game is about. Try a single RTS mission if you want to see, but don't judge this game from the RTS part.Great game overall. If you still aren't sure, watch a youtube of some actual gameplay.			"

												Space Rangers is one of those games that over the last 7-8 years of knowing about it, that I can always go back to and enjoy. In my opinion it is the absolute best sandbox space sim that's ever been made. To enjoy it you have to be able to create your own adventures because there is no structured plot. It's all emergent in play.			"

												1C - First, I'm the first to say that many of their titles are ambitious and most fall short. Most of 1C games lacks polish or efforts to just make it right. All great ideas, very poor execution or QA to some extent. However, Space Rangers HD is a gem out of the failed attempts. It's really good and when it drops on specials like ""right now"" it is completely worth it. The game is hard and you'll get into situations where it's basically game over, nothing you can do... Still, when you do get through these hard challenges, it is satisfying. This game does not forgive and in my case forget ""SCREW YOU RANGER BANDAK!!!!"" - This dude keeps popping up trying to kill me... :( Anyway, a great space RPG that completely kicks the butt of anything recent.

												Space Rangers combines a unique set of games - to the point where you can't actually call it a Turn-based strategy game, Real-time strategy game, adventure, action, simulation... in the vein of much older games like Sid Meier's Pirates!, it has a core game that is turn-based strategy with a half-dozen smaller games included.  Players can choose multiple violent paths to fame and fortune, or even track and predict market variability in an effort to make money through trading.The whole is even greater than the sum of its parts, and the remake introduced a third faction and an improved translation to the mix.  Highly recommended!			"

 Quick Summary  A Space exploration, action, RTS, Text-adventure filled space adventure. The only REALLY GOOD Space game that 1c has ever put on steam. The Summary You know... OUT of ALL the 1c games I bought from their space fi bundle... This made it worth it. The universe revolving around you... watching as a reaper like menace is taking over your galaxy, the universe has about a million npcs floating and moving about, conducting trade, business, pirating, looting, and fighting. You can be really what ever you want. Want to be a fearsome pirate? Be one. Want to be a heavility protected Transport? Be one. Want to be a science ship looking for life in the galaxy? You can do that ♥♥♥♥ too... ! The game's multiple civilizations have their own personalities for each planet, and conduct their own research against this alien invasion from another galaxy (Sort of like mass effect, again) and you or well, everyone else in the galaxy must unify to stop this threat. (Once again, like mass effect) You of course, don't have to actually help, and watch your galaxy eithier being dominated, or liberated. PROS: Galaxy feels alive, simulated economy, faction wars, new research always being discovered and generated, every ship in the galaxy has it's own task, and personality. +++History is always being recorded! Watch as the galaxy news, or just NPC's converse about the recent events in either the local area, or how the Reaper menace's situation is currently going. Hear about the lastest news that the Galaxies biggest fleet was just annihiliated in an attempt to push back the aliens forces! +Your not Commander Sheperd! Your just another speck floating around in space! Will you be a soldier aiding against this reaper menace? Or watch the galaxy slowly be consumed? It's your choice. +Exploration is kind of fun, does feel a little dull... +Multiple random text adventure games brought through quests, like going to prison. ++RTS mode, though a little basic, it's still lots of fun! ++ Neutral: Soundtrack is pretty generic..? CONS: Ugh, Ship combat. ---Trade Grinding, though optional, can quickly make the game too easy. -Would've liked to have seen some voice acting, so I don't have to read walls of text each time I conduct trade, get missions, conduct research, etc. -- Conclusion? 8/10. One of my most favorite Space Sims.Space Rangers HD is a well-done Space Trading, pirating, researching, president running, planetary RTS, prison shanking, reaper menace filled game that is full of potential, and has been getting updates occassionally. (Hopefully this continues! I love the new updates Devs! Keep it up!)			"

												A blast from the past of my own childhood. I loved the entire Space Ranger series as a whole and used to play it non-stop. I loved the game so much and I still love it to this very day.The soundtrack is simply masterful, especially the Human theme which just rings of glory and sadness at the same time. I used to spend hours just docked on any Human colony world just listening to that theme song, refusing to take off even to defend the system from Klissans, Dominators and Pirates.Now, the game itself is based around a group of non-military volunteers called ''Rangers'' who are tasked with defending the Interstellar Coalition of Five Races (Humans, Gaal, Faeyans, Maloq and the Pelengs) from any threat that may threaten their security. The Rangers are each their own general, their own corporation or bank and can hire other Rangers to work under their command. In this game, there are tons of ways to improve your combat capabilities, and also tons of ways to just play the game. You can be a Warrior, a Mercenary, a Merchant, a Corsair or a Pirate and just play for as long as you want in a single playthrough. They're literally unlimited.In the end, this game would probably get a 10 out of 10, but the overall lack of variation between planets and the top-down gameplay is severely lowering the score, HOWEVER, it doesn't impact on the overall game as it's still a perfect space sim of its time and for those who want to await a better one similar in style to this one, but without the top-down limitation.

												Have all of the to date iterations of Space Rangers 2; HD, Reboot, and Rise of the Dominators.   They all have varying tweaks/differences  that make them worth playing, especially if you  get 'em on sale.  Thank goodness for developers with OCD.  Don't care that much for the planetary battles so I avoid them after the first (requirement for recruit training and nets easy early experience/cash).   This relatively inexpensive series is definitely a keeper.   Gotta give it a strong 84/100, imho.			"

												Space Rangers HD: A War Apart... What can i say about this? its nearly perfect even on the lowest settings this game manages to be incredibly beautiful, with beautiful backgrounds and wonderfully rendered objects, and the RTS missions still look decent even after so many years. The soundtrack is a marvel of making electronic sound feel natural and wonderful, it fits with every situation your in to a terrifying degree, i could get lost in time just listening to this atmospheric yet melodic soundtrack.But whats all that if the gameplay  inst good? Well im glad to say that the gameplay is done splendidly, all modes in the game are well programmed and the controls feel natural to use, and the primary game mode (the one where you fly your ship and do whatever) doesn't get old. granted, i only said NEARLY perfect, there are noticeable translation quirks that might bother some people, and the game can crash if your not careful (or if you run it on the highest settings, regardless of how powerful your PC is, personally, mine is more than capable of running this, but even then problems happen) (BONUS: if your a lore-nut like me, then you'll be pleased to know this game has a good story and lore)OVERALL:8.5/10 (i'd give it a 9 or a 9.5 if they made it somehow perform better even on higher end systems) "

												When I was young, there was a mouse-driven space game called Escape Velocity. That game and its sequels was awesome and I poured hours into it.Space Rangers is like a modern, even more awesome (if possible) take on EV. It is hands down the coolest top-down space game Ive ever played. There is something for all sci-fi lovers. Trading, fights, arcade sequences, RTS, combat, story, dynamic worlds and planetary movement (youd be surprised how many top down space games have stationary planets). Everything. I haven't played the originals, so I cant compare the two. The only thing I dont like is that the Pirate faction seems kind of OP, but you can turn their aggression down iin the fully-customizable difficulty and game-play menu. That is an awesome feature, being able to control nearly every aspect of the gameworld -  alien behavior, planets (types, how many) enemy faction behavior, trading behavior and so forth.I love in-cockpit space games too, but theres just something fun about the top driven ones.

												It's a good game so far. Just starting out I found it to be extremely difficult but after figuring out the mechanics of the game it began to become a bit easier. Mid game I realized the game got way too difficult again due to the raging factions trying to take over space. I like the equipment system as everything is randomized from merchant to merchants and they have a search system to help you find what you want. This gae has a lot of depth to it if you are able to play through it. Currently I transfered over to the pirate organization which changed things for somewhat the worse so I will have to start over again. I would like to change the organization mechanics as it is a bit confusing as to who is a pirate and who is a ranger as the ship names change and ships are labeled rangers when really they are a pirate. The trading system is fine, pretty basic but it works. The game has three other ""mini-games;"" the planetary battles battles are pretty basic where you equip robots like a mech warror load out and move the robots taking capture points. Personally theres not much to think about when playing it. There are text based games which are pretty fun but the problem is that they are pretty streamlined and if you fail you can always restart and do the same thing. The last is an arcade type game where you fly around shooting ships in a seizure like background, I never got to figuring out how to play it. So far I havn't gotten too far into the story or close to succeeding at the game. I would say that if you are to buy this game is due to the space battles in turn-based mode. It is innovating at the start but it could have been even more.			"

												Space Rangers is perhaps the single greatest game you have never played. Now I do not blame you for not knowing about an obscure Russion top down roguelike in space... but if you do not buy this game and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it right this very second then I just feel sorry for you.In the mid 2000's there was an explosion of highly creative game development that came out of Europe. S.T.A.L.K.E.R and The Witcher are the two that made it big and everyone has heard of. The other two amazing titles of the time that did not make it big were The Guild, and Space Rangers. Due to being far more niche in their appeal very few people know about the latter... which is a shame because they are fantastic. Space Rangers truly is like 4 games in one. The main game is a top down Sci-Fi Roguelike very much akin to Star Control. If you fly into a blackhole you go into a bonus arcade stage that works much like the Maze levels in Sonic the Hedgehog. You can choose to take missions on some planets and space bases which then send you on a wild text based adventure the like of which Steve Jackson would be proud of and finally there are RTS levels where you take control of an army of Mechs and have to destroy the enemy base to capture a planet or take control of it away from the enemy faction. This may sound like a mix of mini games splattered into a Roguelike... However, these other game types are anything buy mini. They are highly detailed, well formed, engaging with a huge amount of varied content that adds a ton of variaty to a main game that actually manages to deliver on a living universe. If you enjoyed Star Control, Space Pirates and Zombies, Sins of a Solar Empire, X-Series, Elite or any Roguelike or Space Opera title... then you owe it to yourself to play Space Rangers.			"

												I would rank this game absolute number 1 among all the games I played.If you like RPG, RTS, arcades or turn-based games and never tried a mixture of all of them, then you must play this one. This game offers everything is small portions, so if you don't like a part of it, your impression of the entire game will not be spoiled. If you hate RTS or text quests, it is entirely possible to skip all missions that offer those. If you don't like turn-based fighting, then choose a peaceful path of a trader. Alternatively, if you are down to kick some butt, just bully all pirates on your way and destroy dominators. There are countless ways to play the game and I bet anybody will find a way to enjoy it. This is the only game that got me hooked into its immersive, well thought-out  and filled with humour world. I spent countless hours (possibly 100s) playing the 1st and 2nd part of this series, and I can say that Space Rangers HD is just more balanced among both with better graphics, alternative ending and more weapons. Devs really spend a lot of time working on balance fixes and minor bugs here and there (check patch history). Overall well polished and diverse game. 10/10 buy with confidence  "

												A true hidden gem. Give it a try and you will be lost for hundred of hours. My play time says otherwise because I played mostly an older version, outside of Steam. Music and atmosphere are unforgettable. Gameplay is mix of 4X, RPG, text adventures and RTS. RTS missions are average but optional. Text quests (optional too) are well written, have good humour and many laughable moments. Core elements, 4X and RPG, are solid. A lot of race, personality, difficulty and advanced settings.			"

												Space Rangers HD: A War Apart is a refreshed version game, which has been expanded by adding new faction, missions, maps, ships and equipments. Game is a combination of many types: space simulators, strategy, arcade, text adventure and cRPG.Fighting in space, planetary battles, skirmishes arcade, missions text, skills development, modification of equipment and much more. Good graphics, interesting, sometimes funny, complex and absorbing for many hours. The randomness of events makes that every time the game is a little different. It all makes the game that is worthy of attention.			"

												One of the few good Russian developed games. Played the original version for far longer, than the Steam version. Shame, that Space Rangers 1 and 2 had such poor marketing on the Western market, and almost nobody knew about them outside Russia.Basically, you play as a captain of a ship during war with enigmatic and tecnologically advanced enemy. The beauty is, that you are completely free to do whatever you want. Want to fight with common enemy and become war hero? No problems. Or maybe you want to build your fortune through pirating and smuggling? Maybe you want to live a mercenary's live, and fight for whoever pays you the most? That is all open to you.The HD version added several cool things, like additional maps for planetary combat, new text based planetary quests, absolutely new ""storyline"", where you help pirates secure there reign over Galaxy, and so on.In conclusion, I absolutely recommend this game.

												Disclaimer: this review is full of sarcasm and irony. Just as always.Score out of 10:Graphics: 8.0, this is not photo-realistic FPS, but everything is nice and polished. Created professionally and with much care to game style.Game engine: 8.5, if I recall correctly game was written on Delphi or some other from Pascal family. This alone is a huge sign of how cool original developers were. Also game runs smoothly, it features thousands (ok little bit less but still) different sub-systems, like planetary RTS combat, space arcade combat, text-based RPG, trade, open world, proper AI simulation of life and even some form of base management. Seriously, according to ""Gameworld Navigator"" journal it's METAgame.Game mechanics: 10.0, look above. The amout of game mechanics and quality of implementation are superior. Never seen something more sophisticated yet so simple to play. Replay-ability is so-so, but you can finish it 3-4 times at least before it becomes boring. Game designer should take his place in the Hall of Fame for computer games. Game addiction: 8.1, game is pretty entertaining, but has many differnt phases or sub-games, so you can actually quit it after, for example, exhausting planetary combat. Which was never the case in games like Civilization, when you continously click ""Next turn"" button for whole night. Would not say it's bad, though.Gameplay: 9.6, i recommended this game to majority my friends and none of them said a bad word about the game (nor me). It feels and plays smoothly. The 0.4 deducted points are because lots of its charm is lost due to translation. Original russian version is full of fun and funny things that hardly could be translated.TOTAL: 8.85TL,DR buy it. It may be old, strangle looking, weirdly promoted and unknown to most of you, but those who played it became her fans. Do not listen to me, look at this stats:Originally posted by steam store user rating:RECENT: Overwhelmingly Positive (123 reviews)

You don't need my review to tell you this game deserves its 15$.Best regards,Space Cadet Lyakusha Pyenchekryak-42.P.S.Do not look on my Steam in-game timer. I played it (SR1, SR2) years before release on Steam and I know what I'm talking about.			"

												Do not let the name fool you, this is not some power rangers sort of kid game. It is a deep free-roaming 2d space battling game. It has turns which go into continues mode seamlessly, kinda baldurs gate style. It features weapons with (kinda) random stats, so you will be looking around the markets for that nice version you wanted.It features a war on 3 sides map which which is not faking who is winning or losing, it is actually happening.Furthermore about the not faking, nearly all spaceships in the game are not faking either, they are doing their thing wether you are around or not. (they do get their equipment a little different then you, i forgive the programmer)The text quest are sadly not as nice as the first space ranger version. You might like em tough.The robot battles are a funny distraction from the actual game. Seems to me like a failed side project which was added for free.The wormhole battles are kinda pointless, but at least dont last long.All 3 side games can pretty much be ignored without concequences. Which is a good thing.			"

Not only that, but it also contains arcade-style battles and even text-based adventures.  This game offers a bit of everything.  Considering the price, sci-fi space fans should find at least something to enjoy about this game.Though I have never played the original, this game has really captured my interest and I recommend it to others who enjoy games of this genre.  My only disappointment so far has been the lack of manual zoom during space flight and the tutorial could stand to be a bit more interactive/useful.

												This game never gets old. It's super adictive and a lot of fun! Sure, once you play non stop, it may get boring, so you step away from it for a while. A few days, weeks, perhaps even a month or more. This is normal to many if not all games.However, once you decide to turn on this game again, you get sucked into cozy open-world Universe and can't stop playing for hours if not days, weeks, months.Clever A.I., great writing, interesting gameplay, and the best part is, you play the game you want. There's nothing holding your hand and pushing you to finish it. You really do feel like a small person in it, and not some Superman who can take a lot of hits and never die. However, you also have the ability to make all the difference if you try. You may fail again and again and again, but that one small victory is going to stay with you and push you to try again and again and again.Personally from me, I found a wingman for my self by accident. It all started when I just wanted to test something out and realizing that it didn't worked out, I thought about going solo again. The best part is, it's been nearly 20 in game years and we still fly together. Not because it's easier for me or because I get an advantage in anything from my wingman. In fact, sometimes it's even harder to fight battles because I don't want to lose her. But the feeling of sharing victories together is what makes us fly together!This game may not be for everyone, but if you have some extra cash, give this game a chance. Who knows, maybe you'll find your wingman that you'll never want to split with.			"

												Metascore is not an accurate representation for this game. It has a lot to offer and many different types of gameplay during the various aspects of being a SpaceRanger. I have yet to play any game that has the same amount of variation in gameplay available(from oldschool text quests, arcade minigames, trade, space combat, piracy, merchant, quester, mercenary etc.) Good buy and well worth the price.

												I played this a long time ago and had some fond memories of it.  Now I bought it again in the HD version.  It does look nice, however, I have decided I hate the text adventures as well as the RTS missions. I was really into leveling up and getting better stuff for a while, but then the tech progression got really slow and there just was not much to buy.  To make matters worse the way the game does ship maintainace, it is a percent of the value of everything.  After a while just flying around and having normal wear and tear lead to huge expenses.In the end, I just got bored of doing the same thing over and over without completing the main story line.  I could never ""solo"" sectors of dominators and trying to find one where other NPCS we helping out seemed like blind luck.  I just got bored of it all and put the game down.  For good I think.I would say, buy it when it is on sale.  I really like the idea of the game, its just that the execution was quite rough with just too many annoying things.			"

												Space Rangers HD is an awesome game and  a big improvement over Space Rangers 2 Reboot!  I know you're going to say how Can Ranger Ponyhare say this with only one hour of  game time.   I can  say this because I have spent seemingly countless hours playing this game with the Steam Client in Offline mode.  I'm trying to keep this review brief and make it as helpful as possible, so I'm only including thoughts about the Pirates.  First there are basically two pirate factions, Independent Pirates that are out for their own ends, but are willing to follow you if you have enough Leadership Skill and Cash.Second is the Pirate Brotherhood that will take Systems from the Coalition and Defend the systems they have but who will never follow you.  At least they didn't follow me and I made the Rank of Capo in the Brotherhood.  Offending planets controlled by the Brotherhood is not like offending Coalition Planets.  You can't Bribe individual planets into good relations.  Better relations are only accomplished at a Business Center if you Build a Pirate Base and at a Pirate Base if you change your identity or Join the Pirate Brotherhood; or leave the Pirate Brotherhood and Rejoin the Pirate Brotherhood.  Playing the Pirate Story line quests also adds some unique adventures but I'll  leave that to you the Reader to Discover when you play Space Rangers HD!			"

												FIrst of all, this is very interesting game, indeed.It's space turn-based RPG, with load of quests and great sence of humour (most of which, sadly not available in English version).Quests are divided in 2 directions: text-based (puzzle, logical) and gameplay (delivery, bodyguarding, patroling, killing, gathering a things and so on).You have a single ship, but in game progress you'll have an ability to command some others ships, if you'd like to.There are great oportunities to customization your ship - you could choose spaceship type, weapons, armor and so on. Loads of artefacts and possibility to improve standrt equipment on Research Stations.In game, you'll have a full freedom - you can be a pirate, a hero, a drug-dealer or weapon baron, you name it. Another point, this is a very old game, with some remastering (HD resolution, 16:10 screen support and so on) and polishing with some new things from the year of 2005 or something about it.And about polishing - this game make my computer freezes from time to time, which sad enough)Gameplay and replay ability 8/10Graphic 7/10 Audio 6/10Scenary 8/10Overall score: 7.5 / 10			"

												In my TOP5 games of all time.The base version is great in itself. This HD remaster adds some gimmicky stuff (beside resoulution upgrade which shines in RTS portion of the game), soundtrack and a few other questionable improvements which I wouldn't mind being without. I didn't like the way they changed some of the art and was, until recently, praying for them to add an option to switch with vanilla art, as it seemed a tad more immersive. BUT! the studio behind this remaster is still developing free content for this game and since its release, content progressed quite a bit!All in all, the resolution upgrade alone makes it worth, especially if you're a fan of the series as I am (and can stomach poor art choices for some base/planet backgrounds and loading screens).REPLAYABILITY POTENTIAL IS CRAZY HIGHP.S. Don't underestimate the Adventure portion of this game, its one of its strong points. Feel free to disregard RTS though, its not everyones cup of tea and both the AI and UI is quite primitive (though the AI is hard to beat in many cases!).			"

												I have not gotten into the game much. So this is more of a first impressions review.Its difficult. Very difficult. One of those games where you need to learn the system to get over the difficulty hump. There's so much to learn it feels overwhelming. However! I like what I am seeing. A strange mish-mash of cross/ multi genre styles all blended together. Arcade fights. Turn base space fights. Light polotics. Trade. Space simulation aspects. RTS and FPS gameplay. TEXT ADVENTURES!!! and much more! Seems like a very tactical game where I need the right ship/ tools to do certain things correctly. I need to invest time and fail a lot to learn how to play well. But from what I am seeing I love the scope of what the game offers. I quite enjoyed my first failed game :)4/5 ...fyi Mass Effect totally ripped off specters from the original space rangers (and Ender's Game, and 2000 Space Oddesy, and Battle Star Galatic, and on and on)			"

You can kill enemies in direct combat, hack their ships, use stimulants to improve your abilities etc. Missions are really good, especially text quests. Some of them are really hard, they'll make you so angry after 30th time of playing them, but when you do pass them, feeling is unique. Land battles are repetitive and boring, in my opinion.All in all, great game, especially for space lovers.10/10			"

												Definitely one of my favourite games to lose endless hours to.The game combines many different genres into one seamless package. You have a great mix of strategy (turn based and real time), role-playing, trading, text adventure and open world exploration. The story is simple but well presented. You can dive into it with ease, or just ignore it and go explore the galaxy, coming back at your leisure.As you play you'll earn XP to level up your pilot, allowing you to improve various skills. These affect your combat abilities, trade prices and other such things.The main gameplay element is a turn based, top down, strategy mode, where you're flying your ship across the stars, visiting various systems, planets and space stations. It's very well balanced, with a huge assortment of equipment that you can deck your ship out in. Each ship has a varied number of slots for different equipment, along with a max amount of cargo and gear your can carry. Picking the best ship your play style, be it heroic Ranger, trader or pirate, is important. As is knowing what targets to go after and when it's best to just run away.There are also wormholes you can dive into, which will take you to random places in the galaxy. However inside a wormhole you have to face various enemies in an action heavy top down shooter style of play, where all your weapons have their own firing styles.But just flying around in space (as awesome as it is) isn't all the game has to offer. Going to various planets will let you take missions for the different factions. You can have simple trade missions (or just focus on trading freelance to make money), you can escort others or be asked to take someone out, you can also be sent to take on the Dominators, an evil robotic foe made up of three unique factions. There's also ground missions where you will play out real-time strategy missions, constructing your own robotic armies to repel the Dominators.And there's my personal favourite, the text adventures. Many missions presented will give you missions that play out in a classical text adventure style. You're presented with various scenarios and have lots of options on how to proceed. These missions vary vastly, from hover bike races, to testing experimental weapons, to capturing rare creatures to pizza making competitions (I'm not kidding). They are wonderfully written and present a very fun way of handling special events. This style is also used for the prison mini-game, which basically happens any time you're arrested by one of the factions. You can be a model inmate and follow the rules, try and survive being a snitch, or try to be the Don of the prison. Along the way you'll be focusing on keeping your mind and body sharp, taking part in talent contests, cockroach races, dealing with contraband, and all sorts of varied and surprising prison activities.Graphically the game is wonderful. The graphics are detailed and crisp, and just flying around space is an amazing visual experience. The text adventure sections have hand drawn pictures to go with them. The only part of the game that's a little more simplistic is the RTS battles.As for sound, there's some great musical scores to the game and quite well done sound effects. There's no speech, so you don't need to worry about hearing it over whatever else is going on in the game.As for replay value... the universe is randomly generated each time you play a new game. There will always be certain home systems and home worlds that appear, but where they are and what's around them, along with what space stations are available (which you can fund to help construct more of) will differ each time you play. Missions, ships and equipment will vary each game as well, so the course you take through the game can vary greatly. Definitely a game you can come back to again and again.			"

Your a space ranger (guy in a spaceship;). space combat is turnbased and planets have textbased adeventures which i found very amusing most of the time. It also has  a realtime strategy element as in when a planet gets conquered by faction your at least neutral with you can then land on planet to do a landbased RTS mission with robots to rid planet of last pieces of resistance and get some loot. All in all i recommend this if you like Turnbased games with a bit of RPG in in it. The RTS part is optional mostly i just skipped that part cause i didnt find it that good.			"

												An underrated little gem of a game that nobody seems to know about, having seemingly faded from the critical eye shortly before the advent of digital distribution and the renaissance it brought to many other old classics.Look. It's a top-down space adventure game in a randomly generated universe. It is filled with wonderful alien species full of character and humour. You can be a pirate, a merchant, a bounty hunter, a corsair, a soldier. You can join the intergalactic struggle against the ruthless Dominators, or just bugger off and explore a black hole or build a space station or fly around plopping exploration probes on every other planet. Or you could just lurk near the nearest commercial hub, demanding that tasty-looking trader to hand over his goods, aaaarg matey!It has hilarious and exciting text adventures! And a fully 3D (admittedly slightly janky) RTS mode! You can spend hours zouping up your ship with half a dozen frag cannons and the biggest, fattest shields money can buy; or you can whack it all in a savings account and let the money roll in, whilst you fly off to deliver a toothbrush for that nice Faeyan ambassador halfway across the galaxy.Look, just buy it, ok?

												first time a played a space ranger game and overall its good stuff. very unique game. the main part of the gameplay is you are in your ship, you can upgrade it, and you fight turn based.  you might think turn based for space combat would seem slow, but its not.  the text quests surprising are very very fun and good.  who doesn't like going to prison and finding different ways of exiting.. either being the don, or smart alec, a bruiser, ... i had fun with all text quests, very well done.  the other part is planatary conquest where you are playing an RTS.  this unfortunetaly is teh weakest part of the game, and i recommend you try it, just to see how it is, but for me i just skipped these quests.  another thing is, the difficulty is granular and you can change everything about how/what is difficult. etc...  so it makes fighting the overpowered pirates a little bit easier.  i recommend always to look at some youtube videos so you can see teh actual gameplay.

												For anyone on the fence about Space Rangers, if this doesn't sell you on the game I don't know what will. This is all just one single quest:I'm playing a kind of scumbag ranger, smuggling contraband and generally being sleazy. At one point I took an escort mission, when the other ship and I were in deep space with no one around I opened fire on them until they surrendered and offered me credits to stop attacking them, which I accepted, I then flew to the originating base and told them I had successfully escorted the ship and got paid there as well - that kind of thing.I'm flying around looking for opportunities and I see a big collection of ore and mineral, just floating around. I fill up my cargo bay and head to the nearest inhabited planet to unload my haul, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was an outlaw on this planet and the police caught me as soon as I landed. I was sent to prison where I was given the option of serving my sentence or attempting to escape. I chose to serve my sentence, and it turned in to a prison simulation where I had to survive 75 days in prison while balancing relationships with the prison officials and the other prisoners.Luckily I'm fairly rich on the outside and access to my credits was not cut off in prison. I first ran in to an old prison veteran who gave me prison survival tips for a few credits each and he kept basically telling me that if I was going to be a ""good boy"" and suck up to the guards and be a model prisoner, the other inmates would grow to hate me. He also mentioned a cafeteria where I could get food which would make my life easier, but if I spent too much money at the cafeteria, the other inmates would start to get jealous.Then I went to the Cafeteria and spent a lot of money to buy food for every inmate. This instantly bought me the respect of all of the prisoners, but the guards got suspicious and started keeping watch on me. On my way back to my cell I smuggled a fork and a spoon, but when I got back to my cell someone had raided my locker and stolen some credits. I figured I would need to beat someone up over this, so I went to the gym to get ripped, but dropped a barbell on my foot instead, so I had to go back to my cell, where some shady inmate wanted to sell me a tape recorder. I bought it without any idea why I would want it and went to bed.The next day the prisoners were holding a fist-fight championship, so instead of going to work or the gym or the library, I went to the fight. When I got there I found out that the prison warden loved these fights and he was in attendance. I requested to become a participant in the hopes of gaining respect from both camps. The first fighter came out hard and strong and I was forced in to a defensive stance and couldn't get any hits off, the guy eventually pummeled me so hard within a few rounds that local newspapers were reporting on how I ""took it in the face"".When I woke up, I decided to use my spoon to start digging a tunnel out of my cell. After a day of digging I had only made it 7m, so I gave up and regretted not working out at the gym instead. The next day I decided to play it straight and went to get a work assignment, but they wanted me to paint a f**king fence which is bullls**t so I refused. The guards beat the s**t out of my and threw me in solitary for the night. When they brought me back to my cell the next day, I was confronted by a group of inmates. See, when I first went in to prison and I bought respect from the inmates, they took a real liking to me, in fact they liked me to much that I was named ""the prison Don"", and they... disposed of the old Don. However, I was f**king up too much, now things were ruined, and they regretted escalating me to Don status. They brandished some shanks and metal pipes and pretty much told me I was dead unless I paid them off. I also had the option to fight, but between the fight I lost earlier and the beating I took from the guards, I figured it was a bad idea, so I paid them off.I really wanted to go to the medical center, but today was another fight day and it was closed down - f**k. I went to the fights and decided to participate again, in my already weakened state. My opponent was a little scrappy guy but I guess he knew what he was doing, because he knocked me out, then picked me up and threw my body straight out of the ring, godd**nit. The papers made fun of me again and I went to bed.I checked the calendar. I've only been in here for seven days, and I have another 68 until release.e: On day 10 I decided to get some prison tats and ended up tattooing my entire back with Masonic symbols			"

												One of best games of all times. One of rare timeless games that beside Dota 1 and 2 that I never got bored of and never stopped playing. Incredible music, graphics, atmosphere and sense like really being on adventure in universe. I don't know which I like better, text adventures in the game, fights on the planet, or game play in star systems. I bought this sequel just to support this kind of thinking and creativity.﻿Played first part almost 13 years ago and I am always back to play it again since then.			"

												I did play that game even before it was on Steam. From time it was Space Rangers 2 Rebelion. then it jsut changed titles but it was expanding. Its amazing. But I must admit some missions are unfair and pirates are quite OP. Also Planetary missions are really unfair for player and really annoying but its jsut my opinion. I take them since they most well paid and medals you may get for those are awsomeAnyway I do reccomend this game. it may be old but still story, free world, Economy, upgrade system of ship and tech advancing is one of its kind. its like a game where you can be a single pilot and nto do anything in war effort and war goes on itself and other rangers evolve as well. I may have just 31h on steam atm but I can say I did spend over 800h during time I had the game from earliest stages and I dont regret any time of it... Ok except few certian rts missions but still its awsome. Buy it if you appriciate rpg and turn based space exploration in best kind			"

												What can I say about Space Rangers?Well, my first contact with the game series had been established sometime in 2003/4. I played SR1 a bit and quickly moved on to SR2, which was not an actual sequel but an update. A fact which remained true for every following ""sequel,"" didn't know that at the time.I played SR2 quite extensively over the years, one of two games to which I returned quite often, the other being GTA SA. Once I got a whiff of SR2 Reboot, English version of which trailed behind the Russian release, I grew impenitent over obtaining a copy. Finally it came around on Stardock's Impulse service where, after some proxy shenanigans, I managed to obtain a license of the aforementioned software, leading to quite a lot pleasurable game time.Of course SR TWA was supposed to be played with burning passion as well. Burning indeed.The game has been extensively updated (both in content and regarding technical aspects) over the years and made even more interesting. To those players who may be inclined toward this type of games.What type of game is it, you ask, impatient reader? Well, it's an SF roguelike RPG space trader sim riddled with textual quests and packed with arcade and RTS battles. It basically covers all known game genres, with possible exception of triple x rated games, FPS shooters and sports sims. No, you can not play football in SR universe, sorry about that.Of course not all of these components have been well executed, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. Imagine if the RTS battles didn't suck, the game would be even more attractive and demand even more time. That would just suck. You realize, something has to suck.Pros:- everything excluding what's listed belowCons:- I wish the devs had access to more resources so that they may translate ALL the game content into English, instead of having to opt for leaving a part of it out. The game is Russian centric, but instead of seeing this as something negative, one should take this fact for what it is - an excellent opportunity to learn Russian- as it has been mentioned a number of times, RTS mode sucks. However, it's completely optional, which one doesn't get to see in modern games that often. If at all. These missions can be challenging and rather rewarding, but most of them are quite a chore due to incredibly bad controls and pathing issues- some consider the arcade black hole mode to be bad, but I personally disagree. While arcade mode is nothing extra super special, it can be a nice way to obtain some otherwise unattainable equipment and provide a break of standard space faring. My qualm over this are possible balancing issues, since you can get quite expensive gear out of the hole fairly early in the game by investing next to nothing into it. Another thing that sucks a bit is the fact that all those weapons which are great in the hole are otherwise useless. And vice versa, so having nice end-game weapons can make the hole problematic to complete. Maybe this was intended by design, IDK really- I can live with the game being random, however some bits are simply not random. You're practically being cheated now and againg.Two examples:1. some micromodules are not (to the best of my knowledge and experience) attainable from Ranger Centers. There are a few modules (Universe, Broing, Strongster (which may not be in the game anymore, not sure)) which you'll get to see on about one out of three playthroughs. In ten years playing various versions I got something like 2-3 Universe modules, Broing probably only once and Strongster definitively only once. Not nice, especially since you can regularly come across (usually) pirates having half a dozen of these2. some dominator gear simply won't drop while using distress signal. I typically check what do they carry before engaging, usually looking for the holy grail of SR (namely the Vertix weapon fixture.) Once I find one that's type H and below 160 weight I spam that dominator with distress signals but the item in question is simply not jettisoned. I understand that obtaining such a powerful weapon too early may pose balancing issues, but that item is quite heavy and expensive to maintain, so it's really not nice to have something like that pulled on an unsuspecting Ranger. Not nice indeedRoom for expansion:- one thing I can't understand is why (after defeating the dominators and before actually finishing the game) existing races stay friendly instead of simply having a showdown, with petty feuding, consorting and what not. That would provide for some after-game entertainment and it would be quite logical conclusion- RTS components in actual space. Something like: ""I have more credits than common sense and want to render this and that system dominator/pirates/coalition proof by means of heavily armored battle stations, private combat ships and what not)""- a unified node account so that your Ranger node account can be used to draw required resources for all your needs, including upgrades and maintaining equipment. It seems silly and cumbersome to lug around 1200 nodes to the nearest science stations to have something upgraded. Seems almost like a bug instead of a missing featureI think that's about it. As for the sheer size of the world and content, I have to say that even after ten years there's new stuff (not something strictly related to the latest expansion) and game mechanics I encounter from time to time.Nine out of ten. It took so much time from my life I simply can not rate it any higher than that.			"

												Space Rangers HD puts a hand in too many cookie jars and doesn't really excel in any of them. It tries to be a Myst-like adventure series with little short, interactive, branching stories, then tries its hand at being a space sim where you fly around a little and barter, and finally it tries its hand at arcade shooting and RTS style gameplay. It has variety, being a jack of all trades, but it doesn't master any of them. On the other hand, it doesn't fail horrible, save for the reading portions where you can be screwed by RNG, especially when you're on the clock. Don't buy this game unless you're sure you want any of those, or you're a fan of the series. If you are a fan, it does exactly what you want and it runs without issue. So I won't give it any hate for that. It's possible that I'm just not too big a fan of the series, and the game isn't at fault, so I give it that benefit of the doubt.			"

												Space Rangers 2 is a unique and improbable blend of space trading/fighting, robot-war based RTS and choose-your-own text adventures somewhat erratically translated from Russian. You play a Space Ranger trying to save the universe from the plague of a trio of evil AIs and the growing threat of pirates. Or not. You can ignore the story of the game and choose your own goal - and let the universe crumble around you. Sometimes you will be trading or running fedex missions between worlds. Sometimes releasing probes on unihabited worlds. Sometimes you will be jumping into a system infested with AI space vessels and trying to do your bit for the cause. Sometimes you will tracking down some rogue pilot for the money you need to buy your next ship. Sometimes you will be running a ski resort. Sometimes trying to get elected as president - or winning a Fonzer race - or just surviving prison as you wait for your release.If you can't imagine what that might be like, then you ought to try this game. It is a one-off.The pacing is all over the place. The turn-based space battles make mass combat a puzzle, rather than an adrenaline hit. Not a bad thing if you like that kind of thing. The planetary robot battles are long drawn out affairs of attrition rather than inspiration and the text adventures are... mixed... and involve a hell of a lot of reading and even more head scratching. But both are optional and feel almost like entire games all of their own. It can be hard to find your feet - the manual has vital information that the tutorial doesn't cover. It really is a bit of a stitched together monster.However to find all three genres in one game - and a game of so many options. Advancing tech tree - dynamic economy - an enemy expanding into your turf whether you like it or not - named competitors and rivals to fight, or hire. To have a story arc of a galactic battle against three baddies that you can choose whether to engage with - and how. And then to find you are a small cog in a vast machine of traders, pirates, military vessels and rangers who get on with their own lives with or without you. It's a glorious anarchic riot that has (either by luck or judgement) found a beautiful patchwork mix of the bizarre.For all of its faults - craziness - frustrations - iffy translations. It is, quite possibly, my favourite game.			"

												Spacerangers is a simple concept of a 2D space game taken to the extreme . Don't let that minigame look fool you this game has a $60 worth of content . It has somewhat of a sandbox feel to it because you can progress through the game by fighting dominators,trading,doing quests or just being a pirate . The main menu has a very nice custom gameplay options which you can use to make it harder or easier on yourself . Also you can get much better starting ship at the cost of some races hating you which is a risk vs reward option .Probably the most important part of this game is just the fact that it is so visually uniqe and the soundtrack is amazing . It may not be a 3D space game but it still creates very immersive atmosphere .There are several gameplay types that may appeal to different players . You have a turn based space combat, RTS style ground quests where game completly changes the way it plays , Text Missions for people who enjoy puzzles and twitch space combat inside black holes .Last but not least is the element of random events. Sometimes you pilot can get a sickness and then you will keep getting money each month as donations from organization fighting that disease.Each time you play the game you may run into a different problem . Sometimes some of the big bosses can come to your system location and kill everyone , forcing you to flee and adapt new tactics .If you set game on hardest diffeculty you can actually loose entire galaxy to pirates & dominators .It really is a solid game in all aspects . My only complain is that I prefered Dominatos (robots) as main story villains and not Pirates in this expansion . The pirate faction has some issues though because you might get a quest to protect all ships in pirate system which is kidna dumb because its just nearly impossible to do without some serious luck .

												This is a fun game. Very in-depth. You can buy and sell stuff, or you can mine asteroids for a single generic ore, or hunt pirates, or hunt any faction you want.There are 3 different main bad guy factions, plus the pirates, plus the good guys, plus merchants, plus rangers.Even the types of crew have different benefits and their skills improve.Your ship can catch fire, and you can blow your airlocks to extinguish that fire, or suffocate enemies who have boarded, or fight them head on.You can unlock ships, and there are several difficulty levels.The game has English translation, so it feels more like you are exploring space, almost trying to figure out what the enemies are trying to say to you, which is really immersive when dealing with alien races. I have had to use my English dictionary more than once to define an English word, and English is my native language. The English translation was done by Brits. Sometimes the translation tends to be serious, sometimes it tends to be funny.The devs are still active and ready to help players with any problems which hadn't been addressed.			"

Admittedly, the RTS side of the game has ridiculous AI, but it is still kind of fun, even though you just end up completely exploiting it.The game is difficult to get started with.

												A good, solid game. Take it for what it is.Story and setting concerning the dominators is pretty good, most other things are quite generic.Early in the game you do missions for governments and it's either:Bring object A to location B, within a set amount of time.Kill guy in ship A, last seen in system B, within a set amount of time.Go to location B, do a text quest/puzzle.Go to planet B, do a ground mission to kill faction C.^ That's it. You essentially do the same over and over but with different words.However, you need only do 10-20 of these missions until you can get good enough gear to start hunting dominators, and that's where the real profit is.All dominator parts are sold for max price (and sometimes double) to Research stations.Now you've come to the stage where you grind, grind, grind and grind more dominators, preferrably luring them in and kiting them one by one, so not to get clusterf#¤(ed up the bum.Now wash, rince and repeat this for 30 hours and you win the game! Huzzah!The game has it's charm, it has options, you could be a trader, but really.. fed-ex'ing crap across the galaxy gets old pretty fast.It's pretty decently priced and it'll probably get you anywhere between 15 and 40 hours depending on the rate you go at.And you'll want to be fast. If you're slow, dominators will conquer the galaxy. If you're fast, you get less hours out of the game. Go figure.			"

This game-concept allows the player to become a pirate in opposition of the Coalition. If that is your thing, then you will most likely enjoy this game more than me. If you despise pirates then this game will infuriate you. Pirates arrrr over powered (OP) even on Normal difficulty.  Some have speculated that pirates have to pay for their repairs, equipment, missiles and MM's. Inconceivable! They rarely if ever pick up loot. They cannot possibly get enough from extortion. They always have the best equipment and MM's. And 9 times out of ten they are doped up, improving their mad skillz. It is possible to ignore pirates, allow them to conquer Coalition systems and then land on ""their"" planets. If your relations with them are good, then they will leave you alone... except for independents. And maybe that's how to be less frustrated. NewSo this episode added a new Race/Faction, the pirates, its HD... some new weapons (which pirates use effectively in packs), Steam achievements, supposedly some new quests and perhaps a few more things. The ship defense design was changed to segregate Energy, Fragmentation and Missile weapons. The lower the score the less damage your ship will take in that class, e.g. M:80%. Unfortunately, this is where the game becomes unbalanced. There is one hull class in the game that consistently has the lowest defense scores, ergo the best defenses, the Dumbo class. Like it or not this is the single/sole goto choice for ship hulls. OldThe devs did not correct the: Superfluous grammar and typographical errors, e.g. It's not ""Sale"", it's ""Sell"". It may be HD, but the display area is the same. Cannot zoom in or out on the tactical map (system travel)The minimap is fixed. You can go beyond the edge of the system but you will not be able to see your location or other objects on the minimap. The equipment reliability system has not changed and this is the greatest problem with the series. It's not the poor equipment reliability that is so irksome; there are two in-game mechanics for controlling that. It's the exorbitant cost to repair that is so poorly designed and unbalanced. A design that relies entirely upon recovering and selling Dominator equipment to science stations (full value). If there were no doms, then NO ONE could afford to repair their equipment. The design is ludicrous, frustrating and very aggravating... in other words NOT fun! This problem is compounded when fighting pirates. They rarely drop anything of value and the overall effect is just to wear out your equipment. IMO they also don't pay for their repairs. All quest and related dialogs force you to find the destination in the text but readily remind you of the ""Customer"". A simple ""Destination/Target"" heading would have been nice. No turn management improvements, e.g. everything requires an entire day to complete, e.g. landing, taking off, jumping, etc. Days (the turn) could have been divided into, oh I don't know, hours and allow the turn to be stopped at any point. The turn/hour progress indicator could easily be shown on the HUD. And if the time requirement to jump is 12 hours then at least you won't have to just sit there and wait a full day for all those missiles to catch up and blast you to pieces. Jumping still requires the ship to travel to some obscure location at the edge of a system. For instance, if you are at the outer lower edge of a system, you may have to travel to the top edge to exit, etc. More often than not this behavior is senseless and annoying, especially when being chased by... Birthday gifts, etcetera, are scattered all over the galaxy. No easy way to collect them all. Attempting to manage this loose inventory consumes too much game time. Time that your enemy is using to their advantage. There were no improvements to the trade/mercantile system (it's not just overly simplistic but senseless and boring)The planets in the Sol system are orbiting in the wrong directionStations... they spend all that money to build them but can't afford to equip them?! This is supposedly left to the player... who can't afford to repair his own gear let alone another station. The pace is aggressively fast, unbalanced. There is no time to enjoy other aspects of the game like quests... let alone collecting gifts and selling. It's pretty tedious. The game can be fun but get it on ""sale"" at 50% or greater.			"

												In the early game, you see that most enemy ships you can't beat and that's expected.  Later on in the game you expect that you would be able to take on more and more enemies.  That doesn't happen though.  Game is not balanced.  The pirates are too powerful and take over the galaxy even on easy mode.  There is very little you can do to actually win.  Fun though if  it were not for that extremely frustrating point.  The previous version of this game (Space Rangers 2) was the same game without the high definition graphics, but was actually winnable.  Why do they have to break the game when changing the graphics?			"

												A great addon to a great game. At first view is has little visible difference from the generic game, but actually there are quite a lot of them. I can recommend this game to true fans of Space Rangers, but if you want to make an aquaintance, i reccomend you to start from the first part. Both parts are exellent, but different.			"

												I paid only for future UPDATE of Game!!!!!!! We really need more story line. At this moment only we play for pirate or parody to be agent of Coalition Forces. Pirate's way is more comfortable in first part of game, agent's storyline is more strange and brutal in the middle of game. I dont make this game ends more then one. Couse, every two months of real life i've tired of troubles with npc-agents or pirates, some side always having a great overpower on normal or middle difficulty. Not much upgrades (interesting but always ends in the middle of game), not much music (but it's a great music, if your spaceship are not landing to military base!!! Great music!!!). Science stations, business centre and military base e/t/c is not able to upgrade by player's money and weapons for be 100% alive in pirates or dominators attacks. You up the science station with big guns and helath regeneration - but crowd of pirates or ... - wasted money, wasted loot. I need more from game... But it's must be played/If you still thinking buy or not - I'll recommend to try this musical masterpiece and interesting graphical design.			"

												I would give this game score 6.5/10. I like mix of TBS and Quests. Game is good, but I played Space Rangers 1 several times, and of course I compare these two games when I play. Space Rangers 2 got some very cool upgrades:+ Planet battles+ Improved equipment search - now you can search by equipment type, weight and other settings+ Improved ship storage - in SR1 it was extremely stupid+ Nodes system for upgrades+ Sattelites + Pirates can occupy star systemsIf they would stop after adding this stuff, game would be 10/10. But everything else they changed is bad:- Stupid spaceships with disabled slots. Anyone ever bought ship without weapon slots?- They just killed design of SR1. Now everything is ugly. Weapon does not look like weapon, radar does not look like radar etc. Why change everything? And worst part - they kept equipment names.- Limited amount of artefacts you can use- Useless business and medical stations which just break balance- No battles when you jump to other star- Acrylic equipment? It's like garbage. Bad design, stupid features. You have nods system. Why add 1000 types of equipments?So all this 'features' are really bad. Game is good if you never played SR1, but SR1 is much better - 9/10. I would buy it on steam, but SR1 still not released :(			"

												Space Rangers HD is a very niche open-world turn-based space trading and combat strategy game that I think many people will find rather frustrating.  The game is improperly balanced so that the player has a very narrow path to success and a steep learning curve.  There's a lot of different ships and parts you can use, but many of them seem not to be viable and will lead to your death.   Not enough firepower?  You die.  Not fast enough?  You die.  Not earning enough income to pay off pirates or repair your ship after fighting them?  You die.   Not enough fuel make a hyperspace jump to run away?  You die.  The learning curve and narrow path to success reminds me very much of the game X3: Terran Conflict, another more-complex open-world space trading and combat game which I would recommend over this.  If you are able to find the path to success then you may enjoy these games greatly, but if you fail to find it you will die again and again without making much progress and probably give up the games without experiencing what they have to offer.In this game you are supposed to try to control the pirate threat but you aren't powerful enough to kill pirates early in the game, only fast enough to chase them around and sustain a lot of damage fighting them only to have them land on a planet and fully repair their ship most of the time.  Before you know it the whole universe starts getting overrun by pirates and you have only been able to kill one or two strays.  You start to get jumped by more pirates than you can afford to pay off or hope to kill off, run out of money, then die.  Prepare to save and reload often in this game as that seems to be the main path to survival when you don't know what you may encounter before entering a black hole or a sector or taking a quest.  Death is going to find you, so be sure you have saved before that.Some of the planet battles in the game are difficult and frustrating and will require many restarts in some cases before you randomly end up with the right plan and conditions that will allow you to succeed.  You can skip them if you want to as the game does have an option to do that.There is some gaming population that will find games with narrow success conditions and an abundance of options, many of which are superfluous or serve to hide the narrow path to success fun to play.  These players enjoy overcoming difficulty and pride themselves in their ability to analyze a situation and find a way to succeed.  They will find the way to exploit weaknesses, recognize patterns, and filter out what doesn't lead to success.  They require a certain amount of failure to make victory worth achieving.  If all or even most players succeeded, then the challenge would not be great enough for them.  If this sounds like you, then you may enjoy this game.  If that doesn't sound fun to you, then you probably should pass on this one.			"

												Bought this cause i played it alot as a kid , and i can say the game is preety much the same , the diplomacy if you want to call it that still holds out , the space battles still hold out , the ground battles not so much but its not all that bad. The reason i do not reccomend this game (fullprice) , is because some of things that were added that worent in the game originaly are just bad , had a text mission (there are a few of those) where the translation was god awful , the choices made literaly no sense, and i had literally no idea what was going on (mostly because everything that was written was nonsencical , picture something translated from chinese using google translate....). The pricing of things in game is kinda wonky , and i dislike the pirate faction mechanics... Anyway i would reccomend getting the original , it still works (and if it doesnt there are fixes). However if this goes on sale i do reccomend getting it then , because while the game isnt bad it was better before.			"

												As much as I love this style of game, it is unfortunatley heavily unbalanced. Every improvement in this game over the original SR2 release is overshadowed by the fact that the Pirate faction is more powerful than all the other factions COMBINED. Playing on normal and I see systems with 20 pirate ships, all firing missiles, meaning unlike Dominators that you can kite and wear out slowly these guys will annihilate you in just a few turns. Why even call them Pirates? Why not ""Scourge of the Universe""? So horribly unbalanced and frustrating. Seeing system after system fall to the pirate swarm is just plain idiotic.			"

												I wanted to love this game. It looked so nice. But no, there are too many major flaws.> FIRST HOURLet's start from the beginning with the tutorial. Got killed by a pirate who had more defense, better weapons and faster engine. GAME OVER!Since i could complete the tutorial later, gues it was just a random encounter.Still, in the beginning you cannot really fight. If you happen to be stronger then your enemy, he just escape to next planet, repair his ship or just wait. You won't get any exp, loot or bounty. Just a bill for ship repairs.> MISSIONSThere are different missions available, each reward some cash and exp.With a trader ship you can take on transport missions. But they are near impossible at the beginning, since your engine is way too slow for the set timelimit.Later you get engines with 40 parasec hyperdrive. You just jump to your target and the missions get really easy.There are even assassination missions.Some targets have escort. Impossible to beat them at the beginning. Other targets just escape to the nearest planet. If they get arrested - BAD LUCK. Mission failed.It has some text adventures too. Reading them is getting bit tedious on HD screen with text using ~80% of the displays width. Smaller columns would be easier to read. Could be worse...The worst missions? Planetary battle. You land on a planet and play a RTS game against up to 3 cheating AI enemys. They have unlimited resources and can wipe you in the first minutes since you only have enough resources to build 2 units to defend against an army of 10+ units.If you get lucky (spam restart), the enemy decide attack each other and you can just watch. Your own units do stupid things like enganging enemy in melee even if you have long range weapons installed. Repairbots tend to go the frontline too. Some sommands are just ignored, like conquer enemy base or retreat from the battle.So why just don't skip the mission? They are painfull, but they yield about 5 times the cash and exp any other mission do. If you skip them, you have to grind for much much longer time.> BLACK HOLESYet another type of minigame. Black holes appear at random and can be entered for fast paced 2D scrollshooter. You get BH-tier equip upon win, which is good endgame stuff.Too bad the minigame has issues too. If you move forward and shot, you hit yourself. You can kill yourself that way... GAME OVER.> ENDGAMEWell.... i'm not there yet.You gonna start fighting against aliens. In one game I had aliens in the next sector. Without feul to jump back, they attacked me and... GAME OVER.I really like the game, but in the third installment they still have lots of issues. Frustrating issues.In this stage, i cannot recommend the game. Maybe they will do things better in the fourth version.			"

												I would pass. This game has a lot of depth, but the gameplay is obtuse and punishing to the point where it's not fun. Maybe if you played this back in the day, you know what's needed to enjoy it. But coming to it for the first time, I found the tutorial fine -- and then everything fell apart. ""Bring X to System 1."" Sure. Oop, my ship's not powerful enough to make it to System 1. MISSION FAIL. Reputation here is now POOR.""Find BOB and kill him."" Sure. Where the hell is Bob? Who knows? Fly around forever and maybe you'll run into him. Oops, time ran out. MISSION FAIL. Reputation here is now POOR.""Gimme all your credits."" No way, dude. It's on. DEAD.Uninstall.			"

												I soooooooo wanted to like this game. In fact, if they cut out the RTS-wannabe part and the hyperspace arcade-wannabe part, I'd probably be on board. As it stands though, you HAVE to do at least one of each of those to finish the game, and those two aspects were poorly implemented and annoying. I thought everything else was great, and it boggles my mind how they could snatch failure from the jaws of victory. Flying around the universe was a LOT of fun up until I hit the brick walls, at which point I pretty much quit out of frustration. This is probably one of the few games ever to make me do that. Fingers crossed that if they ever do another, they'll just focus on the good and drop the bad.			"

												This game is nothing like the pictures or description make it out to be. Maybe that's alright with people already familiar with the series, but I was sadly disappointed. The user interface is terrible, there's almost no in-game tutorial, and the gameplay is tedious. I have no idea when the tag arcade is added to Space Ranger HD because it's absolutely not arcade-y at all. Oh, and the RTS mini-game is terrible.			"

												Here's how you play it:1. Start a new game in «Ironman» mode with only one autosave slot.2. Game crashes for no reason every couple of hours, but at least you can continue from the autosave.3. Spend around 30 hours on your single playthrough. Earn money, rare items, fight bad guys and robots. You became a wealthy person with a nice ship and equipment, and can finally relax a bit.4. Game finally crashes so hard it freezes Windows and after a reboot, your only autosave is gone.5. 30 hours well spent.			"

												Pros:* Sandbox game.* Hilarious fetch quests of epic fail variety - no matter what you're asked to do, it will not work out as intended.* You can disable planetary battles.* Autopilot for realtime hyperspace battles - at least you're not a sitting duck if you have to go afk midbattle.Cons - where do I start...* Crashes often when you alt-tab.* Planetary battles have ridiculously low pop cap: 9 robots with best hull/chassi/weps are not enough to defend one direction, much less advance.* Planetary battles have no discernble rally point mechanic - you have to micromanage your army. It defeats the selling point of being able to control individual 'bots - since you have to constantly order reinforcements to advance and can't afford to spend time in the cockpit.* Pirates are ridiculously overpowered, even on normal difficulty. Coalition can't stand ♥♥♥♥ agaisnt them, and it effectively disables assassination missions, too. Just take a look at the forums.* Hyperspace battles only exist in black holes - so you can't farm for XP and equipment when jumping between systems anymore. One of the most memorable features of Space Rangers has been effectively removed from the game since black hole might as well pop up in a pirate system (see above).To wrap it all up: they took the most interesting features of the previous Space Rangers game, smashed them to pieces and replaced with them with junk. Have fun.			"

												There may be the slight chance, that I just have not understood the game and am making a fool out of myself but as it stands, this game is a pain in my behind and I will have to wait some time before I will try it again otherwise i might set fire to my desktop pc. This is not the game I thought it to be. It has a huge open map, randomly generated every time, which is nice. In the time I had, the only quests I found where sometimes given from planets for me to go to a different system, where I would get blown up in a few seconds (not exaggerating) from hostile ships looking the same as the friendly ones. I picked a warrior-type ship and character and couldn't even last 10 seconds against one ship. And last time I checked, 400 is less than 450. In this game, a ship with a speed of 400 can catch up with you on a straight line even if your speed is 450.Numbers, how do they work.Fighting on a planet is fun for the first time but you have to use the ability to control a robot completely otherwise your ""force"" will get destroyed. I tried their commands (your robots that you create can follow a distinct path and execute an order like: attack everything) and they are worthless. sending in your troops in one long line will get them destroyed not only, because all their robots wait on one position and can fire without problem but also because your bots will try to shoot through your other bots, making the flamethrower a complete waste and some other stuff too and I am not even talking about the pathfinding issues where my robots will split up making it even easier for the enemy to destroy not one large group but two small ones.I have to admit, I only ever played the tutorial on fighting on a planet, because every other mission I received was for a system I could never be able to stand my ground in. I even tried evading the enemy but, as I said: 400 > 450.On top of that, in my short playing time, I started once in a place where nothing interesting (or money creating) happened to far away from other systems (had to restart), only got rewards I couldn't use (besides the money) and found the opportunity to harvest ore extremely tedious because of the time it takes and the many miss-clicks.  It would even help if you could set a waypoint when on the planet, because all your robots start on the lower end of the map even if you are on the top. Maybe it is in there but after trying several times and keys and still not finding anything makes me not want to look it up but kick this game off my computer.I will feel like one hell of an idiot if  this game is more than what I experienced and I was just impatient and stupid but right now, this is the game I wasted money on and I am disappointed.

												Mostly squandered potential.  Never quite hits the sweet spot.  Confusing.  Frustratingly difficult much of the time.I've seen this game described as a sandbox game a number of times.  That's not really true.  If you try to play it as a sandbox--just being neutral, doing your own thing--you will lose.  The pirates will take over the galaxy and your game is lost.A frustration is that you are woefully underpowered compared to the game's two main enemies--the pirates and the dominators.  Attempting any operations in their systems leads to a mass attack from enemy ships that are ALL more powerful than you are.  Even the rare one on one combat against one of their ships ends up in your death way too often.  Even the tutorial's unmanned drone will own you if you don't first seriously upgrade your ship.  And all of this is on the Easy setting.  I can't even imagine attempting the higher difficulty levels.There is a story line of sorts to the game, but it is pretty well buried, as are many other features of the game.  I found myself frequently looking online for any clues on how to succeed, and time and time again I would read about features that the game barely even mentioned.  Very little is explained in game, and the ""manual"" is pretty bare bones.Planetary combat missions are doable, but the difficulty makes them dull.  The developers seem to have recognized this since they allow you to select an option to prevent the game from bogging you down with them.Planetary text missions are a whole different kind of ridiculous.  The stories are long and only moderately interesting.  The options are usually just RNG rolls instead of offering any meaningful strategic choices.  I found myself dying/failing over a dozen times, and just rapidly clicking through the same choices over and over hoping to get better rolls just so I could get through them and get on with the game.It's sad that all of this overshadows what could have been a very good game with a lot of depth.

												So much promise and content to this game, but the interface is a mess and the grandness of it's scope is directly proportional to how overwhelmed and unable you are to even see or understand what it has to offer. Tries to be a lot of things but doesn't give you a learning curve to get up there. For example, there is a tutorial that teaches you all the basics of how to fight ship to ship, and trade, and do missions, and see how the planetside RTS works... but whatever you actually try is a dismal failure. Do you like trying to grab a bit of mineral debris with repeated commands only to be mystified that it always takes about 3 tries? Is your education in system-based combat of any use when any encounter you wind up in you are likely going to be totally ventilated? Howabout a tutorial on how to play the RTS that literally allows itself to get bogged down until you AND the enemy run out of resources? I wanted to like this game and gave it several shots. Ulitimately life is too short. I had to give up. Try at your own peril.			"

												I've played my share of Space Rangers in not-too-distant past and I loved everything about it. Yet, this new reinstallment of SR2 brings very questionable feelings.First of all I cannot understand how this new and ""optimized"" version manages to lag on 2 of my rigs (Core i7/GT630M laptop and Xeon X5570/GTX750Ti desktop). About every 3 game turns the screen freezes for about 1-2 sec (with or w/o VSync).Secondly, I've been experiencing some serious stability issues. The longest game session was less than 30 min. Game crashed in both Space and Planetary modes.Third and most annoying thing is that enemies are tremendously overpowered. It might sound like complaining, and not a game problem, but in my opinion it definitely is: I got killed 3 times at the very beginning of the campaign by a training combat drone!			"

												this game is pretty much a running  around trying not to die game unless you hold ctrl shift and type god... then its fun.The game itself is potentialy fun the high costs of items / repair costs and blatent AI cheating really just encourages you to cheat , without the cheats i would have deleted it allready and be on to the next.I dont even bother with planet battles due to the insanity of the cheating For an average gamer with a small amount of time and average experience i really dont recommend it ,if you can handle cheating to learn it can be fun , if theres a trainer which turns certain ai choices / cheating off even better.of course i dont use trainers because of what normaly will come with them is worse then what you need them for but if you are willing to take the risk you probly allready like the game enough and will probly only use it to balance it , i still recommend only useing cheats tho.

It's just not going to ever happen as the first 10 minutes are one of the biggest turn off I've had this year.You'll surely get a lot out of this game if you are willing to watch a lot of YouTube and read Wikis but what's presented here is in no way interested in making a good first impression.

												I won't recommend this game for newbies of the ""serie"". This is an old-school, old-difficult type of game.There is no tutorial or help in the game. You could try to search the help on the net, but it seems most of them are in Russian language.It has a strange mix of techniques to me - turn based flying in space like in some strategy, lots of texts like in the old adventures (no talking of characters, eventhough they have animations of speeking), 3D fights on the planet, ...Music - well what music? Is it midi or what? Very repeatable...Graphical look - could be attractive for somebody, but I expected more from the trailers.It seems to me like a game from 10 years ago with a little polishing. It could be good in those times, but it can't compare with modern gamesDefinitely not worth my time :-(			"

												This is a game I had high hopes for, but it simply let me down.  Your game play will consist of running planet to planet praying for a fight of some kind ... someone, anyone to fight.  Eventually you will stumble into a system with 6-8 enemy ships and they will all instantly swarm you and kill you.The turn based combat is clunky. The randomly generated gear is often useless ... whole planets have 10-20 items for sale.Do not buy this game for full price, find it in a bundle somewhere.  If I had paid full price for this game instead of getting it in a $5 bundle I would be asking for my money back.The game needs to allow you to use bigger ships, or have more than one ship.			"

												The core features/concepts of SR3D are things that I would typically find enjoyable in a game, however the horrendously bad UI - lack of UI scaling - and clunkly control scheme make it a very unenjoyable experience for me.Instead of simple easy to read tool-tips, the game has a static display in tiny (almost unreadable text) right on the bottom edge of your screen. So when you're clicking on a button all the way on the right side of your screen, you have to pan your eyes back to the bottom center of the screen. The text and font used means not only do you have to suffer the annoyance of looking back and forward, but also strain your eyes reading it each time. My frustration with the UI is only equaled by the atrocious control scheme. It's hands-down the most unintuitive and clucky contol system I've ever used.It's a  modern game with some nice ideas, but has all the drawbacks of a 30 year old game in terms of interface and usability. It's not a particularly pretty game., It lacks voice acting, And character models and animations are extremely primitive- but all that could be forgiven if the UI and control system weren't so evil.

												God what a bitter disappointment. I was so hoping for a sandbox to hold a candle to the likes of Escape Velocity, and this fell so short it broke its hip.Can't trade, because so and so race will hate you.Can't kill pirates, whatever race the pirate was will hate you.Can't kill dominators, because your ship SUCKS and they will eat you alive.Your only options, it seems, is to gimp and cheat. Everyone recommends starting pirate just to get the free ship. So, this game is NOT sandbox, or open world, or anything other than a choo-choo failure on railroad to play the way the devs wanted you to play.The upgrade system is rather painful as well. Your cargo space is how much mass your ship has left over. That's loose logic if I ever heard it, because there's nothing in the way of cargo pods to fit on your ship. Oh yeah, and everything is timed. You don't have time to learn the game, because pirates are chomping at your bits, and dominators are chomping at your bits and taking systems and blowing up stations so.. Yeah. Refunded. Bye.P.S. Not even touching that joke of an RTS. Even the die hard fans of this game detest it.			"

												3/5 and only get it if it is on sale.I have played this game before it went HD and I completed it without cheats back then.It was long and tedious. Seeing it on sale on Steam I thought to myself - gonna get it, gonna cheat it, gonna have fun again.And I would like to point this out now - I am all against multiplayer cheaters, skill is all that should matter.However I totally support cheating/modding in single player modes, because poeple should enjoy the game the way they like.Fancy hardcore mode with one life? Go for it. Fancy easy mode with uber-guns and steamrolling through hordes of enemies? Go for it.Above everything else, have fun playing the title.Nope, not here.Space Rangers is a very difficult game and very time consuming. Unfortunatelly quite imbalanced too.Any attempts at using build in cheats or cheat engine will flag your game as 'cheated' and you will get no achievements, no score ranking etc.Keeping that in mind (you might think it is not a big deal, after all) I have to warn you that by playing this game you are in for a quite of a boredom unless you get the mechanics right - and quite a lot of dying as well, so save often before engaging in space combat.Now onto review:Graphics: 3,5/5 It is colourful, eye candy, outdated 2006 graphic style ported into 2013 that will wear you out quickly. Game is not bad looking and there are no graphical issues I can speak of, but it is missing the immersivenes of other space themed titles - colourful nebulas, detailed planets, cool ship graphics - it is not there, do not expect it, don't look for it, don't wait for it. What you see in your first system is all there is.What you see in your first land battle/black hole is also all there is.Gameplay 3/5Planetary quests are hand drawn, text based, old school adventures of choices. They are in some parts very random and you are advised to save prior to starting one. Some of these (like this game of one pawn against 4) require few tries to complete due to random AI movements. Others require you to familiarize with quest first in order to understand it's mechanics. (A warning. Don't dig down in sex-change quest for a Peleng IF you play as a Peleng).Planetary quests are the most difficult part of the game and the most enjoyable. Each is different and unique; this is the only part where Space Rangers really shines.The RTS battles are sometimes simply impossible to win (you will see) and require constant activity (non-stop production and attacking) and are very crappy, but they pay quite well. Space battles and generally things you do in space fall into 2 categories:- making money by scavenging stuff from space/planets, performing easy quests (package delivery, get a quick ship, get all those quests and earn tons of money), or by so called trading (use trading centers to figure out best deals)- running into or away from combat. This is where this game falls flat on it's face and moans in agony. You will need few deaths to get used to general turn-based combat system, targeting, and generally understanding why you do not do any damage.In difference to the original game there is this pirate faction added into the title, but they are just 'meh'. You can either bother yourself with antagonizing pirates (meaning, every system will have a hostile pirate fighters) or going against Coalition (meaning, every system will become hostile), which is just as stupid as it sounds.There is no storyline to speak of. You are a ranger, who wants to become THE Ranger, there are some evil guys (rouge machines) that will shoot you on sight, there are some good guys (basically anyone else) that you can interact with. You either destroy the evil ones (oddly, you can join them, but it is game over with some info that you destroyed good guys) or they destroy everyone else, plain and simple. No twist, no immersion, no nothing. Just us vs them. Unless you cheat in money(and you don't want to in HD edition, as mentioned), you will have to spend first few(or more) years of the game just getting enough to buy a decent ship and components (and by decent I mean the one that lets you fly through dominator's systems and live) and upgrade them with micromodules to the point of usefulness. The real game starts then (you will get a ton of exp/badges by the time you will be ready for combat) only for you to discover that either:- evil ones are too strong and you will have to reconquer dozen of systems (gets very boring very soon, especially since they fight back trying to instantly recapture the system) just to get a chance to get to their homeworlds and destroy bosses- they have been reduced to just a few systems and there is no one left to fight (game will end in next few years)Music 1/5I will give this poor rating for what have been done in HD edition. In original game, music was in .dat format, you could listen to it outside of the game and with some tinkering replace the few poor track with something better. This is no longer the case in HD edition - everything is packed into pkg file. Therefore you are forced to listen to few very good tracks and then be interrupted with few really, really crappy. There is simply nothing you can do with that, as touching game files is out of the question. It's either turning the music off altogether and playing it out of soundtrack (really, a soundtrack was added as a standalone?) or suffering it while you will be pulling your hairs out during some intense (and by that I mean hundreds of missiles aimed at you) space combat.It's 2014 and steam workshop is alive and kicking, yet devs of this game are becoming increasingly paranoid about anyone who buys their stuff actually trying to get more fun out of it by cheating/modding. As such I can't recommend HD edition to you. Get yourself SR2:Reboot, play it, cheat the most annoying parts of it (and there are many), have fun. You won't have much fun here, once you will understand how little profit you can make by trading/missions and see the price tag for decent equipment and how shockingly imbalanced SR really is. This game simply becomes a grind for gold way too soon and stays that way until almost the end. Also some difficulty settings are no longer available on start - they have been moved to 'advanced settings' and using them means your score will not be posted (WTF, really?!). Yes IT IS THAT STUPID AS IT SOUNDS!So in conclusion - there are other titles for you to play for 18€ that you will enjoy much better. This one is not worth that much money.For less than a 5€ however you might give it a go, just don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.You are warned.			"

												First time I've played a game like this so I'll give you my thoughts on the breakdown;I feel that while the game is smooth and I haven't run into any real bugs however the learning curve on this game is a difficult one; Even on normal the enemies seem to be overpowered and it makes combat seem undesireable without first coming up with a diplomatic gameplan of where you want to be 1000 turns in the future, which of course first requires some gaming experience.While I do like the originality in having to know when to pick your battles I feel that its an entirely frustrating experience learning what you can and cannot beat.

												Very good example of terrible sequel. This is what may happen when code monkeys take source code of the great game and try to change it to make money. Yes, do not be confused, this sequel had been made by students, not by developers of the original title. I am not going to tell you about terrible balance, other reviewers did it already. Just set autosave feature to 1 day and game will start to freeze every turn on SSD drive instead of 10 turns(by default). Looks like terrible coders have never heard about threads and parallel execution. Is it so hard to implement save of the game progress in background?If you can live with freezes in the game, you can try it. I would prefer playing previous versions of this game made by professionals.			"

												This may have been a great game, a long long time ago. By now it's just a slow-paced old-school 2D space game - very disappointing compared to e.g. Star Conflict. Thre are even ""Text Missions"" - such as a racing game based on multiple choice text segments instead of actual racing. ""Kill Pirate xyz"" missions where it's near impossible to actually find that guy in time, and if you find him he's bound to have a faster ship and escape. Space combat is a weird and long-term boring mix between real-time and turn-based. Sure, it has some decent elements concerning ship development, but it's strained efforts in being ""funny"" concerning the intercultural relations, while at the same time being ""serious"" about the dominator threat kills the mood for me every time. Not worth the time & money, IMHO.			"

												I've played some trading games and I've played some turn based games (gal civ2 and Patrician). I could not figure out what was going on in Space Rangers. The fonts are small and hard to read. As far as I can see there is no tutorial. I picked a race. I stopped in at a store and got totally confused by what was going on. I think I was buying things and I overloaded my ship but I never saw where  my max load was recorded. I managed to take some things off and got the ship ready for launch. I picked out a destination, at least I think I did and then I took a turn. Time moved on. I could see the date change but I was still in the same building as far as I can tell. If I moved through a vast space and went somewhere else I would have liked to arrive in a place that looked different and maybe seen myself traveling. I expected to see a ship on a map move or something to give me some sense that I was going somewhere. I had no idea where I wanted to go or why I'd want to go anywhere. I read some of the news. They talked about deals somewhere. Nothing appealed so I just decided to go somewhere to see what it would be like.Anyhow, I was so unenthused that I quit. I may give it another try but I don't see the attraction of this game. The various screens have nicely drawn artwork. Very inventive. It looks like they knew what they were doing but they just couldn't be bothered to lead new people through some of the gameplay so they could experience the game. They did have time to put up single spaced walls of text that could make you go blind the lines are so long. I was also annoyed by trying to find the guides on steam in english. The english speaking market buys a lot of games, developers. It might be worth it to show a little competence. There is an in game ""help"". I guess that means reading help goes towards your two hours of trying the game so you might just get stuck with this game because all you did was read the help page. Not cool.			"

												I bought this game because I was under the impression it was developed by the same team that developed the Kings Bounty series, which is a great series.I don't know whether it is the same developer, but I do know that this game is as bad as Kings Bounty is good. I started reading the manual, which is of very little help. The interface in the game is extremely complex and badly designed, Normally I would be willing to put the effort into learning a game but this game is so bad it's not worth it.  "

												So I tried this game - picked it up on sale at some point -  and the first time I played it the TUTORIAL missions sent me to a planet where two enemies attacked and killed me.""That's a bit ♥♥♥♥ed..."" I think to myself.  ""How was I supposed to know they were the enemy?  They had no markings, they just made a bee line for my ship as soon as I entered the system.  Fine, at least I know they're coming, I can be ready for them"".Yeah, nah, you're ♥♥♥♥ed.  Your guns can't do any significant damage to them and your shields are like butter""Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  Perhaps I went to the wrong planet?""  Nope, your Instructor decided to send you to a planet orbited by two guys who want nothing more than to ♥♥♥♥ up your day.So I give it up as a bad idea.Decided to give it another try today.  New game, knowing my instructor is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will sell me out.  Upgrade shields, weapons and engines...Still ♥♥♥♥ed.  Bad guys are even tougher than they were the first time, and I'm somehow doing even less damage.And all this is still in the first three missions of the tutorial.  Aparently all it is going to teach you is that the game, which looks like it could have been a fun top-down space epic, is ♥♥♥♥ed.Don't waste your money.			"

I do enjoy how non-linear it is, but apparently if you don't follow a very sharp level of progression you'll soon be destroyed. Also, planetary battles take hours to do, you can't save midway, and the AI cheats.			"

												This game is basically Star Control without the charm. Game design has come a long way in 20 years, and this doesn't really stand up to the test of time. Although trading and quests are part of the game, and mildly entertaining, the only real long-term solution is violence, which is very unsatisfying in its mechanics. In friendly sectors, you click on a pirate ship to lay in what is supposed to be an intercept course, and set which guns to activate. What actually happens is you face away from your target while he chases you, making all your forward firing missiles take forever to double back and hit your enemy. Then, when he's at half hull, he breaks off and afterburns to a nearby planet to escape destruction, leaving you with nothing to show except a damaged hull and a bunch of empty missiles.In hostile sectors, you get swarmed and die. And don't even mention the RTS surface battles. They should have just cut them—I thought Empire at War's planetary battles were superfluous...but boy were they a treat compared to this. To summarize, the controls are too poor to formulate any consistent tactic, and you're forced to constantly reload to get lucky enough to kill anything. All this time, you're draining your bank account, making it about as hard to get ahead as in real life. It's possible if you're patient, just not fun.			"

												I had this game on my wishlist for probably over a year and after reading a lot of positive reviews I was invested in finally sitting down for a whole evening getting my hands dirty and trying to learn the game with the hope that it would something that I could lose myself in for a long time. However, after playing over the tutorial and the early game for almost three hours I had absolutely nothing to show for it.First I had to dig up the manual to find out what the races and personalities meant. Then, after playing through most of the tutorial I repeatedly died to a training drone (!) because my starting ship was not cut out for it. Then I realised that the game had left my starting equipment on the station without telling me I had to equip it before leaving and managed to beat the tutorial by repeatedly docking to repair mid-combat. Finally, I got into the game proper and can find no indication in the game or in the manual as to how to make enough credits to even keep up with the cost of repairs.I desperately wanted to be able to get into the 'rhythm' of this game so that I could enjoy what appears to be a cornucopia of varied content, but it fought me every step of the way. I am honestly amazed that this experience is not reflected in more of the game's steam reviews. These people must have infinite patience.			"

												This game lacks any sort of decent tutorial, which I find unforgivible for a game with this many features. When you start the game it greets you with tons of options and laps of story text which are not put into any context. Following that you are put into a text heavy conversation with a alien dude. At some point you get the conversasion option to say you are new and sign up for a *training course*. If you do you are just randomly thrown into space and forced to figure out what you got to do and how. Not even something like a simple objective marker is handed to you. Now if you are handy enough and found the ingame menu you will find a help button. This button will bring you to your desktop and open a manual file with you guessed it... another sea of text. So except if you are the kind of person that is really good at reading instruction manuals (that is a skill I tell you) you will find the start of this game super discouraging.This game might be fun but the developer's poor and lazy attempt at explaining the game to new players is just dreadfull. I can't reccomend a complicated game to anyone if there is no good tutorial, period. "

												Откровенное разочарование вышло, хотя роль сыграло и то видимо что игру купил. Сразу как вышла.До версии 1.6.2 играть было относительно сложно и интересно. До тех пор пока пиратская ветка не проявилась во всей красе. Вместо рпг, то есть свободного мира, на ведут по обязательной пиратской линии, с не менее обязательной работой на коал(не мишек, коалицию). Все выглядит как в дешевой ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ской рпг(пародии то есть). Задания в основном простейшие, и не выполняются только при полном отключении головного мозгу. Или при совсем слабом корабле. Ну или при багах, которые ещё правят.Но играть то было интересно, все таки более 100 часов налетал.Несмотря на бесконечных пиратов(игра стала похожа на какое то Diablo), несмотря на вылеты, несмотря на отсутствие логики в сюжете зачастую. До 1.8.2, баланс не особо менялся, а потом разом был угроблен.Слишком легко освобождать системы от пиратов? Давайте дадим им бешеный респаун, маловато старого оружия и врагов, давайте дадим ещё больше.Оружие и враги это правильно, а какого хрена враги респаунились раз в три дня. Если планеты коалиции на такое способны не были....Потом угробили лучший в игре корпус, Тень Империи. Превратив в развалюху на которой наверно теперь летать стесняются.Вот потом игру и забросил, как и все форумы рейнджеров. Я фанат старых частей и Революции старой, её отшлифовали до совершенства.ЗЫ. Сильные стороны игры - Текстовые квесты, отдельные планетарные битвы(иде важен самостоятельный контроль, а не зерг роботами), старая музыка, графика в целом, тексты.Недостатки - Баланс из заднего места(играю терь в пиратскую старую версию), новая музыка, сюжет, переставший быть свободным игровой процесс.

												Ok... this game might have been good in 2002.Now it's 2014 and it's production like this which give the genre a bad name.I played for 2 hours just to give it a good test... here is how it goes. I started a game by choosing at random in a load of what seem to be pointless options. The game proposed me a tutorial after read about a dozen wall of texts. The game even lampshades it's being annoying by doing so. I hurt my eyes looking at the small print everywhere. Then I bought some probes, when to explore mercury (sounded like a good idea) and when outside of mercury, some pirate asked for twice my total money otherwise it kills me. Then a second one joined. Now I can't leave the planet - not that I could beat the first one. After a half hours of tests I managed to kill them (with the help of random military ships in the system) but 2 more joined... and I spend most of my money repairing my ship. It feels like endless grind. I didn't even play 2 hours.Apart from the obviously bad balancing in this game (really ? getting camped in the STARTING SYSTEM ???), combat done in the tutorial feels VERY bland, just point in a direction and shoot automatically if you didn't forget to ask it to shoot. Inventory is very small, there seems to be about 8 things possible to trade, repair costs are prohibitive, mini-games... uhg. I started the ""robot war"" thingy. Ok, it kind of does allow for infinite money in the main game at the cost of not playing the main game. It's about as fun as the ""just before space"" war in spore with the Fun part taken out of it. Oh wait, there is no fun part in that phase of spore... and this is even worse. Trading is... trading. Mining is shooting at ships and waiting for more asteroids to come. Exploration consists in loading probes and clicking ""end turn"" until it's done - and mostly you can't take everything beause inventory is sooo small. And the walls of text in very small print which hurt my eyes on top of it.I imagine that some of the defects I speak of are alleviated later in the game, but the start did such a good job in disgusting me I can't even think of going to look.I can't recommend this. It's game like that which keeps the space games down. I'm glad I got it in a sale for 5 euros, but it's not even worth this low amount of money.PS:Sadly, this game shows the limitations of the review system in Steam. When a game has a ""cult"" following a load of hardcore fans flock to the game, block bad reviews, and flood the store with ""good"" reviews. Don't be fooled, this game is fully deserving of the low reviews it deserves on metacritic.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  No, I REALLY wanted to like this game.  It reminded me of another space exploration/ combat/ merchant game I used to love to play called Escape Velocity.  This was slightly different, what with the turn based movement/ combat and a RTS-type aspect with the ground combat.  But I thought that would just add to the enjoyment.  My biggest problem with this game (and the reason I uninstalled it) is that they tell you nothing about anything.  You are thrown to the wolves from day one.  They do have a minor tutorial that ""instructs"" you how to play.  It took me dying 5 times in the tutorial (THE TUTORIAL) to realize that most of the useful information is displayed as a microscopic toolbar down in the bottom left of your screen.  After I saw that, I actually managed to make it past the tutorial only to die promptly thereafter to a random pirate (this wasn't in hard mode, mind you).  Also, there are so many little markings and symbols that don't have a description.  These things should be helping you, but instead just make me ask, ""Why give me descriptors that are in no way descriptive or helpful?""  There are 2 very different combat modes (one of which they don't bother explaining at all).  All-in-all, this game was just massively frustrating.This could be an AMAZING game.  All they would have to do is help you understand how the game works.  Instead, they throw you the (incomplete) Dummies guide to brain surgery and say, ""good luck, sucker.""  I will gladly pick it up again if I learn that they have added an actual descriptive explanation of how to play the game.			"

												If 'No Man's Sky' became literally no man's sky now, Space rangers could be called 'Man's Sky' as it really has active, dynamic space. It is an awesome sci-fi game that is such an RPG that is also an RTS, TBS, text adventure, dynamic trade & eco sim, adventure and everything in-between. In the case of such a game it is inevitable to be repetitive in a way (think of Freelancer) but Space Rangers solves this phenomenon with variety. The game includes so many elements / game genres that make most similar game concepts collapse and fail. Space Rangers works fine because it can successfully balance everything with seemingly no effort while you are on the mission of s(l)aving the galaxy.If No Man's Sky had just the fracture under the belt it would make a great game.

												I've already put hundreds if not thousands of hours into this game, so when I saw continued interest and some new features for Steam I was seriously pumped. Long story short, this is a universe that really moves and lives on its own without you. I've rushed across galaxies to pick up a new warp drive just to see another ranger get there before me and buy it. I've escaped Galaxies just before they were crushed under robotic oppression. It really is just a great idea and executed well. I wish more games and even other genres would take pointers in their open worlds. Really the only criticism I can give is the ground battles are a little bit uninspired for an rts... they have some good ideas but it just gets very repetitive. But there is literally an option in the game to skip them and never play them, so it's just another example of how they are in touch with their audience.			"

												This is a lil part in an e-mail I sent to the publisher support or something, idk if i sent it to the right guy. All I fell about this game combine in this, and I ask them if they have SR2 Reboot on steam so i can buy it but they dont. Introduce, etc""I'm from Vietnam and I'm a fan of Space Rangers series especially Space Rangers 2, I've played it since I was a 6-grade-kid. It's over 10 years for the first time I played Space Rangers 2 and sadly, its a cracked version. I bought SR2 from a cd store and in Vietnam at that time, we don't have the conception is paying for games, we just buy a cracked cd game, the price is about 1$ (I'm so sorry about that).I really love Space Rangers. After playing the first Space Rangers 2, I always looking for the next version of it, and it lead me to SR2:Dominators, SR2:Reboot and SRHD. When i know that SRHD is going to be released, I was so glad and exciting, I though that the developers forgot the SR series. But in that time, I still play the cracked games.16 months ago, I began to know about paid games and found out Steam store and after a year, I decided to buy real games instead of download the cracked versions from the Internet. The reason why it took me a year is I finally can make my own money 5 months ago. You guys may think that this is not a big deal at all because it's a normal thing in your country, but to me, it's a very big step, some of my friends do think I'm crazy. And I chose Steam to buy games, but it's hard for me to find all the Space Rangers games that was released on Steam store. I bought the Space Rangers, Space Rangers HD, but I couldn't find where to buy Space Rangers 2: Reboot. I tried to find how to buy it for weeks and when I know it's hopeless to find more, I decided to send this email to 1C Company. I know that the game removed from Steam store but I really really want to buy it. So can I ask for a favor? Can you give some email address or website of the seller that sell SR2R Steam cd-key/gift? Or if you can sell it to me, please tell me the payment, I'll pay it with a reasonalbe price (it's a shame, I'm sorry for that, I'm just a student with a not-much-than-1$-an-hour-part-time-job).""I dont have much but if you or someone you know have SR2 Reboot, add me and give me a price, i'll buy it asap i got enough the money, tks all			"

												This game... this game...I grow up with it, i asked my frend for a game back when i was in school, and when he gave me this, i was blown away, i must admit i had a hard time figuring stuff out when i was first playing it but men, when i figured this stuff out it was the single greatest expirience i ewer had with a game, i could play it for hours, days, weeks and never get tired of it, i must say i never got in to planetary battels and latter they added a dialogue option to never get quest's bassed on it, that was an improvement, other thing i never got in to is battels in black holes, they suposte to represent arcade games, but i just found it hard because of the camera angle, but 2 of this things are almost completly optional, you will have to get in the black hole to fight one of the bosses, but its not a hard fight.But i runned in another problem, when this game came out it was for the Russian audience, so most of the writings and jokes lose thiere charm when translated, same with films, but i could not realy care for that if not for 1 single thing. English version has only 27 text quest's when russian version has 71 of them, that is a gaint bumer, people who dont speak russian not gona enjoy one of the best things this game has to offer. Other then that? Backstory, yeah, same issue as the one abowe but you cant realy fix it, you see, a big part of the dialogue is telling us abbaut some one called ""Rachehan"" and somthing called ""Machpella"" (sorry if i spelled it wrong).Rachehan is a greatest pirat the universe has ever known and Machpella was the danger that fallen on the universe but you probably dont know that, as you probably dont know that this is actualy a SECOND installment in Space Rangers franchise, originaly it has been called ""Space Rangers 2: Dominators"" and latter was ""Space Rangers 2: Dominators Reloaded"" then there was a fan addon ""Space Rangers 2: Revolution"" and then it has become ""Space Rangers HD: Revolution"" as an official release, and then ""Space Rangers HD: A War Appart"", so when you reding this right now and you never playd Space Rangers 1 you might say: ""Where can i get this game? Im intrested in this game but i dont want to go in it without backstory"", tough poop its not available, its not on steam, and there is no stores that sell it from what i know, CD with it are probably still alive but you will have issues running it on new PC.Bottom line, it would be better if it was 100% transleted, other then that, i spended over 800 hours playng it back when i was yong, and its still... AWESOME!i r8 10\10 M8YEAH!			"

												There is only one thing I can say in criticism for this game, and it's this: its translation team didn't do a stellar job. That isn't to say they did a bad job, because the worst that could be said is their writing was a bit difficult to understand.The rest of the game is a veritable gem. And it's a game that's still getting polish, because it's still getting updates and content that add depth to the game. I first bought the game ages ago and enjoyed it then and recently came back to discover that they'd added a great deal without me having paid a penny for it.			"

												edit: reading other comments, lowering difficulty does not help, pirates are OP and they own you. Such a disappointment. Just play original SR 2, much more fun.Not really recommended on normal difficulty. It is harcore on normal difficulty. I have played original space rangers, it was so much fun. Difficult sometimes but not impossible. This one is overall much better, but the difficulty kills the game value. As I have finished the original, I cant even progress on this one at normal difficulty, may be it is me I dont know.FOR THE ORIGINAL: One of the best games ever. Gives you the old good gaming enjoyment. Once you start playing, it sucks you in.			"

												It's an update for good old Space Rangers 2 (which is good) with a bit of bad things. At first it was fine, but then...- Addon developers have strange sense of humor and put stupid russian internet memes in scenarios, in graphics, for some reason they consider that this is funny- A lot of unbalanced content. For example I can suddenly receive bad-♥♥♥ ship for no particular reason, and destroy almost anyone, in current state of gameNew music is bad, compared to old one. Beside that new music is a lot louder than older and that makes difference even more audible. Actually, a lot of «new» content looking out of place.I would say original game is 10/10 and addon is 5/10, just for hd resolution and stuff.			"

												This game has a lot of good points and several not so good points. I recommend getting if it's on sale.ProsLots to do (Missions, Trading, Text Quests, Planetary Battles)Open WorldLots of upgradesWorld feels aliveCan command a team of rangersPiracy is funPirate route is interestingConsLack of Player impactPlanetary battles quite weakText quests can be annoyingFighting dominators can be a painLack of options when investing in projectsOverall I have had a lot of fun with this game. I first played it back in 2006 when i read a review on some game site. While the game is fun with lots to do, it can be frustrating at times. You really can't affect the state of affairs in the galaxy. While you can invest in projects and purchase fleets and stations, these have little affect. If they had allowed you to build a fleet and have more control over building up the coalition and which systems to attack it would have been a much better game. Planetary battles are just not that fun, the play control and the design of the minigame is just a bad RTS. I just skip these, but unfortunately you lose out on a lot of potential income. Hopefully another similar game will be released that takes what is good about this game and gives it more options so the player can affect the game world more directly.			"

												An obscure classic from russian developers that never got that much traction outside due to almost non-existing advertisement.The game is centered around living as the Ranger, one of the more or less independent vagabonds loosely employed by union of races in order to combat a threat of extreme magnitude. Most of the game is spent in a 2D top-down world that utilizes turn-based system that is usually working as a real-time, until you need to change your commands to something else. The world is extremely lively and probably one of the best simulations out there on the market. NPC are diverse in their goals, participate in combat and trading. In general, the world is living and breathing without much care for the actions of the player.With that said, the game is anything but simplistic. Player is provided with variety of activities and while some of them are pretty basic (like trading), the sheer diversity is more than enough to compensate. It features one of the best text-based quests I've seen in games in a form of mini-game, somewhat fun real time arcade style combat inside wormholes, a full fledged RTS ground battles mini-game (sadly, with rather exploitive enemy AI). It is perfectly possible to gather a lot of money and experience without participating in the combat. For the most part.After all, the threat of Dominators, enemies in this particular game, is ever present. With the addition of Pirates as the third faction. The map is regularly changing, with star systems getting preyed upon or liberated constantly. The tug of war is very well simulated, to the point where its perfectly possible for the Dominators to actually achieve full victory over opposing races on higher difficulties, if the player is either too passive or too unlucky. Similarly, the Pirates and Military don't wait for the players explicit desire to fight a battle. They mount regular assaults, in which you can participate, but they certainly aren't going to wait for your arrival. The uphill battle is very well demonstrated at the beginning, with Dominators possessing extremely potent weapons and ships, with even smallest ones suparssing most of the ships available to the player and Military. Only down the road the research pushes boundaries of current weapons and ships, ultimately giving you a pretty substantial chance of engaging even a small enemy fleets on your own. That is if you're not lucky to pick up a miraculously intact Dominator weapon from one of the ships that was brought down by combined effort.All in all, this game should be quite enjoyable for those seeking complexity and longevity in a seemingly simplistic package. The game has plenty of downsides, but so does something like Mount & Blade. At such a low price point, it is definitely something worth trying out, if you like what you see in the videos.			"

If you ever find something CLOSE to this let me know so i can buy it , to summarize :You are a person living on the future where there is an menace in the form of an ""robot intelligence"" that is divided in 3 categories and is comming slowly overtaking the galaxy , on the other hand there are lots of races and mainly the pirates , the military and the rangers (wich you are one) plus the civilians in an open universe whre you choose to do what you want as a player, will you become a military supporter , or a pirate or an rogue dude , or a space ranger with companions or an cargo ship , its all YOUR choice , but BEWARE the machines are COMING and you play a CENTRAL role on suppressing it or let the universe be taken by it for the tecnology advances as time goes by , new weapons are developed new engines new thingys and new ship designs that can make you rock  (but on the same pace will the machines and the overall world) dude THIS GAME ROCKS you can become like a ranger with 6 companions raid an dominator (the robots race that are consuming the universe to make it more suitable for em) controlled system and liberate it for the side you chose be it the military or the pirates , Raise your ranks and be the best one on any side or break everything and everyone!.Will you die in a prison in some planet for your crimes or will you save it from invading dominators? .

												This game is like a bunch of minigames all thrown together.  The main game is a spaceship/trading game,  you upgrade your ship and fight in turn based combat.  There's a lot of freedom you can be a pirate or trader for example,  different ships have different strenghts.  There's also a bunch of ""text quest"" minigames which are completely optional but can give you good amounts of credits to upgrade your ship,  some are really good but others are a bit tedious.   There's also optional RTS missions which I don't like much but they are short and give good rewards so I'll try each once and skip it if fail once.  The game is a bit of a mixed bag but the main game is solid and oddly addicting.  Early on you have to rely a lot on other rangers and military ships to fight the dominators (evil AI) but you can eventually become very powerful and hire up to 6 NPC ships and capture enemy systems by yourself.

												Probably the most freedom I've ever had in a sci-fi space game, you can do alot of things such as be a war hero while occasionally working as a part-time delivery boy that also sells weapons to pirates on the side.The combat is simple but pretty interesting during the later stages of the game, and the quests themseleves can be pretty amusing, from the way their described to sometimes what you have to do.The trading is, again, relatively simple but still complex enough that you won't be bored of it for a long while, it certainly alot more fleshed out than trading in most other games that don't focus on it.The music is ambient and fits the tone of the game.And the minigames are pretty fun themselves, with only planetary battles being a mixed bag for me due to how they work strategically.All in all I say you'll get you moneys worth out of this game, and probably more.

												An obscure classic from russian developers that never got that much traction outside due to almost non-existing advertisement.The game is centered around living as the Ranger, one of the more or less independent vagabonds loosely employed by union of races in order to combat a threat of extreme magnitude. Most of the game is spent in a 2D top-down world that utilizes turn-based system that is usually working as a real-time, until you need to change your commands to something else. The world is extremely lively and probably one of the best simulations out there on the market. NPC are diverse in their goals, participate in combat and trading. In general, the world is living and breathing without much care for the actions of the player.With that said, the game is anything but simplistic. Player is provided with variety of activities and while some of them are pretty basic (like trading), the sheer diversity is more than enough to compensate. It features one of the best text-based quests I've seen in games in a form of mini-game, somewhat fun real time arcade style combat inside wormholes, a full fledged RTS ground battles mini-game (sadly, with rather exploitive enemy AI). It is perfectly possible to gather a lot of money and experience without participating in the combat. For the most part.After all, the threat of Dominators, enemies in this particular game, is ever present. With the addition of Pirates as the third faction. The map is regularly changing, with star systems getting preyed upon or liberated constantly. The tug of war is very well simulated, to the point where its perfectly possible for the Dominators to actually achieve full victory over opposing races on higher difficulties, if the player is either too passive or too unlucky. Similarly, the Pirates and Military don't wait for the players explicit desire to fight a battle. They mount regular assaults, in which you can participate, but they certainly aren't going to wait for your arrival. The uphill battle is very well demonstrated at the beginning, with Dominators possessing extremely potent weapons and ships, with even smallest ones suparssing most of the ships available to the player and Military. Only down the road the research pushes boundaries of current weapons and ships, ultimately giving you a pretty substantial chance of engaging even a small enemy fleets on your own. That is if you're not lucky to pick up a miraculously intact Dominator weapon from one of the ships that was brought down by combined effort.All in all, this game should be quite enjoyable for those seeking complexity and longevity in a seemingly simplistic package. The game has plenty of downsides, but so does something like Mount & Blade. At such a low price point, it is definitely something worth trying out, if you like what you see in the videos.			"

												There is only one thing I can say in criticism for this game, and it's this: its translation team didn't do a stellar job. That isn't to say they did a bad job, because the worst that could be said is their writing was a bit difficult to understand.The rest of the game is a veritable gem. And it's a game that's still getting polish, because it's still getting updates and content that add depth to the game. I first bought the game ages ago and enjoyed it then and recently came back to discover that they'd added a great deal without me having paid a penny for it.			"

												This game... this game...I grow up with it, i asked my frend for a game back when i was in school, and when he gave me this, i was blown away, i must admit i had a hard time figuring stuff out when i was first playing it but men, when i figured this stuff out it was the single greatest expirience i ewer had with a game, i could play it for hours, days, weeks and never get tired of it, i must say i never got in to planetary battels and latter they added a dialogue option to never get quest's bassed on it, that was an improvement, other thing i never got in to is battels in black holes, they suposte to represent arcade games, but i just found it hard because of the camera angle, but 2 of this things are almost completly optional, you will have to get in the black hole to fight one of the bosses, but its not a hard fight.But i runned in another problem, when this game came out it was for the Russian audience, so most of the writings and jokes lose thiere charm when translated, same with films, but i could not realy care for that if not for 1 single thing. English version has only 27 text quest's when russian version has 71 of them, that is a gaint bumer, people who dont speak russian not gona enjoy one of the best things this game has to offer. Other then that? Backstory, yeah, same issue as the one abowe but you cant realy fix it, you see, a big part of the dialogue is telling us abbaut some one called ""Rachehan"" and somthing called ""Machpella"" (sorry if i spelled it wrong).Rachehan is a greatest pirat the universe has ever known and Machpella was the danger that fallen on the universe but you probably dont know that, as you probably dont know that this is actualy a SECOND installment in Space Rangers franchise, originaly it has been called ""Space Rangers 2: Dominators"" and latter was ""Space Rangers 2: Dominators Reloaded"" then there was a fan addon ""Space Rangers 2: Revolution"" and then it has become ""Space Rangers HD: Revolution"" as an official release, and then ""Space Rangers HD: A War Appart"", so when you reding this right now and you never playd Space Rangers 1 you might say: ""Where can i get this game? Im intrested in this game but i dont want to go in it without backstory"", tough poop its not available, its not on steam, and there is no stores that sell it from what i know, CD with it are probably still alive but you will have issues running it on new PC.Bottom line, it would be better if it was 100% transleted, other then that, i spended over 800 hours playng it back when i was yong, and its still... AWESOME!i r8 10\10 M8YEAH!			"

												Love this game, and am absolutely ecstatic that it was revamped to work on modern PCs.Finding that epic hull, using modules and scientific upgrades to bring your weapons and defenses to insanely high standards, finishing quests ahead of schedule to get that bonus money, engaging in the planetside strategy battles, there are so many little things like those that make playing this game so rewarding.Now if you REALLY want a challenge, try opening fire on every species' military ships. Nothing like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the entire universe for kicks.			"

												edit: reading other comments, lowering difficulty does not help, pirates are OP and they own you. Such a disappointment. Just play original SR 2, much more fun.Not really recommended on normal difficulty. It is harcore on normal difficulty. I have played original space rangers, it was so much fun. Difficult sometimes but not impossible. This one is overall much better, but the difficulty kills the game value. As I have finished the original, I cant even progress on this one at normal difficulty, may be it is me I dont know.FOR THE ORIGINAL: One of the best games ever. Gives you the old good gaming enjoyment. Once you start playing, it sucks you in.			"

												Amazing game, the one that truly bears the spirit of a saying ""From Russia with love.."".""+"" :1. Sand-box universe newly generated each new game.2. Huge amount of side activities, some of them could be skipped if you don't like something in particular.3. Multiple endings.4. A DAMN HUGE MASSIVE GIGANTIC amount of humor (that point is valid for russian version, I don't played an english one).5. RPG elements are well implemented.""-"":1. Planetary invasion battles (imho!). This activity is not obligatory and could be skipped, yet there are unique rewards for doing it. My personal dislike is based that it is very easy to learn and VERY HARD to master. Sometimes impossible to complete the mission with positive results if all dominator factions decide to gang up against you. I really wish that kinf of activity was turn-based. Anyway, I do highly recommend this game  if you are enjoying flying space ships, trading things, being treated like super hero (sometimes - like stupid super hero :}}}} ), exploring strange things, shooting bad guys (or good guys, if you prefer that), puzzle solving and saving the universe after all of above mentioned.

												It's an update for good old Space Rangers 2 (which is good) with a bit of bad things. At first it was fine, but then...- Addon developers have strange sense of humor and put stupid russian internet memes in scenarios, in graphics, for some reason they consider that this is funny- A lot of unbalanced content. For example I can suddenly receive bad-♥♥♥ ship for no particular reason, and destroy almost anyone, in current state of gameNew music is bad, compared to old one. Beside that new music is a lot louder than older and that makes difference even more audible. Actually, a lot of «new» content looking out of place.I would say original game is 10/10 and addon is 5/10, just for hd resolution and stuff.			"

												Awesome game, very addictive.Turn based 2D space sort-of-RPG (RPG because your character has a few stats that you increase for XP, you customize equipment of your ship, and because you can roleplay your own path - be a corsair, trader, mercenary, goody-two-shoes hero...), arcade minigame (in back holes), real time strategy missions (sometimes on inhabited planets), old fashioned text based minigames (some missions on inhabited planets, also if you get thrown into prison).The game world (galaxy is randomly generated for each gameplay) is very alive and goes on regardless of your progress - you can affect it, of course (and various alien races will like or hate you for your actions), but it doesn't stop and wait just because you decided to waste time (or got thrown into prison :D ).There are basically three warring factions, out of which two you can join, the third are the main bad guys. These factions actively mount offensive and defense of their territory and take over planetary systems from each other (in case of the bad guys there are also three sub-factions that fight each other). At the beginning of a playthrough you are just a small fish in a sea of sharks (on higher difficulties i definitely don't recommend to take part in the war, before you have some decent ship and equipment), and by the end you will be liberating systems pretty much single-handedly.The economy part of the game (i.e. trading commodities and change of prices) is nicely done. NPC ships fly around trade commodities and buy new equipment (so the equip stores are not just for you - if you see that there is a nice peace of equip on some distant planet, you may want to hurry).Terrific alien races.The ship equipment, variety of weapons and variety of equipable or usable artefacts is also very nicely done.Quality of available equpment changes over playthrough, depending on how much in-game time has passed.A few negatives that need mentioning though- in RTS part, AI of your units is dumb as a tree stump, much micromanagement required, at least in my experience- in RTS you can't save, so you have to do everything in one go, which is inconvenient (it however also prevents save-scam and thus increases difficulty which is nice, albeit sometimes a little frustrating)- the GUI could be a little confusing for a new player (easy solution, just try out all the buttons on screen and see what they do)- it is easy to mess up the beginning if you don't know what you're doing and the in-game tutorial doesn't cover everything (saving often helps and i'd recommend to start one playthrough on easy and play it at least for an hour or two to learn the basics)			"

												This is a lil part in an e-mail I sent to the publisher support or something, idk if i sent it to the right guy. All I fell about this game combine in this, and I ask them if they have SR2 Reboot on steam so i can buy it but they dont. Introduce, etc""I'm from Vietnam and I'm a fan of Space Rangers series especially Space Rangers 2, I've played it since I was a 6-grade-kid. It's over 10 years for the first time I played Space Rangers 2 and sadly, its a cracked version. I bought SR2 from a cd store and in Vietnam at that time, we don't have the conception is paying for games, we just buy a cracked cd game, the price is about 1$ (I'm so sorry about that).I really love Space Rangers. After playing the first Space Rangers 2, I always looking for the next version of it, and it lead me to SR2:Dominators, SR2:Reboot and SRHD. When i know that SRHD is going to be released, I was so glad and exciting, I though that the developers forgot the SR series. But in that time, I still play the cracked games.16 months ago, I began to know about paid games and found out Steam store and after a year, I decided to buy real games instead of download the cracked versions from the Internet. The reason why it took me a year is I finally can make my own money 5 months ago. You guys may think that this is not a big deal at all because it's a normal thing in your country, but to me, it's a very big step, some of my friends do think I'm crazy. And I chose Steam to buy games, but it's hard for me to find all the Space Rangers games that was released on Steam store. I bought the Space Rangers, Space Rangers HD, but I couldn't find where to buy Space Rangers 2: Reboot. I tried to find how to buy it for weeks and when I know it's hopeless to find more, I decided to send this email to 1C Company. I know that the game removed from Steam store but I really really want to buy it. So can I ask for a favor? Can you give some email address or website of the seller that sell SR2R Steam cd-key/gift? Or if you can sell it to me, please tell me the payment, I'll pay it with a reasonalbe price (it's a shame, I'm sorry for that, I'm just a student with a not-much-than-1$-an-hour-part-time-job).""I dont have much but if you or someone you know have SR2 Reboot, add me and give me a price, i'll buy it asap i got enough the money, tks all			"

												This is a great game in my view really fun starting with a tiny ship and ending up with a massive cruiser with the larges guns the galaxy has ever invented is the first thing great about this game the n you have the progression of the game as you progress the galaxy gets bigger revealing more planets and systems these systems also change hands with the different factions in the game which you can directly alter and the way you can choose your style of play is great chose to be a soldier constantly on the front lines to the quiet life of a trader or even be the most infamous pirate in the galaxy this galaxy is always different each time you start up as well really making replayable and the different quests from courier quests to rts quests and text quests all in all a brilliant game			"
