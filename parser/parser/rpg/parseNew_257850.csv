												I am partially colorblind, red/green, and as a result I cannot tell what is going on in this game. Before you take to the comments to berate me or tell me how stupid my review is, please understand: I am not saying this is a bad game. I am advising that others with my eye conditions or similar use caution when purchasing. This has the marks of a great game, and I fully expect this will get downvoted for being a negative mark on an otherwise stellar review trend, but this is for other people who have red/green color issues as I do: Hyper Light Drifter requires you to be able to decipher what is happening with speed and agility. I cannot - because I cannot differentiate the color palette well enough to follow the way things are happening. As an example, dodging those little laser birds is near impossible for me due to the tones of color used to mark where they are shooting and how it blurs into the floor coloring - but my brother and wife can get them immediately.I was really, really into the vibe of the opening sequence and the environments I have seen are haunting and raise tons of questions; who is the drifter? Whose world is this? What happened to all these people I see laying dead around the areas I am wandering, and what in the hell are those decaying titans? I don't know, but I doubt I can play this well enough to see it through - I can't get to the first boss. The soundtrack is fantastic, and the combat is quite enjoyable when I can see what is happeneing. It's smooth, easliy controlled, and rather lethal. Groups of enemies will swarm you at once. I've always found it wierd when you get surrounded by enemies and they wait to attack you one or two at a time - none of that here. These things want you dead and will work to see that through. It's refreshing. The dash gives you that extra bit of mobilty and lets you reposition easily, though it can just as easily get you killed if you don't mind where you dash to and the dash cooldown.All the atmosphere, wonderful music and lovely art in the world, however, can't help me read the patterns of enemies that use colors I can't see very well to telegraph their attacks. And since you can't advance without clearing the rooms of enemies in most cases, I am stuck.EDIT: All right, a few notes since this has gotten much, much more attention than I expected: This is a warning to my fellow colorblind or color impaired folks, not a mark against the game, guys. Contacting the developers is a great idea, and I will do so. However, beyond that, where do most people go to check for what others say about a game? For potential issues? The reviews. If this review doesn't apply to you, that is great! You have good eyes. Be grateful you can enjoy things like this with no issue. And in that case, please move along. To anyone thinking that I am demanding the game cater to me, that is simply not the case. I am not trying to trash anyone's favorite game here, nor have I suggested it was bad because of my vision issues. If you don't like the negative mark, I am sorry but take that up with Steam. I am stuck with a binary review grade, yes/no, and it doesn't work at all for people noting concerns like this. And since I can't mark it any differently, I am stuck having to mark it down with the explanation that I am not actually marking the game down but that I am not able to recommend the game to people with my issues. I can't even play it, how could I recommend it to other color impaired people who also may not be able to play?			"

												REVIEW OF BETA: FINAL RELEASE MAY DIFFERHyper Light Drifter is a MERCILESS action adventure game, somewhere between a post-apocalyptic Zelda and a cyberpunk thriller. There are no instructions, no warnings, and the game does not hold your hand - it just throws you into a trial by fire, and I constantly felt that I was just barely holding on.The game gives you two weapons (at a time), a sword, the ability to rapidly dodge short distances, and precious few hit points, and then brings on wave after wave of enemies, all with strong AI that are not afraid to flank you or attack you en masse. Multiple enemy types with various strengths and weaknesses constantly joined forces to put me into harrowing positions that I could just barely eek may way through. Any gamer who has ever watched a game and incredulously thought, ""Why are they lining up and attacking one at a time? No one would ever do that,"" will love this game. The challenge level is real, even in (for lack of a better description) platforming elements, where the player's blink/teleport/dodge is utilized like a real game element, and not just a ""press x to not die"" style safety button. But even when you do die (and you will... a lot), death is never overly penalized. In my many, many deaths playing this Beta, I never felt overwhelmed at a need to replay huge chunks of the game; the checkpoint system is invisible, which is to say executed perfectly.The game drips atmosphere. Without anything even resembling a story being delivered, I feel like I know this world; it could also be that the team has just perfectly captured the feeling of a dystopian dream, including the earnestness of the character you're playing. I don't know what the Drifter wants, or why, but I do know that no one would go through all of this unless it was truly life or death. The pixel style artwork is phenomenal, even if the 2D/3D design sometimes tricks the eye a bit when giving the illusion of depth and height simultaneously. The music is INSANELY good. Rich, deep, mysterious, and in the style of the artwork, evokes what might have been in a masterpiece of the 8bit/16bit era.I can't recommend this game enough. My only complaint about the beta was its length. I'm dying to play more. If anyone has any questions, feel free to message me.			"

												You know what?I was so ready to give this game a negative review. Sure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked out of you.After I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.			"

												I love exploring in games and turning up hidden treasures. They don't even have to be actual treasures, just interesting little bits of scenery or lore to take in. For people like me, Hyper Light Drifter is just about everything we could ask for, untold secrets densely packed across a vibrant alien world. Coupled with a story that hinges on those very secrets, and combat that comes in intense bursts between journeys, this has easily become one of my favorite games to explore.I'm not even going to make an attempt at Hyper Light Drifter's story because divining it for yourself is part of the game's appeal. It opens with a blast of intense images full of destruction and foreboding, and then sets you into the world at a forlorn campsite in the middle of... somewhere. Your ultimate goal is to activate four devices at the cardinal corners of the world, for reasons that will become apparent in due time. The story that goes along with this grand journey is told in the places you find, the scenes you witness, and the textless interactions you have with the strange inhabitants of this colorful world.And boy howdy, colorful it is. I can only assume that's what drew your attention to HLD in the first place, because screenshots of it are plenty intense on their own. Everything in the game is rendered in chunky pixels of incredible color saturation, finding you in purple and fuchsia dungeons, perfect cerulean lakes, or sea green forests of crystal. The landscapes are just as detailed as they are hued, with little telling cracks in stone or hints of recent disturbances in ancient tombs. This combination of color and detail can make the lay of the land hard to understand at first, but an hour or so with the game's many cliffs and traps will get you adjusted to the delightfully garish art.Once you get accustomed to traversing the alien landscapes, you'll have no end of discoveries to make there. Most of your time is going to be spent exploring the world, marveling at the grand and somber ruins of past civilization, and scrounging up loot from within its bones. Nearly every scene in the game has a secret platform or passage tucked away that leads to money for upgrades or keys for unlocking doors or stranger things still. There are small tells that can hint at secrets but to get the most out of the game you'll need to sniff them out yourself, pressing on every wall and attempting daring dashes across bottomless expanses. The exploration is incredibly rewarding, not just in how much there is to find but how secrets themselves reveal bits of environmental storytelling, like skeletons gathered around a still-burning campfire.The other part of the game is combat, and I hope you're ready for a drastic departure from everything I've just described so far. As beautiful and relaxing as wandering the world is, battling its less-neighborly denizens is an intense, lightning-fast exercise. Enemies tend to have quick, far-reaching attacks with conspicuous telegraphing, requiring you to use your near-instant dash to dodge and re-position for the sword hits to dispatch them. You'll catch on pretty quick in the early fights with simple lunging enemies, but before long you'll be facing hulking monstrosities with ground-shaking strikes, alien swordsmen that slash just as fast as you, and hordes of those same simple enemies you thought were no trouble before. Surviving battles means finding openings, managing the health and positions of all your foes, and dashing like a Tracer main on angel dust. Especially after unlocking the chain dash that lets you blink all over the map.You'll have plenty of tools to help you survive and succeed, including guns, bombs, sword upgrades, and new dash abilities. All of these can be purchased using the credits you find so diligent exploration is key to combat, as well. You carry a supply of medkits that can restore your paltry five blocks of health but it's more to cover for single mistakes, rather than tanking hits through an extended fight. The bosses will definitely put you to the test, having enormous health bars and attacks that can hit multiple times from multiple angles. Late game fights have an element of bullet hell to them as well, which will challenge your reflexes to either dodge or reflect with your sword.Reaching the end of this grand journey will take you 5 to 6 hours, and every minute of that will be spent in the depths and expanses of a fully realized alien world. The designers behind Hyper Light Drifter know how to craft amazing vistas and startling scenery, because you'll be coming across it constantly. And the adventure doesn't end when the credits roll, because I guarantee there will still be loads of secrets to turn up, including hidden upgrades and bosses. Along with full New Game + and Boss Rush modes, you can spend well over a dozen hours here without seeing everything. And with so much wonder and mystery around every corner, there's absolutely no reason not to.			"

Posted: June 12, 2016
												It took me a bit of time to compose my thoughts and write up a little on this game. Overall this feels like a tribute to old zelda games mixed in with a sense of souls game type difficulty and execution.After the intro, which will bore your eardrums you have a brief tutorial that adequatly teaches you how to play. There is your energy sword, gun, dash. Basics of combat and exploration. Outside of tooltips there is no actual text in the game (unless you count the created alphabet and messages with it that is part of the game). This is a story that if you want to fully understand you will have to work at it. Pay attention to detail and reason it out a bit. I personally don't care. To me primarily gameplay is why I play games. This game at least had an appealing atmosphere and a good soundtrack to help set it.The art is from my perspective well done. Graphics as with any game will ultimately be subjective. If you don't like pixel art I don't see this changing your mind. If you do you may find a great deal of appreciation for this title, at least on that end.Personally combat is the reason why I enjoy this game as much as I do. Why I decided to play through NG+ (think of it like this game's hard mode, where a lot of things will kill you in one hit). Mechanic wise the game is fair. It can be difficult, but never feels unfair. You can always get better. Learn to chain dash more efficiently (requires just frame input). Learn to use the right guns and upgrades (outside of the 'shard gun', all the guns and upgrades have their own uses, some more than others but they all have a purpose). Enemies have easy to learn patterns which you can exploit by your superior movement ability and powerful arsenal. When a fight goes well, and you dashed through multiple enemies just to line them all up with a railgun or a slash dash it can be rather satisfying. Boss fights are exceptionally well done. Each boss can be beaten in matter of minute or so, depending how good you are and which tools you brought with you. They feel like epic duels, both you and the boss are powerful and clash.Exploration wise expect an absurd amount of secrets. Not just secrets, but secrets that have their own secret, which haves it's own secret area which has its own secrets. Inception a bit. It pays off to explore. Each of the collectibles will either make you directly more powerful (afford more upgrades), or indirectly by getting certain rewards locked by keys, or needing cerain collectible. Majority of the game is optional. If you play this game bare bones, and only do the main objective. You will probably miss about 2/3s  of the game. Overall mechanic wise and general difficuly and progression is spot on.Unfortunately this game isn't perfect, and worst part of it is that it isn't related to game design, but on technical faults. Game is locked to 30fps. While this isn't a ""huge"" issue. Game is perfectly fine on that framerate. You can master it just fine (same with something like Nuclear Throne). The bigger issue is framerate inconsistency. There will be parts where your framerate dips. Remember how I said that chain dashing requires just frame input? Well imagine doing a challange that needs you to perfectly dash through an area just so the framerate to change mid way, messing up your timing and making you die and start over? The ♥♥♥♥ing spike room dash puzzle in NG+ nearly drove me insane. I think it took me nearly 500 tries. There was one corner where the framerate would dip about half the time. If it did I died. Not to mention edge collision detection is WAY more than what the models show. You might think this kind of stuff is gamebreaking, but unless you are really doing a perfectionist run you probably won't notice. I didn't really until I was playing NG+ where a lot of this crap ended up killing me a good bit. Controls suffer the same as the framerate. Large majority of the times it will be flawless. But you will get into a moment where you know you pressed something and it didn't happen, or it took few frames too long.Overall I got down deep with the game. I wanted to play it well since it was so enjoyable, but the occasional technical hicups made it far from a perfect experience. I absolutely love this game, and would heartly recommend it if the trailer is even remotely interesting to you. Just beware that some of the technical issues hold the game back from being an absolute masterpiece.------------EDIT------------The developers have been consistently patching up the game and working out the kinks that I originally outlined. As it currently stands the game runs at 60fps smoothly. Even on the potato I tested this on. I can't tell for sure if the input issues are still there or that framerate dips in certain areas like it did. However judging by their notes, perofrmance was the target of their updates. They optimized collisions so the game can run at a higher framerate. It wouldn't be a far stretch to assume this means the same improvement for framerate consistency. Regardless I can't know for sure untill I go for another full run, since these bugs only showed up in certain instances/places. If I find some inconsistencies I will make another addition to this, however my guess is that it should be working fine. Anyway, these fixes address my largest complaints and setbacks I originally had with the game. From a quick look it seem it has been settled. For anyone having doubts about getting the game now if technical issues were a concern I would advise to buy it. To me this game stands as a masterwork in current sea of mediocricty. Honest props to the developers. Cheers.			"

												Imagine Zelda: Prepare to Die Edition. In a way it's like Zelda x Bloodborne or a much, much better Zenonia. This has everything I've ever wanted in a 2D action-adventure game. Great mechanics, subtle story, FAST paced, nice skills and insane mobility.If it looks like something you might enjoy, chances are it will go well beyond your expectations. 10/10. If anyone is familiar and can recommend anything similar shoot me a message.			"

												[No spoilers]I've become a very picky gamer within the last few years. I've seen triple-A titles pique my interest and let me down way too many times in this last generation of games. I ran a gaming website with a handful of friends very briefly and one of them really introduced me to indie games. I played a handful of them before HLD but this is the game that showed me that Indie games are not only alive and well, they'll dominate the games market. People really pour their heart and soul into these games and HLD is the perfect example of a team who had an idea to create a piece of art.The game is hard. Not painfully hard to the point where you want to quit playing all the time, the map shows you an idea as to where things are and how to get there but it forces you to learn the world. It shows you that there are areas to be seen once you get further in the game. It doesn't TELL you anything, doesn't hold your hand other than a few simple game-mechanics, it let's you experience the world the way a game like this is meant to be. When you get frustrated with in a spot and you die repeatedly, it's easy to set it aside but want to come back and play more rather than just forget about it. It punishes you in a way so you'll learn what to do, rather than just let you spend another 10-20 minutes running back to your spot or have to fight the previous enemies over and over again.  Some of the boss fights in this game are beyond fun, I can only think of one that I beat on my first try and I know there was a good amount of luck involved in it as well. Very challenging, another example of pushing you to learn.The soundtrack evokes emotion at every level. There's music to put you at ease, that let's you know things are about to get serious, to put you on edge, to show you you're absolutely powerless and that the creatures you are fighting see you as only dust in the eye. Disasterpeace created something beautiful for this game. I plan on buying the Vinyl when it is released.The mechanics are fun, there are ""mini-games"" here and there to test your ability to problem solve as well as how good you are at rapid-dashing. I'm a drummer and I thought I would master this but it actually took me a really long time before I could get the rhythm down, allowing me to dash enough times to get the achievement. The game has the vibe of an NES Zelda game that cuts out all the things Zelda didn't need.The storyline is confusing, but you understand everything you need to in order to continue on with the game. You don't feel objectiveless, but you certainly feel helpless. Every few minutes your character will walk slowly, bending down and holding his chest as he coughs what I can only assume to be blood. You know you're on a timer (or at least your character knows he is) before you fall to your demise.Finally the artwork is a masterpiece. They do an excellent job of captivating the vastness of the world they created. The palette is bright but I personally think that they bring something new to games that could have just been full of green grass and blue sky. The ability to paint a world that's so similar yet so different from our own is genious. ""Oh, look at that frog-- OH GOD WHY IS THAT CREATURES HEAD ON A PIKE!"" I remember literally yelling at my PC when I first saw the creatures.TL;DR Hyper Light Drifter is an audio and visual masterpiece. It takes Zelda style games, gives them a retro-futuristic feel with a difficulty (not frustration) of the Dark Souls games. If you have only $20 to spend on a new game and feel like having a brand new experience. I highly suggest this game.10/10			"

												You will buy this game, and for the first few hours you'll hate yourself because your hands won't do what your brain wants fast enough, the only thing keeping you playing being the intriguing storytelling, neat visuals and great soundtrack......untill it all clicks together, when your brain finaly fuses with your controller about half way through the game, the tight controls will allow you to take on the unfairest of fights in a blink, leading you to the game's end in under 10 hours.But you will need more.You'll keep playing, untill you find all the viciously hidden collectibles thanks to subtle visual hints left by the game.At this point, once you've collected most of them and bought every upgrades, the game is too easy. You've lost the thrill for the challenge.That's when you'll try New Game + mode where you replay the game with all abilities unlocked from the beginning...but your health is capped at 40% which means enemies will kill you in two regular hits or one single heavy attack. Bosses one shot as well in this mode.People often compare this game's difficulty in NG+ mode with Dark souls. It's nothing like it. It's much fairer.You don't have to guess what enemies do. You don't have to die at least one time against each boss because their attacks are unpredictible. When an enemy is about to attack, you know what it will do and where. This game doesn't test your guess work, or your patience against die-and-retry kinds of boss. It tests your reflexes and quick decision making because yes, all attacks are easily predictible, but rarely over 0.25s in advance.One last thing : to fully apreciate this game, you have to know that the guy behind its idea was born with several life-threatening heart defects. This is why despite its esoteric, borderline childish art style, the game doesn't shy away from heart/blood or even death symbolisms so keep an eye out for those....Now that i think about it, this game is almost a life lesson.One last (but important) thing, playing with a controller is much easier.

Masterfully done. That's the simplest way I can describe Hyper Light Drifter.After finishing one playthrough on easy, this just blew me away. Eat your heart out Zelda fanboys, the indie scene just one-upped you! But seriously, this game took me back and really gave me those feels of playing earlier Zelda titles like A Link to the Past. The major functional differences are that Hyper Light Drifter is more action-RPG oriented with debatably more strategic fast-paced combat, and the game is overall shorter (but there is a good bit of replay value with various modes and NG+).One of the coolest thing about Hyper Light Drifter is the universe it takes place in - it feels really well put together and thought-out. Some sort of dystopian neo-apacolyptic world. Obviously the pixel art and music are outstanding. I mean they literally could not have crafted this better. The controls are super tight, and combat is butter smooth. You got killed? You know it was your fault; you know you could have planned that better and not choked. That's how it is.Pros:+While the asking price seems steep - it's worth more. I'm not talking from an hour-per-dollar standpoint, but even if you go there, you could easily get 20 quality hours out of this hunting achievements and completing higher difficulties and Boss Rush modes.+They are still adding quality updates to the game.+Controller support couldn't be better (XBox360 here).+Awesome open-world gameplay complete with currency of sorts and skill/weapon upgrade system. You also earn alt outfits and colors. +The quality of the music and pixel art should be a golden standard of sorts for similiar art styles in the industry. This stuff should be in design textbooks.+Tons of little secrets and power ups hidden really well in the world. It encourages you to explore - and thats the best kind of game design.+Totally addicting; I binge played this in about a 12 hour window - and those who know me - you know this is rare.+Not a glitch in sight.You Decide:=The story is not told through words. It is picture-based, and there is little of it. I like that. It feels indie and abstract. Do I understand the story, in full? Nope. But some of the fun is figuring it out. If you need a concrete Zelda-like fairytale, be warned.Cons:-Some will complain about the map - but I stopped what I was doing and spent about 10 minutes wrapping my head around it. It's not poorly done, so much as it is abstract. It shows 'connections', but cardinal direction is less of a focus. So it can fool you if you are reading it like a traditional map.Play it now, or play it down the road. Just make sure you experience this at some point. "

												When people told me this game was Zelda meets Dark Souls, they set a high bar. Impressively, this game lives up to the hype. The art direction and soundtrack is fantastic and the gameplay is fair but brutal. Some of the optional challenges remind me of Super Metroid, requiring impeccable precision and timing. I've put nearly 40 hours just trying to find all the secrets scattered throughout the game.  For $20 this game is a steal. It is easily one of the best action RPGs on Steam.			"

												I don't have many games.To be completely honest, I don't really have the cash to afford them.However, when I saw this game, I wanted it. I read up on it as much as I could without the plot being spoiled, and eventually the summer sale rolled around.And this game was on sale.  This was my chance! I bought this game.At first, I was tentative to play it. I spent a long while playing other games before finally saying ""♥♥♥♥ it,"" and I opened the thing up.Let me say now; I may not have played many games in my recent life, but this was a game so cool that my mind was blown simply by watching the intro cinematic. That's how simple it was to blow my mind.And then the game began.Being thrown right into the action is a hallmark, in my humble opinion, for a brilliant game. It doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around. It doesn't prolong any dialogue or require you to ""Create your character.""No.I was thrown straight into the game and it was absolutely amazing.Over 40 hours of playing later, I'm here: Collecting all the gearbits I may have missed before hitting the final boss fight, just for that sweet 100% completion award. I'm almost there.This game ranks pretty high up on my list of things I love, and with good reason: This game allows you to take what you will from it. There is a story, but only if you decide to look for it. There are so many things you can find and fight, but only if you go looking.Sure, you can finish this game by beating all the bosses, but then again, you can  immerse yourself. And honestly, with this game's soundtrack (by Disasterpeace, who also has a neat little cameo), its art, its secrets and its gameplay, most people would agree with me saying it's probably one of the best releases of 2016. And for me, it will stick with me as an all-time favourite.Do yourself a favour, and grab this game.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is brilliant. If you haven't bought it, buy it. Or ask for it for your birthday.Ignore any comments about the game being ""too hard."" I'm depressingly average at games and I completed it without too much trouble. Some sections are definitely challenging, but due to clever design decisions at no point did I find it frustrating.Combat is fast and very satisfying, as you use a combination of dash, sword and ranged attacks to get in and out of range, dealing and avoiding damage. Enemy encounters are over in seconds rather than minutes, so replaying a section until you get it just right doesn't feel like a chore. Checkpoints are generous so you shouldn't have much backtracking to do. Waypoints less so but shortcuts open up after completing some sections. Controls are responsive and the game ""feels"" really good to play. There are lots of upgrades that will help level the playing field, and enough health packs hidden away to keep you moving.The variety of skills and weapon upgrades give you lots of different tactics to and experiment with, and you'll find your favourite combinations.The visuals are very striking, and they help to make the world feel immersive. There's loads of little details that help bring the world to life, like the various creatures that live in the central town - they flip burgers, play guitar or drown their sorrows in a back alley. Animations are smooth and full of character.Each area of the game has its own distinctive feel, and its own set of enemies posing different challenges. Exploring each new area feels exciting in a way that not many other games master. Among the otherworldliness are prosaic touches like crates, desks or filing cabinets (that burst satisfyingly into piles of paper when hit) that make the environments feel solid and convincing.There are heaps secrets hidden away - secret paths, doors, pickups and new costumes - so exploring thoroughly is rewarding. I only found a tiny fraction on my first playthrough.There is virtually no (English) text in the game, the story, controls and objectives are communicated visually or aurally. Don't be put off as you're told all you need to know and if you just keep exploring you'll get where you need to go.The Disasterpeace soundtrack is brilliant.Not much else to say, it's a game that shows that a small group of talented developers armed with Game Maker and a compelling vision can make a title that blows AAA titles out of the water in terms of gameplay, style and imagination.Oh yeah, boss fights! The bosses in this game made John Walker cry like a baby, but I can't think why.All are classic, traditional boss battles with patterns you have to learn, attacks to avoid, and moments of vulnerability. None of the bosses is ""unfair"" and every time I died it's because I panicked and did something stupid. If you have an ounce of patience and don't get greedy you'll beat any boss in one sitting. In short, bosses are imaginative, varied, full of character and very satisfying when you finally nail them.			"

												Gorgeous visuals. Amazing soundtrack. Straightforward mechanics. Obscure story. Challenging bosses. A stunning world that you're free to explore with hardly any hand holding. Fans of the Soulborne and the original classic Zelda series will love this game.			"

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 9/10 - must playsimilar games: FEZ, Dark Souls, Transistor, Legend of Zelda, Megaman Zerotags: Beautiful, Sci-Fi, Post-Apocalypse, Exploration, Combat, HardHyper Light Drifter is one of the top league Indie games like Transistor, Shovel Knight or Banner Saga. With 6 hours playtime it isn't that long (although you might need longer if you die more often), but in my opinion it was the perfect playtime for this game and it felt really complete and round. But there is also a next game+ mode, which I will definitly play, especially because you can't get all upgrades on your first playthrough.UPDATE: Next Game+ mode is a bit dissapointing. All that changes is that your Health gets limited to 2, so you die in one hit against bosses and can only take one hit from  some normal enemies. I still try to beat this mode, but it isn't what I hoped a ""next game+"" mode would offer.Hyper Light Drifter is a Top Down game where you explore a ""post apocalyptic"" like world and fight monsters. You also meet other characters, but there is no understandable language in this game. When NPCs talk to you you see images of what they are talking about. I think this is okay, if these characters would speak english for example, it could hurt the atmossphere. And even though you don't hear a single word, some characters are actually really cool. There is also lots of mystery involved and even after beating the game, I'm still not 100% sure what really happened. Maybe I'm a moron, maybe the game isn't bringing across it's story well, I don't know, but I still had a very satisfying experience.Exploration is one of my favorite things in video games, but I'm not talking about exploration like in Firewatch or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I'm talking about exploration in games like Dark Souls and Half-Life, and there is plenty of that in this game. The level design is open, but also focused and guides you. There are always side paths where you can find stuff and there are also really well hidden, but also well hinted, secrets. You also never get lost, because you have a map and every area has a unique theme. Also there are landmarks like giant corpses of some giant beings which help you orientate in the world. The world of this game is really amazing actually, and it's so beatiful.What really rounds up this world and the atmossphere is the music. It just perfectly fits this game and is so well made. It sounds a bit like it's inspired by FEZ actually (not only that). I also love how the music just flows, there are not sudden stops or clear moments where music starts and where it ends. All of this is so well made and helps to create this unique, beautiful and immersive world, which is just fun to run around in, but what about the combat?I love the combat. I really really love it. I love that this game makes no compromises. This game isn't extremely difficult, but it punishes beginner mistakes, like button mashing. You have to completely understand each mechanic to be able to succeed, but there are plenty of opportunties where you will learn them. Every area has it's own enemy types, each with it's own strength and weaknesses. Some hit hard and have lots of HP, but are slow, some are really fast but have really low hp, some have ranged attacks, some have multiple attack types. This means that when you are in a fight you have to priortize different enemies, just like in Doom or Serious Sam. Like in Dark Souls you have a limited amount of healing items you can carry, and using a healing item takes a little bit of time, so you have to time it right. Also you have to decide if you want to heal early or late, depending on how much you are willing to risk.What really made me love this game are the bossfights. ALL of them are really well made, although one boss was a bit too easy and I beat him first try (the boss of the water world, the frog thingy). Every boss starts with a small number of attack types and is not too overwhelming, but the more the fight continues, the crazier attacks they will use. Because of this there is no trial and error. You can watch the bosses do their things while you keep dodging. Also when you die and restart, you won't get overwhelmed immediately. There is much more to the gameplay I could talk about, but all that should matter for this review is that the combat is really well made, well thought out and also extremely responsiv and beginner friendly (but the game is really hard). You will need a controller though.Btw I didn't even notice the 30 fps, because of pixel art and the game is still very responsive, but 60 fps would obviously be better.			"

												DISCLAIMERI don't write a lot of reviews so I know my review might be bad, but I had to for Hyper Light Drifter. It probably says I have 12 hours in this game, but at the time of writing this review, 7 of those hours are from the release build and the rest from the preview build.Edit Reason: I forgot to talk about how it runs.. Sorry..Edit Reason 2: Reworded a few things.Kick Starter:As a kick starter backer, this game has given more that I expected. The preview build of the game was amazing and hyped me up for the release. And I wasn't let down at all.So What Is It?:Many reviews already tell you what the game is like so, I'll keep it simple. Hyper Light Difter is a top down, action adventure, pixel art master piece. The mechanics (which involve sword play, dashing and ranged weapons) are rock solid and never fault you for unknown reasons. The atmoshpere and sound design are honestly one of the best experiences i've had in a long time, the story is super interesting and cryptic (this is a bonus or a flaw depending on how you like your stories) and lastly the game feels SO good to play.Anything Else?:The game's difficulty gives me a dark souls 1 vibe, PLEASE don't misunderstand what I mean by this. What I mean is; the game is hard but fair, deaths that happen are your fault. Very very rarely will something kill you and leave you thinking ""there is no way I could have saw that coming."" Apart from experiencing a boss for the first time, which will leave you crushed into the ground after your first attempt.Cool Opinions, What about the controls?:The controls feel perfect on a gamepad, as I used a xbox360 type controller. Personally I find HLD is best played on a game pad but still controls well on keyboard(APART FROM DASHING, SEE FORUMS). The drifter (the character you play) moves very smoothly and is easy to control in pretty much any situation.Still Some One Sided Opinions in there, what about length?:Well here is where the game is slightly pulled down. SLIGHTLY. My first playthrough was about 5 hours and 30 mins. I didn't explore every single thing, although I did sit down and just look at the beautiful pixel art at times, so you could probably pull it out to 8 - 10 hours if you wanna find EVERYTHING. But if you are worried about the length, there is new game +. And trust me, this game has replay value. What If I Don't Care About Secrets and Stuff?:Well you should because there is countless secret areas in the game. And a lot of these areas you need to find to continue the story, at least I think you do... Either way just keep your eye out if you are interested in secrets. IF NOT, you could probably beat the game in like 4 hours. I'm not a speed runner so I couldn't tell you.New Game +? (More info to come):Yup, instead of 5 health, you have 2! Goodluck! :)Enemy placement seems the same but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥its difficult. You have to completely adapt to a new playstyle and have even quicker reactions.What about how the game RUNS?:Well its locked to 30fps. The devs said it was due to the logic in Game Maker coded to work  with 30 fps, but other people on the forum said that the devs could of easily created the game 60fps with no issues. So take that as you will. I also seem to get a fair bit of screen tear some times, but this only happens if the camera is moving constantly.Bugs?:Only one I've found so far. I dashed too fasted into a boss fight and my character was perma stuck in the ""i'm standing still for the boss intro to look cool"" phase. I couldn't move but couldn't take damage, so i just restared the game (it restarted me at the begining of the boss room) and it worked fine.Soooo Do You Recommend it?:Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk yes. This game honestly blew my mind. Every sence is just too ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful. The enviromental story telling lets your mind go crazy, the combat feels too good... You can interact with NPCs by pressing Y (or your equivalent button) and they way the communicate back to you is very Journey style, where as your little robot guy pings a sound and the NPC responds with it's own sound. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. HIGHLY RECOMMEND with a game pad.SO LASTLY:If you like games with combat that requires good reaction and a decent amount of thinking, a LOT of hidden secrets, a fun as ♥♥♥♥ dash ability, not much story hand holding (you gotta figure a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥out), beautiful pixel art and lastly, engrossing atmosphere, then you should 100% get Hyper Light Difter.And if you don't like it, refund it? Sooo what are you worried about...			"

												Wow.First hour in. Super impressed.They've over-delivered.Pacing is spot on.Combat incredibly satisfying. Several ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can do that?"" moments.1 part muscle memory, 1 part twitch-reaction, 1 part enemy-priority juggling. Dash of ominous-yet-cheerful soundtrack.And ♥♥♥♥. It's gorgeous.11/10, would have a sloppy makeout-session with the devs.******************************************************************Couple things to consider before diving into this sexy-mess:******************************************************************1. I'm through and through a kb/mouse kind of feller. But you're probably going to want a controller for this one. Really feels right. This is the kind of game that's good enough that it's worth dropping the extra couple bucks if you don't have one on hand.2. If you're looking for a casual wander-around and take in the sights sort of experience, you're going to be sorely disappointed. If you're bad at games, you probably won't finish this one. Not a lot of hand-holding going on here.			"

												This game is pretty freakin' swell, but it's probably not for everyone.It may look like some artsy Zelda clone, but that isn't the case. People have been saying it's like Dark Souls, and while I can see why they would say that, I don't think that's really accurate, either.This game is all about timing and finese. If you try to button mash through combat against anything but the most basic of enemy, you're gonna get wrecked. Likewise, you can't just spam health items to cheese the combat because using a health item during combat is probably going to have the opposite effect from what you were hoping. Healing doesn't happen instantly, and trying to heal in combat leaves you open. The enemies will take advantage and punish you.You've got your standard sword, which is your basic melee attack. You also get a gun fairly early, and it really comes in handy on certain enemies.  There's an evade roll that you're gonna get real familiar with, and it is used for both setting up counter attacks as well as exploring and uncovering secrets.This game has a lot of secrets, by the way. You'll want to check any walls that look odd, and keep an eye out for platforms that might be on the very edge of the screen, only showing a few pixels. It's also not uncommon for secret areas to have other secret areas inside them. It might be worth noting that some of these hidden areas are manditory for progressing through the game, so if you hate exploring you'll probably end up using a walkthrough. Like a silly little casual.As you collect currency, mainly from all the secret areas you'll come across, you can buy various upgrades in town. There are vendors for different types of skills. One vendor sells various sword upgrades, another sells gun upgrades, and one has evade roll upgrades. There are a couple others around, too.I do have one issue with the game, and that is the fact that there is no dialogue or text at all in the story. The story is told to you via pictures. I feel like it wasn't the best choice for this game, because the story is really weird, and very hard to understand. I was lost before the intro cutscene finished. It makes it hard to get invested in the story when it's basically nonsense. Keep in mind I'm not saying this is a strike against the game, I'm saying it's something I personally didn't like. Still, this is a really fun game with neat aesthetics and intense combat.You should probably get it.Unless you're a smelly casual. "

												Hyper Light Drifter is a very beautifully artistic game and a solid/challenging action adventure. You play as the Lone Drifter who is on a quest to cure what is plaguing his body, the story is unique as it is told through the world itself and the lore around the places you will venture in your journey, similar to Dark Souls. Also just like Darksouls, this game will not hold your hand, you take whichever path you want on your journey to cure what ails you and face perilous and difficult challenges along the way. Another thing to note is the amazing retro soundtrack, from it's boss battles to it's ambience that captures perfectly the world and situation around you. Highly recommend you pick up this amazing title!

												Should you get this game? First ask yourself a few other questions.Question: Do you have a mac? Answer: If yes, don't get this game YET.Explanation: The mac version apparently has some bugs that still need to be fleshed out.Q: Does your system meet the hardware requirements?A: If it doesn't, don't get this game.E: Many reviewers have complained they couldn't run the game, then gave it a negative review. WHAT?Q: Do you need the game to tell you what to do every step of the way?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: Many people have called this game ""obtuse"" due its (almost) complete lack of instrcutions.Q: Do you need the game to provide you with a detailed encyclopedia describing the story?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: This game has no dialogue and only a few stories delivered in pictures and cryptic monoliths.Q: Do you dislike games that require you to die a lot in order to become better at it?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: You will die A LOT in this game and it can become frustating.Q: Do you dislike searching, scouring even, every nook and cranny to find a WELL hidden secret?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: Exploration is integral in order to progress in this game.Q: Do you dislike difficult boss fights that require many (many many) tries to beat?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: This game has very difficult boss fights. You will die a lot even when you know the patterns.Q: Do you need to be showered with healing items?A: If yes, don't get this game.E: Health packs are frequent but not so numerous that you're always full. Once you get better, you'll need them less.Q: Does 30 fps matter to you?A: If yes, don't get this game?E: People are complaining that 30 fps causes sea sickness, lagging, and a poor looking game, none of which are true.After answering all of the questions you should have a good idea of what's in store for you, without spoiling anything. I personally love this game and couldn't give it enough praise. The story that is there, is captivating. The graphics are beautiful despite it being pixelated. The music fits perfectly with the ruined landscape. This game is great and I believe much of the negativity surrouding it can be attributed to people wanting a game to be exactly how they envision, instead of just sitting back and enjoying the experience.

Posted: April 4, 2016
												I just finished the game.The game feels like a hybrid between Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls but what I love about this game is that it doesn't requrie level upping or heart pieces to strengthen your character. Improvement comes from you and learning how to use the skills and equpment is what grants you strength. You can play through it without any optional upgrades at all, I think.You cna also play the stages in any order but it's usually recommended to get the multi-dash upgrade first for an easier time.There's also platforming here which is a delight for me who grew up with platformers.The game is very atmospheric with it's gorgeous pixel visuals and animations but I do feel apathetic playing it most of the time. I can't find any emotional attachments to any of the characters because it's a silent game. Pure visual story telling would work if the story was simple but I get the feeling that it's far more complex than it seems. There's even a bit of time travel here from what I understand. This might just be my own preference because I can't stand narratives in games with silent protagonists.My only real con about this game is that it feels kinda' short or I just found an exploit and ripped right through the game.  There's a little too many health packs lying around too.  I also thought that he'd have more attacks from what I saw from the game's previews but my memory is a little hazy on that.There's also a new game plus which limits the HP bar severely and only the truly daring would go through with that handicap. I suppose this addresses the game's length and I might attempt it at some point but I'm a little burnt out.Overall, it was a great experience but I think it get's overshadowed easily by other games with a more captivating narrative or mystery.

Spoiler free review, with a short and long version, updated after the 28th September update who raised the framerate from 30 to 60 and added a Boss Rush game mode:	TLDWTR (too long didn't want to read) VERSION:Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) is a 2D action-adventure game, characterized by:- a gorgeours pixel art style similar to Qora and Titan Souls' ones- a cryptic wordless narration, similar to Teslagrad's one- 60 fps,thanks to the september 2016 update- sometimes irresponsive controls- a deep combat system- time required to ""speedrun"" it: 4-5 hours- time required to complete Normal Mode at 100%: 15 hours- the presence of in-game secrets,minigames, gear upgrades,Arena,Boss Rush mode and a New Game + modeBuy it if:+ if you like fast action games played using a controller (recommended)+ if your skill level with action games is slightly above the average+ if you prefer to be enchanted by graphics rather then being amused by narration+ if you love hard combats combined with a solid combat systemDon't buy it if:- you believe that spending 20$ for a 4 hour game isn't acceptable- if you're not gonna complete and collect the other collectibles- if you hate hard games with sometimes unreliable controls- if you hate frustrating challenges and/or playing with a controller (highly recommended)LONGER VERSION:I've been playing this game for over 30 hours and after completing it at 100% i'll quickly summarize the game's best and worst aspects getting a bit into their details.GOOD ONES:1- HLD's appearance is striking and beautiful as it takes inspiration from Atzec's art and from games such as Qora and Titan Souls by reproducing and improving their pixelated styleThree examples:

2- the soundtrack fits the game perfectly, varying from dark,hectic to highly soothing and relaxing melodies3- HLD shows a decent enemy variety as there are over 15 enemy types with different attack strategies and very cool boss fights. Fighting bosses will feel like a read duel, where every hard hit will count for both sides with devastating effects; bravery and skill are well rewarded,despite the weird controls, meaning that if you don't need to ""git gud"" at the game, you can atually wreck even the advanced bosses with few well placed hits/shots.4- collecting secrets and currencies needed to upgrade your equipment never feels boring as the hidden areas, even if well hidden sometimes, are fun to be explored and admired when finally discovered and reached5- the map is really,really big, full of remarkable (secret) locations, landscapes,dungeons and a main village with houses and available shops as well6- the game is challenging and extremely hard at times, giving high satisfaction when the player is finally able to grasp and then master all the combat and movement mechanics7- Movement and combat upgrades are creative,satisfying and beautiful, despite the sometimes unreliable framerateBAD ONES:1- The game map is nonsensical and useless. I'll quote Dr.Manhattan from Watchmen here: ""I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a photo of oxygen to a drowning man."" How can i describe this map? Imagine to get lost in a cave below a city, now you'll have to find your way back home by using the metropolitan city map. Unless you have good memory, you might get lost and confused.2- HLD uses almost the same narrative system adopted by Teslagrad, meaning that the story is showed by small cutscenes and obscure, wordless comic balloons. HLD...fails miserably in mimicking Teslagrad; the real story and the rhunes' alphabet were deciphered by a clever and passionated Steam user and the lore was explained by some cool Reddit's posts. The game itself doesn't do NOTHING to be clear or less cryptic! Even collecting and reading all the  monument stones  will not reveal ANYTHING to you,at all!3- Weapons' upgrades are extremely superficial, allowing you to improve only their magazine size. Some weapons are useless and obsolete from the exact moment you've picked them, making the game and combats less varied. They suffer the same fate of the PP-Bizon in CSGO competitive matches, meaning that that weapon is useful in few situations and only in a precise part of the match, making it pointless for the following matches.TO SUM UP:Hyper Light Drifter is a gorgeous looking 2D game, plagued by a poor narration and sometimes wacky controls. If you're going to buy it remember that playing it without collecting any item or without finding any secret area will give you for 20$ a 5-hour long videogame.			"

Overview:Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action-adventure RPG game inspired by and made as an homage to 8-bit and 16-bit classics from the 80s and 90s. The game consists of fast-paced, real-time strategic-combat gameplay. The game is developed and published by Heart Machine, made using GameMaker: Studio. It’s available for PC, OS X and is planned to be available for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the future. It is a very special game.Story:This game’s story has to be fully inferred. There’s no dialogue, only imagery; this takes after SNES’ games’ tendencies to not have any dialogue. The Drifter (our protagonist) is ill, he coughs up blood constantly, implying his impending death. The protagonist’s illness is inspired by the game’s creator’s own battle with heart disease. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is a major inspiration for the game’s world. Hidden around the game is ancient technology forgotten by the world’s inhabitants, The Drifter sets out on a journey to find a cure for his illness and in his journey is revealed the secrets of this ancient technology. However, his adventure is not without obstacles. There are many enemies throughout the game, four main bosses to the North; South; East; and West; as well as some other bosses in some locations of the game.The narrative through imagery is extremely atmospherical, which in turn conveys different emotions. There are some NPCs in the game which have certain stories to tell, most of which deal with themes such as hardship and needing help from the good-hearted protagonist. Although it’s a bit difficult to understand the story in its entirety, the game manages to leave you feeling like you’ve just been through quite the adventure by the time you finish it.Gameplay:The gameplay is extremely fun, it is also challenging. The Drifter uses an energy sword for melee attacks, ranged weapons like guns, and AoE attacks. The enemies in the game become more abundant and progressively harder to defeat, forcing the player to experiment with different tactics. The game’s creator, Alex Preston, says the game is a combination between TLOZ: A Link to the Past and Diablo. You can save and restore health at certain checkpoints in the game, which also serve as fast-travel points. These points can be found in the central city, and in the four areas surrounding the city. The player can upgrade certain aspects of the Drifter’s ability by finding batteries, which function like money/ability points. The developers also recently added a local co-op mode which is in BETA. Each boss has a very particular pattern, and have varying levels of difficulty, the last of which is the hardest. Even if this game takes after titles such as Dark Souls, it is not as hard, though gamers who enjoy a challenge will definitely enjoy this one. It’s simple but testing, can be casual at times, but unforgiving if you’re careless.Visual:Two words: Pixel Art. This game has a very attractive aesthetic, all rendered in beautiful pixel art. The animations are wonderful and the environmental design is a delight to look at. Even though it is clearly a 2D game, some of the animations are executed so well that it almost seems like it might be 3D at times. From the visual effects to the simple animations of doors opening, swords swinging, and things exploding. It’s all fluid and satisfying to see. Although the cover art and concept art for the game is relatively minimalistic, in-game everything is fairly detailed, considering it’s all pixel art. The character feels alive and never feels odd to move or strike with. The atmosphere and ambience that the game’s visuals manifest is enough to immerse you into playing it for hours on end.Sound:Sound in this game is what makes it all work. Combat sounds, environmental sounds, and character speech sounds, they’re all great, but the sound that makes it all come together is the music. It’s not very surprising that the soundtrack is so good, since the composer is Disasterpeace, the same guy who made the soundtrack for Fez. The 16-bit style music is a nostalgic trip to the SNES and is what completes the immersive experience of playing the game. The image-based narrative goes side by side with the soundtrack, making all extremely cohesive.Final Thoughts:To be entirely honest, I didn’t expect much about this game except that it had Dark Souls-esque gameplay and a nostalgic aesthetic... until I started playing it. When I did, it quickly took me back to my childhood experiences of playing games like The Legend of Zelda, I must have put in close to four hours in my first session, I simply could not put the controller down. The story drew me in, the gameplay satisfied and challenged me, and I’ve enjoyed every minute. When I finished it I was surprised to see the credits go on for so long, Heart Machine aside, this was a fairly big production for an indie game. The special thanks section has some interesting names in it. I can’t help but have full respect for Heart Machine in reaching out to different people, funding their game with kickstarter, and delivering a truly special product. This game is very special.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

												At the time of this writing (mid-April of 2016), Hyper Light Drifter is easily my favorite new release of 2016 so far, and will surely have a spot on my list of my top 10 games of the year.This is just a wonderful game all around. This is some of the finest, most memorable world building I've experienced in a game in a long time, all of it done without a single word. Just absolutely beauitful art, incredible ambience, and boundless creativity. It's a world I didn't want to leave. I completed the game just about 10 minutes ago, and that makes me sad.It's also an incredibly exciting gameplay experience. The combat is technical wizardry. It feels punchy, responsive, and satisfying. It's a challenging, fair game that strikes that perfect middle ground of not being easy in the slightest, yet never feeling frustrating. The game is just a delight all around. Developer Heart Machine has arrived on the scene in a big way with Hyper Light Drifter, and I can't wait to see what they do next. Pick this one up without hesitation. This game is wonderful...a stellar example of what makes this medium so special.			"

												One of the best games I've played so far. It has an excellent combat system that doesnt ""dumb you down"", it makes you get better to overcome the enemies, excellent maze-like maps(kinda like dark souls 1) where it loops in itself and feels like a zelda game at the same time while creating a unique world, story and characters. Loved the game.			"

												I don't write many reviews, but I feel compelled to leave a small note that expresses my enjoyment of this game. It's one of the few games I've purposefully played slowly because a) want to find everything collectible in the game and b) I don't want the game to be completed. It's a strange dichotomy to be sure however it is also a testament to the type of game Heart Machine has created. In short, everything that constitutes this game deserves your attention. Thank you for reading.			"

												Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.There's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. Hyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an ""Indie"" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.One of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. Really, it's that good.			"

												Cute and mature.Punishing and forgiving.Slow and fast paced.Easy and frustrating.Let's go over each.Cute and mature.The pixel art is quirky and colorful. The entire narrative is made up of pictures for ""conversation"" rather than text. Many parts of the world are vibrant and simply pleasant to look at unless you inherently despise pixel art. But at the same time, it's grisly.  You behead your foes, spill their blood, and leave persistent corpses by the piles in your wake. There's also implied genocide in one region. Not the ""oh noes they're getting rid of us, frowny face :("" kind of video game trope extermination. I mean bodies-in-the-water genocide.Punishing and forgiving.Some think the combat is difficult, and it can be if you make mistakes or mistime your movements/attacks. You have a fixed HP of 5 hitpoints, no damage-gate, and no practical invincibility frames (you'd have to have robot reflexes to make deliberate use of them). Nearly attacks will do 1-2 damage, but they add up staggeringly quick when you put yourself in bad places against multiple enemies (spoilerz: you fight multiple enemies in 98% of all combat). But at the same time, your game auto-saves after every transition, which means you'll never be far from where you died. This cuts down on repetition after death that other punishing games are renowned for, and makes it easier to digest.Slow and fast paced.The game world's beautiful, and clearly the artists wanted you to really look at it. They reward slow pace with secret loot scattered all over the game. Specifically; several outfits (that give minor but varied effects), 2 bonus firearms, keys (to access other optional areas), and token fragments for upgrading your abilities.Lulls between fights can be long, sometimes to tensely extended periods. But during larger fights, the combat probably only lasts about 7-10 seconds while you're dashing around, dodging projectiles/enemies like you're playing a bullet hell minigame. A successful boss fight may not last any more than 2-4 minutes.Easy and frustrating.I didn't find HLD overall very difficult. You have a tremendous amount of tricks at your disposal once you start upgrading. Projectile deflection, shielded dashing, extra healing reserves, new and powerful attack moves, more gun ammo, and even grenades. But at the same time, even with every upgrade under the sun, you're still frail, waiting for one misstep to get mangled.You don't have invincibility frames while healing, so poor choice of deciding when to heal is usually fatal. In NG+ many enemies/traps will kill you in one hit since your HP gets reduced from 5 to 2, leaving absolutely no room for error.Simplyfinishing a playthrough is easily doable if you have passable dexterity and/or a gamepad, but if you're a completionist you'll experience undistilled bouts of rage.It's my favorite game of 2016. The pixel art is surprisingly fluid in cutscenes, and animations utilize it well. The gameplay is simple but versatile due to good usage of melee/ranged combat because they synergize instead of being separate. The textless story enthralled me and made me try analyzing everything it gave me.The ending kinda sucked though. I felt like the obscure narrative fell very flat at the end, like the person directing it didn't really know how to conclude their own story. So, mentally prepare yourself for that.			"

												This is the best game I have played in a long time.I hesitate to say the best Zelda-like game, because that would indicate that Zelda is better.  And it's not.  I don't say that casually - I love the Legend of Zelda series, but MAN, Nintendo got REKT here.It is most like the original Legend of Zelda in that it is very free-roaming and is difficult, however, it teaches you the game in such a fantastically simple way.  It requires no manual.  You'll be able to get into it pretty quickly.BREAKDOWN:Gameplay: 10/10The smoothness and variety of the combat and enemies is astonishing, far surpassing Zelda.  You get energy for your gun by using your sword, making all of combat a mix of both.  The dash and additional moves you learn make you feel like a master swordsman instead of a derpy Link.  The elements teach themselves quite well.Story: 7/10This game uses absolutely no words, which is AWESOME.  Dialog is done through pictures.  It gives the whole game world a bit of an alien feeling, like you came to a foreign land.  That said, I'm not sure I understood the overarching story very well.  Extended cutscenes might help with that a lot.Art: 10/10The art in this game is absolutely astounding.  I love it to death.  Not annoyingly pixely, and very unrepetitive.  It is beautiful.  Just look at videos and pictures.  SERIOUSLY.Difficulty: 9/10The difficulty in this game is almost perfect for me - it's difficult and the bosses will probably kill you several times, as will the levels leading up to them.  The penalty of death, however, is merely starting the room over with the same stuff you had when you entered, which makes the difficulty really fun instead of annoying.  Considering this light punishment, I would have liked some harder enemies to fight.  I suppose though as someone who likes Dark Souls a lot, that means it will be perfect for a less masochistic player.Overall: 9.5/10 - as awesome as Dark Souls, though in a different wayThis is a must-buy.  You won't regret it one bit.  I wish there would be a sequel.			"

												A game that feels like an odd mix of Darksouls, Zelda, and Hotline Miami, Hyper Light Drifter is Challenging, flashy and very pretty. The story is pretty cryptic but there is enough there to make you want to figure out whats going on, and its engaging enough that you will probably come up with your own theory for whats going on. The sound is very good minus some sections of high pitch whining, while I did not personaly mind them its screechy enough to be unpleasent			"

												A Masterpiece!I'm not normally a fan of Pixel Art games, but there is something truly mesmerizing about this one. The screenshots don't do the visuals justice, and the music is otherworldly. Some of it reminds me of the amazing Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis. The gameplay is simple and engaging. Whilst nothing (so far) is beyond my skill, it still feels like a challenge every time I'm swarmed by foes. The combat is fast paced and gritty; with quick jabs that always feel... solid. Not sure how else to put it, but I feel pleasure every time I smack a baddie in the face with my sword or a round from my blaster.PROS:> Beautiful visuals. All environments, elements, and entities are masterfully created & animated. Combat looks (and feels) amazing, traversal of the world is engaging, and cutscenes are emotionally moving.> Amazing soundtrack. I often go between different activities quickly. Usually I close/mute games when I go to something else, but Hyper Light drifter is an exception. I like to leave it playing softly in the background.CONS:> In combat, the camera may sometimes ""jam"" on the world constraints (used to hide/focus on things) rather than keep an enemy in view, often hiding said enemy and letting them blindside you.> Occasional stuttering for no apparent reason, as resource usage is still minimal. Not sure what the cause is. Autosaving is the culprit in many games, but doesn't seem to be the cause here.OVERALL:9/10Whether this game is played in short a short burst or for hours on end, I never tire of it. I'm compelled to roam (and cleanse) the world, and find out what the Drifter is seeing. Is it all in the mind? Or are these dark spirits trying to keep him away?NOTE: Be warned. This game is quite challenging, even on Easy. So if you're purely a casual gamer, you might want to wait for a sale or avoid it, unless you've money to spare. "

												This game absolutely rules.It sits comfortably upon the razor's edge of hard difficulty never steeping into the unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t category that so many other ""git gud"" games so often fall prey to. You die to a boss and you respawn immediately before the fight able to try again within moments. Bed of Chaos from Dark Souls 1 made you walk one minute across a pool of lava before you could re-fight him.I had to take a pause in the game to soak in the beautifully crafted environments. This game didn't need to look so damn good but it decided to look ultra F-I-N-E anway.The colors pop vibrantly like the neon 80's. Music is a little bland and forgettable though. The game doesn't do any handholding so here are some important tips that will save you some trouble. 1) The levels are all about the same difficulty. You can do them in any order.2) Tackle the East first, that boss is the easiest and your reward is a very high dps weapon3) Purchase the triple dash before you head North. You'll want it for both the level and the boss.4) The boss in the west is the hardest by far5) The dash attack item is useless--the input is only one frame long so it never comes out.			"

												I´ll keep it short:People on the web say it´s pretty much a mixture of Dark Souls and Zelda. There´s adventure, a satisfying, (textless!) dark story and a really challenging fighting system.The soundtrack and overall design is really moody and catches you within minutes, the visuals beautiful and unspent.After the game was pretty much done, the developers spent a LOT of time polishing the game. They´ve often redesigned enemies or animations, rebuild levels or overthought game mechanics. That´s why everything in this game seems to be just where it should be.It´s a finished, carefully polished gem, so don´t just gobble it up, slowly enjoy every bite of it. A game for game gourmets.

												Backed this game because the art style looked really compelling.What I got far, far exceeded my expectations.  -Challenging combat that is difficult enough to keep you interested but fair enough to keep you trying.  It requires a level of mastery and reflex that isn't really like any other top-down adventure game I've played.  Makes successful combat very satisfying and makes you want more.  -Lumping this in with other pixel style games is unfair.  I personally hate pixel art games.  This game is dazzling.  Beautiful art design that is more stylized; it doesn't use pixel art as a compromise for poor art-design or limited resources.  It elevates the style to a new level, and I doubt many who use the style will be able to answer.-The Legend of Zelda influence is there, and it's compelling.  The cinematic qualities aren't overbearing, but they definitely enhance the experience enough to add intrigue.  $20.00 might seem like a high price, but it's more than worth it for this.  It's an excellent, very well designed game.  I helped kickstart this years ago and had all but forgotten about it, but playing it now, I'm glad these guys took their time.  It's a very, very well done game.9.5/10 - Near flawless.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a lovely, brutal game that will test and reward your patience. I'm only about 5 hours into the game but I have another 5 hours from the beta.Pros- Great combat- Easy controls- Cool upgrade system (once you figure out how it works)- Fun enemies (That all seem to have different behaviors)- Lovely sounds and music- Great graphics (If you enjoy pixel art)- Interesting story.Cons- Well, maybe I'm just bad but the bosses are SOOOO hard. I've gotten to 3 of them but I haven't been able to beat them yet.So far I love the game and it has been well worth the money.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of my favourite games in years. I initially bought the game because I loved the visual design, but it ended up exceeding my expectations on every level. The visual style, the soundtrack, the storytelling, and the gameplay are all of the highest quality; they are complementary, and memorable. When I initially played and finished the game, I was very satisfied and thought that I would probably play it again in a year or so. I ended up coming back in just a couple months, and found myself playing it through three times in a row, completing the majority of the game's optional challenges. I now know that this game will join a small handful of others that I return to and replay every year or so, which is probably the highest praise I can give. If you want to play a beautiful game with an incredible artistic aesthetic, I strongly recommend this game. If you want to play a challenging but fair action game that is reminiscent of old classics, I strongly recommend this game. Support this game, we need more like it!			"

												Sometimes in all the years Ive been gaming (about 30) a game comes out that is unique - something that stands far above all the typical games out there. Hyper Light Drifter is one of those. At its core, its a top down action game like the old Legend of Zeldas. But it has some of the most amazing pixel art I have ever seen, and a mindblowingly great soundtrack. Its sort of an RPG, but theres absolutely no text or words, except for a few control hints at the very beginning. Not in the shops, not with the NPCs. You go to a shop, and series of pictures tells you what the thing you are buying is and what you need to get it. NPCs tell you their stories in a series of detailed images. It takes some getting used to, but its awesome. Its really surreal. After a brief (awesome) cutscene, your char stand up and you're off. Nothing is explained beyond a few brief control hints, and you dont know what you're doing, although the game reveals gameplay concepts slowly enough to you that you arent ovewhelmed with the fact that the UI isnt a standard action RPG. You make your way through this uniquely rendered post-human world, fighting enemies and interacting with some odd animal-like natives who tell you stories in a series of images that are so well done you'll understand what they are saying with watching it twice (at most). The farther you go, the more of the story is revealed. Its confusing at first, but really grows on you once you get the hang of it.The controls are simple and easy to get used to. One of my only complaints is the controller is non mappable. What you see is what you get. I managed to make it work for me as neither LB or LT is absolutely needed quickly and accurately, but if you have physical issues, please take this into consideration that although the game does have ""full controller support"" it is permamapped, and youre going to need to use at least RT and RB quickly.AGAIN I have to give the reminder: To all devs out there - PLEASE make controllers fully mappable. If you have controller support at all, why not make it mappable? For someone like me with a physical disability it can be the difference between enjoying a great game, and being forced to refund a great game because its unplayable. Theres a LOT of gamers with physical issues out there, and that numbers only going to go up as us first gen gamers get older.Hyper Light Drifter is nothing short of uniquely amazing.			"

Posted: April 14, 2016
												Hyper Light Drifter is a top-down hack n shoot a little zelda-like. -Good-:Gameplay:Your options are fairly limited in combat. Slice, dash, shoot. You eventually get other weapons and a few new abilities, like 2 flavors of dash attacks, projectile reflection and a charge attack.   Enemies have patterns that you exploit to damage them and try not to get hurt in return. It's simple but overall fairly solid.  Bosses are extra challenging and pretty fun.  The length of the game didn't overstay its welcome, but near the end it was definitely becoming a little boring fighting normal enemies.Graphics:The game looks beautiful, both in motion and in stills. The opening is probably one of the coolest openings I can remember. Each 'main' section of the game world has it's own theme both above and below ground. There's a few cool setpieces in the game for you to appreciate [A battle frozen in crystal, remains of a titan, etc] , sometimes little details too.  I wish there were more of these honestly, just cool places to explore and appreciate, to try and put the story together, as oftentimes areas within the same zone kind of just blend together.Music:The game's music is very low key for the most part, ambient electronica. While on paper that sounds boring, in game it's used to great effect, with special musical cues during cinematic scenes or exploring an important area.  -Questionable-:The story:Aside from the monoliths, which are in their own language, there's no written text or dialogue in the game. That would be fine, but there's a real minimal amount of 'picture dialogue' in game. It's all very nice, I just wish there was more of it.  Most of the story is derived from conjecture. There's no real character growth, either from the player or the NPCs, even as the world changes.-The bad-:Mechanics:I never got good at chain dashing. Maybe that's a personal thing, but it probably isn't helped by the 30fps max that a fast paced pixel art game shouldn't be running at.  You also get a shield dash, which seems to only work about 3/4's of the time.  That's probably also my fault, I think it has weird vulnerabilities on startup and end.  Weapons don't really feel balanced. The pistol is worthless compared to every other weapon (except against those 1 HP birdmen) and the homing shard launcher is also a little underwhelming. The lasergun is too situational.Secrets:They're terrible. They're a chore. They're poorly implemented.They usually come in a few varieties. Invisible hallways, some of which have the BAREST of visual cues, a few that almost have zero, and about 3 that actually have reasonable hints. The worst part about these is that they're not consistent, having you end up just wallhugging the entire game. It really brings the entire experience down.There's also hidden platforms. These are probably the worst. In some locations if you stand on an exact player sized area, your drone will make a little ping and you can activate it to reveal some platforms that you can dash on to. These kinds of secrets are absolutely terrible.  A few of them have the absolute slightest of hints (a hole in a fence of a walled platform), but even then finding these kinds of secrets is more of a chore when it should be exhileration. There's also a few secrets where if you dash to one platform your normally locked camera will be moved to see a new area. I found most of these by myself, but they still were unintuative. The worst hidden area I can remember is in the southern sector of the game, where you have to make a blind dash towards off screen to get on another platform. Other:There's also the map. It's very general, and for the most part, won't really be a help to anyone, aside from when you're looking at a guide to find where you missed secrets.  The game doesn't really have any puzzles.  I felt this to be a little wierd for a game that cited link to the past as a main influence. I wish the game had less obtuse hiding locations and more challenges for items.Replayability:The game stayed fun all the way through, but I didn't find any joy at going through it again, even with the alternate drifter or the 2 HP NG+ mode, which I realized in advance I probably wasn't good enough for, at least not without a lot of redoing.  The game just doesn't really offer enough ways to play differently, or an exciting story to experience again-  Overall - :  Good for one playthrough for most players, only those looking for an abstract kind of suffering will replay on NG+  At it's price of 20bux, it's reasonable.tl;drHyper Light Drifter wants to be Link to the Past:Prepare to Die Edition with super metroid exploring, but ends up being Metroid II: Indie Edition.

												A game for players who:- enjoy simple yet challenging combatting experience. - like pixel graphics and good music. - like character upgrade features.- like games with replay value. (after game challenges: Hoarde arena, boss rush, finding collectibles missed at first playthrough, NG+)1. The game is challenging. (Only 10.3% of players have achieved the Achievement Bully ""beat all bosses"" ) *Which is why, every time you find or kill something, it gives you that satisfaction and rewarding experience.* - Certain areas with mobs of enemies feel a little too difficult at times. - Boss fights are hard. It might get frustrating. - Secret passages in the game can be hard to find without the help of online guides. (hidden modules, keys, clothes, guns, monoliths)- You will get lost sometimes, the map itself is vast and has some hidden paths. Finding modules and getting your way to boss is not obvious. -As you progress, upgrades on attacks and dash add more depth to the combatting experience.2. Amazing pixel graphics. This game feels like an art.- monster design, character design, map design, boss design, effects. Everything is very detailed and beautiful. 3. Music / Sound effect-Great music that goes well along with the map design. Helps you to really get into the game.-sound effects of the character's attacks are very fitting. -death sounds from the mobs makes killing very satisfying.			"

												In an age where pixel indie games have become something of a cliché, Hyper Light Drifter brings some much needed life into the genre.Hyper Light Drifter, or HLD for short, is an action-adventure game with its roots firmly placed in the Legend of Zelda games of yore. With a top-down perspective, a sword to slash around, an arsenal of weapons at your disposal, and a vast world to explore full of hidden secrets and goodies, it's nothing too alien. But yet, the world of HLD is entirely alien. While you might get a text crawl or dialogue in any number of Zelda games to explain what's goin on, HLD takes it in the complete opposite direction. There is absolutely no dialogue or text to speak of, save for a couple of lines in the tutorial and a note on how to use warps. Everything is represented through either pictographs, stories shared through images by NPCs, or directly by the environment itself. It is up to the player to understand what is going on on their own terms, much like the game Fez. But unlike the self-serving pretentiousness of Fez's presentation, HLD is a very gritty, brutal world that pulls no punches.The graphical presentation is absolutely gorgeous. There is so much care and love put into the world to make it seem alive. There are tons of sprites and art pieces that are only used once, just for a small (or large) piece of scenery. The animations on the enemies, friendlies, and the player are top-notch and completely smooth. Each of the four zones are completely distinct with one another, united only by the center of the map. My humble opinion is that this is THE best pixel-style graphics you can see in any modern indie game today. It does so much with subtle color variations that it puts its peers to shame. While some might claim that certain games from the 16-bit era might fare better, that's not the point. When put in a group of its own stylistically similar peers, HLD is head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.And what better way to suit the graphics than to have crisp, fun gameplay? HLD relies on three primary mechanics, each of them simple in their own right. Swing your sword. Fire a gun. Dash from place to place. But it's what you can do with your own personal abilities that can make it much more effective. You can upgrade to chain-dash endlessly, charge up your sword to whack enemies into the abyss, chuck bombs, fire anything from a shotgun to a railgun, the latter of which is helped by the fact that ""ammo"" is generated by slashing your enemies. This promotes a quick and brutal style of combat, in which the enemies have certain patterns and behaviors that you can manipulate to your own advantage. Homing rockets heading your way? Easy, either slash through it or guide it into a baddie. Gunners shooting at you from afar? Reflect the bullets right back at them. On top of this, the amount of secrets, be it the mysterious monolith tablets to the 185 gearbits, to even outfits that help boost an aspect of your character, like faster bomb regeneration or an extra bit of health.The soundtrack is wonderfully set to the mood of the locations you visit. Grungy, popping beats in the midst of battle to a quiet ambience in the gloomier areas, there's a lot of variation to find. What's more important is not only how consistent the quality of the music is, but how well they transition from room to room. Instead of having a fixed track for a specific room, they transition from the previous room flawlessly and often become incorporated into a single song. No matter where you go or what you do, you always feel like you're making progress in the world.That doesn't mean the game is perfect, however. Finding those last few secrets can be a little bit of a chore and the underground map might as well not exist, because it barely makes any sense. Dashing from platform to platform, while a non-issue in most cases, it's rather hard to keep a straight path and you often find yourself veering off-center frequently. And not to mention, some rooms are almost unfairly brutal with their layouts.In an age where the promises of a developer are more often than not hollow, short-sighted, and disappointing, HLD is a lovely total package that every game should aspire to be or at the very least, take some pointers from. It doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or present itself as something entirely new. It's a game that knows its boundaries, respects them, and instead perfects what's inside those boundaries than trying to be a little of everything at once.Fantastic game, a must-play game for those who enjoy action-adventure games.9/10.

												This game is easily my favorite one to come out in a long time, from the beautiful visuals to the challenging yet fun combat it suits me very well.Pros- Beautiful pixel art with extremely detailed animations.-A great and diverse soundtrack that fits each area very well in my opinion.-Fun yet challenging skill based combat. (But a little luck never hurts.)-A good diversity of enemies, with widely varying attacks and strategies.-Difficult yet fair boss fights that were one of my favorite parts.-Very well made upgrade system, with diverse new attacks to get.-Secrets are fun and rewarding to find. (Here's a hint, there's a symbol you can find on the ground near most secrets.)-NG+ is personally a blast.Cons-Most guns become obsolete after you get the shotgun and the hyper railgun.-Gun upgrades only add extra ammo.-The main town feels unlived in and static.-30 FPS lock. (Apparently people have FPS drops, but that hasn't been a problem for me. And I'm playing on a non gaming CPU.)-The dash stab doesn't make a huge hole in the enemy when they die to it. (That's just a personal gripe.)All in all, this game is amazing, easily my favorite game right now, and is certainly worth checking out if you have the money. Plus, decapitating bird wizards and frog ninjas. Yes.			"

IntroductionHyper Light Drifter is a story which is being told slowly and is not necessarily easy to understand right away, because of its abstract way of unfolding. In the game you play as one of the many drifters, a nomadic AI who seeks to unravel the technologies of old times, forgotten from long ago. You get sidetracked, left to find a cure for your sickness and also saving the world from corruption.AtmosphereThe world itself is really well made. Everything you see tells its own story, like dead cities, sky-scrapper sized titans, robots, labs, temples and so on. You might even stop for a second to soak the whole greatness up. And it is drawn oh so good. Music being a key part of this game is also really amazing. It is calm and melancholic, and reminds me very much of the older movies like Blade Runner. It doesn't distract from playing the game, rather manages to sweeten the experiance.DifficultyThe game is very hard, on a level of Dark Souls and beyond. While the enemies you encounter can be tough and even tougher if they come in groups, the real difficulty shows on bosses. They each have different moves and stages and take quite a few hits to defeat. It is likely to get stuck on a boss for a while, but if you kill them in the intended order, there shouldn't be too many problems.CollectablesThere are a lot of little secrets hidden in the game, some of which are gearbits used to upgrade the dash ability, weapons, health kit slot upgrades and grenades. You can also find monoliths that tell stories of a race that lived before, constumes and keys that unlock specials doors containing said valuables.ControlsThe game plays best with a gamepad, which includes dashing, attacking with the sword, shooting, aiming and switching weapons, throwing grenades and healing. Said controls are weird at first and need getting used to, with dashing being the main problem. You need to press dash rhythmically to do chain dashes, which are vital to progress through the game. After a couple of hours though, all the pieces somehow fall into their place and when you start getting the hang of it, the game becomes a nice experiance, rather than an awful nightmare.Besides it is more of a design choice, rather than developers own fault.The negativeThe only deal breaker for some could be that the game only plays at 30 FPS. That could lead to some missed opportunities to dodge or attack, but I can say for myself, I honestly didn't have any problem with frames. The gameplay is smooth, even on a fast paced game like Hyper Light Drifter.ConclusionI'd totally recommend this game, even at its current price. If you are on a budget, don't worry, this game is totally worth every penny. I think that everyone should experience what awesomeness this is.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is truly a fun experience. It is a very mysterious game with interesting lore, all while having a rather simple story. You'll experience little hand holding with difficult boss fights and enemy encounters. However, the combat is rich, fluid, and fast paced. It's clear the developer put a lot of passion and style into this game. For me, this is a game truly worth playing and I recommend it.			"

												This game is atmospheric, riviting, poignant and fun to play. The creators crafted something beautiful, not just in form, but in functionality. The game is challenging but not frustratingly so; each mistakes lights within you a fire to do better and improve. The silence of your avatar is endearing, coupled with his suffering, the sotic nature of his nebulous quest is a task you will want to see until the end.			"

												This game actually feels like some legendary title from 90's by the way it's played, not just visual presentation. And it does also have some controls nitpicking relevant to games of that time. Which sometimes works smooth as butter and other times just one stumble or mistake and everything falls apart. At least most of the time relevant checkpoints keep you from rage quitting, but only if you don't try some challenges. Those can get easy over time though, with skill and patience.If you like Transistor, you might just like this game. And vice versa.			"

												Steam reviews only allow ""recommend: yes/no"". I checked ""no"" but it's too harsh, there should be a ""not for everyone"".Maybe I was not in the right mood when playing this or I'm not the target of this style, but I think I'll just abandon playing it.I loved the art when watching the trailer/screenshots and the ambience is interesting; but the difficulty made this boring, and the enjoyment of exploring this world turned into a chore when it killed me again and again (with sloooowww death/revive animation) for each new zone.Also, the art style, while nice to look at at first, gets a little in the way of the gameplay: not very ""readable"", getting stuck trying to move in a fight because some differently colored square was actually a wall and not the ground, for example.I think I don't have the time for that anymore. I preferred getting stuck for days on a difficult level in ""Portal Stories: Mel"" than getting stuck for 10 minutes fighting my way through a room in HLD.			"

												Died a lot. Always came back for the art. Finally stayed for the awesome-once-mastered gameplay.There is a lot lot to be loved about HLD. The gorgeous pixel art, the awesome sound atmosphere and the amazing gameplay combine to provide a very enjoyable experience. Kudos to the bosses, which are among the most memorable I've ever fought in a video game.However, the story sometimes feels a bit cryptic, especially considering the beautiful world created for the needs of the game, which would maybe have deserved a clearer, more engaging setting (as well as better hints for secrets !). Personally, I've been refrained from trying to find collectibles for that reason, and as a consequence the game felt quite short for its price.If you love Dark Souls, 2D Zelda, or fair challenge as a whole, get it now.If you love mind-blowing pixel art and beautiful worlds, but aren't willing to endure numerous hours dying and exploring, get it on sale.7.5/10 (PS : Go east first !)

												Super beautiful game and the learning curve is on point for those that enjoy a challenge. Also if you like treasure hunting, oh boy, you're going to have fun.As an anecdote, I did the western wing on two seperate occasions. The first time that I fought the boss, I died probably 15-20 times before succeeding. The second time, I killed it on the first attempt.Also, the way that there is no written or spoken language outside imagery is a super clever and engaging decision.As a package, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Thank you developers.			"

												If you like a beautiful atmosphere, and a game with a great degree of challenge, reward for unbridled exploration and minimalist storytelling, stop reading and buy the game. It took me unlocking multi-dash, an extra health pack slot, an increased ammo clip and the ability to reflect projectiles with my sword, as well as the training accrued during the time it took exploring the world in order to gain these upgrades, to sufficiently prepare me with the skills to defeat the first boss I encountered.That's how much of a challenge he was. Which is why it was so glorious when his health bar hit zero, and my drifter did his victory dance. Those who would complain of difficult boss fights in games, well, this game has them. You'll need to be patient.Looking back, I could have probably killed him without the extra clip for my pistol, as well as the extra health pack. But I'm glad I gained these upgrades. Hyper Light Drifter is some kind of mix between the older Zelda titles, with a spattering of Dark Souls, and all the atmosphere of a game like Bastion. Once you get to the main hub, you can explore the world in four directions, with each direction ending in a boss fight. As you explore the world, you unlock upgrading chips which can be cashed in at shops in the main town. There are a number of upgrades affecting your sword, your guns, your movement, your health packs, and grenades. I'm about 23% through the game, based on what I've collected so far, and I can say at this point that it really doesn't matter what I picked up, except for maybe multi-dash/projectile reflection. Of the two boss fights I've done, they've seemed to be the most useful skills to have. I'd wager neither are necessary.The game is devoid of text, and there's no voice acting. Everything you discover, you do so through images that present events, and visuals that explain your purpose, etc. Talking to people consists of seeing a few images that make up their story, and in many cases, a symbol is added to your map. You're on your own to divine what everything means. Exploration of the world helps in this regard, as the atmosphere provides you context for the world you're in.Bonus points for that skeleton giant on the mountainside in the north. Seeing it in the background, and then actually encountering that area proper screamed Dark Souls. Each enemy has a differing amount of life, and a different moveset. If you're impatient, you'll quickly find your Navi-like sprite shouting at you to heal. Once you've run the gamut against a few of the same type of enemies, you'll no longer find yourself in this situation, instead dispatching groups of shuriken-throwing ninjas with untenable grace. I suggest picking up the sword-projectile deflection as soon as possible, as your ability to deflect can transform a pain-staking ambush into a slaughterhouse ballet. Bosses require a Dark Soulsesque amount of patience. Learning their moves, learning where you'll be safe, when you can attack using your different weapons, and again, maintaining safety, are your priorities. It can get frustrating, but I wouldn't call it twitch-style play. There's a certain amount of a grace period with regards to timing, at least as far as I've made it. You can set yourself up with quite a few potions with relative ease, allowing a greater grace for mistakes. Dying resets you to the closest checkpoint, which usually occur when you swap screens. Occasionally, you'll encouter ambush-style encounters where you can't escape until you clear the field, usually ending in a checkpoint. If you die in an area without hitting a checkpoint, all upgrades gained and enemies killed will respawn. Most enemies in an area do not respawn once dispatched.Health packs respawn, so you can properly prepare for boss fights, as well as exploring new areas.One of the few things I haven't yet mentioned is the ability to unlock ""magenta triangles"" for each of the areas you go to. I've yet to realize their significance in the context of lore. They're used to unlock specific doors in each of the 4 areas. Specifically, each area has its' own pieces, which you'll collect as you explore, allowing access for further exploration. Finally, there are a number of locked doors, labelled with a key symbol, which I've yet to unlock. Mysterious.At this point, I'm going to stop writing and continue playing. I have the urge to see another gorgeous vista. Plus, there're some water-submerged ruins that need picking through with a fine-tooth comb.Adieu.			"

												Are you morbidly depressed because you can't run Dark Souls 3?This is both a substitute, and a damn good replacement until you get a half-decent computer. I highly recommend using keyboard and mouse for fluid gameplay, though this is likely personal preference. A marvelous soundtrack, complete with rewarding pattern-recognition and gradually progressive gameplay. You can go wherever you want in the game, in any direction, and you'll be able to handle everything that comes at you, even without upgrades. This game is the pride and joy of isometric dungeon crawlers for the last year or so.			"

												This review is based on the 60fps update which in my opinion was much needed. I played for an hour or so on release and the 30fps lock genuinely hurt my eyes on the area transitions. The update fixes that.Absolutely superb. The general art style is right up my street, glitchy and organic with dark undertones. The music is suited to each situation, exploration is backed by some lovely piano tunes. Gameplay is very responsive with good timing needed for dodging what feels at times likje a bullet hell game. Dodging around and slicing mobs up makes you feel like a ninja. The skill upgrades are cool too.			"

												It is, by far, one of the most challenging-but-fair games I have played. The controls feels just right and responsive, in almost all fights I have played there's a way to get all your opponents without taking a single hit from them, but that requires master timing and precision. As everyone said, the ambient, scenarios, music... all matches amaizingly well on this game. It is hard? Yes. Of course it will be hardest at first, but trial and error teach very well how the game mechanics works. Already one of my favorites on my library!PS: The game has LOCAL Co-Op mode if you plug in a controller and hit start. It will take you one of your five health bars to spawn the second player, but it will have full health. The second player does not have medkits, and spawns without ammo. But, keep in mind! Bosses will have twice as much health!			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one the few games which's awe and greatness I always struggle to describe, and I daresay I it's the grandest and most relatable thing have I ever played in my life. It draws a colorful and ominous world of non-verbal, environmental story-telling where even the tiniest prop plays part in a game-wide geometric supremacy. Same goes for cinematics, animation, music, level design, illustrations, sound and the UI art as well - everything fits perfectly together and I have yet to experience that degree of attention and detail in any other game I'm aware of.Gameplay-wise, you'll get an excellent mix of Zelda bits, Metroid-esque half-open world exploration and the combat strictness of something like Bloodborne or the Souls series. You can dash like a lightning, slice like a samurai and sport a bunch of guns for pretty much anything where the first two aren't enough. Almost every move you can learn, every gun you can find is gonna help you and play an important role in unriddling the secrets of the world. There are battles of both strategic and reactive quality, hidden rooms, half-invisible platform puzzles, satisfying bosses and a dozens of seemingly unrelated but yet delightfully mysterious collectables.And then, every so often, you'll find yourself soaked in this mix of flow, beauty, sorrow, delight, terror and and awe - all at the same time. It's a phenomenal experience to have, if not THE experience in your life as an appreciator of the superb. Moreover, it's the first game where I feel that it's more than a game, more than a game that is art. It's beyond art.Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend playing Hyper Light Drifter. Especially if you have yet to play it.			"

												This game stirs my soul in evocative ways. It feels like an amalgam of my own past, escaping into 8-bit NES and titles like Blaster Master and Guardian Legend and Crystalis, although it's not a direct reference to any of those games... But it's like that, especially if you grew up playing 8- and 16-bit video games developed in Japan... Somehow mixed in all this is the DNA of visionary anime like Nausicaa and other fare.It feels like a conversation held in the chiptune pixelated language of an entire era and aesthetic. Something somber about it all, too, a bit gothic perhaps.  The game invites profound awe and introspection just one layer below the action with every sprite, background, and audio track.Hyper Light Drifter seems to come from the heart, and stands loudly proclaiming the artform of gaming lives on even as the world, wonder, and hope of our childhoods fade and are replaced with something more knowing, more appreciative of the fleeting good, and more weary of all in the world that erodes it.   It's especially poignant today; evocative of a cultural era that seems to be slipping through our fingers as the Japan of a generation or two ago that reached such stunning artistic heights in anime and digital media perhaps begins to fade.I'm still relatively early in the game, but would enthusiasticly recommend it to anyone who enjoys deep, quiet, beautiful exploration, tremendous atmosphere, exceptional music, and a bit of legitimately challenging twitch gameplay. :)			"

												Quite possibly my favorite game on steam. Everything about this game is great, from the music to the art style and overall gameplay. I love how it looks like a simple adventure indie game but at the same time I love how challenging and difficult it is behind all the prettiness that is this game. You cant necessarily improve your character based on just leveling up only, I like that while there are a few upgrades and perks from outfit combos, it's mostly you learning how to improve on your movements and utilizing what you've learned to defeat different enemies. At first it's confusing as you don't really know where to go. There isn't any dialogue at all besides a few figures shown to by certain characters. You choose where to start, either north south east or west and just follow the path and see where it takes you. At first I didn't like that there wasn't a guide as to where to start, but really that's what makes this game so special. It's an unknown world and you immerse yourself in it. Once you explore after a few hours you'll start to get the hang of it. The bosses are amazing, the enemies are unique too. And besides all that there are so many hidden secrets and items to collect from outfits to gear bits. You don't necessarily need to collect everything to progress in the game, but if you're like me you want to 100% it and collect everything. And if the game isn't hard enough for you as it is you can try it on NG+ mode and make your life a whole lot more complicated.My only complaints about this game is on collecting items, it was a pain to collect all 186 gearbits and having no idea where to look for the ones I've missed. The game gives you hints as to there being secrets nearby I suggest you look for those once you start the game so you don't realize halfway like me and go through everything again and recheck every corner. (They look like small little squares on the ground)Another thing is I highly recommend playing this with a controller. You need to be fast in this game and moving around fast and precisely is pretty hard with a keyboard and mouse. It's much more enjoyable with a controller. Lastly if you liked super brothers sword and sorcery you'll LOVE this. I know I did c: "

												An amazing experience throughout. The visuals and soundtrack are immersive and rather unique. Combat is challenging with many different enemy types.What might seem like a cute indie game, turns quite shocking, starting from the intro. Behind the bright and colorful visuals, is a dark and gripping story. I would say it's nothing less than a masterpiece.			"

												An absolutely amasing title with story within the silence.Get it on sale.Get it full price.Just get it, tbh.Nice controls, nice art, nicer music.If you enjoy the idea of an open world adventure with a vague quest where all of the story and interactions are shown through animation and montage, this is definitely the game for you.Really pumps up those dillapidated sci-fi tones. Think an atmosphere of something like Crawl or Risk of Rain. Or both, if you swing that way ;)Oh yeah, someone posted a negative review to draw attention to the fact that the game is near unplayable for people with colour blindness. If you know you are colourblind with green or red (I might also add blue?), I suggest looking this game up on youtube before buying. That's the only excuse for not buying it, tbh.			"

												This game is incredible. It grips you from the first minute when you're introduced to the game through a slick, harrowingly beautiful and intriguing opening cinematic. The animation and art direction is top notch. The game play is a mix between link to the past dungeon crawling and challenging combat and exploration reminiscent of Dark Souls. The combat is tough but fair. Often times I'll die, and go back into the encounter with a new plan and win because I'm more familiar with the challenge at hand. This is the best kind of difficulty. It's not easy, but it encourages you to retry and conveys a sense of accomplishment when you win the fight. I would recommend this to anyone. One of the best games I've played in awhile.			"

												Awesome game all the way through to the end........ Keeping this short and sweet. I really enjoyed playing this to the point of actually finishing it a third time as I constantly learned of areas to add more to the plot or story of the game. Now remember the game is very visual in telling its story and the sound really adds to the atmosphere that just keeps you going. I never really care to achieve all the bits and pieces of the game and just enjoy your own experience as you play through any game but this one just calls me back for more. I've owned the game since its release and up until now I have just put this together for the reviewers.This game was well worth the money and highly recommend it........Great Job.			"

												A beautiful, neon, anime-inspired ""Link to the Past"" with great combat & exploration. The art style was enough for me to buy the game and I was immediately blown away by its stunning opening sequence with its visual nods to Akira, Nausicaa, & End of Evangelion. The game is hauntingly scored by Disasterpeace with a mood similar to his IT FOLLOWS soundtrack, eerie and dreamy. Difficulty isn't an issue, there's some challenging boss fights but with forgiving checkpoints and an upgrade system, every battle can be triumphed with satisfaction. I only played through it once and didn't find all collectibles, but I highly recommend it and greatly enjoyed by time.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of the most beautiful and engaging indie titles I have played in recent years.It is quite an amazing feat because the game manages to achieve this almost without written text or direct exposition. It really and I mean really does not hold your hand when it comes to explaining the game mechanics or even the story. However, a beautiful world with a tragic story is there to explore and the journey is wholeheartedly worth it.Just take a look at the screenshots! You can tell that the art direction is fantastic and seeing it in motion coupled with an unforgettable music is just as amazing. The gameplay is reminiscent of the Souls games in a way that you have to slow down and react wisely during combat. A lot of people and reviewers noted that the game is needlessly hard sometimes and I strongly disagree. It is challenging but if you keep being patient and learn enemy patterns, you should overcome the hardest of the situations. (And this is coming from someone who has not played through a single Souls-like game.)I understand the controversy behind the game being locked to 30fps but it was not a deal-breaker for me. Personally, I would have preferred a 60fps lock overall, since technically you would have twice the time to react to enemy fire and also perform the dashing moves. The gameplay is fine really and anyone saying that it should be ""60 fps or no purchase"" should take off the chip from their shoulders.Overall, Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent example of how to tell a story and engage the players, sometimes in very moving ways, in its world just by using gameplay alone. I am simply left wanting more and I hope that the developer will soon add an expansion pack or anything that reveals more of this universe. It earns a wholehearted recommendation from me, even at full price.			"

												Hold up, before you downvote this review hear me out. I bought this game to play co-op with a buddy as advertised. However be forewarned that there is only local co-op though the store says there is both co-op and local co-op (even multiplayer and local multiplayer).Its an otherwise beautiful game as you can tell from the positive reviews but I feel scammed that the game does not have online co-op as advertised. I'm willing to change my review if the store page is revised or if online co-op is added.			"

												This is a truly beautiful game. It amazing visuals, an amazing soundtrack, well-paced and engaging combat but also an alluring world that rewards exploration as well. The use of coloration and the game's unique stylized art themes, as well as its distinguishing lack of dialogue, give it a feel unlike any other, but at the same time evokes nostalgia in gamers who have played games such as A Link to the Past.While playing, the choices of where to explore and what to fight available to the player are abundant; while stuck in one area, players can fall back to a previous one and usually find something new, or practice their mechanical and/or combat skill to overcome the task at hand. Solid top-down melee mechanics and even ranged gameplay will enthrall gamers looking for action, but long sections of exploration or area progression will play to the sense of childlike wonder found in all who are ready to appreciate a game. Taking beauty and exploration that games like Zelda have done so well, and combining that with fast-paced and unique combat gives Hyper Light Drifter that nostalgic feel while also giving it a personality of its own.Perhaps the aspect of the game that makes players feel invested, beside the shear aesthetic beauty of the game, is that there are no words beyond the file select. The player interacts with NPCs through dialogue boxes containing pictures or brief demonstrations rather than actual dialogue. This may be intimidating at first, but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive enough for this to not be a problem, and it forces players to be more involved in discovering their world, successfully adding a sense of depth that is rarely seen.The only possible drawback to this game is that there simple is not enough of it; if players do not pressure themselves to explore the world to the fullest, they may find themselves progressing through the game a shallowly fast rate. However, anyone who is willing to appreciate this game to its fullest will take it slow, try to find every last secret and explore every last nook, and will not be dissapointed upon completion. Also, this game is highly replayable, as well has having an NG+ mode, so even if a player goes through it quickly, there is still more to get out of it.Ultimately, this is a game filled with breathtaking visuals, thrilling usage of colors, and a hair-raisingly beautiful soundtrack. By taking inspiration from successful elements of older games, it evokes a sense of nostalgia, but also adds its own personality through its original combat mechanics and atmosphere.10/10.			"

												Honestly can't recommend this game enough. The world-building is some of the best I've experienced, with the story being told almost entirely through the environments you encounter and the secret areas you uncover. This game does more with atmosphere and music alone than many other games manage to do with dialogue and text. The combat is certainly difficult but only teeters on the edge of frustrating in a very small number of encounters. Some may complain about the boss fights, but much like Dark Souls, all of them are winnable if you simply pay attention. Bottom line, this is one of my favorite games to come out in years. You definitely owe it to yourself to give it a shot.			"

												This game is definitely roguer than a ROGUELIKE in difficulty even if it is not a roguelike, honestly, permadeath or procedural stuff is not even featured, game becomes catchy and challenging but sometimes mentally harassing. However this game to me could be a classic of elegance and gameplay, Hyper Light Drifter looks so stylish to innovate a classical formula, rpg adventures with an hack'n'slash type of combat, that it would deserve a look just because of the taste and elegance in the artwork and soundscapes, at first glance the commands are immediate and simple to master, recalling a console type of approach,(reccomended joypad), the story becomes catchy thanks to the the addictive graphic and colours, and there's not a single sentence to read; usually i'm not that keen on those type of games, however i'd reccomend this as it tends to be a sapient mixture of ingredients, even during the difficult parts.

												A beautiful and engaging game, unafraid and carefully designed. One half exploration, one half a challanging but not unfair combat system. Recommended to anyone who enjoys nonlinear worlds with rewarding exploration.Points of interest:-The combat is very paced and rewards patience.-The environments are detailed and complex, not linear but not open-world. -Careful observation and exploration is heavily rewarded but not necessary. -Has a beautiful soundtrack which enhances the experience without being distracting.-The world is full of many different hidden items, some of which are easier to find than others.-There are unlockables and upgrades, but none are necessary to enjoy the game. -Death reloads the autosave, but it seems to always be well-placed.-Replayable - the world has a lot to offer and is designed well enough that going through again isn't annoying.-There is a story, but it's not overdone, and doesn't get in the way of playing the game.-Best played with a gamepad.

												Been wanting to play this game for a long time, so I was excited to finally explore its beautiful, cryptic world, but my expectations haven't been met unfortunately. The combat felt punishing and way too difficult, because it technically doesn't give you the finesse required to master the fights. Knowing it had four directions to go to, and discovering that each had a boss required to progress in the game, I was suprised to beat them all that fast. So the game was shorter than I thought, too.But once I closed the game to take a break I realized I had spent 4 hours and later finished the game with almost 9 hours played in one day and it felt like I played way less!The game grew on me and after a while my first impressions all have been eradicated - I begun to love the game more and more. The soundtrack is subtle and fits perfectly, ranging from lovely piano music to goregeous analogue, warm  synthesizers. The pixel art is beyond everything I have seen before, setting a new standard for what you can achieve with only pixels and a few colours. And the combat got easier after time once you know how to time your dashes and combos, making each encounter a well choreographed dance. Boss fights sometimes felt too easy, sometimes too hard, but overall it boils down to how well you can play - memorize attack patterns and behaviour, counter it with a dash and time your combos just right to make the most out of the small time windows where you can make your move.In a lot of ways this game reminded me of Titan Souls, although both are completely different. If you wonder if Hyper Light Drifter is something you would like, then give Titan Souls a shot. Should be easy to get since it was bundled a bunch of times.Review taken from my backlog profile.[backlog-deepness.rhcloud.com] "

												If you're oldschool or you're discrediting this age's pixilated games or even new devs, you're the gamer I need to talk to. That's definitely a product only possible to come from Another World gamers and others, when the narrative was purely visual. Like a mute movie. Enough good points compensates flaws.That game does the same as the older RPGs did. Terranigma in particular, but the game is unique on his own right.The world is big, the eastern sunken ruins are probably the first choice of play thanks to some random dog but map screen has a confusing design.Controls aren't always so responsive and so far I can't play local Co-op with a joystick and I couldn't find a fix on Skynet Google.Music does much of the ''talking'' here. Games without written dialogue relies on it, music is very immersive on all occasions.It isn't based on @ss-leveling, you gotta work and find the upgrades. Ups could be a bit more rewarding for all the troubles you have to find them.Exploration and discovery suits with the gameplay. The order to go is purely based on what you can do. Your motor skills better be sharp though. Impressive visual creativity are sometimes blurred by lack of semiotic concordance in the plot. Nevermind. Wtf that even means?""Standard'' level can be very hard, and you're somewhat ''tricked'' to take it first time. But this is exactly where the fun-factor is dammit. Just don't call that Arcade.Nice pixelated graphics without too much polishing which is good. Nostalgia attacks during cut-scenes and other animations.A bit of human ingenuity made a simple concept living again, that's why it is attractive to me.I really recommend you Hyper Light Drifter and I never recommend games so explicitly. I usually appeal to subliminal messages and lots of unwanted bull in the best of my s#tty abilities, so we don't end up like IGN or something. Go drift with the light, so far it has been great to go fractal in this cybernetic fantasy world. 11 out of frigging 10 man. "

												I absolutely recommend this game.Sound, graphics, story, action, all really fantastic. The story is paced out without text, leaving a great deal to the imagination. The action is pretty brutal, but no so much that it makes you break your controller (usually). I find this game inspiring; a real work of art.Having completed it, I can't quite think of what to compare it too. But when I play it, it made me feel like a kid playing Zelda:Link to the Past again for the very fist time. It had that sense of exploration, mystery, and wonder. Some of the vistas the game hits you with really made me smile. Such a seemingly simple medium and they used it so well.I look forward to more from Heart Machine. Even if never another Hyper Light Drifter (because it is perfect enough as is), something else with that level of quality.Thanks Heart Machine. I wish I could have contributed to the Kickstarter  :)			"

												EDIT: 60fps added in beta update. LITERALLY NO REASON TO NOT BUY THIS GAME.Without a shadow of a doubt, I love this game. The environments are gorgeous and interesting to explore; everything feels like it has an actual purpose in the world as though it truly is a real place people live in. While not really a puzzler, the game encourages in-depth exploration and rewards you for finding its very well tucked away secrets (although sometimes you find a secret area and think, ""how was I really supposed to find this without stumbling on it by accident?""). The fighting is fast and exciting and once you master your movement, you'll feel like some sort of insane ninja. The aesthetic is amazing, the soundtrack is absolutely astounding and I can easily say without a doubt this is one of the best experiences I've had in a while.			"

												The game is very good, and you will spend a lot of time trying to find things if you're like me and refuse to use a guide. Other people have probably spoken all about this though. I just want to make one thing very clear: there is no co-op. ""Local co-op"" doesn't mean ""co-op"" for most of us in the internet age since we don't all have a little brother or someone that comes over to play games anymore like in the 90's. This game does not have online connectivity. nVidia GameStream does work, but it also has its own problems. We weren't able to get the game's audio playing to the remote client, and he could hear himself talk into his microphone whenever he said anything while my game window was focused. Maybe in a few months or something, nVidia will fix the problems there and this game can be co-op that way, because he was not complaining about control latency (he lives 1000 miles away).			"

												After picking this up today, and getting sucked into it for 10 straight hours, I can recommend this game to anyone who loves hunting for secrets in games. Learning how to identify them and actually discovering them is extremely rewarding. There was even one secret area within another secret area Quake 2 style. Just know that some of the boss battles are brutally difficult at first. Once you understand how they move though, your immensely satisfying victory is inevitable. I did end up having to backtrack at certain points, but I always kept looking and eventually made it to the next boss.Tl;DrAs long as you persevere and keep an eye out for secrets, you will have a great experience.

												I really, really wanted to like this game. I spent 3 years following it after backing it on Kickstarter and was sorely disappointed with a game that could be beaten (although not 100% completed) in less than eight hours. Not only that, but I paid $20 for it. Those who claim this game is difficult probably just aren't very adept at playing many games. The fighting is repetitive, predictable, and forgetful. There are only a handful of enemies in each section of the map and the bosses prove to be the most difficult, though not overpowering. The story, if you can call it that, is vague at best and the best part is that when I beat the game, it froze and whatever ending there was supposed to be, I missed. I'm not really curious enough to play through again to see what happened. I don't see the intrigue to the New Game+ because the regular game was so underwhelming. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is ambient and relaxing, and the movements are pretty fluid. However, the amount of abilities is pretty limited so there's not much variety to your attacks. Again, I really wanted to like this game, but for this price, I just can't recommend it.			"

												The trees rustle in the distance. A faint summer breeze blushes against your cheek, then dies. Holding tight to your blade, you make your way though a magenta forest. The metalic taste of blood in your moulth reminds you that you don't have much time left.Hyper Light Drifter is a post apocalyptic tribute to classical Zelda games. You are a crimson traveler seeking a profaned crystal in hope of finding a cure for your illness. That is all I can tell about the story, not because I'm afraid of spoiling, but because it's fairly difficult to figure it out myself.Most of the story is told though the enviorment. Between the combat rooms, you travel though graveyards and laboratories, unraveling why the world came to what it is now. Impressive pixel art combined with an immersive ambience create a very strong atmosphere. So, even if you won't understand what you have played, you may still have a jolly fun experience.Now, the combat. The combat is generally quite simplistic and consists out of dashing, hacking away and occasionally using projectiles. Most of the challange comes from being forced to manage large groups of enemies. In a way, you can classify it as a bullet hell. The dash plays a key role in the game, as you are given a few moment of invincibility each time you use it. So, most of the time in the arena one will spend as a pink blur circuling around the room. The difficulty demands quick reaction times, up until you get the upgrades.Two extra medkits, a shotgun and the abulity that allows you to deflect bullets back at the enemy have a tendency to make most encounters anticlimactic.After completing the game, you will probably realize that you've missed about 60 percent of the content, since most of that content is quite well hidden. Everybody is expecting to find a spare upgrade part under the stair case, yet items that unlock new areas and game modes are so criptic to find, that there is no way the majority of players will uncover them without consulting a walkthough.My first playthough lasted about 10-12 hours and held my interest quite well. If you are a fan of dungeon crawlers set in a surreal apocalypse, mind giving this one a look. If you are hesitant, try picking this one up during the next Steam sale. "

												Oh yeah, this is what I've been waiting for!  I love the fast paced combat, atmospheric music, art style, and I really like the minimalist style UI.  If the rest is anything like what I've experienced so far, we're in for a treat.			"

												----------------UPDATE-------------------I'm going to go back to playing easier games, like Dark Souls.------------------------------------------------My review will only be an initial one, as I haven't progressed much further through the game (so I won't comment on story quality yet).Firstly, if you're thinking of buying this game...when they say this game is recommended with a controller, they absolutely mean it. The keyboard controls are good, but the mouse aiming just doesn't quite work with the drifting mechanic, as often the direction you're indicating with the cursor will be drifted over, and so the direction of the NEXT drift is the opposite. So basically, joysticks all the way.The actual gameplay is excellent, and there's a clear emphasis on the pacing of attacks for a hack'n'slash title. You can't simply ghost an enemy and spam them with melee attacks, as the melee attacks aren't instantaneous in their duration and therefore leave a window for you to be damaged. The pistol/gun is also limited in its ammo, and you must refill it by killing enemies. It means you can't simply spam the gun, as it won't get you through a battle alone. Gameplay wise, the drift mechanic is pretty fun. Apart from traversing gaps in the terrain, it melds well into battling enemies as a dodge mechanic. It also assists in breaking up battles with the previous discussed melee and pistol/gun attacks, and the game seemingly encourages you to alternate between them, which is reinforced by the enemy's attack patterns. Level progression is also extremely Zelda-esque, a large open world with marked objectives and certain areas to continue story progression. So there's linear story progression but in an open-world, though I don't know if this will split into multiple story missions at this point (though it could). The possibility of some degree of non-linear story progression is only suggested to be possible as some story missions require you to travel to fetch various segments that combined will unlock the next story segment, so there's a degree of non-linearity in mission completion as is (the closest example I can think of like this is FEZ cube requirements when unlocking new sections). Additionally, the game also implements an auto-save system, so dying will result in respawning either at the beginning of the level (often occurs in dungeons), or nearby before a battle area. While autosave locations can often be annoying, or make a game overly easy, they have been well implemented in Hyper Light Drifter and strike a good balance, being useful without affecting difficulty. I say this because the game can be f*cking hard at times and no number of saves is going to help you.Where the game stands out is its audio and visuals, Disasterpeace delivering on another stellar soundtrack that really drives home the atmosphere of the environment drawn by the phenomenal pixel art. The illustrations are beautiful, and quite frankly, I've never seen pixel art better than this in a game. There are points in the game where you can just stop and look from piece to piece of the environment, noticing the detail put into each. I especially liked the detail put into the non-combat environments such the robots(?) frozen in time, covered with moss. It very much has Studio Ghibli's ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"" appeal. It's hard to top this art direction, its been implemented perfectly.It's also worth noting the 30 fps lock. While it certainly isn't desirable, I found it to be barely noticeable even when playing with a mouse + keyboard (as framerates have an immediately noticeable impact on the responsiveness of a mouse), so again, a controller is the safe choice and the preferred option for this game. So far, so very, very good. I need to update this review when I can play it with a controller, but so far it's very much heading towards a ""must own"". Its hard to find games like this with such distinctive art direction and executed with such finesse, and actually giving back to the supporters instead of cr@pping on them with microtransactions etc.			"

												Pros: This game offers interesting challenges, great art and a wide range of secrets waiting to be discovered. Some sections of the game are merciless both in setting and gameplay and will probably require a lot of tries to get through. For character progression, the game rewards exploration rather than grind.The Linux port seems to be working pretty well on a Radeon HD 7770 using the Catalyst driver. If you're gaming on Linux, this is most definitely worth it.Cons: Any completionist will inevitably have to spend a lot of time trying to push through walls and peeking from cliffs. Some of the hidden secrets seem to be unreasonably difficult to deal with, in particular the dash challenges. Why would you ever do anything like that?			"

												Absolutely one of the best games I've ever played. If you're still unsure about buying this cheap and complete classic, let me try and convince you:1). The visuals are stunning. I went in with lowish expectations because it was a pixel game, but god damn it's amazing what this game creates out of those small colourful squares. The graphic designers manage to create beautiful and remarkable landscapes with depth and awe that make you stop and appreciate the view for a bit. The sprites are all detailed and made with care, the animations and effects all combine in the heat of combat so nothing feels out of place. It all flows fantastically in a way that lets you know it was mastercrafted. 2). The sound design is just as good. The robotic sounding tunes manage to give off the feel the game is trying to convey, that of old busted technology scattered around, leaving mysteries behind for you to uncover. But those same robotic melodies are exactly that, melodic. They sound wonderful and fit beautifully, and the way they transition perfectly whenever you discover a great new sight or enemies appear and combat starts really keeps that aforementioned flow going.3). The gameplay is brilliant. It's all well and good for a game to look and sound good, but if it doesn't play well, it's a bad game. Well, luckily HLD hits the nail on the head in all departments. With a game that channels a Link To The Past inspired world with various different enviroments to explore with many unique enemies and landscapes, which change up the combat every time to keep it all fresh, you get a really good experience. The difficulty isn't low either. Many equiate it to Dark Souls, I would say I understand why but I wouldn't say so myself. The combat is a lot faster and more fluid, but in terms of how hard, I'd say its on par. 4). Lastly, the story. This game is very cryptic. It doesn't flat out tell you any story. It's a game with no voice acting at all, save for grunts made by NPCs, however you do get visual stories made up of several pictures when you talk to certain NPCs, which make up small stories of their experiences. This leaves you guessing, and perhaps you'll be looking up particular parts to understand what's going on. I'd say this is its only major downfall, as a beautiful single player RPG, I wish the story was a bit more comprehensible.That's about it. I really, really love this game, and I'm so sad it's as underappreciated as it is. This is a gem, a classic which will remain in my mind as one of the best games. Period. If you're looking for a inexpensive but fulfilling experience, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not picking this up and playing it. Played my copy with an Xbox 360 controller and it was a very comfortable experience. A lot of people complain that it's locked at 30fps, but I can assure you it doesn't matter at all. The visuals make up for the not as silky-smooth experience, and I beg, please don't disregard this game because of something as trivial as an fps lock.			"

												Damn good fun... played several hours in the Kickstarter alpha alone, now, having begun to play the full release, they definitely did not disappoint. It's a mix of Bastion (post-apocalyptic-narrative/atmosphere/unique-stylish-aesthetic), Zelda (story-driven/adventure-exploration/mechanics/upgrades), and FEZ (atmospheric-music/sound-design=disasterpeace).Pros:-Very attractive and stylish pixel art, great sound design and atmospheric music (well designed, wholly coherent with complimentary components, from art & animation to sound effects & music.)-Mechanics have some depth and skill of use (drifting & swordplay, with upgrades).-World-building, Storytelling & Immersion (a variety of races, adding plenty to the world-building and atmosphere; vignette-based story-telling, relying on pictures and NPCs whose animations speak a thousand words; atmosphere reinforced through art, music & sound design, along with areas that have their own feel and design aesthetic).-Plenty to explore and many hidden areas (a charming home base, reminicient of Zelda A Link to the Past; variations on a theme, distinct and purposeful tilesets that have a story; cleverly hidden areas, requiring curiosity and persistence).Cons:-Performance hiccups - The game does suffer from slow-downs, as it was created using GameMaker and isnt the most optimized, sometimes making the game more difficult than it should be (eg: during combat, when trying to drift or attack, input does not register and frame rate drops like crazy, so you end up getting mauled to death when you would other wise have fended enemies off or even try to escape.) * If you are suffering from unusually low fps, it helps to make the game ""Full Screen"" if you have it set to ""Windowed Max""-Forced, unnecessary revisiting - Some hidden areas require special items, from areas on opposite sides of the map - where this can push the player to revisit previously visited areas, it is downright needless and frustrating, as other guns that should have the same effect do not (eg: an area that requires the ""Lazer Gun"" to trigger a switch and not just the recently acquired ""Zaliska""'s exploding bullets, which triggers other, much more hidden switches in the same locale). Upon a revisit to such an area, after defeating the boss and acquiring his special pistol, making sure that all the hidden areas were explored, one will only to find the recently acquired upgrade/pistol does not work. I understand if such instances are meant to give more 'gameplay', but it does not work in this game, due to the labyrinthian and complex map/area layout. It worked in Zelda and gave areas more use, but those areas were much more easily recalled and offered a simple, pleasant memory game.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a top down pixelated hack & slash and shooter. The story start off with your character (a drifter) afflicted with a sickness that is killing them. They need to search the areas to discover answers for a cure. What interesting is that the whole story is told without any words being spoken or written. All ""dialogue"" is told using pictures. So I found myself talking to everyone and paying close attention to try to make sense of the story. Gameplay is fast pace. Initially you have a dash ability to dodge attacks and zip past enemies and sword to cut down enemies. The Drifter also carry around 2 health items that restore health (you can upgrade it to carry more). As the game progress you'll gain new guns and currency to get upgrades and new skills. The currency is rare to come by and require much exploration to amount enough to get enough for an upgrade. Now exploration is where this game struggle since the map is just confusing to look at, let alone use. You're better off just not using and walking against every wall of each area looking for a secret passage. Enemies are quite easy to beat, but can become overwhelming when force to take out multiple at once and different types. The Bosses are quite interesting and can give players a decent challenge. I've never found a boss that was just ""unfair"" in fighting them, but challenging enough to make me remember them. The traps in the dungeon and world are easy enough to get through and the puzzle are simple and easy to solve. The real draw of this game feel like the exploration because there are numerous locked doors that can require up to 10~12 keys to open. And when these keys are hidden throughout the area and the map is confusing to look at you will find yourself just wondering around hoping that your stumble upon a treasure.All in all the game is fun and short. The only real way to expand your playtime is to take your time to explore for all the keys and treasure. The combat feel tight and challenging but fair. The music is comfy to listen to as you play. A worthwhile indie game to play.			"

												I'm not much for writing reviews, but felt the need to for this one. As of this writing I'm about 1/4 to 1/3 the way through.Flat out this game has a fairly high difficulty, exactly where I like it. Battles take much strategy and fairly twitchy reflexes, as well as old-fasioned pattern-learning that made the old games so satisfying to defeat. Be careful what you spend your currency on. I made a poor first choice, then had to learn to use the chosen ability tactically in order to get by the difficult encounters which followed.Much to explore, and a whole worlds worth of lore to uncover through scenery, subtle hints, and vague yet amazing picture-based story. The soundtrack is moody, atmospheric, and context based, with layers being added and removed to suit the scene. Way to go Disasterpiece.So far this is the best [released] kickstarter game that I was involved in funding. Get it and play it, it's worth every penny.			"

												One of the best games I have played in many years. It felt like an ARPG Fez. I loved the pixel art, sound, music, gameplay, story. Everything felt so abstract and curious. I played the game in co-op with my son. We thought that would help with the difficulty level. It did in the dungeons, however, the bosses have two bars when battling them in co-op mode. For the final boss we went with single player and found him easier to defeat. There are many examples of kickstarter failures out there. But HLD delivered on all aspects. Bravo.			"

												I saw Kanye West in the credits. 10/10 IGNHonestly, when I saw this game, I thought it looked beautiful. From the start of the game to the end, even though I did get somewhat irritated at how it was difficult at points, I loved it. There is no words, no dialogue, the whole story is told through pictures and from that, it comes down to the player's interpretation of what and why things happened. It caught me off guard but it was nice to enjoy the music and not having things ruined by subpar voice acting or paragraphs of story.The music was amazing, the graphics breathtaking, the whole game as a whole was great. I just might go and pick up the soundtrack on bandcamp because FLAC. With all the great things that I have for this game, there is only one gripe that I have with the game. 1) It's short. There is no getting away from the fact that this game is broken up into 4 areas that even though there are secrets and puzzles all over the place, the casual player will just squeak by and go for the minimum. That being said, I did not get 100% on my first playthrough nor did I do any%, it was just a first playthrough without a guide. Overall, I would give the game a  7.5/10 . Is it a must buy? Not it isn't, but if it's on sale, then go and pick this game up. I would automatically recommend this to anyone that enjoys games that are slightly difficult, great story and a wonderful soundtrack.Even though I don't see myself playing this game all the time, I do think that trying to do NG+ and then doing 100% will give me quite a bit more time into this game.

												Felt like writing a review even though I don't have much playtime, I'll update this as I progress, so this is just first impressions.Overall, an incredibly vivid and pretty title with astounding pixel art and colorization that contribute to its own vibrant aesthetic, along with interesting lore and storytelling methods, accompanied by a fluid and fast-paced combat system and noteworthy game and character design. Spanning a wide variety of genres including cyberpunk, adventure, and nostalgic 8-bit/16-bit games, HLD is definitely something special. If you can look past the controversial 30 FPS lock, difficult-to-follow story, and sometimes frustrating endeavors in-game, you'll probably enjoy what this title has to offer.45 Degree Angles: The Game gets an 8.5 / 10 from me so far.

												This game is clearly one of the most visually stunning indie games on the market. However, it is very, VERY flawed. The game is riddled with glitches, most of which you'll find without even trying. Once, an enemy jumped off a cliff, and spawned an item in the ground that was innaccessible. The AI is hilariously stupid, and will often walk into a wall repeatedly or kill itself by jumping off cliffs. The collision is enough to make a grown man cry. Sometimes I'll jump to a ledge only to land on the very edge of it and fall off. What's even worse is that falling puts you back on the ledge and you're stuck in a loop until you die. Passing a checkpoint with one health and no health restores is a nightmare, as you have to pass the next few rooms without getting hit at all since dying doesn't restore your health.Overall, unless you can get this game for 10$ or less, don't buy it. A 20$ price tag isn't worth the struggle of playing it.			"

												Don't be fooled by my short played time....  I bought this game on GoG as well.Yes.  Thats right.  I bought it twice.LegendOfMetroidSouls - Legend of zelda - meets metroid/vania - meets dark souls.... what else needs to be said?Oh, thats right. Its absolutely GORGEOUS.And the storytelling? No words... but its all there, beautifully rendered in imagery... artistic interpretation and a sense of imagination is needed to get the story.But the game play is so awesome and 'simple' to pick up, that if you are the type to ignore the story, you can.Don't think for one moment though that 'simple to pick up' means easy though...Yes, the game is forgiving with save points pretty often, and you just restart at that save point when you die.  Not if.  When.  You will die... often.  Get used to it.       (disclaimer - sure, someone out there somewhere will post a no-death playthrough eventually....)Its gorgeous, it scratched the zelda itch I had been nursing for some time... and a few other itches I didn't even know I had.... buy this damn game already!

If you want a game that can visually and mechanically explain itself to you without a tutorial, this game is for you.  If you want a game that truly speaks out to the hardcore gamers who grew up on titles like Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, or Terranigma, this game is for you.I implore you to try this game, Heart Machine did a wonderful job.

												An utterly fantastic experience, and I'd say I am about a 3/4 of the way through my first run. Challenging, but really fun with the slick combat. There's even a fair amount of customizability which adds to the RPG aspect, and one of the coolest parts of the game is how the story unfolds. Nothing is handed to you or explained, you are just a vouyer to an amazing story unfolding organically right before your eyes. NPCs tell you stories through beautifully handrawn pictures. Add amazing graphics, detailed sprites, with amazing animations for enemies, bosses, mini bosses, NPCs, and of course the protagonist himself to make an epic game. A nostalgic experience that also revolutionizes what you can do with a pizelated , 2D adventure action RPG. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												One of the most aesthetically pleasing games I've ever played. Every single aspect of it, from the beautiful pixel art to the color palettes to the ambient music, contributes to the very immersive and enthralling atmosphere of the game. There's a simple joy in exploring this mysterious world, filled with anthropomorphic creatures that speak in pictures, long dead giants whose bodies have become part of the environment, and an intiguing mixture of fantasy and sci-fi elements.The story is kept vague and relies mostly on contextual clues from the surroundings, but that doesn't stop the game from having a cohesive if slightly cryptic narrative. The game encourages exploration and discovery, with many many secret rooms and items to uncover, and there's a genuine sense of accomplishment from finding little hidden pieces of the overall puzzle.As for the actual gameplay, it's challenging but fair. The combat relies a lot on good timing and reading your enemies, and you can unlock quite a few cool guns and upgrades. The dash move is especially useful, and makes the battles feel very fast paced and nerve-racking. And even though there are still some pretty difficult parts (made worse by the fact that checkpoints don't happen as often as I'd like) it never crosses the line into frustrating.All in all, a very memorable and enjoyable game!

You play the part of the guy out of Ico - or someone to that effect - who traverses a giant puzzle which masquerades as a game map. Might not have mentioned before, but the game is pretty tough. Button mashers need not apply. The game is built around uncovering paths, locked doors and finding segments of pink triangles that further open up the map.Combat is at the core of the experience. It's timing based - learning enemy patterns and when to strike. Pretty hard, but extremely rewarding.There's ZERO information on what the story is about, nor is there any tutorials. No background narrative either, outwith some beautiful pixel art postcards which lay out the story. Several hours in and I've no idea what's going on. That's the beauty of it though; your interpretation of the storyboard art is yours alone. I fancy it as some sort of post-apocalyptic alien world in which there's been a massive war to end all wars. Will not know what the story is really about until I finish it. Which wont be soon given how hard the game is.Art design, music and tough but rewarding fighting make this a real class act. Buy it and love it!			"

												Don't play this game, it will ruin all other games for you by setting a new standard.I played this blind, didn't know anything about it other then what the trailer revealed. The gameplay is fast paced but slow at the same time. You can relax and enjoy the beautiful artwork or fight the difficult, skill-based monsters. A key feature that sets this game apart from other difficult, combat-orintated games, such as Dark Souls, is that the most challenging fights last less then a minute. The final boss shouldn't take you more then 10 minutes even if you die several times. Non-stop music, even when you die, keep you in the mode.There is no obvious story presented to you. The creator, so I've heard, takes much inspiration from the idea that you should not say any more then required for story telling. Other then a few tips in the beginning of how to play the game, the plot is up to you to decifer through vauge snapshots presented by some npcs. I've seen dozens of unique interpretations and I urge you not to look into any until you beat the game yourself. I guess you could say it shows a lot about you based on what you make the plot out to be, with your given protagonist and possible antagonists and mysterious surroundings.A major disappointment, however, was the New Game+ mode. Traditionally, a NG+ involves keeping all your gear from the previous game and restarting with more difficult enemies. The achievement you get from completeing this NG+ is correctly named, as you'd have to be a masochist to play through the entire game again with only 2 health (the standard damage of a boss's single hit) and all sword and drifting upgrades.26 hours played, only took 14 to beat the game and the other 12 searching for that last gearbit I still can't find... Frustrating for my fellow completionists, this game being one I gave up on that beautiful 100% mark, but worth every penny.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent A-RPG that reminded me a lot of A Link to the Past and other games from the 90s.In terms or artistic direction, the game looks and sounds amazing, everything fits together really well and contributes to a very pleasant experience. One of the most unique characteristic of this game is that everything is told with sound and pictures rather than words. It's a very nice form of storytelling I am not used to see and I found fit well with the rest of the game. It does leave a few things up to interpretation and makes it a little difficult to place names on people, enemies and locations, but made everything very interesting. I do think this helped, along with the sound, music and visuals, keeping an impressive level of consistency in terms of atmosphere and how everything felt. Everything feels desolate but unlike a lot of games, it feels intended and not just because of a lack of content.Gameplay is simple but definitely engaging and challenging. One of my mistakes was to assume this was more of a ""Hack and Slash"" type deal, although you quickly realize that spamming attacks and not being careful about your surroundings will only get you killed.Encounters always feel very precise, where you'll fight a certain number of enemies at once and are almost always better off trying to strategically take them out in order. Boss battles are also quite challenging and usually require memorizing attack patterns, although it's definitely not impossible to succeed on a first attempt.I have to say I was a bit misled at first and I feel like some people who don't enjoy the combat as much are not playing ""correctly"" (more carefuly and patiently instead of expecting a fast-paced action game). I've seen it compared to Dark Souls and I would agree.As with most A-RPGs, upgrades can be bought for the most parts and provide new tools to fight with, which are all interesting additions to your arsenal. Other will be found as you progress through the game. The amount of ""backtracking"" needed due to an item requirement is minimal.The game is heavily focused on exploration. The map is very similar to the one in ALTTP and will never show you exactly where you are, you will have to pay attention to landmarks and go from there when looking for something specific (or simply the way to your objective).Consequently, the game is almost entirely non-linear and can be completed in any order. The world is divided in 4 zones with different themeing (which is something I appreciate a lot), similar to Termina in Majora's mask, although less ""Obvious"" and more progressive. I did notice a difference in difficulty between areas but the order in which I completed them did not make me feel like an area was either too hard or too easy.I have to say exploration is definitely this game's strong point and finding secret locations definitely feels rewarding. However I do feel like the whole aspect where everything is visual made it very difficult for me to keep track of what I had done and what I had left to do. Although I did try to go everywhere and find everything I could find, I ended up finishing the game with a lot left to do, and a lot of ""collectibles"" missing. Because I usually tend to avoid reading much about games until I'm done with them, I have no clear idea of why I should go back and look for those.Because of this, I have completed the game and am curious to collect what I'm missing but have no incentive to do so. I do enjoy roaming around but while finding secrets along the way feels rewarding, deliberately looking for them for extensive periods of time feel rather tedious. I'm left with a game I feel I have not completed, but lack motivation to go back and complete everything. I do want to and will go back at some point. Right now however, I feel like it's too big of a commitment for a reward that might be non-existant. I have played games that got even better when I decided to put the extra time in, however (such as Anodyne) and will most likely update this review once I get around to it.If you love exploring and want to dedicate a lot of time to a single game, you probably won't feel this way. Other than this, it's an excellent game and definitely worth the price.			"

												Liked it at first, Difficulty was alright, though the game didnt really get harder later on. Bossfights were quite nice.What ruined the game for me was the secrets in the game. Played through it, but now way in hell am I going to get back to every place to hug walls to death. Thats not how you make exploring fun.Going back to places to refil on healthpacks (or just die on purpose in an area because you lost too much health there) isnt fun. Just refil it when I port back to town. The map was pretty much worthless. Even though i like to not get hit over the head with story, I didnt get it and it really wasnt interesting enough for me to bother with it anyway.			"

												I hate to say this about a game I backed in the Kickstarter phase, but I'm just not really digging on Hyper Light Drifter. I mean, it's really pretty, and it had an interesting idea going with the no-words storytelling, but...it was just so obtuse, I had no idea what was or had been going on, and as a result, had no curiosity about what was going to happen, because it was bound to make equally little sense. Plus, the controls feel unnatural, and there's no way to customize them. All that combined with the challenge level of the game leads to me just getting frustrated at dying over and over again and not having any motivation to keep playing.			"

												10/10: BUY THIS GAME Gorgeous, original and captivating!I've just finished my first hour and I'm blown away. I must say I've never been so eager to write a review of a game! After finishing all the Dark Souls games I heard this was similar in gameplay, but Hyper Light Drifter is so much more.Upon starting, the amazing pixel art is immediatley shown off with a mysterious cutscene, with haunting music. When I started playing, I messed around with the controls before the tutorial (which was brief and effective) and found myself quickly getting used to the simple and satisfying controls. There is near to no text in-game, storytelling is told through pictures and enviorments, inspiring the imagination and showing off more pixel art. The combat is intense, with many ways to overcome foes, and is sleek enough to effortlessly combine melee and ranged attacks.  And best of all,  there are secrets around every corner. If you liked Dark Souls, Hyper Light Drifter is a breath of fresh air with some familiar concepts,For anyone else, it's an essential game for anyone who enjoys pixel art, adventure, mystery, sci-fi or a damn good game.

And that's a plus for this kind of game.- The story is cryptic and hidden through images and cutscenes, but once you undestand it, you will love it even more.- The atmosphere, the world and characters are very well done.- This game is totally worth it's full price.

												Here's a list of everything awesome about this game.1. the artholy god, the amount of work put into the art of this game - the big camera-panning landscapes, the player animations (even the SITTING animation looks badass), the enemy movement, the themes - is phenomonal. i've never played a more beautiful game in my life. sometimes i just stop playing and look at the art in awe of its quality. seriously.2. the combatguys. this combat system, while hella difficult, is a perfect fit for what this game was going for (after the addition of I-frames to dashing). the upgrades to your equipment and movement add even more variety to your combat strategies as you go on in the game wrecking enemies, dying, and wrecking them again until the next area. beautifully done.3. COLLECTING THINGSyou heard me right. a game that lets you go around collecting things for both a dopamine fix AND progress in the game is gaming done right. modules, gearbits, monoliths, health kits... finding things made me so happy. (COSTUMES THOUGH)this game has had me in chills since day 1 of playing it and i'll bet you it has for everyone else who has. please play this game, and complain how hard it is, only to find yourself elated when you get through that room. this is an experience we all deserve to share and have.thanks, heart machine. please make more games. we love you.

												After completing this game tonight I highly recommend it. The art style is gorgeous, the combat is tough, unforgiving but so rewarding. The story isn't blatantly obvious but I liked that you had to think and figure it out.  One of my favorite things compared to a lot of other games is how it never held your hand too much and this added to my sense of accomplishment. I couldn't imagine playing this at 30fps so full credit to the devs for spending the time to get it up to 60. Truly shows how much they care about this game.  "

												After finishing this game over two sessions of binge playing, I can comfortably say that it was worth the money and time spent.The artwork is beautiful and the atmosphere is second to none. The controls feel tight yet smooth and there is a sense of progression in terms of both items and individual player skill. Hyper Light Drifter is a somewhat difficult yet fair game, and is definitely worth the experience. I'll give it a solid 9/10, only short of a 10 due to its lack of clear narrative.			"

												Really great game. Definitely feels like it has a Souls games influence in it. Most areas you will not be able to just button mash your way through. I died a few times before realizing that you really have to pay attention, every hit matters. The checkpoints are pretty generous which is nice, but health packs are fairly scarce (depending on how well you play). I seem to play just well enough to only have about 1 healthpack in reserve usually, so in my opinion it doesn't give you too much or too little, its a good balance and it makes you want to improve. There are plenty of little hidden areas if you pay attention, which give you upgrade materials as an exploratory bonus. The level design feels tight and connected. If you like the pixel art, great music and a touch of souls inspiration I'd say get it!			"

If you end up attempting NG+ this becomes an even larger issue due to your low health. The art style and gameplay of this game is amazing. I just wish it wasnt held back by its technical issues			"

												One of the best games I have ever played.However it is not for everyone, here's why.So Hyper Light Drifter follows a charecter called ""The Drifter"" or ""The Magician"", a blue skinned guy who has a kickass sword and can dash and kills stuff! The story for the most part is hard to follow if you dont pay attention and because there is no dialogue it isn't dropped in sort of easy to pick up hints. Instead when you talk to people you are shown still images that tell a short tale. From what I can tell the story is ""You're part of a race called Blue-Skins, who did some bad♥♥♥♥♥♥and are hated. You are approached by Anubis/The Jackal who is supposed to be god, he asks your help to fight an evil called Judgement, the Jackal makes sure you do this by giving you a disease that will kill you unless you help him seek out and destroy Judgement!""Tl:dr You're a smurf who needs to help a dog god kill a big black thing, also you've got cancer.The game itself has a lot of big pro's and con's that will likely affect your decision on buying itPro-Amazing art style-Amazing music-Difficult gameplay-NG+-No dialogue-Pretty cheap price when on sale-A few difficult achievments to work towards-Makes you want more high quality gamesCon -No Dialogue-Sometimes unfair and a bit frustrating-Only one story or way to play the story-Pretty short game-Makes you want more high quality games-Capped at 30 fpsSo I put some stuff in both Pro and Con, I doubt I have to explain why but I will just in case.Stuff like no dialogue are both good and bad, depends on the point of view.Anyway my final review of this is  8/10 Gameplay  6/10 story 3/10 replayability  7/10 Overall  Like Dark souls and Zelda violently ♥♥♥♥ing behind a bar So they updated the game and changed some stuff, made it 60 fps, did some other cool♥♥♥♥♥♥I love the creators of this game with a passion			"

												Hyper Light Drifter combines Hack and Slash gameplay with a unique dashing ability and additional skills to create pretty fun fights - any boss fights are no exception to this.The visuals and soundtrack fit incredibly well, and further set the tone of the game, to a point where you don't even need dialogue or the like to follow through. You'll understand the gameplay basically by yourself (and have to, since there is only a very basic tutorial), and the story unfolds itself over time.Even if you may not be a fan of the core gameplay, another important part of the whole thing is exploration, since you have to do a lot of it to find everything there is in the game. It does get pretty tedious later on, but certainly isn't anything unfair. Most completely-out-of-sight secrets are just additional content, and not required to progress.This does require you to also be fine with backtracking, since it would be basically impossible to beat the game without returning to where you came from.Definitely recommended, alone for the atmosphere from the first few minutes of the game.

												I HAVE NOT BEATEN THIS YET, THIS IS JUST IMPRESSIONS.HLD, Hyper Light Drifter is really damn good. It's got fluid combat that's pretty damn tough, though fair. A wide varitey of enemies (some shoot bullets, some charge, some shoot arcs of bullets, some explode, etc), lots and i mean LOTS of secret and hidden areas, that are not easy but also not ""♥♥♥♥ i need a walkthrough to find this"" kinds of areas. The game is gorgeous with fairly large areas and everything is just bursting with color. The soundtrack is extremely good and if you've played Fez, it's by the same guy and has a similar aesthetic (though i will say the town hub's song is a bit too fez like, to the point of copying IMO). Also, besides a few ""press button to do this"" tutorial messages in the begining (theres like 5 like how to shoot your gun or dash) that's been it for words. Just pictures which, also, look gorgeous. So there's a lot of enviornmental and ""figure it out for yourself"" story telling. All in all, as of now, exploring one of the main areas where i havent even gotten to a dungeon yet, 9/10 and would highly recommend.			"

												I bought this game on a whim, and I don't regret it at all. Pros -Beautiful, melodramatic soundtrack. Background music fits the area it's assigned to and gives you the feeling of where you are. Boss music is epic, and perfectly crafted to make you feel as though you are fighting something truly powerful.-The detailed pixel art is stunning. Sprites for the creatures are easy to identify, and very creatively designed, especially bosses. Environments are breathtaking, and worthy of filling up your screenshots section.-Combat is fluid and fun to play with. As the Drifter, you are extremely agile, armed with your sword, your gun, and bombs(if you've unlocked them). You feel this way, as you can easily chain dahes and slashes together to swiftly cut down enemies. At times, it can feel like Dark Souls, with an emphasis on careful timing, preparation and dodging, along with saving your limited-use medkits. EDIT: Thinking it over, Hyper Light Drifter works much more like Bloodborne than Dark Souls. Medkits work like Blood Vials, you use both sword and gun, and there is no blocking.-Plenty of secrets and unlockables. Though there were gripes before that secrets were too hard to find, devs have updated the game with small symbols on the floor which tell you that a secret is nearby. Looking for these secrets becomes a sixth sense, and finding each one is valuable for your character. Sometimes it's a new outfit, sometimes it's a coin, sometimes it's a key, etc. -The story is told in a vague, and creative way. The game uses no words at all, other than tooltips. Instead, conversations with NPCs are told with storyboards, showing a sequence of events how they happened. The player makes up names to associate with things in the game, and much is left up to your creativity. However, story is there and it is definitely worth paying attention to. Cons -Difficulty. Remember the comparison to Dark Souls earlier in this review? Well, Hyper Light Drifter is, at times, as unforgiving as Dark Souls is. Many times I didn't have enough time or space to dodge attacks, and there are certain situations where I felt the devs had thrown too much at me. But, in the same vein as Dark Souls, it tries to be fair.-The story, mentioned before, is vague and confusing, which can be an issue for some people. Simply read that section in the pros and decide whether or not it's something for you.-Secrets, also mentioned before, can be extremely hard to find and can feel very grindy to try to look for them all.-You better own a controller if you want to play this game. TL;DR/Conclusion Hyper Light Drifter is a beautiful game, in both soundtrack, visuals, and underlying story. Combat is swift, fluid and fun(if you have a controller), though at times unforgiving. The dungeons, enemies, environments, and bosses are colorful and creative. The story is emotional, however you have to look for it.

												Only a few hours in,  so I haven't had the time to go in depth with the gameplay and the story. I have always been a fan of this type of art style and Hyperlight does it amazingly. The opening to the game is one of the most visually and musically stunning things I've ever seen from a game. The gameplay is extemely fun and challenging. The game recommends using a controller, and it definately helps with the fast passed gameplay. The enemies are numerous and varied, and most of them require different strategies to defeat.  The combat is very challenging, but it is tight and fluid, so once you learn it, it is very enjoyable. Because there isn't any dialogue, it took me a little while to figure out what I had to do, but after some snooping around, it is pretty straightforward.			"

												This game is honestly one of the best I have ever played. The art is beautiful, the combat is challenging, and the story is hooking and fluent. It also has a nice bit of a Zelda vibe with all of the little hidden areas and secret loot. 10/10 would reccomend.			"

												This is my favourite game.I've played better, I've played worse, both in story as well as game mechanics.I love this game for the music and the visuals, as well as the entertaining and punishing gameplay.I tried to write a long review, but as I did, I found that I didn't really know why this game is my favourite. How I would describe this game :Beautifully mysterious and melancholy.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a brilliant action rpg. As well as one of the most difficult games to come out this year. If you're a Zelda fan, souls fan, or retro game fan. I highly recommend this. You can see my video review below

												THIS GAME IS JUST SO ♥♥♥♥ING BEAUTIFULIt is just exactly what I expected when I bought it. It's a beautiful game with amazing atmosphere. The design is so nice, the colours, the landscapes, the dungeons, the music... Just everything about the world, it is so nicely put together.Mechanics are hard at the beginning but there's a point you reach where everything gets very intuitive and is just so enjoyable. I am not a skilled gamer, I struggle most of the times, and this game IS NOT too difficult as I have been reading in a lot of places. It is a difficult and challenging game, and at some points frustrating because you'll get stuck in a place for quite some time, but it is not too difficult to enjoy. It just makes it more addictive.I still have to explore some areas I missed and I am so looking forward to the co-op to play it through with someone else and enjoy again how freaking pretty this game is <3 I could just stare at it all day, it stole my heart since the first trailer.10/10 would cry again			"

												A very good action adventure game with lots and lots of exploration and secrets that stays difficult the entire way trough.The art style is actually very pretty instead of being pixel art as an excuse not to have better graphics because its ""retro""At least with a ps4 controller the game handles very well and the combat is very fluid and rewards skill. Your guns charge their ammo as you hit things with your sword so the gameplay stays a good balance between shooting things and hitting things. You're never given more (maximum) HP or ways to take or deal more damage, with very few expections everything deals 1 or 2 damage, including your weapons.The game rewards keen eye and exploration with things hidden in places you need some creative use of the dashing ability to reach or behind walls with some minor hints near them.The story is told without any dialoque and doesn't get in your face constantly to distract you from the gameplay.In the end this is probably one of the best games in this style I've played, highly recommend.

												Highly recommend this game.First thing you notice: It's Beautiful!The areas design are really good as the gameplay is. The game is hard, and asks focus and persistence from you. However, you will learn from mistakes, and the game doesn't penalize you much from failing.Also, the game doesn't tell you much about your objectives. The own design leads you to the objectives.Furthermore, the game rewards exploration. There are plenty os secrets and some nice collectibles.An honest thank you for the developers. "

												I bought this game on a whim, and I don't regret it at all. Pros -Beautiful, melodramatic soundtrack. Background music fits the area it's assigned to and gives you the feeling of where you are. Boss music is epic, and perfectly crafted to make you feel as though you are fighting something truly powerful.-The detailed pixel art is stunning. Sprites for the creatures are easy to identify, and very creatively designed, especially bosses. Environments are breathtaking, and worthy of filling up your screenshots section.-Combat is fluid and fun to play with. As the Drifter, you are extremely agile, armed with your sword, your gun, and bombs(if you've unlocked them). You feel this way, as you can easily chain dahes and slashes together to swiftly cut down enemies. At times, it can feel like Dark Souls, with an emphasis on careful timing, preparation and dodging, along with saving your limited-use medkits. EDIT: Thinking it over, Hyper Light Drifter works much more like Bloodborne than Dark Souls. Medkits work like Blood Vials, you use both sword and gun, and there is no blocking.-Plenty of secrets and unlockables. Though there were gripes before that secrets were too hard to find, devs have updated the game with small symbols on the floor which tell you that a secret is nearby. Looking for these secrets becomes a sixth sense, and finding each one is valuable for your character. Sometimes it's a new outfit, sometimes it's a coin, sometimes it's a key, etc. -The story is told in a vague, and creative way. The game uses no words at all, other than tooltips. Instead, conversations with NPCs are told with storyboards, showing a sequence of events how they happened. The player makes up names to associate with things in the game, and much is left up to your creativity. However, story is there and it is definitely worth paying attention to. Cons -Difficulty. Remember the comparison to Dark Souls earlier in this review? Well, Hyper Light Drifter is, at times, as unforgiving as Dark Souls is. Many times I didn't have enough time or space to dodge attacks, and there are certain situations where I felt the devs had thrown too much at me. But, in the same vein as Dark Souls, it tries to be fair.-The story, mentioned before, is vague and confusing, which can be an issue for some people. Simply read that section in the pros and decide whether or not it's something for you.-Secrets, also mentioned before, can be extremely hard to find and can feel very grindy to try to look for them all.-You better own a controller if you want to play this game. TL;DR/Conclusion Hyper Light Drifter is a beautiful game, in both soundtrack, visuals, and underlying story. Combat is swift, fluid and fun(if you have a controller), though at times unforgiving. The dungeons, enemies, environments, and bosses are colorful and creative. The story is emotional, however you have to look for it. A game that takes aspects from the Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls, perfectly mixing them together. The best indie game that I've ever played, and truly a masterpiece.9/10, will definitely go through New Game+.			"

												This is a marvelous game. Scenery is beautiful and exploration is rewarding. Combat makes you feel such a badass, while keeping controls simple (but I really, really recommend to get a controller).Some people say it is hard, but it is hard just enough so you cannot get by just mashing at buttons randomly.P.S. I would say that 'library' text is too hard to decipher (it's non-mandatory) - thanks to the guy that wrote guide with deciphered text			"

												So far, I'm one boss down and practising on my second. Yes, the bosses can be a bit tough and in a less fair way it seems than bosses in Dark Souls. But if you've got patience from playing FromSoft's games (and their ilk), you'll easily have the skills to beat this game.The best bit about it is the atmosphere and exploration. The visuals are lush and gorgeous and really help to draw you into the world Heart Machine have created. The music by Disasterpeace is very similar to Fez's soundtrack, but still lush and entrancing. There aren't many instructions (something I really appreciate) and you're left to your own devices (which I appreciate as well). I'm probably 1/3 of the way through in about 6-7 hours of playtime, but I'm sure it'll take me much longer to find all of the secrets, etc.TL;DR If you think a top-down quasi-Souls-like atmospheric action adventure and exploration game is your cup of tea - go for it! You won't be disappointed :)			"

Product received for free
												Followed this game during the steam sale. Loved the artstyle but I had no idea what the game was about.Had my good friend Radimir gift me it later and I went to try it out.I was very confused at first and felt lost, but now that I've played through the game and ng+ I feel like I understand it now.The pixel art is beautiful and all of the areas really feel unique and colorful.The music was great and made me feel even more connected to the game.The combat was very confusing at first, but once I upgraded and figured out stuff on my own I felt like I was really being tested skill wise on how to deal with fights. The blend of dashing, slicing and shooting ends up feeling so natural and smooth.Tried the local coop briefly and thought I didn't buy the game with it in mind, I could definitely see people digging this as a coop game.I played most of the game using an xbox gamepad, but I have tried out keyboard+mouse. I don't particularly feel like one is stronger than the other in total. But I did have trouble aiming with the gamepad, but I think that's just my fault.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This review was published as of my first hour of gameplay.This game is legendary. I have never in my life, AAA games included ever been so absolutley stunned by the graphics of a game. This is one of if not the most atmospheric game I have ever played, the soundtrack, SFX and visuals come together to make one of the most perfectly beautiful things i have ever seen. Even if the gameplay was terrible i'd recommend this game just for the experience. However, i don't have to recommend it on the presentation alone because the gameplay is FANTASTIC. The three combat mechanics I've seen so far are all wonderful, and blend together perfectly. As of right now i have a gun, a sword, and a dash. The gun is filled via successful hits on enemies/breaking random containers in the world, which makes it fit well in combat as it gives you a powerful and satisfying ranged option whilst never invalidating the sword. The dash flows well in both explorative gameplay and combat, and is exactly the kind of ability that fits the weapons you're given in this game. This game is also difficult, with healing items seeming uncommon and enemies dealing large portions of your health in a single hit. This being said, the game never feels impossible or unfair. This will be, no doubt, my Indie GOTY 2016. I only have two issues with it so far, and both are very minor. The first issue is that you can easily click outside the fullscreen window, and because i have a second monitor i end up going too far right with my mouse sometimes, causing the game to tab out. However, after an hour of gameplay i've taught myself to just not do that and it's almost a nonissue at this point. [[THIS WAS PATCHED DAY 1]The second issue i have with this game is that the death/respawing animation seems to drag on, and (possibly because i'm trash) i die a lot in this game, and sitting there waiting really breaks this game's wonderful combat flow.] However, these two small issues overall don't detract from the gaming magnum opus that is: Hyper Light Drifter. TL;DR versionGame is really pretty, the combat flows like a river, and issues are minimal.9/10			"

If the game interests you, wait for a deep sale or the inevitable indie bundle.			"

												Absolutely superb. What a wonderful, beautiful game.It looks incredible, it controls wonderfully. There's a lot of fast, hectic combat but it never feels like a chore to play. When you die, you feel like it's your fault and not the game's, and it spurs you to try harder and get better and style on that god damn boss. There's a rich, incredibly atmospheric land to explore, there's secrets and little bits of storytelling in every nook and cranny. There's a haunting, cryptic narrative to uncover. It's been a while since a game clicked this well with me, everything just worked and to top it off the game doesn't overstay its welcome. Wonderful stuff, well worth the wait as a kickstarter pledger.			"

												After about 50 hours I think its time to review this game. This is my favorite game of 2016. It has no ambitious story, no hidden meaning, no crazy twist ending. Its a video game. This game does not ""extend the medium"" or ""Deliver a new layer of immersion"" its just a damn good game, and its been a while since I have played one of those. The combat is fast and fluid, like Bloodborne it feels more like a dance than combat. The firearms and powers blend seamlessly with the rest of the sword slashes and dashing. The bosses are a cut above amazing. They are challenging but always fair (except the Northern boss on NG+). They all have diverse designs and just as diverse ways of fighting. The story is loose and mostly absent, but I felt this ominous feeling that something horrible had happened and it really created an atmosphere that I have never experienced in any other game. I don't like to give number ratings for things, I tend to recommend something on a should you or should you not play. But I think that I would be comfortable giving this game a 10/10 if I were asked to rate it on a scale. I have problems with it (the northern boss on NG+) but none of them would keep me from even considering to tell you not to buy this game. "

												Hyper Light Drifter, in a lot of ways is simply a action-platformer.Although many say it’s a indie Darksouls game, it more in-line with Devil May Cry or Bastion type game, as there is no punishment for dying. The game's combat and special moves resemble Devil May Cry with gun-sword combat, deflecting projectiles, perfect-timed swings and platforming, the game also borrows a lot from Bastion’s top down game mechanics.The pacing and level design of the game resemble more closely to a Zelda type game, with freedom to go to three available directions; East, North and West. In my playthrough I started with the North. At the North I learn hints of the backstory and lore through its environments and pictograms-dialog from engaging with the NPC. Talking about environments, there are secrets, hidden switches and hidden rooms everywhere, I once also found a hidden switch that lead to a hidden room with more hidden rooms. Which leads me to say “Way too much wall hugging” thankfully there are community guides if you so wish to use them.In conclusion, Hyper Light Drifter is blend of multiple great games, but does not simply just copy, but make it their own unique design and style. A great recommendation for all!			"

												What an amazing game. You're thrust into the world with minimal information and only a vague idea of your goal and how to get there. No hand holding, no in-depth exposition, just a mysterious 3 minute opening cutscene and that's it. For the most part there's no decipherable text or speech anywhere at any point, as the game relies on subtle auditory, musical, and visual cues to tell its story. And in case you couldn't tell from the trailers, it's stunningly beautiful throughout. The world has been put together with such care and detail that at times I was fighting my enemies just so I could more easily appreciate the settings. There's also small details that make the game seem that much more fully fleshed out; for instance, after a small period of inactivity your character will sit down on the ground. As alluded to before there's a completely unique alphabet in the game that can and has been decrypted.But yes, this game is HARD. I'll admit I'm not the most skilled at games. I tend to play games on easy-medium difficulty settings just so I can keep up. But even I can tell this game is very difficult, and there is no adjustment for the difficulty. Enemies move nearly as quickly as you do and often times deal more damage than you do, and health kits are usually either in short supply or very well hidden. The bosses are even faster and can often kill you if you're not careful in a matter of seconds. It's a difficult game to get right, but when you finally manage to nail down a room full of enemies or one of the bosses, it's super satisfying, and you feel like some kind of video gaming wizard.My only complaints were with the weapon upgrade system, which consists solely of being able to carry more ammo, as well as the in-game map, which only shows you very generally where you are and can be difficult to read at times.Overall I absolutely loved this game, despite dying constantly. The setting is the best example of modern pixel art I can think of, the story is engaging and mysterious at the same time, and the gameplay is satisfying.			"

Im glad I finally bought it.Pros: Breathtaking pixel art, a large variety of color are used, and the sheer amount of detail put into the world is amazingGreat combat. at fisrt it can be a bit difficult to grasp -even intimidating, but with time youll be zipping across the battleground hacking and slashing enemiies to pieces like a true drifter.Guns provide another intricate part of fighting, allowing you to attack from afar when things get too ugly to get close. As you prgress you get a variety of weapons to choose from and upgrade as well.collectables. When youre not zooming around fighting enemies, there are numerous items hidden aroud the world giving you acces to new outfits, each providing you with a different perk. Gear bits which are dotted accross the world allow you to upgrade not only your characyer butyour arsenal as well. Difficult but forgivnig. While this gamme is very difficult (trust me you will die playing this game) it is still forgiving providing little to no set backs upon death.Cons Chain dashing. chain dashing is one of the key essential upgrades youll want for your character, allowing them to zip around without break. While this can be very helpful in both fights and travel, I always had trouble chain dashing when I really needed to. While I did enjoy using it (boy did it come in handy for several parts) I found myself frustrated with it.This is definitley one of the best games ive played in a while, and would hiughly recomend it if you like both darksouls or the legend of zelda.

Well, this is the game you've been waiting for.If you don't like to die a lot, or doing the same things over and over again, this game is not for you.			"

												Hotline Miami meets Zelda meets Out of This World. This game is beautiful. It's art direction, pixel graphics, music and storytelling are all top notch. NPCs relay stories through pictures, gorgeous pictures. Basically, ""Some bad stuff went down in our Animal Crossing Village, and lots of people are dead."" You have to head in one of four directions to find out what is going on. There are a few minor bugs so far, but nothing distracting from the awesomeness. The only downside is the controls are definitely geared toward controller play (This is mentioned in the opening screens). Without the controller I get frantic and my mouse flies all over the place, which is bad since dash, slash and shoot go toward the mouse pointer, not the direction you are moving/facing. It's sooo sweet I will probably buy a controller just to enjoy it more. Just like a good adventure game, there are hidden rooms all over and lots of secrets to find, not that I have any idea what they mean.			"

												This game is already shaping up to be my favorite indie game of 2016. Here's why:In the game you play as a warrior looking to cure his heart disease. Something the creator of the game is struggling with himself by the way. Other than that, the story tells you very little, but shows pictures of an apocalypse, brought upon by giant machines.The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a violent and dystopian one, which is offset by areas of peace and liveliness. Everything is brought to life by the neon-inspired graphics and animations that have you gawking at the most beautiful pixel art you've ever seen. The music accentuates the tone of the world with an eerie and unsettling soundtrack that is heavy on the synthesizers. Accompanying swoosh and swing sound effects hit the notes just right.The game itself is challenging, unexplanatory and sometimes frustrating, yet so good. The fighting is brutal, though you only have yourself to blame in case you fail as the controls are lock-tight. The level designers deserve special praise as this one goes back to the old days where you have secret crooks and crannies rewarding you with hidden treasures to find. Meaning it's a game you can easily revisit to discover hidden areas and rewards.tl:dr You simply must play this rare gem of a game.			"

												I wrote a more lengthy review/overview here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/257850/discussions/0/365163686046444209/But I'll just give the TL;DR for the review:This game is gorgeous, it's extremely difficult in the best way, and it's a startlingly refreshing take on a Zelda-esque top down adventure game. That said, while the story feels like it's something epic, it's hindered by some poor gameplay decisions (namely, the map) and extremely ambiguous story-telling that left me wondering, when I finished it, ""What the hell just happened?""Still, it's worth every penny and is an exceptional game in its own right. Anyone interested in a Zelda-esque (though I hate to use that term, because while there are some similarities between the two it also differs quite a bit) should buy this game immediately, and learn to hate themselves all over again.

												A great and difficult game with compelling gameplay. I like the bright artstyle that the game has compared to its dark and gritty story. Speaking of the story, it is very interpretive and up to your own mind to decide how the story works since the game has no dialougoue, which make it even more ominous. However, the shotgun is too useful once you get it (it was the first gun I unlocked after the default).			"

												UPDATED ONE MO GAIN: Have I mentioned that this is my game of 2016? Not DOOM, not Owlboy, not Stardew Valley. HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER.UPDATED, ORIGINAL POST IS BELOW THIS ONE:So, after the latest update which adds a fluid 60 FPS and the Boss Rush mode, I have to say, my opinion of this game has only gotten higher, and I didn't know I could feel that way about this gem.Before, I loved the combat, but now that the FPS can be 60, OH MY GOD. The combat is so fluid and satisfactory, my mind is blown. It was a visceral joy before, but now it's pure delight.And THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE BOSS RUSH MODE. I always hate it when a game has terrific boss fights that you can only experience once. But now, with this addition, I can slay them all as much as I want. I'm so happy with this latest update.Also, as a side note, the guy who made the soundtrack for this game, Disasterpeace? He's a REALLY nice guy, and if you enjoy the music for this game, I recommend you get it directly from him at his Bandcamp page because 1. You can get it in FLAC and 2. You can get a copy of the original sheet music for the games title music, Panacea.----What a fantastic game. Seriously. The imagery and music in this game are spellbinding. I feel taken away when I play this game. I fully intend to purchase the soundtrack.The lore and feeling of this game go above and beyond to give you a world with so little. Some of the best pixelated animation in any modern day game.The controls are tight and the learning curve is totally fair. I love the character designs, I love the color scheme of everything.And no♥♥♥♥♥♥ I, for the first time since my days in high school... Feel like writing some fan fiction.10/10 would daydream again about the life of the Hyper Light Drifter.#Sequelplz			"

												What I liked:+ colorful artstyle+ it's a visual game: it's simple and not confusing for me+ music (absolutely majestic)+ a vague but interesting story open to interpretation+ a linear but at the same time open world+ creative combat mechanics that are ""easy to learn, but hard to master""+ customizability; it's limited but that is not the main point of the game. The main character's design is already cool!+ side quests-- which I really like in games!What I disliked:- The price: doesn't manage to hit the marker considering it's a shorter game; I recommend you get HLD on sale though!- It's nice that the game doesn't have an obtrusive HUD/GUI, but sometimes you can get lost because there aren't clear pointers; this definitely isn't the game for people that like being told what to do.-Not knowing how or where to get the ""key"" things?- That cheaty little bugger in the soccer game! RRRRGHH, he likes to trip me.Overall, it is a short and sweet game with an interesting story, cute characters and certain replayability. I'm hoping for a Alt-Drifter DLC in the future, but until then I'll try to get as many achievements and secrets in the game as I can. Good job, Heart Machine!			"

												The best RPG I've played in a long time. The art is beautiful. The combat is challenging and tense. The world is mysterious and intriguing.The only flaws are that the game doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do at the start (you're left to explore and figure it out), which can be a little confusing, and the controls are clunky with keyboard+mouse, you pretty much need a gamepad.

												Music: Awesome. Matches the world perfectly.Gameplay: Awesome. Combat has nice flow and is the right ammount of difficult (not very hard actually).Graphics: Awesome. Great use of colours and lights/shaders.Story: Now, here's the thing. I'm going to say ""Awesome"" but this is very subjective. There's many places where you can look at the environment and relate it with other places & imagery to understand what happened in this world, AKA environmental storytelling, but there's no thing such as story being told to your face, with letters. Actually, there is some ""text"" with ""story"", but it's hard to find & interpret (others have done it all already though), and that's about it.Just a little summary of its story, you know. In case you are the ""tell it to my face"" kind.Bonus:Controls: I'm usually a KB+M fan but for this one I recommend playing with a controller.Mouse pros: Aim in any direction easily on-the-fly with your mouse.Mouse cons: You dash towards the mouse. Hard to dash backwards. Can be fixed by switching dash direction to match your movement direction (WASD) but that limits it to 8 directions.Controller pros: Really easy to dash in any direction (not limited to 8).Controller cons: Hard to aim on-the-fly. There is a dedicated button for aiming without moving but you are then (obviously) forced to stand still as it uses the movement stick. In my case I didn't really need to be precise while aiming (in combat), but rather dashing.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a breath taking game with strategic hack and slash and a progression style similar to older Legend of Zelda games. I've glanced at other peoples reviews, and in general what they say still holds up:-The gameplay itself is challenging, and if you learn to efficiently dispatch your foes you'll fine there'll be an abundance of health packs.-Secrets, secrets everywhere. Sniff the walls all day long but honestly I found that to be enjoyable - finding new areas, extra items and tid bits was something I've always liked to do in games anyway (although this game has certainly outdone itself in number of hidden stuff behind seemingly impassible walls - even the secrets have secrets. No, really-).-Aside from the Monument text that you have to decode (Purely extra stuff - just reveals more about the story, even if the translations themselves are vague) and the text in the game telling you what button does what everything is told to you via pictures and images. Even important story details and objectives. No seriously - I didn't fully realize what that map was in the Guardian Drifters house until I started pulling up the things in the East area, and by then I'd missed two of the gem things needed to open the Boss door. I got frustrated, wasn't sure how to read the map and didn't want to back track (the thing I loathe the most in games) so I looked up someone doing a run through of the East area to see what I missed. It was only then and after I connected the symbols the Guardian had showed me on the map did I realize what I needed to find and why. After that I was fine but it was still very unclear to me at first and disconnected me a bit from the game world itself. I guess it was also a little disapointing to find out that getting four of those gem triangle things instead of three (the min you need for the Boss of each region) didn't really give you anything new except for a quick rehash of the opening and illness induced nightmares. I don't BELIEVE getting four in each region did anything to affect my end of the game stuff (it certainly didn't seem like it) but there's no real benefit from getting four of them, so any hopes of extra cutscenes, pictures, or interactions that told you something more (or at least something more obvious) were trashed. Bummer.-Despite that previous combo paragraph, the scenary always drew you back into the mysticality of the enviornment, as long as you were focused on the game and not preoccupied with anything else (stressed? not invested? Hard to take in the story).And to continue off of that note despite me, personally, still liking the game comes one thing that disapointed me more then anything else - lack of concrete... I don't know the word for it but it needs more key points story wise. Letting you know right now if you don't like/care about stories in games this one is still great - gameplays fantastic bosses are fun to fight. Story is still great regardless.. but..It's super vague. I mean, so vague to the point where you gotta start making stuff up for even important plot points like the titans in the opening cutscene and the Drifter themselves. Other then what you see blatantly on the screen (and what you can translate outside the game from the Monuments) everything else is a theory. The Dog? Anything you can guess about it or it's origin - theory. Titans? Even calling it a Titan is a theory - could have been Giants, or some other species created by someone else - or not. The game is very open ended in it's ENTIRE story (they give you pieces and you basically build it) and despite it's visual approach the Drifter doesn't react to any of it. You really only get bits of the Drifters personality from how they're animated. Other then that and the cutscenes his personality is very interpretive and... I dunno about you but with games like this I'd like a few more story keys or personal ties from character interactions to draw me into the world a bit more. After that intense opening cutscene, I was kinda sad to find there wasn't much more then that (even the ending one was lacking but at that point I was taking what I could get).Grant it I haven't found every secret in the game YET but I've been looking around and if you've been in the fandom business for atleast a cycle or two you'd know spoilers are usually one of the first things you see when you're indulging in  lore and fanart and I have yet to be spoiled by anything I might have missed. Haven't heard a lick about it so I just assume it doesn't exist until I find it.If you wanted a story told TO you this games really bad at that. You really gotta put pieces together to form any sort of picture about the world in your mind and by doing that you get drawn into the world as the Drifter. For all we know they know about as little as you do, so your curiosity, your lack of information is their lack of information.If you wanted to dive yourself into a world and examine the pieces this games good at that.To get out of the story perspective, though...Gameplay? Amazing. Not too challenging and fun to engage in.Visuals? Astounding. There will definitely be sections you'd want to screen cap or stare at for a few minutes at a time - sometimes longer.Music? Atmospheric - most of it is relaxing or dreadful (boss fights). It's very unique to the game itself.Story? I still like it but... it's frustrating to me all the same. I wish there was more key points told to you, more definites, more to work off of besides all these loose puzzle pieces that don't easily match up - but the Monuments are the same way, only more obvious..Maybe the whole stories there like how we can translate the Monuments, I have no idea. Probably. The pictures are puzzle pieces in this race to see what the definite story is - but then they'd all still be theories. I could run this in a rat race all day, but really this game is great. Regardless of whether or not it's on sale I'd recommend it. If you're still unsure, wait until it's on sale. Still a great game, still a good story even if I think it's a bit too open ended; I still liked it.And yeah I realize this is just me kinda being disappointed with lack of concrete story points but I figured I'd add my two cents in where no one else seems to be poking at it. Or at least not as prominently. I might edit this later when I replay it.			"

												This game is simply wonderful. I'm a sucker for pixel-art, and this game delivers with a diverse colour palette, snappy animation, and downright beautiful world design.The combat really drives the experience; it's difficult without feeling unfair, but it can be punishing of mistakes -- it's similar to a Dark Souls title in that regard, specifically Bloodborne for the fast-paced, dash-heavy combat.It's also similar to a Soulsborne title in that the story isn't just laid out in front of you -- there's never a moment where the game takes you by the hand and says ""Okay son, here's the story."" I love devs that are brave enough to let their worlds and their stories stand on their own without worrying that someone might not ""get"" what's going on; I much prefer to have a mysterious story that I might not catch all of, revealed to me in snippets or by clues in the environments themselves.In short, you should buy this game. It's great.			"

												This is a damn good game. While you can sometimes be confused as to where to go, it is thrilling to explore around. Fights are tough, and boss fights will definitely frustrate you, but it the feeling of reaward when you finally get that last hit in on a boss that has killed you time and time again is worth it.The game recommends you play with a controller, however I have gotten through two areas so far and been just fine with a keyboard and mouse. It takes a lil getting used to the controls, yeah, but once you got it down you shouldn't have too much of a problem.Disasterpeace has done absolutely amazing work on the soundtrack, and I really love how different parts of the songs come in when you discover new stuff.Even if you dislike pixel games, I definitely recommend playing this one. It is an experience and well worth your time ;)			"

												I'm glad, I blindly backed every Kickstarter project I thought looked cool a few years ago when I had some money left over and then totally forgot about it afterwards. Hyper Light Drifter is such a game and boy, was the surprise nice, when I suddenly received this Steam key out of the seeming blue.Hyper Light Drifter is a wonderful experience that combines calm exploration with beautiful visuals and a soothing soundtrack with punishingly hard fights. It's never too hard, however; the game just lets you progress naturally, in a Dark Souls-esque way. (I've never played much of any Dark Souls title, sadly, but after this game, I strongly want to, again.)The game rewards curiosity and persistence just as much as it punishes greed and rush, you want to carefully explore the world to not die and lose your progress since the last save. The game isn't perfect tho; while hard, sometimes the checkpoints are mostly set between map transitions, sometimes in such a way that you can easily exploit their placement. Especially when you don't want to repeat the arbitrary collecting action after eery respawn, you just collect after respawning, leave the area, enter again and then you don't have to do so again - that feels a bit counter intuitive to me.Otherweise I can't think of many other negative aspects in HLD. A few things, that positively stuck out, in my opinion, were the almost total lack of text in the game. Except for the HUD and very brief control explanations, all written and spoken language is abandoned, so the game focuses on visual storytelling instead. Also, Disasterpiece did a great job at the music composition once again and its implementation is superb. The music and sound design do their part on the non verbal storytelling and it shows.I don't have much more to say right now, except that this game deserves more attention. I am sure more people would (and hopefully will) enjoy this masterpiece but I kind of expect it to become an insider tip.Highly recommended.			"

You really gotta put pieces together to form any sort of picture about the world in your mind and by doing that you get drawn into the world as the Drifter. For all we know they know about as little as you do, so your curiosity, your lack of information is their lack of information.If you wanted to dive yourself into a world and examine the pieces this games good at that.To get out of the story perspective, though...Gameplay? Amazing. Not too challenging and fun to engage in.Visuals? Astounding. There will definitely be sections you'd want to screen cap or stare at for a few minutes at a time - sometimes longer.Music? Atmospheric - most of it is relaxing or dreadful (boss fights). It's very unique to the game itself.Story? I still like it but... it's frustrating to me all the same. I wish there was more key points told to you, more definites, more to work off of besides all these loose puzzle pieces that don't easily match up - but the Monuments are the same way, only more obvious..Maybe the whole stories there like how we can translate the Monuments, I have no idea. Probably. The pictures are puzzle pieces in this race to see what the definite story is - but then they'd all still be theories. I could run this in a rat race all day, but really this game is great. Regardless of whether or not it's on sale I'd recommend it. If you're still unsure, wait until it's on sale. Still a great game, still a good story even if I think it's a bit too open ended; I still liked it.And yeah I realize this is just me kinda being disappointed with lack of concrete story points but I figured I'd add my two cents in where no one else seems to be poking at it. Or at least not as prominently. I might edit this later when I replay it.			"

												A game that definitely surprised me. Mainly taking influence from Zelda (along with its own new ideas to make it stand out) and some influence from Dark Souls.Its core combat is similar to Zelda but is more about timing like in dark souls (getting hit does tons of damage too) with a fast paced hack n slash feel to it. The combat is a blast and quite challenging. Its a hard game but you will begin to understand its rythms and the tutorial is good. Exploring the dungeons are great as the level design is phenomenal with many secrets hidden within them. Exploration in HLD is just amazing hands down. Each area has a unique look n feel and unique enemies to them. The game gives you a hub area and you are free to explore any of the four zones whenever you want. The hub itself also have shops with upgrades, mini games to play and secrets of its own. Really like how the game throws you into the world and expects you to find your own way. The music is great and very moody. Really atmospheric stuff. The visuals and animations are top notch for a 2D game, especially one made in game maker. Its also been polished over time and now can run at stable 60 FPS. However it can still use some more polish in other areas.I dont have many complaints but if I were to nitpick the coop is unfortunately non existent. Fantastic game: 9/10Cant wait for a sequel!			"

												I completely agree with all the positive things that are being said about the game, but there's one thing that I haven't seen people discuss: Post-release updates. Hyper Light Drifter has been recieving constant patches, bug fixes, and even free additions into the game. Not only did they add support for 60 FPS, they made it possible to switch between it and 30. It's little additions like this that make Heart Machine such and excellent company. They even added an easy mode for people who wanted it. This is, in my opinion, the model of a good Indie team. Post game patches that improve an already masterful game, and making sure everyone can enjoy it without ruining what they already had. Buy this game, if only to support the people who created it.

												I wrote a more lengthy review/overview here:http://steamcommunity.com/app/257850/discussions/0/365163686046444209/But I'll just give the TL;DR for the review:This game is gorgeous, it's extremely difficult in the best way, and it's a startlingly refreshing take on a Zelda-esque top down adventure game. That said, while the story feels like it's something epic, it's hindered by some poor gameplay decisions (namely, the map) and extremely ambiguous story-telling that left me wondering, when I finished it, ""What the hell just happened?""Still, it's worth every penny and is an exceptional game in its own right. Anyone interested in a Zelda-esque (though I hate to use that term, because while there are some similarities between the two it also differs quite a bit) should buy this game immediately, and learn to hate themselves all over again.

												Expect a fantastic twelve hour Zelda inspired adventure. The controls are great, and so are the boss battles. The only flaw is that a lot of the unessential secrets in the game are too well hidden. You can easily get through the main game, but if you want the whole story you have to hunt down a massive list of hidden items.			"

												The best RPG I've played in a long time. The art is beautiful. The combat is challenging and tense. The world is mysterious and intriguing.The only flaws are that the game doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do at the start (you're left to explore and figure it out), which can be a little confusing, and the controls are clunky with keyboard+mouse, you pretty much need a gamepad.

												Lots of fun. Felt like taking a classic 16bit adventure and upping the graphics and responsiveness for a more enjoyable experience. I'm reccommending the game and think it's a magificent work of art. Beat it before all the difficulty nerfs, but i'm a little dissappointed by the ending. It was an amazing story, but I feel it was the reason why I never watched Lost. Like when i heard the premise of ""Lost"" i though oh, yea that sounds like it'll be a really good hook, but the ending will never be able to deliver on what it's building up so one of two things will happen either the story will end and all your questions will be answered in a dissapointing way or they won't be and you'll be dissappointed even more. HLD feels like it took a middle ground and left you the player to fill in most but not all the gaps. Still great game, and i'd reccommend it .			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a cybernetic ninja roaming the ruins of a once great society. He has a bad case of the blood coughies and he frequently hallucinates/remembers a cyber genie killing him. A deified dog appears to be watching his every move and dead titan carcasses are everywhere. What's a poor drifter to do but uncover every secret and murder every hostile in his path?The designer pretty clearly had a singular vision for this game that really coheres together all aspects into a superb video game. Between all the secret areas, combat scenarios, enemy types, upgrades, unique boss fights, interleaved level design, tight controls, there's also all the gorgeous pixel art and ambient sound design. Compares well to Cave Story, Dark Souls, and Fez.			"

Posted: May 2, 2016
												Hyper Light Drifter is a breath taking game with strategic hack and slash and a progression style similar to older Legend of Zelda games. I've glanced at other peoples reviews, and in general what they say still holds up:-The gameplay itself is challenging, and if you learn to efficiently dispatch your foes you'll fine there'll be an abundance of health packs.-Secrets, secrets everywhere. Sniff the walls all day long but honestly I found that to be enjoyable - finding new areas, extra items and tid bits was something I've always liked to do in games anyway (although this game has certainly outdone itself in number of hidden stuff behind seemingly impassible walls - even the secrets have secrets. No, really-).-Aside from the Monument text that you have to decode (Purely extra stuff - just reveals more about the story, even if the translations themselves are vague) and the text in the game telling you what button does what everything is told to you via pictures and images. Even important story details and objectives. No seriously - I didn't fully realize what that map was in the Guardian Drifters house until I started pulling up the things in the East area, and by then I'd missed two of the gem things needed to open the Boss door. I got frustrated, wasn't sure how to read the map and didn't want to back track (the thing I loathe the most in games) so I looked up someone doing a run through of the East area to see what I missed. It was only then and after I connected the symbols the Guardian had showed me on the map did I realize what I needed to find and why. After that I was fine but it was still very unclear to me at first and disconnected me a bit from the game world itself. I guess it was also a little disapointing to find out that getting four of those gem triangle things instead of three (the min you need for the Boss of each region) didn't really give you anything new except for a quick rehash of the opening and illness induced nightmares. I don't BELIEVE getting four in each region did anything to affect my end of the game stuff (it certainly didn't seem like it) but there's no real benefit from getting four of them, so any hopes of extra cutscenes, pictures, or interactions that told you something more (or at least something more obvious) were trashed. Bummer.-Despite that previous combo paragraph, the scenary always drew you back into the mysticality of the enviornment, as long as you were focused on the game and not preoccupied with anything else (stressed? not invested? Hard to take in the story).And to continue off of that note despite me, personally, still liking the game comes one thing that disapointed me more then anything else - lack of concrete... I don't know the word for it but it needs more key points story wise. Letting you know right now if you don't like/care about stories in games this one is still great - gameplays fantastic bosses are fun to fight. Story is still great regardless.. but..It's super vague. I mean, so vague to the point where you gotta start making stuff up for even important plot points like the titans in the opening cutscene and the Drifter themselves. Other then what you see blatantly on the screen (and what you can translate outside the game from the Monuments) everything else is a theory. The Dog? Anything you can guess about it or it's origin - theory. Titans? Even calling it a Titan is a theory - could have been Giants, or some other species created by someone else - or not. The game is very open ended in it's ENTIRE story (they give you pieces and you basically build it) and despite it's visual approach the Drifter doesn't react to any of it. You really only get bits of the Drifters personality from how they're animated. Other then that and the cutscenes his personality is very interpretive and... I dunno about you but with games like this I'd like a few more story keys or personal ties from character interactions to draw me into the world a bit more. After that intense opening cutscene, I was kinda sad to find there wasn't much more then that (even the ending one was lacking but at that point I was taking what I could get).Grant it I haven't found every secret in the game YET but I've been looking around and if you've been in the fandom business for atleast a cycle or two you'd know spoilers are usually one of the first things you see when you're indulging in  lore and fanart and I have yet to be spoiled by anything I might have missed.

												I'm glad, I blindly backed every Kickstarter project I thought looked cool a few years ago when I had some money left over and then totally forgot about it afterwards. Hyper Light Drifter is such a game and boy, was the surprise nice, when I suddenly received this Steam key out of the seeming blue.Hyper Light Drifter is a wonderful experience that combines calm exploration with beautiful visuals and a soothing soundtrack with punishingly hard fights. It's never too hard, however; the game just lets you progress naturally, in a Dark Souls-esque way. (I've never played much of any Dark Souls title, sadly, but after this game, I strongly want to, again.)The game rewards curiosity and persistence just as much as it punishes greed and rush, you want to carefully explore the world to not die and lose your progress since the last save. The game isn't perfect tho; while hard, sometimes the checkpoints are mostly set between map transitions, sometimes in such a way that you can easily exploit their placement. Especially when you don't want to repeat the arbitrary collecting action after eery respawn, you just collect after respawning, leave the area, enter again and then you don't have to do so again - that feels a bit counter intuitive to me.Otherweise I can't think of many other negative aspects in HLD. A few things, that positively stuck out, in my opinion, were the almost total lack of text in the game. Except for the HUD and very brief control explanations, all written and spoken language is abandoned, so the game focuses on visual storytelling instead. Also, Disasterpiece did a great job at the music composition once again and its implementation is superb. The music and sound design do their part on the non verbal storytelling and it shows.I don't have much more to say right now, except that this game deserves more attention. I am sure more people would (and hopefully will) enjoy this masterpiece but I kind of expect it to become an insider tip.Highly recommended.			"

												A friendly warning if you have come across this game, and want to buy it on the screenshots alone. Hyper Light Drifter is HARD. Not impossible, not completely hardcore insane, not even your run-of-the-mill roguelike or bullet hell shooter hard, but it will definitely challenge casual gamers who are looking for a fun and relaxed experience.And what an experience it is. Not quite metroidvania, not quite soulslike, yet drawing from both, this game will see you exploring environments rendered in lovely pixel art, occasionally fighting monsters and doing a little platforming before fighting a boss at the end of each area. Right from the beginning, the game lets you go in three different directions, letting you choose what path to take and which bosses to take on first.Both combat and platforming rely heavily on your dash ability, which you have from the start. Many enemies have dash attacks as well, so combat often becomes a wonderful dance of timed dodges and quick counter-attacks, and the first time you finish a large encounter and your enemies lie in pieces at your feet, you will feel like a god!Overall, I'd recommend this game on what little I have played. But like I mentioned earlier, this game is not for everyone. I'd just like lastly elaborate on the difficulty so you know exactly what you are getting into:- Bosses are VERY aggressive and deal a large amount of damage, and will change their attack patterns over the course of the fight. You will be overrun by adds, and stunlocked while attempting to heal. Your health bar is pitifully small, so sometimes you could go from full health to 0 HP in under a second. You will die. A lot. There are abilities you can buy to complement your arsenal and skills, but apart from the ability to carry an additional medkit, I have yet to find anything that would actually really help you stay alive if you aren't that confident in your abilities in the first place.- Apart from the bosses, there are a number of occasions when you are locked in a room with a large number of enemies. If you die, you restart at a previous checkpoint, but with the same amount of HP and medkits you had going in, so if you were low on supplies to start with, you might have a lot of trouble. Remember that you can always teleport out to the hub, and go farm some medkits and try again.- In the style of many oldschool 2d games, secrets in this game sometimes involve a lot of just running up against every wall in the hopes of finding a hidden passage. Sometimes they are well telegraphed, with clues in the environment, but other times it felt like dumb luck. At times this can get quite frustrating.All in all, it's a great game. It's just not for everyone. If you like this type of game however, you would do well to check it out. "

												This game. Wow. I went into this game completely blind, being drawn in by what looked to be great visuals backed by a fantastic soundtrack all supporting tight, satisfying fight mechanics, and it delivered.Don't play it for the story, necessarily. Just know you're in an apocalyptic world battling warrior raccoons, fanatic bird zealots, cannabalistic frogs, and artificial life experiments gone wrong, all while being haunted by a mysterious shadow. If that doesn't draw you in already, I don't know what else to say.The soundtrack and visuals are so well-done and fitting for every moment in the game. If you press the button (or key) for down, your character will actually sit down and chill. This game actually made me want to stop what I was doing and just sit once or twice, just to soak in a particularly fantastic sight, accompanied with great musical ambience.Now, this game is not for everyone. If you prefer games with more focus and direction, and maybe some more clearly explained plot, then look somewhere else. In addition, the combat rewards skill and severly punishes button mashing, so if you want hand-holding, you won't get it here.  But if you're looking for a game with excellent combat mechanics and an adventure that will take you from the tops of the mountain shrines to the bowels of underground factories, with myriads of enemies to take down swiftly and skillfully, this is for you.Let me be a bit more specific concerning the combat. You will die a lot figuring them out, but once you get it, you will be dashing all over the various arenas of monsters, slaying them with impunity. Reflecting projectiles and unleashing powerful charge attacks are just a few of the abilities at your disposal once you unlock them with the currency you'll find hidden throughout the map.Speaking of which, if I had a gripe about the game, its the map. I would prefer to be able to know where I've already been, and whether I've found all the items in that area or not so that I do not have to waste too much time backtracking.Now, they recently made it 60 fps, which was not absolutely necessary, but definitely made the game less frustrating, as every frame counts. They also included a boss rush mode, which is one of my favorite parts of the game. Oh, and it has co-op!All in all, this is one of my favorite games I've played this year so far. It's so vibrant, fun, and challenging. If you'd like to play a game that encourages exploration and a mastery of the combat mechanics in order to fully appreciate it, and experience a world with mysterious but intriguing history, get this game. You won't regret it.Dat north bird boss fight tho... I died like 50 times. Tread carefully.			"

												Well worth its full price, I had good fun with this game. Currently halfway through NG+Controller recommended. +Great (difficult) bosses. Well varied and interesting fights throughout the game. Good enemy design in general.+Extensive amount of detail put into the game. There's a surprising amount of lore that's discretely and very well integrated in the game.+Interesting and great graphics. The cutscenes especially are really well done and everything's great to look at. The music also deserves a huge plus for being memorable and not tedious.+Extensive amount of content, challenges, and collectibles. Secrets are (almost) always hidden in reasonable spots that you can find if you just pay enough attention.+Moveset is advanced and difficult to master, but also rewarding to use.-Wonky collision, accidentally clipped at points and ledges aren't always friendly.-Crashes frequently on Yosemite (10.10.5). It never got in my way too much since it usually happens around screen transition (so you usually autosave before the crash). This might also have something to do with my controller, haven't tested or anything.-Some sections were more frustrating than enjoyable because of bad placement (or no placement) of save spots.-Some achievements are broken. I didn't get a lot of the achievements I was supposed to get during my first playthrough.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter can be best described as a mixture between The Legend of Zelda and Dark Souls. The game is difficult, but fair and, like Dark Souls, the story is never handed to you and if you want to know whats going on youre going to have to explore a lot. The game also has a total of four dungeons, that can be beaten in any order, well except for the South dungeon. The combat animations are fluid and the mixture of Sword and gun combat is quite satisfying. It is also very dash heavy as it is the only way to avoid enemy attacks. All upgrades can be purchased in any order from the start of the game, but the currency is somewhat scarce and hard to find so pick your upgrades wisely. The games lenghth is around 8 to 10 on your first play through and there are new game plus options for those completionists out there. The only cons I could think of is that there are no words said or spoken by any characters in the game, thus leaving you confused as to what the heck is going on, but if you like that type of story then more power to you. There are also occasional bugs were the a cutscene might trigger too early. The game is also locked at 30 fps so if you cant stand that beware.I would highly recommend this game to all fans of Zelda's combat and Dark Soul's style of story telling, and despite it's minor flaws I believe the art style and combat system are well worth the price of admission.

												Hyper Light Drifter is a challenging game that has a beautiful art style. In terms of its story, it is subject to interpretation. Regardless of how you interpret the story, I genuinely enjoyed the game because of its controls, reactionary gameplay, and design. The only possible ""complaint"" I could have is that it's a bit short (4 hours of gameplay, but that's not bad for a non-AAA title) and I guess also having multiple abilities didn't really seem to make a difference for me. I wish there were more abilities or actions you could do to change up battle strategies a bit, but this is just a minor thing in my opinion. I had fun and I think that most people would enjoy this game as well.If I had to give it a rating (not a numerical score), I'd say it is above average and interesting.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is pretty much what I expected. Top down, 2D Zelda-ish gameplay but with more emphasis on combat. I've been following the development of this game for a year or so now and I'm really happy with the finished product. Gameplay is really solid and the minimalistic nature of the art and storytelling within the game is nice too. I felt that the game was a little bit too short but it was still fun; the trailer made it seem like it was going to be bigger than just four areas/bosses. Replaying the game to find all the secrets and to get all the upgrades is pretty much the only reason I would play it again. It's a really solid game with challenging combat, but the only downside is that it's locked at 30 fps. It didn't bother me too much, but I know people who would not be happy with that. Definitely recommend playing with a controller. All in all, a really fun game for its combat, art, and interesting world building.			"

												Absolutely wonderful.It's a fusion of a Zelda game and Dark Souls that really goes beyond what those buzzwords would imply. It branches out to forge its own identity somewhere between the two. The combat is intense and satisfying, and really rewards careful, analytical play. It's not all about reflexes, but they help.The story is told brilliantly through images from NPCs and a few cutscenes. The overarching plot is a bit vague but gives you just enough to go on, Each area has its own subplot that is relatively straightforward, but beautifully delivered.This game is not too hard, don't let anyone fool you. I am terrible at games and I beat it. It just takes practice and determination.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter, the game with amazing pixel graphic. Yes the pixel art, pixel animation is very good. All of area such as forest, the town, mountain is so well designed. The music is also nice to hear. Since i play this game, i never found dialogue, only pixel art illustration that telling you what really happen so you have to understand all by yourself. Such an unique experience playing a game without the dialougue. It makes me ""Wanna know more"".What i like from HLD (Hyper Light Drifter. For short) is the combat system. even you have upgrade your skill, that doesn't mean you are OP. Yes, to be honest the combat system seems basic but hard. You have to know when to attack, when to dodge with your dash. And not to forget the enemy. The enemy has it's own way to tear down player concentration and make player died. So player must know the attack pattern of the enemy to keep on living in the game. And also this thing that i just say about the enemy makes the enemy isn't useless when you upgraded all of your skill so this is a good point.Not to forget the stage or dungeon. The dungeon itself is very well organized. The best thing about the dungeon in my recent playthrough is the raising tiles. Yup, this tiles will rise or flattened down, making a major change in the battlefield. If you are achivement hunter. this game is very challenging. The majority of the achievement is relatively hard to get. There is an achievement that will unlock if you beat this game without dying. I would recommend finishing this game first before attempting this achievement. If you just straight getting this achievement in your first play session you will be bored. You have to restart again if you die and the intro is a bit long and unskipable.			"

												Same way as Shovel Knight is the new Super Mario, Hyper Light Drifter is the New Legend of Zelda, If you liked games such as A link to the Past or Link Between Worlds in the concept that you have a vast world and you can go basically in whatever order you want, then this is the game for you, It does get difficult and thats why some people say Dark Souls, (because now apparently if a game is difficult you have to compare it to Dark Souls) but nothing is too hard, as long as you play your cards right and use every power to your disposal correctly, then you should be fine, buy this game, it's a great experience, definitely worth the money.

												I'm one year away from 30 and have over 600 games in my steam library, I've been playing games in various forms since I was unable to speak. This game perfectly encapsulates both the history and evolution of gaming in the most eloquent of ways, Both the depth of what's expressed but with the space to interpret for oneself. The gameplay itself is amazing from the cryptic start to somber finish. Fluid and beautiful, you'll be allowed to grow and you'll never blame the game for your own death. This is another sign of a great game.... Everything has been meticulously and lovingly crafted SERIOUSLY there is so much little beautiful details to the animations and environments it's easy to say this game is my favourite modern pixel game EVER. I'd like to thank heart machine for what they have given us. Cannot wait to see what this company comes up with next. I cannot recommend this game enough 10\10 at $20 you'll get your moneys worth. Trust in the heart machine.			"

												I knew nothing about this game when I first bought it. I didn't even give it a good look and thought into it before buying this game. Even though I sort of set my self up for the possibility of buying a terrible game without knowing anything about it, I am glad I bought this game. The first 3 hours of this game got me hooked. The uncertainty of buying a good game was real and this could have been a big waste of money but I'm glad I found this game and I'm glad I bought it. This might even be my new favorite game.It is a challenging game which I have not encountered one of those in a while.It is fast pase and give you little room for error but just enough to plan a way out of a situation.You do not want to go into this game fllailing your weapons around. You must plan and strategize with the move given to you. This game is truly a diamond in the rough.I'm hooked and I can't stop playing.The game is beautiful. The graphics are top tier even though it is a pixel art game. All of the diamond shapes and all of the colors really set up a nice picture. It isn't hard on the eye nor is it dull. It is quaint and mystic. That is the art style.The sound effects for this game tie really well for what the game sound represents. The gun firing sound sounds like a plasma pistol and that sound gives you a vivid image of a hightech gun. The sword appropriately sounds like a light saber, although it does not sound entirely like a light saber but it gets the point across and paints a vivd image that you are weilding an energy weapon. The enemy sounds fit the enemies they apply to. It is all surreal sounding.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter art style manages to feel retro and yet distinct and modern at the same time, a task many other games fail to accomplish.The gameplay as if guided by the art style presents old fashioned mechanics that are polished with a modern spark that is both varied and responsive.I really like this game, it captures a nostalgic feeling I have for an era long forgotten in video game history, and at the same time manages to bypass most of the design shortcoming what were prominent back then.

												I was a backer but I didn't pay enough to get into the beta. I haven't played very long yet, but so far I have to say I am really excited and the quality on display here is a fantastic reward for my modest investment! It's not as hard as Teleglitch but it's a lot harder than Zelda. Harder than Bastion with no shrines, but not as hard as Bastion with all shrines. The gameplay is action-RPG with twin stick and strong elements of hack-n-slash(-n-dodge, because you really have to learn how to effectively use your dash to best effect in the combat).The pixel art graphics are done extremely well, really shows off the format and what it can do when used in a sophisticated way by really talented artists.I'll update this review later, after I've either finished the game or lost interest (don't think that will be the case, though, it's a really compelling play experience so far).

You can either finish it or try to find all the secrets and unlocks (uniforms, guns, techniques, etc) or beat it again on ""New Game +"" with lower health.Very climatic indie game for sure. One downside of the Hyper Light Drifter is that it's gameplay is bound to FPS. Make sure you run it on a minimum required machine or better.			"

												I've being playing this game for a while now and i have to say i am very impressed that i have spended this much on this game.The game graphics and music fit in very well for the theme their going for, something like a fictional cyberpunk feel.The graphics are turely unique that i havent seen in other games by that i mean mostly colour,colours and more amazing colours! Each area has its thing which entertains you for the whole game and even game+.The gameplay is, again, unique and unforgiving something like Dark souls (this mostly comes in game+).I found myself always zipping around the map with the dash which is a big feature in the game, which for sure did its job and adding a bit of extra like upgrades to it same with combat as every monster or enemy has its thing and there is always a diffrent way to defeating them with your sword and again also adding extra with those awesome upgrades.For the people that say that there is no story there is but its very well hidden, but i wont spoil it on you of course ;p but ill tell you if you find out the story you wont regret it.Over all i enjoyed and still enjoy the game as its always updating with new features and just love the diffuclty making it re-playable, i suggest this game to any Dark souls fans out there and really anyone that are thinking on buying this game as it has co-op if you wanna play with a buddy ;p			"

Product received for free
												Incredibly well made 2D roleplay exploration based game. Sountrack is absolutely echanting, visuals never get boring to the eye.Certain nitpicks:- Confusing storyline throughout the first hours of playing the game. It does get clearer and clearer while you keep playing, though. - Not so amazing boss fights. The last one is an exception. (that was so ♥♥♥♥in cool)- Clunky movement mechanics. You'll often find yourself accidentally falling out of the world.- A lot of walking. A lot of it. That also includes a lot of backtracking in order to find extra modules/gearbits/or monoliths. Not much of a big deal, but there's people who don't like this sort of thing. - Some secret passageways would be impossible to find out unless you were dashing around every single centimeter in a level. The game often shows you where a secret passageway might be located by placing a symbol on the edge of a plataform, though, so I guess that compensates the nearly imposssible-to-find passageways. Other than that I can safely say I really enjoyed playing this game. Combat mechanics are absolutely fun to mess around with, several ways to defeat enemies (not only with your sword). Difficulty gradually increases when you progress throughout the game, health packs are distributed evenly, enemy spawn system keeps you atentive enough and ready to jump into action through out the entire game, a whole variety of levels to explore, different enemy mechanics, ect...  did I also say its graphics are gorgeous? Oh yeah, definitely. I love me some eye candy every once in a while.Thanks to my bro Choppa for the game, too. You're awesome dude. Had a lot of fun with this game c:.			"

												This game has mad style. Immediately, you’ll notice the pixel art is top notch. There are gorgeous vistas to stop and take a gander at when you’re not too busy with the fast-paced combat or looking for secrets. You’ll behold a devastated world filled with remnants of the past in 4 different environments located at each of the cardinal directions (NWES). The storytelling mostly comes from interpreting images and your surroundings as the games has no dialogue. Sometimes what’s happening is obvious because a bloody corpse says it blatantly. The game also runs only at 30fps which is puzzling considering how much zipping around you’ll be doing.Look at that view:

Now, the game doesn’t explain much and while that gives it an air of mystery with the story, it works against it in other parts. Do not accidentally sabotage your playthrough with poor initial upgrade purchases. Upgrades requires Gearbits and you need to find four pieces of them to make one. Making a bad upgrade purchase can cause large amounts of suffering because the combat/mobility upgrades should take priority over anything else. My recommended upgrade path is the sword projectile reflect and chain dodge first, then the dodge projectile shield. From there you can safely branch out and grab whatever upgrade you want. I foolishly grabbed an ammo upgrade before grabbing the sword projectile reflect ability which gave me some serious problems in the Eastern Zone with the ranged enemies. Don’t do what I did. Also know that you can fast travel at almost any time to an activated waypoint, so don’t be afraid to try out the other paths to find more bits. Combat isn’t about pulling off sweet 100-hit combos and increasing the score multiplier. It’s about timing, mobility, positioning, and skilled execution. You’ll find yourself frequently dodging to and from enemies as you quickly decide to attack or retreat. Dodges don’t have any invincibility frames and enemies have collision so move carefully. Your character will have access to different guns, starting with the pistol. However, the aiming mechanic is extremely clunky. You hold Left Trigger to pull out the gun, aim with the Left Stick, and then fire with the Right Trigger. Your character has to stand still during that whole process which can mean taking hits while trying to shoot. Aiming my shot by facing the enemy before squeezing the Right Trigger worked out much better, especially with the shotgun. For example, you can dodge or run towards an enemy, fire away with RT, then dodge/run away, all without bothering with the terrible aiming mechanic. Hitting with the sword and then firing right after works well too. You’ll need to watch out for enemies or hazards that can knock you down because you’re not safe on the ground. You can be killed while lying down and some bosses will knock the wind out of you.Each zone has a big bad and those bosses are all about learning patterns and using your tools. They’re not easy foes. I’ve died to all the bosses multiple times before emerging victorious. They have a set pattern and a pattern changeup once you remove enough of their health. Usually this means they’ll speed up, add another attack, or possibly summon adds (enemies). I found myself counting their attacks and looking for their tells in order to overcome them. If you pay enough attention, each attempt will bring you closer to victory as you learn their tactics and counter with your own. I really liked the final boss. The fight was a satisfying and challenging experience. I defeated it with a well-executed reflection of 8-10 projectiles at point blank range. That felt way too good. Mmm.Finally, in addition to the upgrade woes I mentioned earlier, there are other areas where this game stumbles. The map isn’t very helpful and doesn’t mark any of the collectables except for modules, things necessary for game progression though you can find bonus ones. Its rooms are displayed as basic shapes with the paths that connect them. Your player icon will not be accurately positioned to your true location. I didn’t use it much except for fast traveling and occasional path checking for making sure I’m heading down the right chain of rooms when underground.The chain/infinite dodge never felt responsive to me and was sometimes hard to control. This issue could be related to the game running at 30fps. I am not sure. The chain dodge is the main method of traveling quickly. It’s also much faster than the normal 3 dodges at a time. The issue comes from the timing which struggles to feel consistent. Also, the more chain dodges you manage, the faster the timing becomes and those windows are very picky. Sometimes you’ll come to a dead stop if your second button press is off. Or you’ll mess up a third or fourth press which makes your character slide for a considerable amount of distance. The slide looks cool until you realize you’re going off a platform. Sometimes you’ll just slam into a wall and bounce when zipping around. I fell off platforms quite often and I had moments where my second button press left me on top of a disappearing platform instead of starting the chain. For the most part, chain dodging is manageable despite the false starts and slides. It’s also fun when you figure out the tempo, but its unreliability becomes a major problem when trying do some of the optional activities.My last criticism is about how some of the secrets are handled in this title. In short, some of them are either tedious, frustrating, or both. One of them involves reaching a chain dodge number of 800 in the dodge shop. That’s 800 dodges in a row which is possible with the upgrade, but maybe should be avoided. I think my top score was around 60 or more. There was also this crystal room with a cosmetic reward at the end. You had to navigate a long and winding hall with 90 degree turns where the floor was mostly covered with crystal hazards by chain dodging. These crystals turn into big dangerous crystals soon after you pass over them that knock you down for 2 damage. My knocked out character would sometimes land on other crystals and succumb to a fatal crystal chain. If you manage to pass all the hazards, you’re then greeted by a room full of mobs and crystal spiders that encase you in a crystal if they touch you. You can take damage and be killed while encased and have to start from the beginning. That place showed me how flawed the chain dodge was. Or maybe that was a bad room. Throughout the game, I just wasn’t too enthusiastic about secrets unless they were hidden Gearbit pieces. Overall, the game provided me with a good experience, a memorable final boss fight, sweet tunes, and a great amount of style. The game could have been better in the areas I’ve mentioned before, especially with that map. The movement and combat could have benefited from having 60fps.			"

												An asolutely amazing game that is both aesthetically stunning and mechanically compelling. A combination of the unforgiving combat of Dark Souls with the open world adventuring of Zelda, set in a visually sumptuous world of futuristic tech and lost ancient civilization. Hyper Light Drifter lives up to the hype and delivers an unforgetable experience both in combat and exploration.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is somewhat a mixed bag of the game.On one hand we have absolutely gorgeous graphics and amazing soundtrack, solid combat and awesome boss fights.The game feels like a mix of Souls and Zelda. It's definitely not an easy game, nor does it tells you anything about the world directly (there are literally no words in game beyond menu).Vibrant colors and very interesting world only adds to the great atmosphere this game has.Just exploring for secrets is a joy, in my opinion.Melee combat feels pretty solid, all enemies have their own attack patterns that you have to learn, bosses are amazing to fight against.Storyline is.. hm.. I guess ""intriguing"" would be the best word here. Since you'll have to figure it out yourself from a set of images. Some people actually called it ""lazy"" (it might as well be so), but I'd found it to be pretty interesting.On other hand we have a bunch of very annoying things - 30fps lock, very poorly thought through aiming system, poor keyboard and mouse support, lackluster progression system.I mean, you can still play with all of those, they are definitely not game breaking.But missing a crucial shot or dashing off the cliff is not that unusual for this game. And considering how hard can some of the battles be - this might be mildly infuriating.Progression system is probably my biggest gripe here - it could've been so much more, yet it's just a bunch of unlock that you cannot get unless you explore for secrets to find currency for them. And some of those are really well hidden and can take a while to find. Not everyone will like that.So, if you can ignore those issues and just play the game for the world, exploration and boss fights - you'll find to enjoy it quite a bit.Watch my video for more in-depth look here:

												Hands down the best game I've played in the last year! This game is firing on all cylinders. If you want smooth intuitive combat. GOT THAT. Large world to explore with stunning visuals. GOT THAT TOO. Item discovery,  upgradable character and items, bold story telling and secrets galore. OH YEAH HLD's your huckleberry. The only drawback is the game leaves you on such a high that it's hard to find anything that can measure up. Give this game a chance and you won't be disappointed. Good luck and happy drifting!			"

 (I’m new at “officially” reviewing things, so bear with me please.) First off, I  absolutely   recommend this game to anyone who’s considering buying it; however, I will warn that for some people it might be a tougher game than you'd think. That being said, the controls are rather intuitive (I played with a controller, so I can’t really speak for the keyboard and mouse experience), and I would advise that you don’t be afraid to experiment a bit in how you do things in order to find the best method for you. Second, advice if you do play the game: dodge, and dodge often, at least until  you get the ability to reflect bullets with your sword and/or dodge through bullet attacks without taking damage, and then it becomes dodge and reflect often .****************************************************************** Hyper Light Drifter is a game that’s far from easy, but not impossible either. The gameplay is very smooth and the controls are relatively easy to learn — but that doesn’t mean you’ll be  good  at everything right away. You’re thrown into a world that gives you very little and allows you to figure things out for yourself; in a sense, what you put into it is what you get out of it (particularly in terms of the story, but I’ll get to that in a bit). It’s a game that rewards you for secret-hunting, so be on the lookout for everything from secret passages to areas that you can dash to. You will die, and you’ll probably die often. And it will be frustrating at times (at least it was for me). But you’ll find yourself getting back up to try again and again until you get it, and that sense of accomplishment is oh-so-sweet once you make it. The art in this game is absolutely gorgeous — the lighting is extremely well done, the colors are lovely, and I was surprised when I realized the reason everything looks so  smooth  is that the typical outline you see in pixel art is not there. The animations are extremely smooth, and even the death and resurrection animations are good (I will say I’m extremely glad they patched in the ability to speed up the resurrection animation, especially when you’re dying multiple times trying to defeat a boss). The music and sound design in general is absolutely beautiful as well, to the point where I’m still not tired of hearing it even after having a track loop for 30+ minutes straight as I try to defeat a boss. The details in this game are extremely impressive, from the way your blood drops dissolve off the ground to the little victory sword thing your Drifter does when finishing a harder fight. The entire game progresses without a single word, everything being explained through pictures (or in the case of upgrades, little animations) and cutscenes; and yet, I feel like understood the story as well as I personally could have. The “important” characters (those that do more than make a little noise at you when you ""ping"" them) have their backstories told through pictures as well, and I felt oddly connected to them despite not having what would normally be considered ""in-depth"" information about them. Especially true for me in the case of  the other Drifter (possibly?), who’s in the same situation as you, or at least it seems that way . And I won’t lie — the ending gave me a few emotions, at least the way that I interpreted it. All in all, this game is fantastic and I will definitely be playing quite a bit more of it to see what I can find and/or do. This is absolutely a game I recommend.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is an adventure game with fantastic atmosphere. The combat, while so far a bit basic, is well made and you are required to watch the attack patterns of your enemies to find opening. Similar to the Dark Souls games you can heal mid fight, but you are completely vulnerable for a second while you heal. I only fought one boss so far, but the difficulty level seemed perfect. The difficulty outside of boss fights is more on the easy side, since the game hides health packs at every second corner.The world has a beautiful design, that took some heavy inspiration from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and offers quite a bit of freedom for exploration. You are not forced into a linear path, but rather given the choice to explore whichever part of the world you want to start with. The soundtrack has the typical Disasterpeace feel that is reminiscent of FEZ and fits the game quite nicely.So far I haven't run into any major bugs, only some animals that were stuck running into a wall and one or two walls that you could walk through that didn't seem intentional. However one major issues with the game is the lock to 30 fps. While it is perfectly playable at that framerate it would look a lot smoother in 60 fps.			"

												This is really, really good. The music, the art, the gameplay is all fantastic. Some people say the difficulty is unnecessarily cruel. I haven't hit a big difficulty spike yet, but I don't actually know. The most difficult thing so far was understanding the mechanics. But that's easily remedied via usage of a guide, which I reckon beats the whole purpose of this game but to each his/her own I guess.Also, it is the most responsive 30 FPS game I've ever played. So, if that's keeping you from buying, don't let it.I had been hearing about this game for many, many years now and I'm very happy to see that it all came together. Congratulations guys.			"

												Just cleared the west side of the map and then went and got the 800 chain dash acheivement after trying very hard for a long time (that was nervewracking). My previous record was 485 dashes, so from about 600 to 800 dashes you can imagine how nervous I was getting ^_-. My keyboard didn't cooperate at all, the spacebar is just plain awkward to tap continuously. Now I know why it was thrown out. Oh well, at least now I can say I got the achievement using a keyboard I found in the trash! So far I'm lovin this game an incredible lot. Despite the lack of words I somehow identify with the main character. I've not had an experience like this with a game.. until now.			"

												Great game. One of the only improvements I wish for is that the map would detail more collectibles when you find them. It would be nice to visualize where you've already found keys and obelisks to make it easier to get an idea of where to search for the remainder. As it stands I had to resort to a guide because I didn't think to write down or memorize whether or not I'd gotten every key from an area. It would've been too tedious to run back through every section scouring for them.Also NG+ has a pretty lame implementation, but that's not very important.Other than than that, it's fantastic.

												Hyper Light Drifter has a magnificent aesthetic, beautiful soundtrack, and intriguing world. Unfortunately, this is where the appeal ends. Between cut content, horrific PC controls, 30fps locking, and gameplay that feels as though it punishes the player simply for existing rather than challenging them to play well, the game veers far off-course from ""challenging"" into simply ""hard to play."" Combine that with storytelling that errs too minimalist to be satisfying and you have a game that will kill perhaps five or six hours of casual play, but leave you feeling very empty.			"

												I just finished the game a few minutes ago before writing this and I must say I have mixed feelings. The Good: Amazing sound and visual design,  solid dash mechanics. the well designed bossfights.The Bad: Swordplay feels stilted, the story is handled poorly( I don't even think there was one), the map more often then not does not help, enemy placement half the time felt  ill-thought-out, it is not fun to rub your face against walls for hours.On the Kickstarter page they promised a much lager game with an actual story, but when I play Drifter I feel as if there is no purpose as to why I am trying to collect shards. I feel they were going for an old school zelda 1 feel but it falls flat story wise, even for a game that is solely about adventuring.  In zelda 1 the game clues you in to why you have to collect the tri-force pieces. you collect them to save Zelda and to have a chance to stop Gannon. In drifter though you collect shards for access to boss rooms? (i'll edit this part when I go back in if i'm just being an idiot). If you collect 4 you are privy to a meaningless cutscene that basicly shows you the opening again. What i'm getting at is the story feels so pretentious  that the team forgot to write a story with purpose. I'm all for no word storytelling, but they dropped the ball on this one.TL;DR The game sufferd from the Peter Molyneux Effect and it was so close to acheivng what I belive the team set out to make, but they just wern't there.Would I recomend the game? If you just want to turn off and not care then yes, but if you are someone who likes to understand why you are doing the things you do in the game, then no.(I know this has nothing to do with the game but this rubbed me the wrong way. I don't know what these people did but in the special thanks I saw a scam artist (Tim ""money furnace"" Schafer) and two professional victims (Anita Sarkeesian and Zoe Quinn) I know i'll get flak gor this, but why would associat with them?)

												I would very much love to recommend this game. But sadly I can't. And here's why.The combat is very fast and relies on you dodging enemy attacks and then punishing them in their vunerable state. It reminds me of Souls games and Bloodborne. However where those games boast fantastic responsiveness and robust controls this game falls flat on it's face and completely ruins the whole experience,Controls are very unreliable. Sometimes you dodge, sometimes you don't because even if you press the button in time your character will not respond to your input. The easiest way to check this issue is try dodging several times in a row when not in combat. You'll quickly see what I mean.Framerate drops are constant on the upper-middle class rig that runs DSIII on 60fps no problem,Perhaps the Game Maker Studio used to make HLD is to blame but regarless it is a frustrating experience.Game's art direction is worthy of mentioning because this is a gem to look at. Locations are pretty and there are some nods to classic games with way better controls.No matter how apealing this game looks on the surface stay away.To further prove my point here's a review by Super Bunnyhop:

												One of the few games I would think about when people talk about games as an art form. Incredible Music,Art and sound effects. Gameplay is challenging and there are some unlocks that really change how you play. My tip if you choose to buy this game is to explore every little bit of the environment. There are lots of hidden areas and stuff that are not obvious at first glance. Also while there is a tutorial of sorts, a lot of info on how to actually complete the game is left to the player to figure out. But its not hard. If you can figure out what traffic signs mean then you wont really have a problem. Also please play the game with sound and also on good speakers/headphones. It's worth it.			"

												Honestly, I went throught the whole game and didn't discover a single key, that is awesome. I would normally consider myself someone who can snoop out secrets, but this game took it to the next level with how well they designed these areas that you have to really look for. The gameplay was excellent as well. The combat was fair, people moan and groan about how you stop when you heal but if you just get away from the fighting you're okay, and there was only one special move I had a gripe about, the two moves where you stab farther and dash hit had the same key combo. All in all, the game was very well done for the small price it's being sold at.			"

												I bought this game in a bit of a rut, and I was expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game was much more than I could have asked for.The Combat is fast paced with some very interesting mechanics which can make you feel really good to pull off. The story is very interesting, but very mysterious as well. If you're not looking to spend some extra time looking into the story it might be very confusing as to what happened and why. The game graphics are very appealing, very well done and stylized.Definetly a good buy in my opinion, however the game seems to only have about 40-50 hours worth of playtime in it unless you are some sort of speedrunner.

												To begin, the art and ambient soundtrack is astounding. It really immerses you into the game and sets the tone for the plot. Second, the combat is simple to learn, yet hard to master. You can swing your sword, and shoot a gun. Eventually, you can pick up upgrades that may require you to dash and swing your sword in quick succession, but that is really all there is to it. The enemies are made to be very challenging, so you will need to play smart and never take uneccessary damage in order to preserve as much life as possible. Finally, there are many secrets in this game, and even times when you need to look for something vital to completing the game, it could be hidden. I don't want to spoil anything, but always pay attention to your surroundings and look around very thoroughly in order to get the best experience you can for this game. Nothing in this game bothered me enough to mention, but everyone is different. A thing to mention is the story is very interesting yet hard to comprehend. You pretty much have to imagine a lot of the sotry for yourself, but there are times when you can piece bits of the intended story together based on environment, bosses, and interacting with NPCs (That do not talk in any other way besides showing you pictures) Essentially, if you are not into the types of games that do not hold your hand and tell you where to go, you will dislike this game. Come into this 7-9 hour game expecting a challenge, because that is what you are going to get. I hope many people come to purchase this game and support the developers that worked very hard on creating a game that is memorable in every aspect. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes action - RPGs and enjoy dying a lot :DFINAL VERDICT: Art - 10Soundtrack - 9Combat - 9Story - 9 "

												I was pretty pesimistic about this game when I bought it but now I know that it was worth it. It's like an arcade verios of dark souls mixed up with undertale. Well it's like that but minus the plot, at least at the beginning of the game. It's very atmospheric, from the moment you see game logo when you turn it on. Honestly, it's a really terrific arcade game with rpg elements, great atmosphere and soundtrack which has the best elements of the dark souls and 8 bit games.			"

												Instead of a review, how about obtuse comparisons for every gamer?For fans of indie games: imagine Transistor.  Take away the ability to pause combat, and imagine a much more visceral and immediate gaming experience.  You have to plan your approach to combat in this game, but you don't have the luxury of the pause, zoom out, carefully place precise movements phase of combat: everything happens quite quickly.  The game is just as beautiful, but in a more ambient (sountrack) and expansive (world) way.For fans of Japanese action rpgs: imagine a later Ys game.  Now give yourself a gun.  Cover with a layer of lovely pixelated aesthetic flair.And now a comparison that should work for any gamer: Hyper Light Drifter is a Zelda game that really makes you work for it.One last thing: don't imagine Dark Souls.  Yes, the game is difficult.  Yes, the story is told in an organic, non-scripted way.  But the above comparisons give you a better idea of how the game plays.EDIT: Just updating to say the developers have continued to add great content: still a great game I'd wholeheartedly recommend.

												Hyper Light Drifter is an adventure RPG with a unique style of storytelling, enchanting soundtrack, and addicting, fast-paced gameplay. The controlls are very precise and crisp, each new area has it's own style of challenges, and the number of hidden secrets and places to explore are beyond expectations for an indy game. No other game I have played has instilled such a sense of awe and wonder as Hyper Light Drifter has. I am currently playing through New Game +, equally loving the challenge and hating myself for the dumb, silly mistakes I make. By far, the best use of $20 that I can recommend on steam.			"

												This game runs at 30 fps, yes, and I can understand how that will put off some people. But, if you think you can look past that, and if you have any interest in this game, you will find striking visuals, excellent sound design, a wonderfully vague narrative, and several hot cups of visceral, rapid combat. New game plus isn't the best (only a health reduction), but I've gotten enjoyment out of just playing the normal story through several times.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a game that I have been looking forward to playing for quite some time. I feared a little that my excitement for the game may cause disappointment when things didn't meet expectations, but I was pleasantly suprised by just how well executed everything turned out to be.The artstyle is simply gorgeous, done in an 8-bit style to extremely great effect; and combined with the well polished soundtrack, Hyper Light Drifter succeeds in reaching a very high overall quality. The gampeplay itself is quite engaging, with a large emphasis on evasion and hit-and-run tactics, which combined with the unforgiving health system, makes for plenty of very intense engagements. In addition, I beat every boss in the game (optional and mandatory), and every single one was very unique to fight.My only two complaints are quite minor. The first was that in doing a lot of exploring, I spent a lot of time listening to the one track associated with the area I was in. This was eased somewhat in the high overall quality of the soundtrack, but after some time looking around, listening to one theme the entire time did begin to grow a little stale.My second complaint was that I experienced a bug around bosses, where after reloading to try again, the game would autosave after I would use a medkit to bring my character to full health. This meant that each time I retried, I lost a medkit until I eventually had none left.Other than that though, this game was a pleasure to play through, and my seven hours to complete the game were very well spent.★★★☆☆			"

												Hyperlight drifter is actually a really fun game that reminds me of old zelda games. It has tons of exploration and lots of different ways to play and fight, the monsters are interesting and diverse, and the art style is simply beautiful. The only problem I had with the game was the 30fps cap that made it difficult to chain attacks properly, but the devs have updated the game to have 60fps and even added co-op. I highly recommend this game if you've got the cash to spare or see a sale on it.			"

												I stumbled upon this game on launch day and bought it instantly, I played for a bit and got stuck at a part so I refunded it. Months later I buy it again on sale and now it's one of my favourite games of all time. Hyper Light Drifter is a pixel art, bullet hell, adventure game that can most relate to Dark Souls and The Legend of Zelda. This game can be extremely challenging at times and it's actually the first game I've ever played that made me take breaks. If you're like me and you can't understand a storyline unless it's handed to you on a silver platter then you might have trouble getting a hold on what's even happening. If you do somehow understand the story or you looked up detailed explanations of it then you will see that it has a pretty crazy story and it has some deep lore. The soundtrack, it is majestic. I'm not exactly a music critic so I can't give a Anthony Fantano strong 9 or anything like that but it's definitely one of the best soundtracks I've heard in the past few years. To keep this short I'd give this beautiful game a 94/100 and if you like pixel graphic adventures or bullet hell games then this is a must buy.			"

												So lets say you really liked chocolate cake. This chocolate cake called Dark Souls. Now you had a huge chocolate cake in 2011, and you got another huge chocolate cake that tasted almost exactly the same in 2014. Then you had yet another chocolate cake with some cherry drizzle on it (Bloodborne) in 2015. Theres another big chocolate cake in 2016 too, but you start to feel that even though you really love the cake, you are kind of getting tired of it. Not tired enough to dislike chocolate all together, but still. So instead you find a nice coca brownie, and its quite good. Maybe not as good as that first chocolate cake, but the brownie is diffrent in a nice way, and still tastes pretty good.Hyper Light Drifter is a delicous coca brownie.			"

Everything about this was great, the art direction was amazing, the gameplay was great, and overall the atmosphere was fantastic. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the challenge involved, though it might not be for everyone. Some people might pick this game up expecting to be able to hack their way through everything, but even the busiest fights still need to be done methodically. I also really enjoyed the exploration, but again that might not be for everyone. Overall, I would completely recommend to anyone who is still interested. The ride is well worth it.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action game in the style of early Legend of Zelda games, specifically A Link to the Past for the SNES, as the game features a top down camera and involves exploring an overworld with several small dungeons tucked away. Furthermore, the launch was crippled by FPS drops, but it has since been patched out and the game ran without any issues for the duration of my first playthrough.The Good:+Excellent combat that relies on timing and mastery of the players abilities.+Fluid pixel art that is easy on the eyes.+Fantastic music by Disasterpiece, the same artist that produced the music for Fez and Shoot Many Robots.+Lots of secrets, hidden paths and upgrades hidden around every corner of the map and dungeons.+The story and narrative is told without dialogue, much like Journey was, which makes for a different experience.+Enviromental puzzles and challenges break up the hack and slash action.The Bad:-The game has superb boss fights, but could've used more, especially since the last zone featured more than one.-Some enemies will knock your character over and hit you again, before you can dodge away, leading to cheap deaths.-Due to opting out of dialogue the story does seem somewhat shallow.-Secrets fall between just being in a corner or having incredibly obtuse sollutions that aren't always explained.Bottom Line: Hyper Light Drifter is a love letter to old retro games and flaunts great gameplay, tells a simplistic story and at times, delivers crushing difficulty. For those looking for a retro challenge this is it, however those looking for less action and more pure exploration should look elsewhere.			"

												This game is the first and only one for which I have ever felt the need to write a review for. Honestly I wasn't expecting too much out of this when I first purchased it. I watched the trailers beforehand and figured it would be a pretty average/so-so game that I would work on every so often out of boredom. Boy was I WRONG. I found myself immediately intrigued when the opening cut scene started to play on the screen after creating my character save. It made me curious as to what was going on and what exactly this story would be about. Even after completing the game (after about 8 hours) I was still left wondering what exactly was the cause/source of the dilemma which your character faces. I suppose that is to be somewhat expected from a game with absolutely no dialogue whatsoever.The occasional picture based “dialogues” that you would encounter with a few characters throughout the game would give you a general idea of what to watch out for and where to go, but beyond that the grand plot of the story was left somewhat to speculation. However, I would not count this as a con at all. Quite the contrary, actually; it left it to the imagination as to how this world you play in came to be.With that being said, this game is perhaps one of the best I have ever played. It’s simple style, yet complex and diverse atmosphere was breathtaking in its own special way, and the adventure/puzzle/mystery style of it all really made it something that I could not put down. I played it at every chance I could get until I was finished.However, as fun as this game is, it is equally challenging and at times VERY frustrating. It isn’t too hard to figure out the puzzles and places that you need to go in order to acquire the necessary items to progress, but some of the fighting areas (and ESPECIALLY the boss fights) are rather grueling. This is no pushover game when it comes to combat. Some of the mob fights took several tries, and the boss battles took many, many more. What’s more is that it is rather difficult to find health, as it exists in scarcity across the games landscape and dungeons. May Heaven, Hell, and all the hosts that lie within them help you if you happen to enter a big fight without enough health and reserve health. Don’t expect to come out victorious by just “winging it.” It’s difficulty and required persistence WILL make you want to rage quit several times. Period. But not in a bad way… if that makes sense.Overall, for the price that I paid and the experience that I got out of it, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun and enjoyable (and, again, challenging) way to kill time. Just be prepared to devote some time and patience when going into it. 10/10 would pay and play again. "

												Hyper Light Drifter's (HLD) flashy fast style and sharp art direction will draw you into its world and its steeply difficult to master mechanics will keep you engaged (if that's your thing). Reward stems solely from learning the intricacies of combat. With a few unlockable abilities you are highly mobile, easily able to evade or deflect any incoming attack. But, executing these moves with confidence takes practice and HLD doesn't shy away from punishing you for your errors.Like the most successful action games, HLD is undeniably cool and stimulating when you fall into its flow. But, this rhythm-harmony is hard to achieve, demanding practice and your undivided attention. Lose it and you'll find yourself completely open to attack or looking at the black death screen -- your colorful sprite lying in a pool of his own blood. Combat is HLD's most interesting element. You are equipped with a sword that has a single attack combo and a pistol that recharges whenever you attack with the sword. The pistol is just as useful as the sword--even in boss fights--which is an unexpected triumph. Enemies with 2 or 3 hit points can be disposed of with one sword combo, a few pistol shots, or a couple reflected projectiles. Those with more health need a few sword combos and a few shots to take down. But, after completing a single 3-swing combo, your sprite is locked in a sort-of rest animation that leaves you open to attack. Each sword strike has to be timed and enemies never get stunned. Mess up the dash's galloping rhythm and your sprite will slide across the ground for a couple seconds as you helplessly try to regain control. Some guns(yes, there is more than one) have a short cooldown in between shots that can really throw you off if you're not careful. But these moments where, suddenly, combat grinds to halt for a brief couple of seconds really separates it from a generic hack 'n slash requiring little-to-no deliberation. With life-threatening challenges around every corner, satisfaction arises from skill-based consistency in battle. This may be a point of issue for some. The nonlinear structure of the game means every area has a similar level of difficulty (excluding the Southern area which isn't immediately accessible). The hardest area will most likely be your first. Although, if you care enough to explore the late game content, there are rooms that will definitely test your skills. But, these rooms always feel extra and are never necessary for progressing through the main game.HLD presents itself as a very mysterious game and its ambiguity harms more than it helps. NPCs speak in hieroglyphics that resemble symbols you've seen elsewhere. A monitor in your bedroom displays a cryptic diagram. Nothing is explained, save for a few basic controls. After a few hours you will know everything the game has to offer and be left with the matter of finding them. The problem is that you'll think the game has more to offer than it actually does. Much like the NPCs that tell stories in slide-show form, these mysteries are to be seen, not to engage with. They are surface level, solely there to build the world, not to solve. On the whole, the ambiguity of its story, characters, and goal prevents HLD from building tension around any particular confrontation or moment. HLD tries to with it short opening cinematic, NPC stories, and one reoccurring nightmare sequence but it's all too little and all too vague. This, coupled with the game's open structure, results in an experience that never escalates to a satisfying conclusion. However, the game has a consistent, dark tone and an atmosphere that is filled with dread. Visually, the game can be dark and frightening as you journey far below the surface. It can be bright and beautiful as you wander through a crystal forest and even epic, with once mobile giants, now forever petrified in stoic backgrounds. HLD combines sci-fi and fantasy in a unique way and it is difficult to not be drawn into its world.Individual areas are visually and structurally different, distinctly separate from one another.Unlike the game as a whole, each area escalates in the form of sequentially more difficult arena-style battles, climaxing with a boss encounter. Areas will have their own enemy types and combinations, often mixed together in a way that will keep you constantly juggling strategies. Boss fights present proper challenges, spurring the ferocity of combat to new heights in two-phase, lengthy confrontations. Enemy and boss design are both well-done and serve as one of HLD's strongest features.HLD's biggest problem is its exploration. The map is not really all that helpful. There are three things you're looking for in the game: purple triangles, stone tablets, and keys. Purple triangles are the only items that are mandatory for completion and you only need to find half of them. They are displayed on the map, but are still difficult to find. If you don't want to spend countless hours prowling the world for an item, you won't have to. Finding what is necessary for completion is a fun task that gives you proper time to master the deep combat mechanics. But, if you were looking forward to losing yourself in Hyper Light Drifter intriguing world, trying to piece together an various elusive secrets, I suggest you tailor your expectations.After you have found all the purple triangles, the map is useless. The game doesn't aid in your search for the stone tablets and offers no help finding any of the 16 hidden keys. The environments are riddled with hidden passages, offscreen switches, and invisible platforms. If you are trying to collect everything prepare to run along every wall, every side of every platform, and to dash occasionally off a platform just...because...maybe...It starts to feel tedious. Burn every bush with a red candle.The exploration doesn't require any clever use of logic. There are no clues, no puzzles, and really no meaningful reward for end-game exploration. The items you get for finding these secrets are almost always cosmetic. They may boost, for example, the recharge time of your grenades, but nothing you find will alter the way you play the game or the way the game feels. It is a shame that a game with great mechanics fails to offer diversity within them. Only two upgrades, which I acquired quite early in the game, really gave me something new to experiment with, to practice. There is a NG+, where you have 2 hit points and a new outfit. If you are trying to find everything, NG+ is the same exploration with a handicap, but if you are looking for one final test of your combat skills, NG+ will definitely provide it.If you are looking for an indie action game to enjoy casually, a game that eases you into concepts and methods and presents an escalating series of challenges up until the end, this might not be the game for you. HLD is almost always a challenge. Even the earliest enemies have the potential to destroy an experienced player. Still, Hyper Light Drifter's atmosphere, world, and combat are all engaging enough to warrant a purchase and worth a good deal of hours spent exploring.			"

												If there was ever a game that needed to be recognized for it's genuine labor of love, it should by Hyper Light Drifter, a gorgeous RPG Roguelike that caught my eye many months ago.  I've waited for this baby to show up in the Steam Store, brutal and beautiful, and I was not disappointed by what I saw. In fact, I was quite the opposite - I was most certainly impressed.Read ahead and you too will have no choice but to purchase this DOUBLE fine game:WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME? GRAPHICS - Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ do you see these screenshots? They may be pixel art, but look at the meticulous attention to detail in the enviornment! I'm a sucker for good pixel art, and this game is pretty much the epitome of just that. It's like the developer was playing Dungeon of the Endless in his spare time and wanted to make an ode to Amplitude Studios or something. GAMEPLAY - Hard, but not unfair. The game plays as a explorative rogue-like with an RPG twist, and before I start rambling about how HUGE it is, let's point out exclusively that this game is HARD. You will die constantly if you have never practiced dodging everything on the screen with only a couple of health points to spare. But, it treats like the older brother you love - sternly, but lovingly. STORY - There are no words in this game. Imagine how hard it is to tell a good story with words. Now imagine doing the same thing, without words. Like Redford's movie All is Lost, this game is a marvel to look at through the art and interactions of various mute NPCs.WHAT'S MEDIOCRE ABOUT THIS GAME? STORY - Now, although the story is good to explore without words, the game is incredibly vague. You have an idea of what is going on with the corruption (if that's what it is?), but without any solid context, you are writing your own story as you good. I don't believe that was what the developer was going for, so he cut a little short here. Still, not too bad - you can still grasp the general idea of your blue hero. TUTORIAL - While I do not particularly enjoy the idea of giving mandatory tutorials, an optional one would've absolutely lovely. Or even a training course incorporated into your city hub. Because the monsters outside of said hub are unrelentless, I would've liked it if I, the noobie, could've practiced dodging shots and dashing side to side. Alas, I had to learn the hard way.WHAT'S BAD ABOUT THIS GAME? ART - Not the art design, execution, etc. but the fact that I don't know whether the thing I'm jump on is actually a ledge or just a decoration. I can jump on floating islands and boats, but is that lily pad a way to a secret? Nope, there goes a health point. Perhaps if the pointer changed colors or something to indicate that you can actually land on that texture, it would've been MASSIVELY helpful. For a game that's based on exploration, I find it unacceptable to have my hero drown himself over and over again because lilies are not made for standing.This is one of those few games that I did not have to wait for a sale to buy, and I recommend that you don't wait either. This is game is a blast, and it's always very rewarding to know that you have the mechanical skills (or will achieve them) to outfight, outdodge, and outwit your enemy. Plus, look at those BEAUTIFUL, EXPANSIVE pixel graphics. My eyes sparkle every time.9.5/10			"

												Can get annoying if you don't know where you are going. Just go up first, then right, then left then down.Combat is good fluent and quick.I didn't feel like this game was very hard, it was challenging and that's a good thing. Boss fights were really quick. Either you die quick or they die quick. The combat feels really good.The last section of the game felt like the best. Every step filled with enemys, many bossfights and the final boss fight was very good.6hr gameplay is maybe not enough for 20€ though. Updates are coming.			"

												Countless times I have seen games try to pull off that feeling of wonder or curiosity, only to disappoint when it finally releases. Hyper Light Drifter is an exception to this. Throughout playing I was constantly wondering what new things I would find to teach my about the world around me, as others may have as well. finding new costumes, keys, and a flurry of other secrets have led me to love this game for the short time it has been out. Hyper Light Drifter truly is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma from the expansive world presented to you and the lore of the titans that you see, scattered around the four corners of the world. guided by none other than your own curiousity, the game thrusts you in, with little context to your journey. faced with dire situations where enemies charge you and you have nothing but your wits, your sword, and your pistol to defend yourself. I wholeheartedly recommend Hyper Light Drifter and the story it tells to anyone and everyone. That is, if you can handle it.			"

												Beautiful pixel art and rouge-like(-like[1]) gameplay, this game is merciless yet quite fun!Soundtrack matches the dystopian, ominous/depressing tone, though there are some high ones some times.I will say the art in this is the best I've seen, pixel-wise, and I mostly bought it because of that alone.. and because, well, I believe in the guy who kicked this whole thing off. ^.^Bare-bones tutorial in the beginning, you figure out the rest. A story whose characters aren't explained, but rather has emotions seeping out of more juicy pixels in the form of very beautiful (and somewhat strange) ""cutscenes"".Combat is twitchy, always a do-or-die moment; you have to learn the patterns, get fast, get good, otherwise they will (greatly) overwhelm you, and you will either come out of it exilarated at 1 health or raging at your death having 2 med packs yet to spend.I recommend it, though not for the faint of heart; you will be murdered; you will rage; and you will probably get carpal-tonnel if you have a bad gamepad. But it, at the end of the day.. is a well made game indeed.[1]There are save points, per se, though you don't get to choose them.			"

												It's downright wonderful. The combat is tight, visceral, and satisfying. While upgrades to your weaponry can make things easier, there isn't any level wall, nor are there equipment specific areas. If you have the chops in terms of combat, you can go anywhere you like, and complete the game with only your starting gear. There are some enemies that are tough, especially when they have you outnumbered or you're low on health, but in general, the game is fair; albiet a bit difficult.The visuals are stunning, and the sound design is top notch.I'm a bit annoyed that Co-Op wasn't there from the start, but apparently the devs are working on releasing it, and I wouldn't have been upset if the game was marketed as single player from the start, so that's easily forgiven.I have no other qualifications; this game is worth it.

Posted: March 31, 2016
												Hyper Light Drifter is a game about a world; sure, there’s a lot of fighting and weapons and upgrades (and even a bit of football), but ultimately everything is about the world Heart Machine set out to create. And what a world it winds up being.You start off alone, in the mountains, and sick. Hyper Light Drifter is careful to make your sickness apparent, but never let it weigh you down. Immediately, your presence and purpose is set up – an indeterminate time ago, a catastrophe happened, and you’re at ground zero hoping to find a cure. It’s unclear exactly how you’ll find the cure, but the only hope is the technology of a civilization that destroyed itself.After briefly succumbing to illness, the Drifter wakes up in town, and takes their first steps into the unknown. You get scraps of information from the townspeople: someone of the Drifter’s race was mugged on their travels, the mysterious drifter who saved you has a penchant for defending the weak, and the key to finding the cure is in the center of town.And none of these stories are delivered via words – they are presented through carefully, lovingly drawn images of the events. All of the stories you’ll hear are like this: when you enter a new area, you’ll find out about the area boss’ history through visual recollections of their deeds; when you find a secluded survivor, their tragedy is rendered in detail more explicit than text can easily provide; when you run across the other drifter, he simply sketches on your map.But these encounters are rare. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a hostile and uncompromising one, which leaves you without friends or sources of information for most of your journey. To compensate, the world around you is the story. You’ll run across houses and people consumed by crystal, and you’ll see the corpses of giants in the distance that you eventually see up close later. As you go, you start to piece together a rough history of the world just by existing in it. Later, when you find that survivor, it provides just enough clarity to establish a foundation of lore, but doesn’t overwhelm what your imagination can come up with. In the end, how you experience Hyper Light Drifter – and, more importantly, how you perceive Hyper Light Drifter – becomes the narrative.It’s also possible to overlook survivors (though they don’t go anywhere, and can be discovered later), which can drastically affect your understanding of the world. The experience of having your own canon superseded by a game is not a common occurrence, but it’s a thrilling experience when pulled off properly. When my Drifter first set out, they were in a hurry to explore: as a player, I wanted to play; as a Drifter, I wanted a cure. As such, I paid little attention to the details around me, and carried out my task and left. When I came back after two more area bosses were defeated, I found the survivor I never spoke to, and all of the details I had overlooked previously were suddenly relevant and ominous.This only accounts for the surface, though. One elevator ride down, and you start finding entirely new fragments of lore that help you piece together what happened in this world. You see drifters that were killed – or possibly killed each other – in their quest to retrieve modules; you never learn the cause of their demise. Beyond a new source of narrative nuance, the buried laboratories help teach you one constant truth in Hyper Light Drifter: everything has a secret.The Drifter is more than proficient at fighting (though how proficient you, as a player are, is another story), so combat is a way to keep the stakes high while you fulfill your true purpose: exploring. You’ll find fake walls, invisible platforms, and cleverly hidden switches, all which take you to new resources, new story, new items, and new clues.And the best part? You won’t know any of this from the get-go. Even as a player who knew there would be secrets to look for, I overlooked several in the first area I went to. But the second area taught me a bit more about how the world of Hyper Light Drifter works, and by the end of the third, I knew a lot. On return, I found secrets I had easily overlooked – ones that didn’t even take upgraded abilities to reach.Which puts Hyper Light Drifter in a really interesting position: it’s Metroidvanian, in a sense, but it rarely gates off areas based on what abilities you have. Rather, Hyper Light Drifter gates off areas based on what you’ve learned about how the world is constructed. There are also gates that require specific areas to be cleared, but you would almost need precognition to find everything in an area your first time through, and that’s what makes exploring so enjoyable.This focus on exploration plays brilliantly with how the game presents its narrative, as you are required to explore to the best of your abilities, and encouraged to discover new ways to explore beyond what you’re used to. As such, you naturally run across tons of ponderous scenes, and uncovering well hidden ones feels extra special.Hyper Light Drifter, to me, is a lot of things: it’s Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, but as a game; it seems like a spiritual successor to Bokura no Taiyō; it’s beautiful sprite graphics in an age where sprite graphics are fading away; it’s ambiguous in its narrative in the best possible ways.Hyper Light Drifter is a game I’ve known I wanted since 2013 – but it’s also a game I’ve longed to see happen for longer than that.

												When I read comparisions on review sites, comparing this game to Dark Souls as one of the main quips about the game and it's difficulty. They're not entirely wrong; And I don't like Dark Souls.That said, I do like this game very much. Since I don't dig the whole ""prepare to die"" vibe in games, it affects how likely I am to pick up the controller and start up the game between sessions ( A controller is a must - keyboard mouse works but it's built a little more intuitive for controller. More fun too). And that sucks, because all of the art, music and design are so very delicate, awesome, all-engrossing that I really want to spend more time in it... and I know I will, just not all at once.To contrast the game comparisons, it plays closest to Bastion or Transistor. It plays very close to Transistor, but the upgrades are slow on the uptake (and don't really ""up""-grade, but alter your abilities). I dig the limited moves (~3) in the abilityset, it forces you to get creative and makes tackling even simple enemies fun.I'm sure this reads like a negative review. I'm still thinking about that part. Maybe the game makes us observe inward on the shortcomings and insecurities we feel about ourselves, allowing us to confront the worst parts of ourselves. But overall I like this game since I am a bit of a pushover when it comes to pixel post-apocalypta lone hero slashers. Disclosure: Not a backer, realized it was coming out a week ago and picked it up.			"

												A really fun game to be had here. Built around exploration and combat, with the most detailed bit of the story appearing in the store description. Anything that can be said in the game is shown with scenery, or described in colourful detail by the few NPCs you encounter. About the only time any English is used is in the menus and the tutorial, making it a lot more accessible to people who aren't as confident with their English language skills.There's a load of secrets to be found dotted around the world, hidden in such a way that you'll miss them the first or second time, then curse yourself out when you find out how to discover everything. The map's expansive to the point where you can easily forget where that one door you can finally unlock was situated, and trying to find a single item can be maddening if you opt to avoid guides.The combat is oodles of fun, being easy to learn and fun to master. Getting a feel for how much damage you can deal before you need to dodge away from enemy attacks makes fighting beasties enjoyable, even against hordes where timing can be difficult to gauge. And if sword-fighting is a questionable prospect, you can take pot-shots at enemies with any of a half-dozen guns you'll find throughout the world. Good luck aiming with a controller, mind - ""pot-shot"" is about the most accurate you can ask for when seconds spent aiming can allow enemies to take shots back at you, losing you some precious hit-points. Fighting bosses is a barrel of joy with the slash-slash-dodge-dodge gameplay; admittedly, their patterns can be easily sussed out, but their attacks are punishing enough that if you don't learn, you're going to get paddled.Whilst I've certainly gushed about the game, I'm sure you can infer from the previous paragraphs some of the problems I've had with the game. As well as the other problems, a couple of the minigames found in town demand some pretty ridiculous things out of the player, with one of them giving me flashbacks to Spyro 2 regarding its content and difficulty. There have also been times where I've managed to dash myself into locations I shouldn't be, but considering the teleport system, I'm willing to waive 'em.This last point is a minor one, though I have seen a LOT of negativity regarding it in certain locations - the game is programmed to run at 30FPS. I don't know why, and honestly, I don't care, since the game as a whole is rock-solid and easily worth the fifteen quid I put down for it.			"

												We all knew this was going to be a gorgeous and stunningly detailed pixel tour de force on the graphical front, but how does it play?  Like it was crafted by angels.The exploration is breath takingThe combat is fluid, responsive, challenging, and wholly addictive, almost like how I imagine a top down Dark Souls/Zelda love child would be.The music and is mysterious and sublime, perfectly crafting an atmosphere of wonder, anticipation and ominousness.  The non-verbal and obscure storytelling (which I won’t spoil) is pretty unique for this day and age, and I have been very impressed by the delivery of what little I have seen.It took me 11 hours to finish, and even then I didn't find all the secrets this game has.  I'll need to delve more through the mysterious world of HLD to find them all.I know some people have been moaning about the difficulty, esp the bosses, but i found it just right.  It is challenging and difficult, but never unfair; skill and precision are what you need to get through.  I'm not exactly a hardcore super gamer hero (i struggle through Dark souls and such)  but i found most bosses could fall between 5-10 tries.  You just have to be patiant, concentrate, and learn how to exploit them.  Also, the game is never punishing; after death, you start in the room just before you died with ALL the medikits you have ebfore you entered the room.  that's generousI've also heard a lot of whimpering about this being 30fps.  Cry me a river sweetheart.  It doesn't effect the gameplay, and if little princesses can't cope with 30fps, they shouldn't buy game.  There's been SO much footage of this game on the internet for years, so there's no excuse. I must admit, i would have loved 60fps on this, but lets not go overboard here.Its not a perfect game through.  its not alays clear what it in the foreground, and often i found mself falling of ledges that where blocked by scenery.  also, there's some hit-detection bugs, as i've been shot  through walls a few times, are sometimes a wall has blocked my melee attack but not an enemies.Overall, this is my second fav game of 2016 so far (Dark Souls 3 is currently king) and the best indie game imho since Bastion and Hotline Miami.  I really hope there will be a sequal or spiritual successor in the near future.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a game that I have been looking forward to playing for quite some time. I feared a little that my excitement for the game may cause disappointment when things didn't meet expectations, but I was pleasantly suprised by just how well executed everything turned out to be.The artstyle is simply gorgeous, done in an 8-bit style to extremely great effect; and combined with the well polished soundtrack, Hyper Light Drifter succeeds in reaching a very high overall quality. The gampeplay itself is quite engaging, with a large emphasis on evasion and hit-and-run tactics, which combined with the unforgiving health system, makes for plenty of very intense engagements. In addition, I beat every boss in the game (optional and mandatory), and every single one was very unique to fight.My only two complaints are quite minor. The first was that in doing a lot of exploring, I spent a lot of time listening to the one track associated with the area I was in. This was eased somewhat in the high overall quality of the soundtrack, but after some time looking around, listening to one theme the entire time did begin to grow a little stale.My second complaint was that I experienced a bug around bosses, where after reloading to try again, the game would autosave after I would use a medkit to bring my character to full health. This meant that each time I retried, I lost a medkit until I eventually had none left.Other than that though, this game was a pleasure to play through, and my seven hours to complete the game were very well spent.★★★☆☆			"

												Hyperlight drifter is actually a really fun game that reminds me of old zelda games. It has tons of exploration and lots of different ways to play and fight, the monsters are interesting and diverse, and the art style is simply beautiful. The only problem I had with the game was the 30fps cap that made it difficult to chain attacks properly, but the devs have updated the game to have 60fps and even added co-op. I highly recommend this game if you've got the cash to spare or see a sale on it.			"

												A really fun game to be had here. Built around exploration and combat, with the most detailed bit of the story appearing in the store description. Anything that can be said in the game is shown with scenery, or described in colourful detail by the few NPCs you encounter. About the only time any English is used is in the menus and the tutorial, making it a lot more accessible to people who aren't as confident with their English language skills.There's a load of secrets to be found dotted around the world, hidden in such a way that you'll miss them the first or second time, then curse yourself out when you find out how to discover everything. The map's expansive to the point where you can easily forget where that one door you can finally unlock was situated, and trying to find a single item can be maddening if you opt to avoid guides.The combat is oodles of fun, being easy to learn and fun to master. Getting a feel for how much damage you can deal before you need to dodge away from enemy attacks makes fighting beasties enjoyable, even against hordes where timing can be difficult to gauge. And if sword-fighting is a questionable prospect, you can take pot-shots at enemies with any of a half-dozen guns you'll find throughout the world. Good luck aiming with a controller, mind - ""pot-shot"" is about the most accurate you can ask for when seconds spent aiming can allow enemies to take shots back at you, losing you some precious hit-points. Fighting bosses is a barrel of joy with the slash-slash-dodge-dodge gameplay; admittedly, their patterns can be easily sussed out, but their attacks are punishing enough that if you don't learn, you're going to get paddled.Whilst I've certainly gushed about the game, I'm sure you can infer from the previous paragraphs some of the problems I've had with the game. As well as the other problems, a couple of the minigames found in town demand some pretty ridiculous things out of the player, with one of them giving me flashbacks to Spyro 2 regarding its content and difficulty. There have also been times where I've managed to dash myself into locations I shouldn't be, but considering the teleport system, I'm willing to waive 'em.This last point is a minor one, though I have seen a LOT of negativity regarding it in certain locations - the game is programmed to run at 30FPS. I don't know why, and honestly, I don't care, since the game as a whole is rock-solid and easily worth the fifteen quid I put down for it.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is beautiful.Mind blowingly beautiful, both visually and sonically.Let’s start with the visuals.This is the best pixel art I have ever seen in my life.Every facet of this game gushes style, it’s been crafted with so much love.Like I can't overstate that, this is easily the prettiest game I've seen in years.The soundtrack is amazing too.Every time I’d get to a new area and think “wow this looks really cool” the sound would kick in and floor me. The sound wasn’t just limited to specific events either. I found myself repeatedly idly exploring and realizing how subtly the sound was pulling me into the world.I could go on but rather than be like the endless flow of long winded steam reviews I’ll say this.This game is amazing. If you like exploratory dungeon crawlers like Zelda and you like hard games where learning patterns and skillfully fighting matters, like darksouls, this game is for you.For me, as of the time of writing this, this is the game of the year.Easiest 10/10 in ages. Please buy a copy. "

												If The Legend of Zelda and Hotline Miami had a child, and then that child was raised by Bloodborne and DmC (who show the child a lot of sci-fi and samurai films), the resulting adult might just be Hyper Light Drifter.Eye-popping visuals and otherworldly ambient sound mix with intense, twitchy combat to produce something both challenging and super satisfying. Only with a sharp eye and even sharper reflexes will you make it through HLD's strange and beautiful world alive.Like March-releasing indie darlings ""Ori and the Blind Forest"" and ""Axiom Verge"" before it, Hyper Light Drifter is an instant classic.

												I supported this game on Kickstarter, and it exceeded my expectations. It's pretty, it's challenging, it lasts just long enough to not outstay its welcome. The lack of handholding is unforgiving, but as long as you explore a bit to buy two or three combat skills before you try defeating a boss, you'll be fine.			"

												This is a an incredible game. The combat is about dodging avoiding and then striking. The game is very much like a Zelda title but improving on everything. WIth that said, there isn't any puzzle elements but there is a lot of hidden areas. Some of those areas are somewhat like a Zelda title where you need an item, in this case a gun to shoot a pillar to open a secret area. The secret areas in this game is incredibly vast making it fun to explore and the the four areas being it north, east, south, and west have their own unique design and enemies.I highly recommend the game. If you want a story driven title, this won't be for you. The narrative is weak and seems to be up for interpetation. It does have a great sense of atmosphere and wonder. There are characters that will talk to you but through pictures. The music is good and unique. It feels near perfect in blending in with the world.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter presents a beautiful world that is reminiscent of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. The storytelling is fequently environmental and subtle, allowing your imagination to draw you into the rich world created by the developers. Combat can be tough, relying on player skill and ability to both react quickly and intelligently to enemy types and environments. However, this just makes victory all the more enjoyable and encourages elegant approaches to battle rather than button mashing. This game is a masterpiece, don't be afraid to explore the hidden corners of the world it contains.			"

												TL;DR Great game, great graphics.Bosses are very hard but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early.Really enjoying my time with this game. I expected it to be a 4-6 hours ""linear"" story but it actually has a somewhat open world and 0 hand holding. First issue I had is that the game doesn't explain anything to you, nothing is in english and nobody speaks english in the game. Until I started playing it was quite hard to understand what all of the things you see mean. For example, the main objective of the game is explained by a hologram where you have 3 images and you don't even know what those 3 images even are until you start actually playing the game.The game has 0 hand holding, meaning you are put into this world, you get somewhat of an explaination about what you have to do and you can go anywhere you want. There are 4 ""areas"" in which you have to gather some kind of shards that will later I guess activate this thing that is in center of your ""hub"" area. What I like is that the game doesn't tell you ""go here first"" but rather ""pick any of these paths"".One thing that is really bothering me is the aiming with the weapons. I personally don't use controllers that often and this game is certainly designed to be played with one because I encountered some weird stuff going on with keyboard an mouse.I would like if there was some kind of aim assist or actually lock on mode. The game lets you shoot your weapons without aiming as long as you are pointing the desired direction but in middle of the battle you definitely have no time to aim and let alone orient yourself towards enemies. Another thing worth pointing out is the fact that bosses are insanely hard, but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early on. Because the game lets you explore the whole map I think it wants you to gather upgrade points and get some skills and then go and engage the bosses because going in without a single skill is pretty much suicide. Bosses have insane amount of health while you have only 5 hp and there are hits that do like 3 points of damage, knocks you down and by the time you get up you are dead. I am going to see if the boss battles get any easier later down the road when you get some skills and upgrades but other than that and the aiming I am really enjoying the game.UPDATE:Finally managed to beat 1 boss. Took me like 1 hour... It honestly isn't as hard as it is more developing a tactic and timing your hits/dashes.			"

												Imagine a Zelda game set in the future. Then pump that up to ELEVEN.In Hyper Light Drifter you play a nameless wandering soldier with a sword on a quest of unknown purpose, plagued by an unknown illness and haunted by nightmares of death and destruction. You aren't given a clear picture of the goal, or even what you should do NEXT most of the time, but that's okay. Much like a classic Zelda game, you have freedom to explore and do as you please, and discover new secrets for yourself, and there are a TON.The game is also much more action-packed. From the start you are equipped with a ""dash"" function which can be spammed as often as desired (although there is a slight pause after using it 3 times in a row). The primary function of this dash is to let your character leap over short gaps between platforms, but it's also quite useful for dodging and weaving through the battlefield, approaching enemies for the kill and making a quick escape from a big attack. Players will be encouraged to use the dash as much as desired, and mastery will result in some of the flashiest, high-speed ninja fights ever seen in a Zelda-style game!There are shops in town that sell you incredible but not-altogether-necessary upgrades, such as new moves you can do with your sword, more ammo for your guns (THERE ARE GUNS BY THE WAY), and a grenade to add to your movekit.Heavy on story and gameplay with absolutely no dialogue (the game foregoes dialogue in favor of imagery), freedom of exploration reminiscent of oldschool Zelda games and some high-intensity action-packed combat for you hack-and-slash nuts, although calling it that is a dis-service as lack of care or thought given to when and how you move and strike will leave you dead. But, anyway, the game is amazing, okay?Did I mention it's difficult? Punishingly so, at times, but in a good way that makes you feel like you're learning how to do something each time you 'die'.If I have one piece of advice for you, it's start in the east. When you beat it, you get a shotgun!!!			"

												HLD is a beautiful game and very fun to play. Like many of other reviewers have said it plays a lot like the classic Zelda, and they're right. This game also plays much like Spiral Knights to thoughs who have played. It is difficult, but not unfair. Mastering the combat mechanics takes some time but rewarding and fun. The story is hard to follow and will sometimes have you question what is actually going on. What I do understand of the story is pretty cool and interesting. Overall, this game is super immersive and is completely worth $20 of content and enjoyment.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed: zelda, dark souls, spiral knights,  and/or super metroid.			"

												I have a hard time getting engaged with retro and pixel graphics games. Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) somehow has managed to grab my full attention. With the fitting music, ease of control, and threat of enemies keeping me engaged in what I'm doing, HLD is suddenly one of my favorite games.HLD is commonly reported as too difficult. I have experienced some frustration but even playing with a mouse + keyboard the game is really more about not overextending. Bosses are difficult with mouse + keyboard as the dash ability benefits from analog precision but the first boss isn't that hard...died roughly 10 times because I was newbish, using keyboard, and not following the boss cues.The story is purely without text and the UI has no text so I don't know what I'm doing exactly. The pictures portray the NPC story well however the ultimate end, why, who are unclear.The gripes I have with HLD are my own and not a real fault for HLD. First there are so many secrets around that I find myself running along walls so not to miss something (most secrets are marked but not all). Sometimes I enter a new space where the enemies spawn off screen and get free pot shots as they enter. There are long term locked doors scattered around that can't be passed until you've got more of the game completed so don't forget where you saw those doors...Combat is fluid and easy to pick up. Enemies are diverse and the maps alter your options and often give opportunity to look like you planned the whole fight.HLD is great fun with the right amount of challenge. Even if you don't appreciate retro or pixel games check it out; I'm surprised how much I enjoy HLD			"

I was rediculously close to quitting near the beginning of the game, but once I figured out what I was doing and how to play the game properly, it became infinetly more fun. The atmosphere is very engaging, the music is calming yet fitting (probably neccessary for how difficult and rage-inducing this game can be after clearing most of a room and dying), and overall it executed everything it was trying to do seamlessly. It controls like a dream with a controller, but I can only imagine what it would be like with a mouse and keyboard , as I don't dare try it. Worth the purchase if you enjoy a Hack and Slash game with beautiful art style that doesn't hold your hand throughout.			"

												This game is the pure definition of ""struggle"", in both tricky scenarios that the game puts you through, as well as the dialouge-free story that it conveys to the player. Dying goes from a set back to an oppurtunity to try again, and again, and again, until you finally advance after hours of pattern memorization and just plain luck. The vibrant colors mask the bleak atmosphere and surreal visuals the game provides, making it just as terrifying as it is mysterious when you come across more and more of the world. Laslty, the ending perfectly ties the pieces to it all, though it takes some deeper reading and exploration to really understand (this game has a lot of plot related secrets), and serves as an emotional payoff to all the hardwork you did. My only gripe is that the new game plus adds a sort of faux-difficulty by simply lowering your health, though it is only a bonus for most diehard completionists. All in all, Hyper Light Drifter is an solid game that deserves a spot as a Game of the Year, at least for me.			"

												Based off my opinion and could be view differently.I watched this game since it came up on kickstarter and was always intertested in it and this is for sure one my favorite games of this year. That being said, its also very much not what I expected and is kinda darksoulys but I would say its easier. So that really didn't effect me too much, and I'm not dissappointed.Pros:-Tons secrets and collectables -Complex gameplay for certain combos -Open world where you can start anywhere, and go anywhere you like. (except South for reasons)-Beautiful pixel art-Fun combat-Boss fights are satisfying and oldschool meaning they have a pattern, and stronger/faster lower they get.-Decently long, While I took my time with this game and explorer as much as I can or wanted and lasted me about 8-10 hours.-Can builds your character to your playstyle meaning you can go all guns blazing, or focus on combos, and if feel like its  too hard you can get more health pots.Mixed (Meaning depends on the person):-Darksouls like and evil at times and very harsh to the player-Some secrets are insane and require tons of skill not just brains-Health can be hard to come back if you don't explore  -Story is not expressed through words and can be very confusing at times.Cons-(Due to bugs this is a temporary point) You can be set back during certain boss fights or mini bosses and its pretty annoying to get back there.-Harsh save points, meaning you can get set back to very beginning the dungeon in certain places and have to redo secrets and insane fights.-Not explorering is very punishing-Some bosses are little too harsh and have to do perfect timing to dodge.-Healing animation feels a tad too long at points in the game.

												Hyper Light Drifter is the first game I backed on Kickstarter that's been released and I didn't regret backing. My only real complaint is that I feel it's too short – but I suppose that's better than being too long.The combat is great. After playing the Kickstarter demo late last year, I was unsure of if it was going to be too much of a challenge for me, but I had since acquired a controller and it made a huge difference. The combat is punishingly hard, but not unfairly so – every time I died in this game I knew I had screwed up, that I zigged when I should have zagged. I've read a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls and haven't played those games, but I imagine this is what people mean. In a few cases I wish some of the bosses were a bit harder.As far as the exploration aspects go, the game holds your hand just enough to propel you to the ending. If you want more, to see what's behing those mysterious doors you can't open, to get to those areas just off the edge of your screen, you're going to have to work at it. I've seen some comparisons to Zelda here, but if anything I wish Zelda games were a bit more like HLD.I loved the vibe of this game. Everything from the color scheme and depicition of a world of ancient ruins whose origins we'll never know, the lack of any words or dialog to explain what's going on, and Disasterpeace's amazing soundtrack all fit together to make a world I didn't want to leave.

It is mostly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: A Link To the Past, from my personal experience.The game has a beautiful pixel art style, especially the background. And it is well-animated, resulting in tight-but-fluid controls.The gameplay is fast paced but also requires the player to time their attacks and dodges carefully.The enemy designs are simple mostly, but the game always pit you in a room filled with them.This makes the game quite high in difficulty.Another thing that adds to the difficulty is the level design. It's not BAD, but most of the problems I faced is that I often get lost, and the map is not in any way helpful. And looking for secrets in previous stages are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game lacks text, or in-game hints and guides. There are some, but then they give you too much freedom from the beginning of the game.This game, in my opinion, is linear. The ""freedom"" they gave you only delays your progress. It's good that they give you the freedom to explore, but it doesn't work if there is only one new place you can go at a time. Freedom in games, in my opinion only works if the game is open world, and this game is not open world.The soundtrack in this game is weird. I can't even say if it's good or bad. But it is off in most places and situation, with exceptions of some levels. Let's just say I had to turn off the ingame music, and opening my own music software for the BGM. But that's just me though.In conclusion, this game has great pixel art style, gameplay is very good and level designs are okay. The only things that turned me off was  the ingame music, and the hassle of not knowing where to actually go next to progress, due to the vague guide and lack of text. I do recommend this game, but only to those who wants the challenge and also appreciates beautiful pixel art, like I do.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is everything I wanted it to be. I have been waiting for a game like this since Bit.Trip Runner, which may not make a lot of sense, but let me explain.Bit. Trip Runner is an absorbing game. You must focus at all times, as there is always an obstacle coming right up ahead. The rhythm aspect goes very well with it, as every obstacle you clear makes a sound adding to the music playing, and the music adding another layer of melody to the song every time you collect a core. It's very difficult, very satisfying, and very absorbing.Hyper Light Drifter accomplishes this is a whole new way.It's not a rhythm game, and it's not a platformer. It's an open-world adventure game collectathon. The absorbingness (I know that's not a word) is accomplished by--The environment-The tight and very satisfying combat-The unclear (but clearable) storyline-The soundThe environment is bursting with life. If someone told me this game was made with a level making tool, I would deny it until they proved it.The combat is very challenging and very satisfying. Every enemy poses a different threat, and it's easy to charge them when they're alone, but you must think about the situation fast when multiple enemies of differing types block  your path.The ""cutscenes"" usually consist of images or certain characters/enemies attacking the Drifter, yet he always seems to survive. The story is very vague, but if you're up for some translation, you can solve the mysteries.The sound is cinematic. One particular moment that struck me was while I was climbing a mountain, and I reached a vantage point to view the mountain, and I saw a giant being frozen in time, perfectly matching my emotion as the sound suddenly changes to a deeper, louder tone.Another thing is the rumbling on beat to the heartbeat when you get to really low health. I really like that one.I find myself yelling ""No!"" when I die during a crucial moment, I'm that invested in it. Now, if you don't like collectathons, don't immediately dismiss this game; you don't need to collect very much to progress the story. Now, if you are a big fan of this game (like myself), you want to explore all the nooks and crannies, and really see the world this game hides from you. If you have an eye for secrets in video games, you will have a hayday discovering all the secret paths and invisible floors.Get dis game :D			"

												This is a an incredible game. The combat is about dodging avoiding and then striking. The game is very much like a Zelda title but improving on everything. WIth that said, there isn't any puzzle elements but there is a lot of hidden areas. Some of those areas are somewhat like a Zelda title where you need an item, in this case a gun to shoot a pillar to open a secret area. The secret areas in this game is incredibly vast making it fun to explore and the the four areas being it north, east, south, and west have their own unique design and enemies.I highly recommend the game. If you want a story driven title, this won't be for you. The narrative is weak and seems to be up for interpetation. It does have a great sense of atmosphere and wonder. There are characters that will talk to you but through pictures. The music is good and unique. It feels near perfect in blending in with the world.			"

												I purchased the game at full price, I was that sure this game would be good and I was not dissapointed.I came into this game starving myself of what was inside of it. I did this because in a review I heard that it's got a big story with no words spoken, so I didn't want to spoil anything. The combat is amazing, even if my computer can only handle 20fps at times. I believe the best (and worst) part about the game is the ability to do local co-op. It's great in the sense that you can hotseat with whoever it is you want, but the only bad is that my computer doesn't like to run it too well :xGo ahead and pick up the game, it's a pleasant surprise waiting for me to come back to in college.

			This is my first review, so any comments on how to improve would be greatly appreciated. Today I looked at Hyper Light Drifter a game released by Heart Machine for PC and Mac on March 31st 2016,...		

Essentially I really enjoyed the game and think it's worth it for full price. Everything is just so good, though the gameplay can sometimes become unfair and the story is tricky to decipher. Still, I reccomend it to the fullest.			"

												TL;DR Great game, great graphics.Bosses are very hard but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early.Really enjoying my time with this game. I expected it to be a 4-6 hours ""linear"" story but it actually has a somewhat open world and 0 hand holding. First issue I had is that the game doesn't explain anything to you, nothing is in english and nobody speaks english in the game. Until I started playing it was quite hard to understand what all of the things you see mean. For example, the main objective of the game is explained by a hologram where you have 3 images and you don't even know what those 3 images even are until you start actually playing the game.The game has 0 hand holding, meaning you are put into this world, you get somewhat of an explaination about what you have to do and you can go anywhere you want. There are 4 ""areas"" in which you have to gather some kind of shards that will later I guess activate this thing that is in center of your ""hub"" area. What I like is that the game doesn't tell you ""go here first"" but rather ""pick any of these paths"".One thing that is really bothering me is the aiming with the weapons. I personally don't use controllers that often and this game is certainly designed to be played with one because I encountered some weird stuff going on with keyboard an mouse.I would like if there was some kind of aim assist or actually lock on mode. The game lets you shoot your weapons without aiming as long as you are pointing the desired direction but in middle of the battle you definitely have no time to aim and let alone orient yourself towards enemies. Another thing worth pointing out is the fact that bosses are insanely hard, but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early on. Because the game lets you explore the whole map I think it wants you to gather upgrade points and get some skills and then go and engage the bosses because going in without a single skill is pretty much suicide. Bosses have insane amount of health while you have only 5 hp and there are hits that do like 3 points of damage, knocks you down and by the time you get up you are dead. I am going to see if the boss battles get any easier later down the road when you get some skills and upgrades but other than that and the aiming I am really enjoying the game.UPDATE:Finally managed to beat 1 boss. Took me like 1 hour... It honestly isn't as hard as it is more developing a tactic and timing your hits/dashes.			"

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The art is amazing, the music fits perfectly, the gameplay is super snappy. It encourages you to explore and doesn't do much hand-holding. The upgrades you eventually get make a world of difference in how you think about defeating enemies. The atmosphere of the game is mysterious and alien, which is perfect.If I were to criticize anything about this game it would be its difficulty. Granted I haven't played the game since close to launch, and I've heard it's possible some balance issues have been changed, at the time it was extremely difficult. For me, I enjoy challenging games that make you have to plan your boss fights and manage your restorative abilities. So in my personal opinion the difficulty barrier was a fun aspect. But I realize the vast majority of people who had a problem with this game mainly focused on its difficulty. They *wanted* to like the game for all of its other amazing qualities, but just couldn't get past an enemy, or an area, or especially a boss, and just gave up.Still, everything about this game is awesome. You can tell a lot of thought was put into almost every little detail and I love games like that. Grats on such a wonderful game, Heart Machine!			"

												This game is a gem. I would say the exploration is geometrically unique, dense, boundry driven; it's like exploring a painting versus feeling like you're walking through a Zelda open field. If you have never heard of this game, and you know nothing about it- congratulations, you are going to experience this amazing game the way the creators probably intended an audience to experience it... with surprise, joy and a sense of mystery. I'm jealous of you. Please, don't spoil it, just figure it out and be challenged. I recommend buying it immediately and playing it if a Zelda like ARPG is your thing.  Welcome to something new and made with so much careful, meticulous crafting and yes, actual love. Enjoy :-)			"

												Imagine a Zelda game set in the future. Then pump that up to ELEVEN.In Hyper Light Drifter you play a nameless wandering soldier with a sword on a quest of unknown purpose, plagued by an unknown illness and haunted by nightmares of death and destruction. You aren't given a clear picture of the goal, or even what you should do NEXT most of the time, but that's okay. Much like a classic Zelda game, you have freedom to explore and do as you please, and discover new secrets for yourself, and there are a TON.The game is also much more action-packed. From the start you are equipped with a ""dash"" function which can be spammed as often as desired (although there is a slight pause after using it 3 times in a row). The primary function of this dash is to let your character leap over short gaps between platforms, but it's also quite useful for dodging and weaving through the battlefield, approaching enemies for the kill and making a quick escape from a big attack. Players will be encouraged to use the dash as much as desired, and mastery will result in some of the flashiest, high-speed ninja fights ever seen in a Zelda-style game!There are shops in town that sell you incredible but not-altogether-necessary upgrades, such as new moves you can do with your sword, more ammo for your guns (THERE ARE GUNS BY THE WAY), and a grenade to add to your movekit.Heavy on story and gameplay with absolutely no dialogue (the game foregoes dialogue in favor of imagery), freedom of exploration reminiscent of oldschool Zelda games and some high-intensity action-packed combat for you hack-and-slash nuts, although calling it that is a dis-service as lack of care or thought given to when and how you move and strike will leave you dead. But, anyway, the game is amazing, okay?Did I mention it's difficult? Punishingly so, at times, but in a good way that makes you feel like you're learning how to do something each time you 'die'.If I have one piece of advice for you, it's start in the east. When you beat it, you get a shotgun!!!			"

												I have a hard time getting engaged with retro and pixel graphics games. Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) somehow has managed to grab my full attention. With the fitting music, ease of control, and threat of enemies keeping me engaged in what I'm doing, HLD is suddenly one of my favorite games.HLD is commonly reported as too difficult. I have experienced some frustration but even playing with a mouse + keyboard the game is really more about not overextending. Bosses are difficult with mouse + keyboard as the dash ability benefits from analog precision but the first boss isn't that hard...died roughly 10 times because I was newbish, using keyboard, and not following the boss cues.The story is purely without text and the UI has no text so I don't know what I'm doing exactly. The pictures portray the NPC story well however the ultimate end, why, who are unclear.The gripes I have with HLD are my own and not a real fault for HLD. First there are so many secrets around that I find myself running along walls so not to miss something (most secrets are marked but not all). Sometimes I enter a new space where the enemies spawn off screen and get free pot shots as they enter. There are long term locked doors scattered around that can't be passed until you've got more of the game completed so don't forget where you saw those doors...Combat is fluid and easy to pick up. Enemies are diverse and the maps alter your options and often give opportunity to look like you planned the whole fight.HLD is great fun with the right amount of challenge. Even if you don't appreciate retro or pixel games check it out; I'm surprised how much I enjoy HLD			"

This game also plays much like Spiral Knights to thoughs who have played. It is difficult, but not unfair. Mastering the combat mechanics takes some time but rewarding and fun. The story is hard to follow and will sometimes have you question what is actually going on. What I do understand of the story is pretty cool and interesting.

												This game is the pure definition of ""struggle"", in both tricky scenarios that the game puts you through, as well as the dialouge-free story that it conveys to the player. Dying goes from a set back to an oppurtunity to try again, and again, and again, until you finally advance after hours of pattern memorization and just plain luck. The vibrant colors mask the bleak atmosphere and surreal visuals the game provides, making it just as terrifying as it is mysterious when you come across more and more of the world. Laslty, the ending perfectly ties the pieces to it all, though it takes some deeper reading and exploration to really understand (this game has a lot of plot related secrets), and serves as an emotional payoff to all the hardwork you did. My only gripe is that the new game plus adds a sort of faux-difficulty by simply lowering your health, though it is only a bonus for most diehard completionists. All in all, Hyper Light Drifter is an solid game that deserves a spot as a Game of the Year, at least for me.			"

												Based off my opinion and could be view differently.I watched this game since it came up on kickstarter and was always intertested in it and this is for sure one my favorite games of this year. That being said, its also very much not what I expected and is kinda darksoulys but I would say its easier. So that really didn't effect me too much, and I'm not dissappointed.Pros:-Tons secrets and collectables -Complex gameplay for certain combos -Open world where you can start anywhere, and go anywhere you like. (except South for reasons)-Beautiful pixel art-Fun combat-Boss fights are satisfying and oldschool meaning they have a pattern, and stronger/faster lower they get.-Decently long, While I took my time with this game and explorer as much as I can or wanted and lasted me about 8-10 hours.-Can builds your character to your playstyle meaning you can go all guns blazing, or focus on combos, and if feel like its  too hard you can get more health pots.Mixed (Meaning depends on the person):-Darksouls like and evil at times and very harsh to the player-Some secrets are insane and require tons of skill not just brains-Health can be hard to come back if you don't explore  -Story is not expressed through words and can be very confusing at times.Cons-(Due to bugs this is a temporary point) You can be set back during certain boss fights or mini bosses and its pretty annoying to get back there.-Harsh save points, meaning you can get set back to very beginning the dungeon in certain places and have to redo secrets and insane fights.-Not explorering is very punishing-Some bosses are little too harsh and have to do perfect timing to dodge.-Healing animation feels a tad too long at points in the game.

												Hyper Light Drifter is the first game I backed on Kickstarter that's been released and I didn't regret backing. My only real complaint is that I feel it's too short – but I suppose that's better than being too long.The combat is great. After playing the Kickstarter demo late last year, I was unsure of if it was going to be too much of a challenge for me, but I had since acquired a controller and it made a huge difference. The combat is punishingly hard, but not unfairly so – every time I died in this game I knew I had screwed up, that I zigged when I should have zagged. I've read a lot of comparisons to Dark Souls and haven't played those games, but I imagine this is what people mean. In a few cases I wish some of the bosses were a bit harder.As far as the exploration aspects go, the game holds your hand just enough to propel you to the ending. If you want more, to see what's behing those mysterious doors you can't open, to get to those areas just off the edge of your screen, you're going to have to work at it. I've seen some comparisons to Zelda here, but if anything I wish Zelda games were a bit more like HLD.I loved the vibe of this game. Everything from the color scheme and depicition of a world of ancient ruins whose origins we'll never know, the lack of any words or dialog to explain what's going on, and Disasterpeace's amazing soundtrack all fit together to make a world I didn't want to leave.

The atmosphere is brilliantly designed and further instills a sense of wonder.The actual gameplay is fairly challenging, but with practice it becomes very fast and elegant. In addition, having an eye for secrets and a sense for exploration is often very rewarding in this game.

												Come in for the gorgeous pixel art, stay for the brutal combatand the Zelda-like exploration aspect,and the otherworldly music by disasterpeace,and all the hidden collectibles,and the glorious chain dash,and the North Boss which I can't beat,and the fact that this game managed to tell a story without uttering a single word on screen.I'm staying here indefinitely. Hyper Light Drifter is a masterpiece.			"

												I don't like writing reveiws, think that no one will bother reading them, but this...is a thing i must write about.It is not nescessary for something to be hyper realistic and jaw droppingly good looking to be considered a masterpiece. Hyperlight drifter is such a thing. It is a 2D, pixelated, hack n' slash, platformer taking place on a post apocalipty earth-like planet. War over the mysterious energy source discovered/ or created by the mysterious race of ""Librarians"" ravaged the land. What these creatures had left behind now haunts the surviving outscirts of other four (Bird-,otter-,rakoon-,lizard-like humanoid) races. Travel through four regions and discover a great history of once glorious civilizations, while though naration of absolutely no word spoken, not even written visiuals while the story is open for interpretation.Gameplay.Gameplay is simple and straightforward yet challenging, every enemy needs their special approach or they might overwhelm you. They have health bars with squares (each square represents how many hits they can take). You have a sword and six types of guns (Unlocked after deafiting bosses). Each gun usess up ammo you get from destroying the enemy or breakable items. It also includes special dashes allowing player to get from platfrom to platform, or to travel quickly (Can be upgreaded by hidden golden chips). The mechanics are unique, but i'll leave it up to you to discover.World. The World feels ""Alive"", almost every level, every little location or hidden section tells it's own unwritten tragic story for player to discover. I do believe that not one night was put into the design. Audio is miraculous and lovable with music that seemingly is a cacauphony alone, but turns into a symphony combined with visuals and other sounds. Every sector has its own original music. Evemies are original and every single one has their own characteristics and unique looks, guaranteed to stay fresh and new. I beat that game in three days and already managed to form my own theories of it. Yet what i have to say about it is how almost every item in the game is hidden and by a sheer luck or a guide one can find it, it dries my blood!StoryThe story is left open for interpretaiton, as it is told through visions, enviroments and pictures that appear next to characters when you speak to them. Every character is unique and likable.Verdict.The game is worth EVERY single penny you spend, Great world, great characters, great audio, Great enemis, nice combat but frustratig exploration, just be ready for that. P.s What IGN was unfair in was that they gave HLD 7.6 and one of the cons was ""Abstract story telling"" while the same company Used the same thing as pro on a game called ""Inside"". Personally I think this type storrytelling is its pride, the great story given...no word spoken...No subtitles tu read no long cutscenes to see. Only action and a bit of back tracking.9/10 "

												After 16h I finished the game, I felt sad, sad for this history to end, sad to leave this amazing world that showed so much with so few words.Hyper Light Drifter is an amazing game that almost fell apart due to some technical shortcomings.Let’s get to the bad first:-	 This is an action game locked to 30fps. I think that all games running at 60 fps give us a better experience, versus running at 30fps. That’s not to say 30fps is unplayable, but is a fact.  (Update 20160927 - Devs released a 60 fps build)-	While playing 90% of the game using my xbox360 controller, I always felt the dashing was easier and more responsive using KB+M. I don’t know if this was due to the 30fps lock or no. But the parts of the game where you need to dash like crazy, where made using KB+M.-	Lack of directions plays good for the most part, but can get you frustrated if you stumble into a difficulty spike.Now the good:-	Art Direction: Oh my god, what a beautiful world, I can’t call this retro style, the only thing retro is the resolution, and everything else is PIXEL ART at its finest!-	Music: For the most part simplistic, but setting the tone along the journey.-	Combat: Even locked at 30fps, the combat always felt great, with every enemy careful introduced until you starts to face all of them together, and you starts to dance around then, “a dance of dead”.-	History: Story without words, only art and context. I ended the game caving for more, needing to know more about this world, how it came to be. But I’m glad with the direction they choose, always leaving me hanging for the next screen.I just want to leave a note about exploration: You need to explore to find the secrets, but you always felt imposed to hug every wall, every corner to find then. I think they should have chosen another mechanic for this, leaving a few secretes well hidden, but the rest (the majority) in a way where the scenario hinted us for they existence.If you like to explore a mysterious world and fight like a samurai; and can cope with the 30fps lock , go for it. Hyper Light Drifter is amazing!			"

												My oversimplified review of Hyper Light Drifter is - imagine the combat and graphics of Crawl mashed up with the world exploration and story of Ori and the Blind Forest. It's a very simple, straightforwad game that marks a lot of boxes in terms of amazing game design and concise yet satisfying storytelling. VERY low amount of instruction, and the design does a great job making sure you get a handle of the controls and movement just moments after starting. From what I understand, the game is also non-linear, which is my favorite part so far. The soundtrack is also incredible. Very ambient and compliments the world tremendously. Disasterpeace never fails to impress.The only con I see in this game is difficulty and how dying is handled. The difficulty can spike in certain areas in terms of platforming and combat. This isn't too bad because you have infinite lives. HOWEVER, every time you die, there is a 3-5 second animation that plays when your character respawns. I know it doesn't sound like an inconvenience, but in areas where you are constantly dying from trying to figure out a platforming puzzle, it makes for a bit of a frustrating experience. As far as I know there is no way to skip this animation.(EDIT: You can now hold down A and X to speed up the respawn animation!)EXTRA NOTE: As of writing this, Steam says I have 7.6 hours of this game logged. I'd like to let it be known that about 2 hours of that was spent trying to reach 800 chain dashes in the dash shop area. I finally accomplished it. I have no regrets.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a game about a world; sure, there’s a lot of fighting and weapons and upgrades (and even a bit of football), but ultimately everything is about the world Heart Machine set out to create. And what a world it winds up being.You start off alone, in the mountains, and sick. Hyper Light Drifter is careful to make your sickness apparent, but never let it weigh you down. Immediately, your presence and purpose is set up – an indeterminate time ago, a catastrophe happened, and you’re at ground zero hoping to find a cure. It’s unclear exactly how you’ll find the cure, but the only hope is the technology of a civilization that destroyed itself.After briefly succumbing to illness, the Drifter wakes up in town, and takes their first steps into the unknown. You get scraps of information from the townspeople: someone of the Drifter’s race was mugged on their travels, the mysterious drifter who saved you has a penchant for defending the weak, and the key to finding the cure is in the center of town.And none of these stories are delivered via words – they are presented through carefully, lovingly drawn images of the events. All of the stories you’ll hear are like this: when you enter a new area, you’ll find out about the area boss’ history through visual recollections of their deeds; when you find a secluded survivor, their tragedy is rendered in detail more explicit than text can easily provide; when you run across the other drifter, he simply sketches on your map.But these encounters are rare. The world of Hyper Light Drifter is a hostile and uncompromising one, which leaves you without friends or sources of information for most of your journey. To compensate, the world around you is the story. You’ll run across houses and people consumed by crystal, and you’ll see the corpses of giants in the distance that you eventually see up close later. As you go, you start to piece together a rough history of the world just by existing in it. Later, when you find that survivor, it provides just enough clarity to establish a foundation of lore, but doesn’t overwhelm what your imagination can come up with. In the end, how you experience Hyper Light Drifter – and, more importantly, how you perceive Hyper Light Drifter – becomes the narrative.It’s also possible to overlook survivors (though they don’t go anywhere, and can be discovered later), which can drastically affect your understanding of the world. The experience of having your own canon superseded by a game is not a common occurrence, but it’s a thrilling experience when pulled off properly. When my Drifter first set out, they were in a hurry to explore: as a player, I wanted to play; as a Drifter, I wanted a cure. As such, I paid little attention to the details around me, and carried out my task and left. When I came back after two more area bosses were defeated, I found the survivor I never spoke to, and all of the details I had overlooked previously were suddenly relevant and ominous.This only accounts for the surface, though. One elevator ride down, and you start finding entirely new fragments of lore that help you piece together what happened in this world. You see drifters that were killed – or possibly killed each other – in their quest to retrieve modules; you never learn the cause of their demise. Beyond a new source of narrative nuance, the buried laboratories help teach you one constant truth in Hyper Light Drifter: everything has a secret.The Drifter is more than proficient at fighting (though how proficient you, as a player are, is another story), so combat is a way to keep the stakes high while you fulfill your true purpose: exploring. You’ll find fake walls, invisible platforms, and cleverly hidden switches, all which take you to new resources, new story, new items, and new clues.And the best part? You won’t know any of this from the get-go. Even as a player who knew there would be secrets to look for, I overlooked several in the first area I went to. But the second area taught me a bit more about how the world of Hyper Light Drifter works, and by the end of the third, I knew a lot. On return, I found secrets I had easily overlooked – ones that didn’t even take upgraded abilities to reach.Which puts Hyper Light Drifter in a really interesting position: it’s Metroidvanian, in a sense, but it rarely gates off areas based on what abilities you have. Rather, Hyper Light Drifter gates off areas based on what you’ve learned about how the world is constructed. There are also gates that require specific areas to be cleared, but you would almost need precognition to find everything in an area your first time through, and that’s what makes exploring so enjoyable.This focus on exploration plays brilliantly with how the game presents its narrative, as you are required to explore to the best of your abilities, and encouraged to discover new ways to explore beyond what you’re used to. As such, you naturally run across tons of ponderous scenes, and uncovering well hidden ones feels extra special.Hyper Light Drifter, to me, is a lot of things: it’s Nausica of the Valley of the Wind, but as a game; it seems like a spiritual successor to Bokura no Taiyō; it’s beautiful sprite graphics in an age where sprite graphics are fading away; it’s ambiguous in its narrative in the best possible ways.Hyper Light Drifter is a game I’ve known I wanted since 2013 – but it’s also a game I’ve longed to see happen for longer than that.

												It's downright wonderful. The combat is tight, visceral, and satisfying. While upgrades to your weaponry can make things easier, there isn't any level wall, nor are there equipment specific areas. If you have the chops in terms of combat, you can go anywhere you like, and complete the game with only your starting gear. There are some enemies that are tough, especially when they have you outnumbered or you're low on health, but in general, the game is fair; albiet a bit difficult.The visuals are stunning, and the sound design is top notch.I'm a bit annoyed that Co-Op wasn't there from the start, but apparently the devs are working on releasing it, and I wouldn't have been upset if the game was marketed as single player from the start, so that's easily forgiven.I have no other qualifications; this game is worth it.

												Beautiful pixel art and rouge-like(-like[1]) gameplay, this game is merciless yet quite fun!Soundtrack matches the dystopian, ominous/depressing tone, though there are some high ones some times.I will say the art in this is the best I've seen, pixel-wise, and I mostly bought it because of that alone.. and because, well, I believe in the guy who kicked this whole thing off. ^.^Bare-bones tutorial in the beginning, you figure out the rest. A story whose characters aren't explained, but rather has emotions seeping out of more juicy pixels in the form of very beautiful (and somewhat strange) ""cutscenes"".Combat is twitchy, always a do-or-die moment; you have to learn the patterns, get fast, get good, otherwise they will (greatly) overwhelm you, and you will either come out of it exilarated at 1 health or raging at your death having 2 med packs yet to spend.I recommend it, though not for the faint of heart; you will be murdered; you will rage; and you will probably get carpal-tonnel if you have a bad gamepad. But it, at the end of the day.. is a well made game indeed.[1]There are save points, per se, though you don't get to choose them.			"

												We all knew this was going to be a gorgeous and stunningly detailed pixel tour de force on the graphical front, but how does it play?  Like it was crafted by angels.The exploration is breath takingThe combat is fluid, responsive, challenging, and wholly addictive, almost like how I imagine a top down Dark Souls/Zelda love child would be.The music and is mysterious and sublime, perfectly crafting an atmosphere of wonder, anticipation and ominousness.  The non-verbal and obscure storytelling (which I won’t spoil) is pretty unique for this day and age, and I have been very impressed by the delivery of what little I have seen.It took me 11 hours to finish, and even then I didn't find all the secrets this game has.  I'll need to delve more through the mysterious world of HLD to find them all.I know some people have been moaning about the difficulty, esp the bosses, but i found it just right.  It is challenging and difficult, but never unfair; skill and precision are what you need to get through.  I'm not exactly a hardcore super gamer hero (i struggle through Dark souls and such)  but i found most bosses could fall between 5-10 tries.  You just have to be patiant, concentrate, and learn how to exploit them.  Also, the game is never punishing; after death, you start in the room just before you died with ALL the medikits you have ebfore you entered the room.  that's generousI've also heard a lot of whimpering about this being 30fps.  Cry me a river sweetheart.  It doesn't effect the gameplay, and if little princesses can't cope with 30fps, they shouldn't buy game.  There's been SO much footage of this game on the internet for years, so there's no excuse. I must admit, i would have loved 60fps on this, but lets not go overboard here.Its not a perfect game through.  its not alays clear what it in the foreground, and often i found mself falling of ledges that where blocked by scenery.  also, there's some hit-detection bugs, as i've been shot  through walls a few times, are sometimes a wall has blocked my melee attack but not an enemies.Overall, this is my second fav game of 2016 so far (Dark Souls 3 is currently king) and the best indie game imho since Bastion and Hotline Miami.  I really hope there will be a sequal or spiritual successor in the near future.			"

												When I think of this game I am instantly brought to the incredible scenery and the amazing combat. Now it is really easy nitpick a game such as this. And it would be easy to, but I beleive that this game is an experience. Not one that everyone will finish, but one that deserves to be tried. It reminds me of a game I played quite some time ago, called LISA. Now both are very different games but both are EXPERINCES. Journies on may like to call them. This game is an incredible journey. It is perfectly executed down to the very last pixel. How lucky we are that such games are still being released. Now as I am sure you will hear many many many times ( and experience many many many times if you purchase the game) is that this game is hellishly difficult. I tend to disagree, there are difficult moments in the game (because of enemies and bosses) the fact is that after two or three deaths the attentive gamer will breeze through the game. I found its difficulty to be both rewarding and refreshing, as the game is easy to pick up and difficult to master (but not to difficult). The whole game feels so sureal and fantastical in my memory. I would recomend this to everyone. It really is not that difficult to complete the story and the world building and little things really make the game an absolue joy to play. You owe it to yourself to get this game (and LISA and Kentucky Route Zero if you havnt, but that is neither here nor their).			"

												I'm so happy that I backed a game that was as successful and fun as this was. Completed the game over a couple long playthroughs, but I know I'll be going through it again for completionism and for NG+.Graphics: 9/10. Super pretty. Super smooth animations. Lots of detail. Very satisfying and colorful when it wants to be. Some instances of the Drifter moving on top of cliffs that he should be moving behind, but those were only in one portion of one area, as far as I could tell. No actual complaints.Music: 10/10. Atmospheric as all hell. Fitting moments of awe and stress. A superb soundtrack. The Southern-Area boss theme is my particular favorite track.Gameplay: 8/10. You can go through the game with zero upgrades, no guns(probably, not gonna bother trying), and proceed through the four areas in any order. Combat feels nice, special attacks are satisfying to pull off, movement is good. But be ready to drift driFT SLAM(also careful about cliffs woops)I had a great time and recommend it, even at its base price.			"

												For some reason I like comparing games to a mix of other games.  I would say Hyper Light Drifter is a mix of Fez, Dark Souls, Bastion, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.Putting that aside, I adore this game despite how much hardship it has put me through.  It's not an easy game for the most part, but it's fair, satisfying, and rewarding in the end.  Another aspect I really loved was the level design and how carefully crafted and hidden all of the secret areas and collectibles were.  The visuals and audio were also spectacular from the character and enemy animations to the soundtrack composed by Disasterpeace to the effective and crisp SFX.  The story and world were also very ambiguous and fun to try to piece together with a lot of the big setpieces in the game taking to great effect.(Possible Spoilers ahead) My main and only real issue with the game is how insignicant the collectibles really are, only really amounting to some different looking gear.  It makes me wishing it had an impact on the story, the cutscenes, or even just the way the world looks (maybe collecting everything made the game turn to night or something). All in all, though, I would wholeheardedly recommend this game.  Definitely will go down as one of my favorites of all time.			"

												This game is beyond what i can convey in a short review on steam, but to sum it up. its absolutely amazing. its simple yet beautiful 16-bit style combined with its fast paced combat immediatly put this game on the top of my list. as well as the gameplay being difficult on the same level as dark souls and the way it tells its story blew me away. i'm a hard person to please with a game and an even harder of a person to get to cry at the end, adn this game did it. i can rightfully say this game has taken the number one slot of my all time favorite games and i cant wait to see what heart machine does next. P.s. dear ign if this game doesnt get the first 10/10 the world might explode.			"

												I cant' recommend this game enough.The combat mechanics are entertaining in themselves let alone intuitive and difficult to truely master.I particularly enjoy games with such a sense in freedom, yet there's enough guidance to assist when lost.If the lack of info in game and player assistance turns you off, just give it a second, you'll realize it's not much more complicated than it looks, fundamentally simple.Disasterpeace once again blew my socks off with the perfectly crafted ambience and tunes that acccompany this game.All in all, it's around a 10 hour game that is worth every second, with the option to play more to find the lore. Great game.			"

												This is a an incredible game. The combat is about dodging avoiding and then striking. The game is very much like a Zelda title but improving on everything. WIth that said, there isn't any puzzle elements but there is a lot of hidden areas. Some of those areas are somewhat like a Zelda title where you need an item, in this case a gun to shoot a pillar to open a secret area. The secret areas in this game is incredibly vast making it fun to explore and the the four areas being it north, east, south, and west have their own unique design and enemies.I highly recommend the game. If you want a story driven title, this won't be for you. The narrative is weak and seems to be up for interpetation. It does have a great sense of atmosphere and wonder. There are characters that will talk to you but through pictures. The music is good and unique. It feels near perfect in blending in with the world.			"

												This game .. I just can't begin to describe how perfect it is, and anything I'll say would just be an understatement. It's simply beautiful. Defintely one of the best indie games I've ever played, with its unique atmosphere, and homage to the era of snes games, bewitching visuals and soundtrack, and a simple yet challenging combat system It surely holds it spot as one of the best games I've played this year. Do yourself a favor and buy the game, it's more than worth it. Highly recommended.  "

The story(?) kept me wondering and thinking all the way through the game. Definately replayable with a lot of hidden content that is easily missed the first time through. Just the Intro is enough to tell you that this game is money well spent.			"

												I love this game, no more, no less.people say that they are lost, they're probably stupid and don't spend too much time actually playing, instead, they want the entire game to be handed to them on a silver plate with a map of how to actually do everything.i saw one review that said that colourblind people shouldn't play this, and i do agree, it's a pretty game if you can see everything in their full glory.the pixelart is beyond good, it's fantastic, exquisite one might say.the bosses are fun but challenging, (so are the enemies) i have a habit of being able to beat the final boss in one go and this game doesnt have that.although the game might be a bit short, it's more than worth the 10 euro's it is now.fair warning though, this game is hard if you underestimate things.*EDIT*-SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD-i forgot to mention the entire world, the more you progress the more of your possible questions  are given an answer to. what are the big giant human-like creatures? what happened in the forest? what happened in the abandoned facility? the game is wonderfully crafted into this world.-END SLIGHT SPOILERS-i can wholeheartedly recommend this game.

												2nd legit review i have ever done i know i may left some stuff about but i'm to lazy to put it in the review if you want to share something about the game i missed i'll be happy and respond to you. (better not be some troll♥♥♥♥♥♥or i'll fight outside of Fry's electronic)By far the best game i Indie adventure game i played so far in my opinion. The music is amazing and relaxing, the combat is really interesting with tons of move set and the range weapons are great also. I like the idea how you have to slash your enemies or objects to replenish your ammo. The platform is really hard and takes alot of practice to master it because if you're going for hidden items or gear collecting good luck to you pal but it will be rewarding with the unique effects on the costumes it self. The bosses are really unique and i think of it like Mega man you can freely choose which boss or zone you can take on and all of the bosses have counter and weaknesses. If you take on a boss without any upgrade or weapons it can be frustrating and hard but if you can can gett certain upgrades and or guns. This game is as and i know i'm ripping people off this joke but it's as hard as your wife/husband but can be forgiven and you love him/her. I recommend this game for anyone who's not an experience gamer and experience gamers. 9/10			"

												This game is just great. It's best sides are great pixel graphics (I think best pixel art I've ever seen) and gameplay, it's really satisfying, it's quick, controlls are great and combat is challenging, fun and what I like the most, it's based on dashing system, so there is alot of movement in battles. There are a lot of secret areas, so exploring is rewarding. Bosses are also fun, though some of them are too easy. Storyline is, well it just is. Nothing interesting, and at least it's there. Soundtrack is nice, synthwave'y chiptunes and some ambient thrown into it.Would be also great if the game was longer, 8hours (probably like 10-12 if you want to collect all the crystals/gears etc, but I'm not a fan of completing in 100% games, I like to play on my own, without guides or checking every wall if there is a secret), but it's still ok.Overall, there are some cons, but really small ones. Art and gameplay makes this game really special.			"

												If ARPG's are your genre, stop reading, and buy this game. This game has elements of 90's ARPGs like the Secret of Evermore that have made ARPG's my favorite gaming genre. Hyperlight Drifter uses a pixilated art style that is reminiscent of the 16-bit era without looking sloppy.  The story line is straightforward and mysterious, and dialogue is delivered in a series pictures. Never is a true word is spoken by any character in the game, but at no point are you as the player lost as to what is happening -- there is just enough of a push for you as a player to find out more. The game play is fun and addictive. As the drifter you are able to dash and slash enemies, or shoot the baddies with a plasma gun. The bosses are challenging and their defeat gives you a sense of reward when you finally crush them. I do have some issue with the controls: there are dashing puzzles that require precise timing to complete successfully. The game is unforgiving in this respect and can lead to explosive bouts of frustration. Also, I find that the controls have the Drifter prone to falling of cliffs (see aforementioned explosive frustration). The music complements the game well it provides the gameplay with an eerie ambience. Don't expect an epic music score. The music is more simple than the orchestrated pieces in blockbuster hits, but by no means is Hyperlight Drifter's soundtrack ineffective. Overall, I think this game is great. I love it.  A solid 9.5/10.			"

												A fantastic game if you're into the kind of stuff it provides. This is an action adventure in the style of Zelda et al., with a heavy focus on exploration (and on retraversing territory to find things you missed or couldn't access before), fast combat, and atmosphere. Expect some of the best-animated 2D pixel-art graphics seen in ages, an amazing use of sound design, and brilliantly designed boss fights. There's also a compelling story, but it's one you have to piece together yourself through pictures and cinematics, as there's no actual text in the game beyond the tutorials.It's challenging, but not excessively so (despite the reports of some journalists who appear to be bafflingly bad at it), with all its very elements balanced on a knife-edge of precision. Again, boss fights are fantastic. Regular enemies can be beefy enough as well, and you're expected to learn the ins and outs.There are some bugs, but these are getting squashed nearly as fast as they're reported, which is great. There isn't a ton of content, but this is a game that benefits from a completionist attitude, trying to get 100% of everything. It took me about 12 hours to do a full run of the game, with a pretty decent completion percentage, but I still missed several big things from 3 of the main areas, and there are a number of locked doors I didn't open. There's also an extra-challenging New Game + mode that I haven't even touched.Well worth your time and attention, a game crafted with love. Not perfect, and definitely not for everyone, but you'll know very quickly whether this is speaking your language or not. And if it is, you'll love it.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is beautiful.Mind blowingly beautiful, both visually and sonically.Let’s start with the visuals.This is the best pixel art I have ever seen in my life.Every facet of this game gushes style, it’s been crafted with so much love.Like I can't overstate that, this is easily the prettiest game I've seen in years.The soundtrack is amazing too.Every time I’d get to a new area and think “wow this looks really cool” the sound would kick in and floor me. The sound wasn’t just limited to specific events either. I found myself repeatedly idly exploring and realizing how subtly the sound was pulling me into the world.I could go on but rather than be like the endless flow of long winded steam reviews I’ll say this.This game is amazing. If you like exploratory dungeon crawlers like Zelda and you like hard games where learning patterns and skillfully fighting matters, like darksouls, this game is for you.For me, as of the time of writing this, this is the game of the year.Easiest 10/10 in ages. Please buy a copy. "

												I don't like writing reveiws, think that no one will bother reading them, but this...is a thing i must write about.It is not nescessary for something to be hyper realistic and jaw droppingly good looking to be considered a masterpiece. Hyperlight drifter is such a thing. It is a 2D, pixelated, hack n' slash, platformer taking place on a post apocalipty earth-like planet. War over the mysterious energy source discovered/ or created by the mysterious race of ""Librarians"" ravaged the land. What these creatures had left behind now haunts the surviving outscirts of other four (Bird-,otter-,rakoon-,lizard-like humanoid) races. Travel through four regions and discover a great history of once glorious civilizations, while though naration of absolutely no word spoken, not even written visiuals while the story is open for interpretation.Gameplay.Gameplay is simple and straightforward yet challenging, every enemy needs their special approach or they might overwhelm you. They have health bars with squares (each square represents how many hits they can take). You have a sword and six types of guns (Unlocked after deafiting bosses). Each gun usess up ammo you get from destroying the enemy or breakable items. It also includes special dashes allowing player to get from platfrom to platform, or to travel quickly (Can be upgreaded by hidden golden chips). The mechanics are unique, but i'll leave it up to you to discover.World. The World feels ""Alive"", almost every level, every little location or hidden section tells it's own unwritten tragic story for player to discover. I do believe that not one night was put into the design. Audio is miraculous and lovable with music that seemingly is a cacauphony alone, but turns into a symphony combined with visuals and other sounds. Every sector has its own original music. Evemies are original and every single one has their own characteristics and unique looks, guaranteed to stay fresh and new. I beat that game in three days and already managed to form my own theories of it. Yet what i have to say about it is how almost every item in the game is hidden and by a sheer luck or a guide one can find it, it dries my blood!StoryThe story is left open for interpretaiton, as it is told through visions, enviroments and pictures that appear next to characters when you speak to them. Every character is unique and likable.Verdict.The game is worth EVERY single penny you spend, Great world, great characters, great audio, Great enemis, nice combat but frustratig exploration, just be ready for that. P.s What IGN was unfair in was that they gave HLD 7.6 and one of the cons was ""Abstract story telling"" while the same company Used the same thing as pro on a game called ""Inside"". Personally I think this type storrytelling is its pride, the great story given...no word spoken...No subtitles tu read no long cutscenes to see. Only action and a bit of back tracking.9/10 "

												Not a single word was said throughout the entire course of the game, yet it makes the artistry of this game. The pixel visuals. Music. Story-telling. Gameplay. So simple and so nostalgic, yet feels like a modern game due to the combat system similar to Dark Souls and Nioh. Definitely one of my favourite games and probably my top 2 Indie games of all time. Combat is challenging and similar to Dark Souls; don't be discouraged when you keep dying at certain stages of the game. Dying over and over again to certain puzzles and a couple of bosses frustrated me at times, but that feeling of satisfaction when you finally beat it made the deaths worthwhile. What makes it even better is that you learn new skills and upgrade certain features as you progress further into the game, making certain aspects of the game easier while the game retains its ever-so punishing difficulty that you'll still fall prey to your own greed and impatience even with these upgrades.  I've never played Dark Souls or Nioh before, but I could stil complete the game while finding most of the secrets. Don't let other reviews saying the game is too hard bother you; if I can do it so can any of you reading this review. Just put in the effort to learn from your mistakes and theorycraft your way to beat certain parts of the game on your own. If you're stuck at a certain point, you can also look at some YouTube guide videos. If you're interested in the back story of the creator or some further insight to the story of the game, go ahead and watch the VICE documentary of the Hyper Light Drifter on YouTube. Truly an amazing experience for me.			"

												DON'T EVER PLAY THIS GAME WITH MOUSE AND KEYBOARD. JUST AWFUL!!!the only thing I have a problem with is when there are multiple mobs in a closed area. most of the times you won't freaking see what's comming since projectiles cannot really be differentiated with the background. I know it's a beautiful game.my advice is find a place where you're unlikely to be hit by foes since healing doesn't give you invincibility and if you got hit while healing, that would cancle the process.

												( I had 15 hours previously, but not on a Steam version, already beat the Standard game)It's an excellent game IMO, but definitely not for everyone. Art style is fantastic, it's just ""pixel art"" but really tasty and every zone of the map feels like it was made with care. Really detailed.The soundtrack and sound in general, is really good too, the music it's atmospheric, and memorable (Not exactly catchy tho, which is not the same)Gameplay wise, it's a mix of Zelda , Dark Souls , and Metroid. If you liked Metroid, you will like this. Lots of exploration, secrets, backtracking, and powerups. Enemies are kinda hard, but you just gotta get to a slower pace, if you rush constantly you are gonna get swarmed by enemies and die really fast. Just take your time, and dash to avoid the damage. Bosses are hard, hard enough to get you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but take your time to understand the patterns and rhytm of them, and you will do fine.I really like the old school aproach of no dialogues, no text, that reminds me of Metroid too. Just learn how to play, and how things work by looking at them, interacting, and trying.You are not gonna like this game if :-You rush through the map, TAKE YOUR TIME. Secrets aren't that hard to find, you just gotta look properly.-You are used to ""dash to get invincible"" thing.-You expect clear objectives and tutorials, text, etc. It's not that cryptic but not as explicit as many modern games.Overall, it was just what I wanted for a long time. An atmospheric, nice looking game, that offers a challenge, has good music, with secrets to discover, and an interesting lore that you can understand better if you look at some guides and take your time to appreciate the game.

												This game came as real surprise.  It wasn't on my radar.  I hadn't even heard about it, then the other day it shows up in New Releases.  The trailer hooked me, as it looked like exactly my type of game, and I bought it without hesitation.Now once I started playing the game, it became clear that it was meant to be quite challenging, and I struggled with it at first.  I'm not terribly good at the sorts of games that list “high difficulty” among their selling points.  The game was still gorgeous, the atmosphere perfect, but I was frustrated by how often I died, and how easily an area with few basic enemies could kill me.  This further upset me, because I really wanted to see the whole game, and at first, it didn't seem like a game I would ultimately enjoy playing through.It didn't take me long, however, to start to get into the rhythm of the game.  Muscling my way through an area became very rewarding.  The checkpoint system is forgiving enough that you're never sent back too far, and the maps are FULL of secret areas with just the thing you need when you're getting kicked in the jimmies.  I had upgraded a few things (I started with the health packs.  Don't spend it on them, get sword or dash upgrades first) and was generally clearing most areas on the first or second try.Then came the first boss fight.  I said, “Hell yeah, I'm up for this!”  Twenty tries later, I was ready to fling my Steam controller through the TV.  I'd barely made a dent in his health.  I was furious, and far more aggravated than I had been hours ago when I first started the game.  I pretty much gave up on ever seeing the end of the game, and I put it down for several days.It occurred to me later that there didn't seem to be anything really preventing me from going and exploring other places.  The map is divided into 4 sections (each with its own boss) with the starting city in the middle, and it turns out that at the beginning you can go visit 3 of them.  There doesn't even really seem to be any set order they need to be done in, and you can really complete most of each area without actually beating any of the bosses.So now it's on.  I'm exploring every nook and cranny of the map, looking for cards (? whatever the upgrade currency is called) and spending them.  There are so many cleverly hidden (and sometimes beautiful) spots, and finding them is almost reward enough, but they also always contain health packs and/or cards.The variety of enemies is very impressive as well.  Most enemies are pretty weak, and go down with just a few slashes, but most of them can jump and move around almost as well as you, and it only takes a few of them to really crank up the challenge.  It's pretty thrilling to find yourself in the middle of an ambush, hopelessly slashing, flinging yourself around dodging and positioning for an advantage, and then coming out by the skin of your teeth.So having spent some time honing my play style and upgrading the protagonist, I made my way back to the first boss.  No doubt about it, he was still fairly challenging, but on my first attempt I had taken out a fair bit of his health before dying.  I persevered, and after about 5 more tries (each a little better than the last) I beat him.  Now I'm 37 (I'm not old), and I'm a little ashamed to say I was jumping up and down in my living room like a little kid.This was turning out to be among the best gaming experiences I'd had.  I had almost given up more than once, but I think that's what helped give me such a great sense of accomplishment upon returning and completing a given challenge.  I'm real glad I stuck with it through the end.  The setting is amazing, the world is vibrant with life and danger, and the trials and rewards along the way are a near perfect balance.Aside: The issues with difficulty that others are claiming are likely due to the unidirectional way we tend to play our games.  Having trouble with an area or a boss?  Go elsewhere for a while.  It'll still be here when you get back, and you'll be better equipped to handle it next time.The developers have also been very involved in the post-launch playtesting.  Not just for fixing bugs, but they've been engaged with us players tweaking and adjusting gameplay and taking our suggestions and concerns to heart with fast-turn-around updates.  They all deserve a major high-five.Edit:  New Game Plus is not what you think.  It's much harder.Another Edit:  Since I wrote this review, they have updated the game with couch-coop.  Playing it with a buddy is even more fun, and the way they implement it reveals an interesting dimension to the protagonist that I find intriguing.  It's not just that they added a second player, they actually put some thought into the story implications of having another character onscreen.  Superbly done.			"

												This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The art is amazing, the music fits perfectly, the gameplay is super snappy. It encourages you to explore and doesn't do much hand-holding. The upgrades you eventually get make a world of difference in how you think about defeating enemies. The atmosphere of the game is mysterious and alien, which is perfect.If I were to criticize anything about this game it would be its difficulty. Granted I haven't played the game since close to launch, and I've heard it's possible some balance issues have been changed, at the time it was extremely difficult. For me, I enjoy challenging games that make you have to plan your boss fights and manage your restorative abilities. So in my personal opinion the difficulty barrier was a fun aspect. But I realize the vast majority of people who had a problem with this game mainly focused on its difficulty. They *wanted* to like the game for all of its other amazing qualities, but just couldn't get past an enemy, or an area, or especially a boss, and just gave up.Still, everything about this game is awesome. You can tell a lot of thought was put into almost every little detail and I love games like that. Grats on such a wonderful game, Heart Machine!			"

												I'm giving this game a thumbs up. Why? Because it's not only a game but a beautiful experence. Without a doubt this sets the bar way out of reach for others of it genre. It does indeed feel as if im in a world surrounded by this Devs story but everything is beautiful in a mello somber tone from the music. It realy does speak for itself.This is a must buy at full asking price for anyone into rogue-like games or you like that exploration feeling of zelda.PS:I heard about the condition of the developer and I just want to say to him FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT! We need more people like you in this world.			"

												TL;DR Great game, great graphics.Bosses are very hard but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early.Really enjoying my time with this game. I expected it to be a 4-6 hours ""linear"" story but it actually has a somewhat open world and 0 hand holding. First issue I had is that the game doesn't explain anything to you, nothing is in english and nobody speaks english in the game. Until I started playing it was quite hard to understand what all of the things you see mean. For example, the main objective of the game is explained by a hologram where you have 3 images and you don't even know what those 3 images even are until you start actually playing the game.The game has 0 hand holding, meaning you are put into this world, you get somewhat of an explaination about what you have to do and you can go anywhere you want. There are 4 ""areas"" in which you have to gather some kind of shards that will later I guess activate this thing that is in center of your ""hub"" area. What I like is that the game doesn't tell you ""go here first"" but rather ""pick any of these paths"".One thing that is really bothering me is the aiming with the weapons. I personally don't use controllers that often and this game is certainly designed to be played with one because I encountered some weird stuff going on with keyboard an mouse.I would like if there was some kind of aim assist or actually lock on mode. The game lets you shoot your weapons without aiming as long as you are pointing the desired direction but in middle of the battle you definitely have no time to aim and let alone orient yourself towards enemies. Another thing worth pointing out is the fact that bosses are insanely hard, but I think the game doesn't want you to engage them early on. Because the game lets you explore the whole map I think it wants you to gather upgrade points and get some skills and then go and engage the bosses because going in without a single skill is pretty much suicide. Bosses have insane amount of health while you have only 5 hp and there are hits that do like 3 points of damage, knocks you down and by the time you get up you are dead. I am going to see if the boss battles get any easier later down the road when you get some skills and upgrades but other than that and the aiming I am really enjoying the game.UPDATE:Finally managed to beat 1 boss. Took me like 1 hour... It honestly isn't as hard as it is more developing a tactic and timing your hits/dashes.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a glorious game.  I've had my eyes on it since it went up on kickstarter.  The visuals remind me of Fez, Zelda, and odly enough, Dark Souls.  It almost plays like a mix of the three as well which is very, very unique.  This game doesn't hold your hand.  You get a few clues every now and then, and often it'll leave you wondering where to go next, what upgrades you might need or think would best suit you for the upcoming onsalught of your mental stability for the next few hours.  I venture to say it's as challenging as Dark Souls, but a little bit more forgiving.  Everything feels like a walk in the park until there's an ambush of god knows how many monsters, no health packs anywhere near you, wondering if you can dodge countless attacks because you have one hp left, or if you need to warp to a safepoint to heal up a bit.  Soundtrack is absolutely stunning as well.  Every moment something happens there's a spectacular spectrum of sounds, music, and atmosphere that compliment the stress, anxiety and pressure from every battle.  I personally hardly ever have faith in indie devs, or indie games, but this, this is fantastic.  Easily my favorite game in my library.  Vice did a short documentary on the game with the devs and if you need more reason to buy this game, check that out as it goes into the life of the creator, the team, and the game itself.  10/10			"

												Hyper Light Drifter, a complex mix of beautiful ambience and fast paced action sequences this game never failed to maintain a constant state of immersion. The beautiful scenery and large scale fighting makes this game a flurry of actions and animations. I often found myself yelling at the screen over the difficulty of the game but in the end it is worth it. Hard games are a lost art and many indie games sugar coat their games with the ability to choose your difficulty. The appeal of this is understandable but HLD has a mysterious feel and avoiding that attribute helped strengthen it. At first the lack of dialogue annoyed me greatly but I learned to appreciate the simplistic vibes and notions of the NPC's ""dialogues"". This game is not for someone who does not want a challange.SCORE: 98/100			"

												This game is hard. Really, really hard. I promise that you will think the game is unbeatable at times. You will feel like the game is unfair towards the player, and I will admit that it is VERY unfair towards the player.The question is not WHEN you will die, but HOW. The game can be beaten, and the bosses can be beaten without upgrades I'm sure, but it won't be easy.But when you finally stop at the end of the road, when you finally have beaten the game... It will be worth all the pain.And you might even want to beat it again.10/10 To this game for giving me the greatest and most exciting adventure I have had in a long time.			"

												Great game. Aesthetically pleasing with the pixelized graphics and the gameplay is fun. The soundtrack has some really great songs that fit the mood of the area your in. It starts off slow and doesn't really give you a direction to go, so be prepared to run around mindlessly a lot or consult to a guide. It is also more difficult than you think, you have to pay close attention to your health bar or you will find yourself on way less health than you think. The most frustrating part is the puzzles. They can be very annoying at times as the map you are given is not very detailed and just gives you a general idea of what is around you. The puzzles often lead you to optional things like upgrade square things, but the hardest ones are always when you have to get the diamonds which are required to progress. I find myself a lot going up and down and back tracking a ton because I missed a secret passage that was barely noticable. I wouldn't even call them puzzles because they are more of you searching for the right place to go and checking every corner for a passage way. If you can get past frustrating ""puzzles"" than this is a great game. Good music, gameplay, combat is extremely fun, and very visually pleasing. It provides you with an okay amount of hours, it's taken me 6.6 hours to almost complete the game on normal, but you can replay the game once you beat it on a different mode for extra challenge. Overall great game though, masterfully put together.!PLAY ON STANDARD MODE BECAUSE IF YOU PLAY ON NEWCOMER, A LOT OF ACHIEVMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO YOU!			"

												This is an excellent game that reminds me of games like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 6 and other classic adventure/RPG games. The graphics are very original and nicely drawn. It has a retro feel to it without feeling old in any way. The gameplay is amazing. The controls are perfect (although like in many other games the corrupt game makers decided to only allow 2 brands of controllers to work, but you can get around it the usual way). I really enjoyed that story elements were not presented by text, but instead by drawn pictures about what the person is saying. The only really negative thing about the game would be that the story is unclear and vage. You start with a confusing opening and then you're like ""ok what the heck is my goal?"". I discovered the story watching a youtube video about the game where they said the story is ""your character is sick and you need to find a cure"" well actually I never thought of that to be honest. I just realized while playing that there are some triangles to be collected all over the map to fight some endbosses. That's all I can really say about the story of the game after beating it today. So if the story was just a little clearer it would have been 10/10 but like this I'd say 9/10.			"

												What an amazing game!! The music, sounds, atmosphere, gameplay, levels and lack of narrative in a traditional way.A solid game through and through, with a perfect length.If you enjoy exploration in a Links to the past-esque kind of game, you will not be dissapointed! 5/5 gold pubes.

												This is a an incredible game. The combat is about dodging avoiding and then striking. The game is very much like a Zelda title but improving on everything. WIth that said, there isn't any puzzle elements but there is a lot of hidden areas. Some of those areas are somewhat like a Zelda title where you need an item, in this case a gun to shoot a pillar to open a secret area. The secret areas in this game is incredibly vast making it fun to explore and the the four areas being it north, east, south, and west have their own unique design and enemies.I highly recommend the game. If you want a story driven title, this won't be for you. The narrative is weak and seems to be up for interpetation. It does have a great sense of atmosphere and wonder. There are characters that will talk to you but through pictures. The music is good and unique. It feels near perfect in blending in with the world.			"

												Fun, but hard as hell. I was rediculously close to quitting near the beginning of the game, but once I figured out what I was doing and how to play the game properly, it became infinetly more fun. The atmosphere is very engaging, the music is calming yet fitting (probably neccessary for how difficult and rage-inducing this game can be after clearing most of a room and dying), and overall it executed everything it was trying to do seamlessly. It controls like a dream with a controller, but I can only imagine what it would be like with a mouse and keyboard , as I don't dare try it. Worth the purchase if you enjoy a Hack and Slash game with beautiful art style that doesn't hold your hand throughout.			"

												Fantastic indie and a part time dark souls pixelated edition.Pros:- Like to die a lot of times? then this is the game for you!- Beautiful pixel art.- Unlimited (Kind of) bombs.- Perfect game for players that likes a challenge once in a while.- Guns (I don't need to explain this do I?)- Co-op fun with friends (troll them maybe?)- Will pretty much run on almost any computer.- Combat system is awesome.Cons:- Hate to die? well then too bad you will die a lot.- Need to scavenge for medkits (it's not that big of a deal really)My suggestions for the game:- If PvP is added the arena will be quite useful for 1v1 duels since the combat system is really good!- More items maybe?- I think steam workshop will work pretty great with this game (Based on my first suggestion and second suggestion for custom arenas and equipment rewarded for playing PvP maybe?).- More skills?The stuff I put in this review are mostly based on my opinion and well for the suggestions I only think that maybe it will make the game have a bit more rpg-like stuff on it.Anyways game is super great worth paying trust me.

												There are very few things I found wrong with this game.If you enjoy a soft, almost cutesy looking game with a more morbid, horrific tone and story, this is the game for you.A world, open for you to freely explore and see just how lovely but dark this game is.Almost like a mix between the Souls series, with bright colours and a great soundtrack that fits in with every breathtaking moment this game has to offer. And here's the thing, it may be difficult, but it's not a ""I just smashed my controller"" kind of difficult, but more of a ""Well this is hard, but I need to keep trying because this is fun"" kind of difficult. If you've been looking at this game and thinking about buying it, I will totally recommend it to you, it's fun, and even with my short time playing I can say many postitive things like I did before.Hyper Light Drifter is almost a masterpiece and I haven't said that about a lot of games before. So if you do decide to buy it, I hope you enjoy itGifted to me by: Pinky the Cat			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is beautiful.Mind blowingly beautiful, both visually and sonically.Let’s start with the visuals.This is the best pixel art I have ever seen in my life.Every facet of this game gushes style, it’s been crafted with so much love.Like I can't overstate that, this is easily the prettiest game I've seen in years.The soundtrack is amazing too.Every time I’d get to a new area and think “wow this looks really cool” the sound would kick in and floor me. The sound wasn’t just limited to specific events either. I found myself repeatedly idly exploring and realizing how subtly the sound was pulling me into the world.I could go on but rather than be like the endless flow of long winded steam reviews I’ll say this.This game is amazing. If you like exploratory dungeon crawlers like Zelda and you like hard games where learning patterns and skillfully fighting matters, like darksouls, this game is for you.For me, as of the time of writing this, this is the game of the year.Easiest 10/10 in ages.

												My oversimplified review of Hyper Light Drifter is - imagine the combat and graphics of Crawl mashed up with the world exploration and story of Ori and the Blind Forest. It's a very simple, straightforwad game that marks a lot of boxes in terms of amazing game design and concise yet satisfying storytelling. VERY low amount of instruction, and the design does a great job making sure you get a handle of the controls and movement just moments after starting. From what I understand, the game is also non-linear, which is my favorite part so far. The soundtrack is also incredible. Very ambient and compliments the world tremendously. Disasterpeace never fails to impress.The only con I see in this game is difficulty and how dying is handled. The difficulty can spike in certain areas in terms of platforming and combat. This isn't too bad because you have infinite lives. HOWEVER, every time you die, there is a 3-5 second animation that plays when your character respawns. I know it doesn't sound like an inconvenience, but in areas where you are constantly dying from trying to figure out a platforming puzzle, it makes for a bit of a frustrating experience. As far as I know there is no way to skip this animation.(EDIT: You can now hold down A and X to speed up the respawn animation!)EXTRA NOTE: As of writing this, Steam says I have 7.6 hours of this game logged. I'd like to let it be known that about 2 hours of that was spent trying to reach 800 chain dashes in the dash shop area. I finally accomplished it. I have no regrets.			"

												When I read comparisions on review sites, comparing this game to Dark Souls as one of the main quips about the game and it's difficulty. They're not entirely wrong; And I don't like Dark Souls.That said, I do like this game very much. Since I don't dig the whole ""prepare to die"" vibe in games, it affects how likely I am to pick up the controller and start up the game between sessions ( A controller is a must - keyboard mouse works but it's built a little more intuitive for controller. More fun too). And that sucks, because all of the art, music and design are so very delicate, awesome, all-engrossing that I really want to spend more time in it... and I know I will, just not all at once.To contrast the game comparisons, it plays closest to Bastion or Transistor. It plays very close to Transistor, but the upgrades are slow on the uptake (and don't really ""up""-grade, but alter your abilities). I dig the limited moves (~3) in the abilityset, it forces you to get creative and makes tackling even simple enemies fun.I'm sure this reads like a negative review. I'm still thinking about that part. Maybe the game makes us observe inward on the shortcomings and insecurities we feel about ourselves, allowing us to confront the worst parts of ourselves. But overall I like this game since I am a bit of a pushover when it comes to pixel post-apocalypta lone hero slashers. Disclosure: Not a backer, realized it was coming out a week ago and picked it up.			"

												TL;DR: Very fun game, absolutely worth the money. Challenging, without being ridiculously hard. I got this game because it looked very atmospheric and chill in the video. While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying. You'll enjoy it, I promise!Pros:Great soundtrackVery fun gameplayCool graphicsGreat controlsCons:Crashes once ever 2 hours or soDifficult to navigate with the mapUpgrades not explained well			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. It's difficult, but very fair. There is lots of content to go through, including (edit: a boss rush mode!), a horde mode, new game+, and various secret challenges, not to mention the large amount of secrets to find in general. It is a bit light on story, but everything in the world is really nicely detailed and put together. The game is definitely a ""show, don't tell"" type of deal, which I understand may not appeal to everyone.Heart Machine recommends using a controller, but I've played the game using exclusively KB+M and it controls wonderfully.Unfortunately Hyper Light Drifter is locked to 30 fps, which does make the experience worse than it could be, but the game itself is so good that I am willing to live with the framerate, as much as it pains me to say so.edit: And now they've patched in 60 fps and a boss rush gamemode. This cements it as my favourite game of all time. Good job Heart Machine!			"

												This game came as real surprise.  It wasn't on my radar.  I hadn't even heard about it, then the other day it shows up in New Releases.  The trailer hooked me, as it looked like exactly my type of game, and I bought it without hesitation.Now once I started playing the game, it became clear that it was meant to be quite challenging, and I struggled with it at first.  I'm not terribly good at the sorts of games that list “high difficulty” among their selling points.  The game was still gorgeous, the atmosphere perfect, but I was frustrated by how often I died, and how easily an area with few basic enemies could kill me.  This further upset me, because I really wanted to see the whole game, and at first, it didn't seem like a game I would ultimately enjoy playing through.It didn't take me long, however, to start to get into the rhythm of the game.  Muscling my way through an area became very rewarding.  The checkpoint system is forgiving enough that you're never sent back too far, and the maps are FULL of secret areas with just the thing you need when you're getting kicked in the jimmies.  I had upgraded a few things (I started with the health packs.  Don't spend it on them, get sword or dash upgrades first) and was generally clearing most areas on the first or second try.Then came the first boss fight.  I said, “Hell yeah, I'm up for this!”  Twenty tries later, I was ready to fling my Steam controller through the TV.  I'd barely made a dent in his health.  I was furious, and far more aggravated than I had been hours ago when I first started the game.  I pretty much gave up on ever seeing the end of the game, and I put it down for several days.It occurred to me later that there didn't seem to be anything really preventing me from going and exploring other places.  The map is divided into 4 sections (each with its own boss) with the starting city in the middle, and it turns out that at the beginning you can go visit 3 of them.  There doesn't even really seem to be any set order they need to be done in, and you can really complete most of each area without actually beating any of the bosses.So now it's on.  I'm exploring every nook and cranny of the map, looking for cards (? whatever the upgrade currency is called) and spending them.  There are so many cleverly hidden (and sometimes beautiful) spots, and finding them is almost reward enough, but they also always contain health packs and/or cards.The variety of enemies is very impressive as well.  Most enemies are pretty weak, and go down with just a few slashes, but most of them can jump and move around almost as well as you, and it only takes a few of them to really crank up the challenge.  It's pretty thrilling to find yourself in the middle of an ambush, hopelessly slashing, flinging yourself around dodging and positioning for an advantage, and then coming out by the skin of your teeth.So having spent some time honing my play style and upgrading the protagonist, I made my way back to the first boss.  No doubt about it, he was still fairly challenging, but on my first attempt I had taken out a fair bit of his health before dying.  I persevered, and after about 5 more tries (each a little better than the last) I beat him.  Now I'm 37 (I'm not old), and I'm a little ashamed to say I was jumping up and down in my living room like a little kid.This was turning out to be among the best gaming experiences I'd had.  I had almost given up more than once, but I think that's what helped give me such a great sense of accomplishment upon returning and completing a given challenge.  I'm real glad I stuck with it through the end.  The setting is amazing, the world is vibrant with life and danger, and the trials and rewards along the way are a near perfect balance.Aside: The issues with difficulty that others are claiming are likely due to the unidirectional way we tend to play our games.  Having trouble with an area or a boss?  Go elsewhere for a while.  It'll still be here when you get back, and you'll be better equipped to handle it next time.The developers have also been very involved in the post-launch playtesting.  Not just for fixing bugs, but they've been engaged with us players tweaking and adjusting gameplay and taking our suggestions and concerns to heart with fast-turn-around updates.  They all deserve a major high-five.Edit:  New Game Plus is not what you think.  It's much harder.Another Edit:  Since I wrote this review, they have updated the game with couch-coop.  Playing it with a buddy is even more fun, and the way they implement it reveals an interesting dimension to the protagonist that I find intriguing.  It's not just that they added a second player, they actually put some thought into the story implications of having another character onscreen.  Superbly done.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a top down, semi-isometric action/exploration which pays homage to Shadow of The Colossus, The Legend of Zelda, Diablo and to a degree, Metroid-Vania style games, all in beautifully drawn pixel art.Pro's- Gorgeous to behold, manages to do pixel art without coming off as a derivative gimmick. The backdrops, stages, dungeons and vista's are all stunning, with a vibrant (and somewhat unusual) colour pallette.- Tight, fluid combat. With full controller support, the game handles extemely well allowing for swift use of both sword and gun while dashing to avoid enemy attacks.- Ambient, electronic soundtrack which swells and crescendo's dynamically depending on the situation. - Immersive storytelling, told entirely visually using the environment and various NPC's. - Difficult, but forgiving. Deaths rarely feel cheap. - Has a control scheme for PS4 controllers! (may not seem like a big deal, but I've been using a DS4 for some time now, seeing very few games have the control scheme available without modding).- Steady stream of patches since release to address several bugs.Con's- The lack of direction and assistance may be off putting to some.- Hidden and optional areas aren't always obvious (not that they should be), which leads to a certain amount of running into everything hitting Y/Triangle. Could leave a lot of players missing extra upgrade currency/medkits etc..- At times, the music can be overbearingly loud, nothing some volume adjustment wont fix, but when it goes quiet again, you'll struggle to hear.Is it worth the asking price? Absolutely! If you're unsure, go check out a Let's Play, or wait until it's on sale, but if you like to be challenged by beautiful games, this is for you!For fans of: Titan Souls, Zelda, Journey, Studio Ghibli, Dark Souls.NOW AT 60fps!!!

												A mysterious, challenging game. Other than control explanations, the game asks you to figure out eveything about its setting and story through the environment and occasional pictograms. Combat is fast and deadly, requiring careful timing and precise movement. Music and visuals are excellent, perfectly evocative of the ruined world in which it takes place.Edit: Now runs in 60 fps, which makes the game more responsive and smooth to play.Highly reccomended.

 Hyper Light Drifter ,a game which exceeded my expectations.A game which blew my mind in terms ofartwork and soundtrack.I was not sure about me liking the game, so I thought I should write a review,just to clarify doubts, if anyone got some.Starting with: GAMEPLAY Dodging and thinking about your moves is vital for you to survive in this game.You got a hand full of moves and attaks which make this game allways feel freshin the combats.It´s fun to use specific combos, and not only fun but also efficient.What else could you ask for?Also, fighting enemies can be pretty hard, which is a challenge I like,and the boss fights are intense, just as it should be.Good work at the gameplay. LEVEL DESIGN The map is pretty big, and the game rewards the player for exploring.You can freely move around the map, although thre are some blocked zones,which you will unlock by the pass of time. This is no problem,in fact it made me want to continue playing, just to see what i woulddiscover by entering those zones.In my opinion the level design is very good. ARTWORK The designs, designs from enemies, the design of our character, landscapes,my favorite part of every work(movies, games, series)and what usually makes me buy a game and at the end like it.I love the fantasy-abstract-futuristic design this game got.The main character design is perfect, a character that stands outabove all others, showing us that he´s important.The enemies having a simple but great design,you will easily distinguish an enemie from a ""npc"".The Titans, having their mouth wide open, their eyes glowingand their giant bodies, just scary but pretty cool at the same time.Impossible to not notice them.And finally the landscapes, which impressed me.Being able to see different zones of the map from different angles,with these colors, which perfectly expressed how that zone would feel like.Simply beautiful. SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack, something i allways like, and something that, in my opinion,makes a game feel better or worse.A good soundtrack can make good moments feel even better, impressive momentsblow your mind. You get what i mean.This game did just that. I sometimes stood still in a place, just to contemplatethe combination of the beautiful landscapes and the incredible music this game offers. STORY Something that impressed me, and made me feel happy is the fact that after ending the gameI not only didn't find out all the secrets this game has, but neither did I get all the story told. You need to explore all the map by yourself to discover the entire story. Yes, I dont know the complete story yet. I dont even know if im gonna get it all told.What I know is that this gives me the posibility to replay this game, enjoy it even more than I already did, and still have the fresh feeling I had at the first moment.One of the games I most enjoyed, and im sure im gonna enjoy it even more.Definitly recommended.

												A beautiful game with a mysterious atmosphere. I waited for this game to release since it was published on Kickstarter, and it was every bit as amazing as I had expected it to be.Pros:- Simple and easy to understand combat and movement. Your gun works in unison with your blade and they are intended to be used together, a mechanic that this game pulls off really well. The game starts off in hard mode.- Challenging enemies and puzzling environment. It takes some time to get used to the enemy AI and even still it can be challenging. The additional challenges extend from the underground area which lets you challenge waves of monsters from each zone.- Amazing enemy design. Unlike Zelda, monsters and bosses don't have huge glowing red eyes which indicate overly obvious weak spots. This tells me that there's more than one way to kill an enemy, and some methods may be faster and better than others.- Beautiful pixel artwork, music and sound effects. Really have to hand it to the team and disasterpiece for these renditions.- Amazing level design with a lot of hidden passages and secrets. Really good job.Cons / Suggestions:- The wave challenges underground could do with something more. You earn a cape by completing 10 (?) waves from each zone and then completing 10 waves from the final room with monsters from all zones. After that there is really no purpose to continue playing. Perhaps add some leaderboards and additional rewards.- Minimal story. I'd love to know more about the world and the characters in it. Dark Souls is a great example of what I mean, by adding the story in the form of lore without comprimising gameplay quality with hoards of boring subtitles and long narrative. Add more items to the game, add lore to the capes and weapons, make me want to search for these items to learn more about this mysterious world. Perhaps less cryptic clues as to what the drifter's purpose in this world is, why he has to kill the final boss.- Small world. I feel like I want to explore more of the world than is currently explorable. The game can be completed very quickly and only has five bosses. It would be good if I came across an enemy that posed significantly more of a challenge than others, for example, some minibosses. The southern zone did this perfectly, because there three minibosses and a final boss. It would be good to see this throughout the whole world.- Stemming from the previous suggestion, it would also be great to see endgame world-events that take place either randomly in the world, or whenever something is done to trigger these events, as well as rare bosses or minibosses that appear in the world either as part of the specific event or just randomly, rarely. I would personally love to have more of a reason to revisit my favorite locations in the game to defeat stronger monsters and learn more about these locations.All in all, this is a very good game. The cons are more like constructive criticism, some things I would enjoy and I'm sure others would like to see in the game.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of my favorite gaming experiences ever. I'm 32 and I have been playing video games even since the Sega Genesis I got in grade school. Like a game from that bygone 16-bit era, Hyper Light Drifter is focused in it's approach and elegant in its simplicity.The developers at Heart Machine clearly started with combat as the focus of Hyper Light Drifter, and they did a stunning job of creating a system that feels altogether unique and familiar. It shares many similarities to the strategic hack n' slash found in games like Monster Hunter or Dark Souls. You have to be precise and calculated with every action to avoid being punished, but enemies have patterns and tells you will have to learn to survive.Hyper Light Drifter is an Action Adventure RPG. In the air of classics like Legend of Zelda, Metroid, or Castlevania, you explore to find loot, upgrade your gear and abilities, and open up previously inaccessible areas. The bosses and dungeon hordes are both varied and challenging.  You die often, but it never feels unfair. As a result you find yourself wanting to jump right back in, always looking for that perfect run as you leap frog from horde to horde. Checkpoints strike a balance where you are back in the action quickly, but you don't feel like the game is helping you along when you haven't earned it yet. On top of all of this is a gorgeous art direction and one of the best soundtracks of any game in existence. The visuals and the sound bring this world to life in a way that gave me chills at moments. Hyper Light Drifter doesn't bore with dialogue boxes of text or hold your hand with combat tutorials. Instead, it treats you with emotional cutscenes and smart game design. It's cryptic and thought provoking. You get bits and pieces of information along the way which you can put together to form your own conclusions about the who, the what and the why. If you haven't played this game yet please do yourself and favor and buy it now!10/10			"

												If ARPG's are your genre, stop reading, and buy this game. This game has elements of 90's ARPGs like the Secret of Evermore that have made ARPG's my favorite gaming genre. Hyperlight Drifter uses a pixilated art style that is reminiscent of the 16-bit era without looking sloppy.  The story line is straightforward and mysterious, and dialogue is delivered in a series pictures. Never is a true word is spoken by any character in the game, but at no point are you as the player lost as to what is happening -- there is just enough of a push for you as a player to find out more. The game play is fun and addictive. As the drifter you are able to dash and slash enemies, or shoot the baddies with a plasma gun. The bosses are challenging and their defeat gives you a sense of reward when you finally crush them. I do have some issue with the controls: there are dashing puzzles that require precise timing to complete successfully. The game is unforgiving in this respect and can lead to explosive bouts of frustration. Also, I find that the controls have the Drifter prone to falling of cliffs (see aforementioned explosive frustration). The music complements the game well it provides the gameplay with an eerie ambience. Don't expect an epic music score. The music is more simple than the orchestrated pieces in blockbuster hits, but by no means is Hyperlight Drifter's soundtrack ineffective. Overall, I think this game is great. I love it.  A solid 9.5/10.			"

												This game is just great. It's best sides are great pixel graphics (I think best pixel art I've ever seen) and gameplay, it's really satisfying, it's quick, controlls are great and combat is challenging, fun and what I like the most, it's based on dashing system, so there is alot of movement in battles. There are a lot of secret areas, so exploring is rewarding. Bosses are also fun, though some of them are too easy. Storyline is, well it just is. Nothing interesting, and at least it's there. Soundtrack is nice, synthwave'y chiptunes and some ambient thrown into it.Would be also great if the game was longer, 8hours (probably like 10-12 if you want to collect all the crystals/gears etc, but I'm not a fan of completing in 100% games, I like to play on my own, without guides or checking every wall if there is a secret), but it's still ok.Overall, there are some cons, but really small ones. Art and gameplay makes this game really special.			"

 Hyper Light Drifter   Colour-Sound-Communictation This game does not come with a manual and I find that quite amazing. So far any question I've had about the gameplay or how things work, what I should be doing, where I should be going, etc... have all been answered in-game. I am impressed that this game seems to be able to translate ideas, emotions and incentive into any spoken language by the use of colour and sound alone. The world is enchanting. The soundtrack is reminiscent of an NES game, but made with the sensibilities of someone scoring a film in 2018. I love how the music encourages awe, suspense and a bunch of other feeling I've felt while playing but haven't put a ""word"" to, yet.The controls are smooth, and timing is critical. You have to keep on your toes and know how many times to hit, when to dodge and when to be daring.If you like future dystopias, or sword and sorcery style medieval settings, or if you are a fan of classics like Super Mario 2, an action fiend who enjoys Dark Souls, or even someone who just enjoys pretty pictures and surreal sound, this is a game for you!

 Hyper Light Drifter  is above every video game I have ever played in my entire life.Every single aspect of this game had me hooked on it the whole way through, and it was such a refreshing experience.Without creativity, passion, and purpose, there is no point to a video game, and  Hyper Light Drifter  defied this standard that has plagued the entertainment industry for quite some time now. - Enviormental storytelling enriches the experience, as players use their knowledge to decode the cryptic past of the ruined world they wander.- The combat is fluid and energizing, the enemies and bosses not to be underestimated. - There is always something to come back to after you finish your first playthrough.- The art and soundtrack are perfectly mesmerizing.After two playthroughs and one in progress, I can surely say that  Hyper Light Drifter  is a masterpiece.

												Old school Zelda mixed with Dark souls and instant respawning. Once you've killed your first boss and have a basic understanding of the combat this game is increadily fun and addicting. There are times where I died 30+ times but it wasn't anywhere near as frustrating as other difficult games can be, and it's super satisfying after each of the hard battles. The whole game is open world, you have complete choice over which area, boss, dungeon you play through and in what order. It adds alot to the game and feels like an actual world other than other top down games where you just keep going from town to town in different themed dungeons.Would highly reccomend using a controller though, since you can dash in more directions then you would be able to with a keyboard (something which is crucial during the boss fights).If you have a controller, and love games like zelda and dark souls, I would highly recommend it.

												Hyper light drifter is a cool, edgy and very diffreent game, that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do.The story is a cryptic one that tells itself through beautiful visuals of artwork and animated cutscenes with no dialogue or text to be seen at all. Even the characters in the game either speak with symbols, or the ones that do reveal some story of the world have a series of pictures that tell a story that you can come to your own conclusion about. All in all though the story is very mysterious and with every boss a little more is revealed.Exploration is also a big part of hyperlight drifter and more often than not hidden routs, upgrades even weapons can be found all over the place as well as story elements too. There have been many rewards that i have found throug out the world just by trying to walk into walls and stumbing into a whole new area that didnt appear to be on the map at all. When you find one secret area it urges you on to search for more giving you plenty to do outside of fighting bad guys.Now as beautiful the combat is, That combat it tough as nails at first, both on keyboard and game pad.Eeverythings very VERY fast paced and if you miss click by even one milisecond you are as good as dead. However this is a great thing and it keeps the combat fresh all the time because it keeps even the most insignificant enemies a genuine threat in medium to large groups. Even though the combat is very fast however, the way the controls work suggest that the player should stay calm and really think about what they are doing, especially during those boss fights.To summerise...Hyper light Drifter is a beautiful, well rounded and almost perfectly made game but if your not up to the challange this game might leave a sour taste in your mouth, and is definatly worth playing if your a fan of zelda and dark Souls.

												It is a beautiful piece of Art. It is a zelda-ish Action Adventure but for grown ups with a pecific retro Artstyle but the difference between typical indie Retro artstyles and this is that Hyper Light Drifter uses this artstyle to really build up a great atmosphere with many wonderful screenshot moments. If you like a challenging, zelda type of Action adventure this is the perfect choice and the Price is reasonable.The game is 100% worth its money and because there are many secrets to discover you also have a motivation to play this game even beyond the story.

												I am really glad that now this game is in 60 fps. I want to finish it both alone and in local co-op mode. After first 2 hours I am very pleased. This game is quite difficult yet I relax while playing it. Music is very atmospheric and fits well to the gameplay.Edit after 39hI love this game. Exploration is plessure. Combat is thrilling and fun.Finally, dashing skill is some extra-ordinary mechanics. The Dash Eternal!			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is pretty rad. I would pick it up on a sale though. The game isn't very long, and there is a lot of missing content that was promised with the Kickstarter campaign that funded the game. Maybe if these things come in the future It would be worth full price, but for now I wouldn't say so.Pros:-Fun-Difficult-Nice Visuals-Lots of secrets Cons:-Short-Story is pretty non-existant-Missing content			"

												-This game is just plain amazing.-The pixel art is amazing.-The color pallets used are amazing.-The music is amazing.-The storytelling without words is amazing.-The story itself is amazing and can be left to a wide degree of interpretation. (Reddit has some very interesting theories)-The game play, once you get over the fact that this is the farthest thing from a button masher and every movement and action really needs to be timed well, is amazing.This game is not easy at all, at first. It takes time and patience, trial and error, to really learn how to go about battling enemies and specifically bosses. But MAN is it worth the effort. At first I was okay at the game, or so I though, until I reached my first boss (I went north to the bird boss) and I just hated how hard he was so much that I almost rage quit and uninstalled but I really loved the game mechanics, the pixel art style, and the color pallets used so I just kept at it. Probably took me over 200 tries to finally beat him cause of how bad I was (I was still button mashing.) Definitely the hardest boss in the game but he really taught me how to play the game, to pay attention to every movement, from him and by me, and time my button presses. It really made me feel like I'm amazing at video games. Instead of mashing combos until everyone's dead I had to consider the consequences of every button press to the point that my decision making and efficiency really made me feel like a superior gamer.I rarely play games more than once or twice and I've played through this game 8 times already. I know every secret, where every item is, and I still enjoy playing this game every single time.I have NEVER before payed full price for a game on Steam but I did for this one and it was hands down worth every penny.

												I feel terrible in attempting to describe this game because I feel like it doesn't do it justice. It is kinda like a Zelda/Metroidvannia type of game. However you get most of upgrades needed to beat the game fairly early. It is really up to you and your ability to master the provided skillset to figure out how much you can find and how quickly you can reach the end.The more you explore, the easier the game becomes and the more you find out about the lore of the game.This package as a whole is fantastic. What stands out to me the most is the music, the artstyle, the combat, and the ""dialogue"".The music and ambient sounds work really well to establish a mood as you are playing through sections of the game. At times it is able to give me feelings of angst and fear without overwhelming bombast (which seemed to happen 100% of the time in Dead Space).The art (again, I hate giving analogies) reminds me a lot of Another World (AKA Out of this World). I guess it comes from how everything kinda appears like it is all drawn in pastel colors and in movement, you don't notice the details. I don't consider it a knock, I really love it. One of the clever things I found useful is that the character animations change when he becomes critically injured. While in combat my focus can be coned into my character at times and I'll forget to keep an eye on my health. Cues like that are useful. There is also an effect that occurs when a weapon with a cool down is available for use.The combat of this game is what breaks it away from the analogies I lead to describe this game. The camera is in a similar position to top down Legend of Zelda games, but the combat is more active than Zelda. Sometimes you can have dozens of mobs on screen and have to account for environmental factors for some combat scenarios. Depending on your current ablities, you can dash to dodge around or through fire, you can deflect fire, or you can shoot/attack them before they can attack you. When I die in combat, I rarely feel cheated and I'm already planning a new plan of attack while I'm dwindling down in health.I feel like the ""dialogue"" was a nice thing the developers put in with respect to the player who have possibly played hundreds of games with stories at this point. There is little to no text in the game. All dialogue is told in pictures. It is nice for many reasons: it avoids situations where story gets over analyzed and people can see every character has the same voice, an image says 1000 words and not everyone sees the same message, the player gets to set the actual dialogue in their own mind and it is even more powerful than in a book. You get to set the voice and the words taht have been said.The game is only improving since time has gone on: multiplayer, 60 fps, health container refills at checkpoints, ect. Has been included to improve the game further.I loved playing this game and I want to give it another go in the future.			"

												This one is not for the faint of heart. Hyper Light Drifter is challenging, and the checkpoints feel pretty spread-out. The minimalistic way in which the story is presented helps to push the player into exploring the world on their own while still clearly defining key objectives along the way.The gameplay is solid and engaging, fast-paced, and colorful.The game's environments are beautiful without being harsh on the eyes.Adoring the soundtrack.

The only downside is lack of much instruction and guessing what you're supposed to do, but it makes you explore and see more of the world. I've taken more damage by misjudging jumps and falling off stuff, then actual monsters.Still I love the game already and would highly recommend.			"

												When I got Hyper Light Drifter, I had been waiting months for it. I'd seen a good portion of the game played out.I'd seen maybe a 100th of the secrets found.I thought it would be one of my favorite games.Well, I'm pleased to say that after nearly 100%ing the game (I'm missing 2 gearbits which I'll find sometime later) and around 70 hours played, it is now my favorite, knocking Bloodborne down to #2. Here are the reasons why you may or may not find the same experience. A + means positive for me, a ~ means neutral for me, and a - means negative for me. You might think differently.+Every death is the player's fault. Doesn't matter what did it, it's possible to beat the game without losing a hit point.+The secrets are REALLY hard to find without a trained eye.+Bosses have a clear pattern which, even if you read it perfectly, can still catch you off guard.+It has fast paced combat.+The world feels like it fits together perfectly, yet incorporates a bunch of different environments.+It's full of synthesized music (electronic? Dunno what to call it)+There's no voice acting in the game, it's all images and environmental.+Outfits have effects, and you only need 1 of the 3 pieces to each (excluding a few) set to get the full yield!+There are control setups for PS4 & Xbox controllers, as well as Mouse and Keyboard.~The outfit that doubles your stamina (making most stamina-consuming moves plentiful in combat) is set behind an annoying challenge. This outfit is almost required for certain challenges (namely NG+, deathless combat).~Some areas go full bullet hell. (These are mostly secret areas, where projectiles are all over the screen)~New enemies are introduced simply as enemies. Some areas seem impossible at first, and take a bit to get used to.~You will die a LOT in challenge areas. Without experience, you'll die a lot everywhere actually. With practice you might never die.~Playing without a guide or checking each room at a snail's pace will mean you probably missed something.-Both the Drifter (player character) and enemies are nigh invisible behind certain buildings, like pillars in a certain challenge zone. It makes it EXTREMELY difficult to survive behind things the player can't see past.-Some areas have cliffs that aren't in view of the player. So you walk behind something and fall to your doom! (Lost 1 hp)-The natural feel of some upgrades is interrupted by certain limits. Once you're used to or even a master of the controls, these still feel a bit clunky and can mess you up. List:   After dodging three times (excluding chain dashes) there is a small waiting period before you may dash again.   The Sword Dash has VERY precise controls, and is easy to fail. Near walls it doesn't go through enemies like normal.   Grenades throw out with the accuracy of a bullet, but easily bounce off of stuff. You might want to bounce one past a corner, but without hyper-adjusting you'll simply bounce it into the hall and it'll stay there.-Some save areas cannot be triggered twice, or require some extra trigger to cause again. This can set you back a LOT with a death.I hope this was informative and helpful in deciding whether or not you should get the game, and to those who share my views, I whole-heartedly recommend this game.

												Hyper light drifter is a top-down pixel art adventure game featuring challenging gameplay and an interesting exploration system. Despite the absence of dialogue, the game tells a free for interpretation story only by the use of visuals. The game's biggest pros are, in my opinion, the gorgeous pixel art and detailed animation plus the amazing sound design and soundtrack. It's not a flawless game, but I believe it's a must have for the fans of the genre.			"

												Like OG Zelda set in a very mysterious alien world. Music and sound design were fantastic. The aesthetic may be a bit subjective, as I was initially turned off a bit by it. However I got used to it and eventually grew to love it. The timing required on the double dash skill was really challenging for me, and even though I got better at it, it remained frustrating throughout. It’s definitely not bad enough to make me not whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone though (it’s more than likely my lack of skill anyways). Love this game!			"

												TL;DR: Very fun game, absolutely worth the money. Challenging, without being ridiculously hard. I got this game because it looked very atmospheric and chill in the video. While the game is very beautiful, and has some atmospheric(ness) to it, it's definitely not very chill (which is fine). It can be quite challenging and nerv wrecking at times. The map was not done very well and can cause some headaches sometimes with figuring out where to go. So prepare to explore alot. Also, this game has no text in it. Meaning, no characters talk to you with text (only images) and the upgrades aren't described well. The upgrades not being described well is pretty annoying when you're first getting the hang of the game, but you'll figure it out eventually. All in all, absolutley worth buying. You'll enjoy it, I promise!Pros:Great soundtrackVery fun gameplayCool graphicsGreat controlsCons:Crashes once ever 2 hours or soDifficult to navigate with the mapUpgrades not explained well			"

												Believe the hype!Amazing game - but more or less requires you to get past the begining ""what do I do? where do I go? what's going on?"" type intro. For the most part I only have two gripes -I beat the game (though I didn't 100% it) and don't really know what's going on - so the story could have been a bit less vague.The game teaches you to try going into every corner to see if there might be a path there - because sometimes there are hidden paths. So often you end up licking walls to see if something's there.Both of these gripes are minor - and there's a great deal of coolness to the mystery of it, and a great feeling of satisfaction when you do find hidden paths. So I guess it just had to be this way more or less.			"

												This game came as real surprise.  It wasn't on my radar.  I hadn't even heard about it, then the other day it shows up in New Releases.  The trailer hooked me, as it looked like exactly my type of game, and I bought it without hesitation.Now once I started playing the game, it became clear that it was meant to be quite challenging, and I struggled with it at first.  I'm not terribly good at the sorts of games that list “high difficulty” among their selling points.  The game was still gorgeous, the atmosphere perfect, but I was frustrated by how often I died, and how easily an area with few basic enemies could kill me.  This further upset me, because I really wanted to see the whole game, and at first, it didn't seem like a game I would ultimately enjoy playing through.It didn't take me long, however, to start to get into the rhythm of the game.  Muscling my way through an area became very rewarding.  The checkpoint system is forgiving enough that you're never sent back too far, and the maps are FULL of secret areas with just the thing you need when you're getting kicked in the jimmies.  I had upgraded a few things (I started with the health packs.  Don't spend it on them, get sword or dash upgrades first) and was generally clearing most areas on the first or second try.Then came the first boss fight.  I said, “Hell yeah, I'm up for this!”  Twenty tries later, I was ready to fling my Steam controller through the TV.  I'd barely made a dent in his health.  I was furious, and far more aggravated than I had been hours ago when I first started the game.  I pretty much gave up on ever seeing the end of the game, and I put it down for several days.It occurred to me later that there didn't seem to be anything really preventing me from going and exploring other places.  The map is divided into 4 sections (each with its own boss) with the starting city in the middle, and it turns out that at the beginning you can go visit 3 of them.  There doesn't even really seem to be any set order they need to be done in, and you can really complete most of each area without actually beating any of the bosses.So now it's on.  I'm exploring every nook and cranny of the map, looking for cards (? whatever the upgrade currency is called) and spending them.  There are so many cleverly hidden (and sometimes beautiful) spots, and finding them is almost reward enough, but they also always contain health packs and/or cards.The variety of enemies is very impressive as well.  Most enemies are pretty weak, and go down with just a few slashes, but most of them can jump and move around almost as well as you, and it only takes a few of them to really crank up the challenge.  It's pretty thrilling to find yourself in the middle of an ambush, hopelessly slashing, flinging yourself around dodging and positioning for an advantage, and then coming out by the skin of your teeth.So having spent some time honing my play style and upgrading the protagonist, I made my way back to the first boss.  No doubt about it, he was still fairly challenging, but on my first attempt I had taken out a fair bit of his health before dying.  I persevered, and after about 5 more tries (each a little better than the last) I beat him.  Now I'm 37 (I'm not old), and I'm a little ashamed to say I was jumping up and down in my living room like a little kid.This was turning out to be among the best gaming experiences I'd had.  I had almost given up more than once, but I think that's what helped give me such a great sense of accomplishment upon returning and completing a given challenge.  I'm real glad I stuck with it through the end.  The setting is amazing, the world is vibrant with life and danger, and the trials and rewards along the way are a near perfect balance.Aside: The issues with difficulty that others are claiming are likely due to the unidirectional way we tend to play our games.  Having trouble with an area or a boss?  Go elsewhere for a while.  It'll still be here when you get back, and you'll be better equipped to handle it next time.The developers have also been very involved in the post-launch playtesting.  Not just for fixing bugs, but they've been engaged with us players tweaking and adjusting gameplay and taking our suggestions and concerns to heart with fast-turn-around updates.  They all deserve a major high-five.Edit:  New Game Plus is not what you think.  It's much harder.Another Edit:  Since I wrote this review, they have updated the game with couch-coop.  Playing it with a buddy is even more fun, and the way they implement it reveals an interesting dimension to the protagonist that I find intriguing.  It's not just that they added a second player, they actually put some thought into the story implications of having another character onscreen.  Superbly done.			"

												This game is one of my all time favourite games. It rivals pony island, the witcher 3 and the pokemon franchise for the top spot. The art is mystical and lends itself to the lack of voice/ text in the story. The gameplay mechanics are perfect. The flagging of attacks from foes allows for combonations of dodges and slashes that create a unique experince akin to that of the souls series. The exploration is fantastic and is made worth while by haveing items and skill points lying around unexpected corners. The boss design brings the combat into it's owns with some non flagged attacks and heavily flagged attacks really immersing you in the combat. The only complaint is that the controls can become a bit loose when using a controller and the game doesn't lend itself well to keyboard and mouse. The upgrade pathes make the combat even more fine tuned and create even more combos.The game has a very small tutorial at the start of the game teaching you the basics. It is a very hands off game in terms of help.The story is hard to follow but is told through little details and a repetion of things. Once you get the flow of it though you will understand it and there are plenty of videos on youtube giving a brief overview of the story.all in all I recommend this game to anyone who loves the combat of the souls series, Exploring lot's as your going to need to and someone who doesn't like long drawn oput tutorials.

												One of the best games I've ever played.First of all, it's gorgeous. There's a lot of retro pixel style games out there, but not many are crafted with this quality and attention to detail. Every pixel has been carefully placed. In a game with almost no dialogue at all, the artwork is more than just something to look at - it's a large part of telling the story of this world.Something that goes hand in hand with visuals - the soundtrack. And it is just as good, if not better, than the art. It creates a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere. Again, the attention to detail is astounding. This is a challenging game and you will die often, however, when you do, you'll notice the music doesn't skip a beat, keeping you immersed in your experience.Now, the most important part of any game in my opinion - the gameplay. It really wouldn't matter how beautiful the world was if the game was a chore to play. The game proves it's worth here by matching it's amazing art direction with tight, responsive controls, little to no load times, and zero performance issues. It's not a particularly complicated control scheme, but it's challenging and satisfying to master.Beautiful artwork, superb soundtrack, and challenging gameplay. This game is the real deal and in my opinion a masterpiece. If you're at all interested in these kind of old-school, metroidvainia/zelda-ish kind of games, go ahead and purchase. You won't be disappointed.			"

												This game is very challenging, but it doesn't feel unfair. It actually makes you feel really awesome, especially when you beat bosses or difficult rooms. The bosses are very well designed, and are just difficult enough that they take practice and a lot of effort and focus, but they aren't too much that they make you feel like quitting. Overall, it's a very challenging but rewarding game, and it doesn't hold your hand.The game would not be complete without its story. It is definitely one of the most intriguing parts about it, being given to you only in small pieces. Once I let it sink in after I saw the ending, the story and the meaning behind it became one of my favorite parts about the game. It really touched me.Hyper Light Drifter was all that I wanted and more. I'm very glad I played it! It's an experience I'll remember fondly.			"

												I'm definitely going to nominate  The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award to Hyper Light Drifter.I only heard about this game through a friend who was suggested to play it by another friend. I didn't see it a lot on Steam but this game really did captivate me from the first opening scene.The combat system is different, the art direction is interesting, and just the way the game functioned kept me immersed. The story was also pretty solid, and the progression was satisfying.			"

This is an amazing game...You know when you stumble across a game and think: 'You know, this game is pretty cool, it was worth paying the money.'Well with this game you think: 'Holy sh*t, this is fu**ing awesome, it was DEFINITELY worth buying that game!'There are a good amount of secrets so it'll promise a longer playtime, the fighting is amazing and you can take whatever direction you want! Wanna start in the left area? You can do it! Halfway through it and you wanna go in the upper area now? Guess what, just teleport back and go there!One of the best things about this game is the Pixelart...Everything just looks so awesome! Not only that but the ambiance ist so good!You have a spooky, dark theme in the underground, a friendly and calming theme in the main town, a mysterious theme in the woods and so on...Now I'm not saying that this game no flaws.The framerate seems to drop quite a bit from 60fps to 30fps or even less if you are in the main town or in other bigger areas.Upgrades are HARD to get, but I guess that's just the natural dificulty of the game.A Story is there, though I don't see it... What I'm saying is that the fact that there is NO talking AT ALL makes it very hard to understand what happened here.'Good sir would like an upgrade?' 'Yeah sure what upgrade?' 'I don't know, I just have a little video showing what it can do, without a real discription of what it actual is.'The last point I wann make in favor of this game is it's name... ""HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER""??? THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST BADASS NAME AFTER DOOM!!All in all, I can just recommend this game to EVERYONE who likes adventure and exploring games! Hope I helped you making the right decision for you, would be bad if you would take the left decision... I'm gonna go hang myself now...			"

I played this game using a controller after the 60fps Update was released. Don't use the coop feature, it's terrible and just gets in the way of enjoying the game.What should you expect? The game world is a beautiful, mysterious place with some nice variety in its setpieces. There is no fixed path, but a rough map, sub areas and some locked off doors ensure you don't get lost. Just poke at the enemies and feel out where you are comfortable to continue. Combat is fun and follows simple rules. There is a nice rythm to all actions and you will easily notice when you are doing the right thing. You need to learn enemy patterns and will greatly improve during your playthrough. The difficulty is challenging but not unfair. Plenty hidden items turn the downtime between enemies into exciting exploration. (If you want to) Upgrades provide character progression. Plenty upgrade points (and new guns) can be found along the way. They will gradually provide new combat, movement or defensive options.  A fitting story is told in sequences and some pictures, mostly left to interpretation.Speaking in terms of other games, imagine you mixed Dark Souls without the clunkyness and RPG elements, and A Link to the Past without puzzle rooms.

												This game is sooo damn good. If you like metroidvanias, hack-n-slashers, and great atmosphere (reminds me of Monument Valley), this is a must-buy. The controls are tight, the graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay will force you to channel your inner ninja and become a blur of slashes, shooting, and bombs to slay all in your path.My only real gripe is the story. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a vague story that you have to piece together through little hints and details, but I think this game forgot the ""piece together"" part. Even when you're fighting the final boss you don't really have a good idea of what it is and why you're fighting it.Regardless, my minor story gripe is vastly overshadowed by the incredible gameplay and fantastic atmosphere. Definitely recommend this one. "

												A powerfull game, with difficulty like dark souls, and the adventerous feeling of a zelda dungeon crawler, my hours into this game have been spent well.The music really gives a warm feeling of adventure as the combat is really emersive and face paced. Challanges await in this game, and every step is a feeling of victory, to grab that sweet precious loot.A few minor drawbacks are completley drowned out by the good in this game, all in all, the experience was wonderfullA true recreation of a hack and slash.

												I never thought I'd get into a twinstick roguelike, but this game is just too perfect.  The combat feels way too good to become frustrating to me like happens with most games.  A couple of combat scenarios tripped me up enough to where I died about a dozen times, but it never felt like it was the game's fault I wasn't doing good at it, which kept pushing me forward until I did beat them, which always felt good.  Each enemy is completely unique, and in addition all eight bosses had a classic attack pattern that never felt too overwhelming and could be figured out and overcome.  There aren't a billion stats to keep track of, like in some action-RPGs, and I didn't have to keep track of meters all over the screen like in RTSes.  For the most part I was only thinking about how many enemies were around me/where they were, and how much health the enemy I was fighting had.  I didn't have to glance up at the HUD to know I was low on health, because there are auditory and visual clues.  There are also other gauges like stamina and ammo, but I hardly ever thought about it.  You can upgrade your weapon's ammo capacity so that's not an issue, and the stamina thankfully only applies to special moves that you buy.  Point is, the game lets you focus on one thing at a time so the skill doesn't rely on any sort of multitasking ability, and I am infinitely grateful for that.  This game made me realize that my problem isn't with action games but rather with the other genres that are typically paired with action.  You don't need any prior experience to become a master.This game has beautiful graphics and wonderful sound design.  There's just no way to really capture it in words.  It's full of bright colors, but it's never overwhelming and nothing feels out-of-place.  It has pixel graphics, but not in the sort of way that a lot of games use ""retro"" graphics as a crutch for lacking skill.  Rather, this feels like each and every set piece was hand-painted, and later rendered into a style where everything is aliased; if you're playing at a 1:1 resolution to the source, you may be tricked into saying so.  It really doesn't seem to be trying to emulate an old graphic style, yet it achieves its own unique style that completely works for it.It's set in an open-world environment where you can go at your own pace.  There's no shortage of collectibles hidden throughout, as you'll find not a single room that doesn't have anything hidden somewhere.  But don't worry about finding them all on your first pass.  Only after beating the game did I pick up on the biggest visual clue that a secret is nearby.  And there are plenty of guides to help you out.  After going through the starting area, you're put in a village with some shops.  You can see what sort of stuff you can buy and start to think about it.  But you'll head off in one of four directions.  It doesn't matter which, really, the first one will be the hardest of the three as you haven't picked up on skills or gotten any upgrades yet.  That's fine, though.  If you happen to go south, realize that area's only unlocked after the other three.  I went right at first because it's my natural tendency, and happily it's the direction that gave me the weapon I've been using ever since.  I'm so happy this game achieved a good open-world feel to it, where I feel like I'm advancing through the world rather than the game pushing me forward as most linear games tend to go.The only thing this game is missing is online co-op, but considering the nature of it in this game hotseat co-op is completely natural and I don't expect online play of any sort to be added anytime soon.  I don't know how restrictive the Game Maker engine is anyways, I don't think it has network support of any kind.			"

												This game is one of, if not THE MOST frustrating game I've ever played. I was brought to my absolute boiling point numerous times during my playthough, especially while trying to beat the last boss (for the second time, becuase the game crashed during the credits).HOWEVER, Hyper Light Drifter is smooth, fun, fair, and incredibly pleasing to look at. Though I had more of an interest in simply beating the game, there is a suprising ammount of content. There's a lot of secrets to be found, guns to shoot, and quite a few outfits to boost your drifter in some way. Alternate paths to find gear bits, keys to open doors, and even a horde mode of sorts. All in all, I would definitely recommend this wonderful game. Plenty to do, plenty to get mad at, and plenty to have fun with. Do yourself a favor and get this game. Hyper Light Drifter is as much of an experience as it is a kick♥♥♥♥♥game.			"

												Very fun and atmospheric game.If you like both fast-paced, semi-challenging combat and exploration, this is the game for you.The use of sounds and music throughout the game really makes it immersive, and the vibrant colors in each area give the game a rather unique look.The game's story can be completed rather quickly once the player gets familiar with the controls but there's also a lot of hidden secrets and areas (even minigames) you can find, if you spend a little more time with the game.There's no (comprehensible) dialogue in the game, and the player has to figure out the story themselves with the help of NPC's giving clues through pictures and observing the environment itself. You could compare it to Dark Souls but with even less ""tutorials"".It's definitely worth the price, in my opinion. And if it's on sale, I would even recommend it as a must-buy.			"

Product received for free
												An Excellent game of combat and exploration, at the crossroads between Zelda and Dark Souls, with a magnificent pixel art that will remind you of Dungeon of the Endless, if you had the pleasure to play it. But with such inspiration, you should expect a solid challenge, so yea, prepare to die a lot and be frustrated by some achievements ... It's also one of these game with its own alphabet. suppose it's a trend now. i liked the way the scenery and the few npc you encounter tell the story, but i wish there was some text (well, there is, but you can't read it as it is ...) to get info about the equipment, the enemies, the lore. But that's really all i can find against Hyper Light Drifter ... Seriously, it's pretty damn awesome. Buy it at full price to support the devs if you can, i really want to see what they will do next.			"

												A great, well designed world to explore in an action, top-down fashion.The pixel art is beautiful, well designed and consistent in the game world. Personally, I think the graphics could have been a lot more beautiful without pixelation, and at times I was a little bit annoyed or sad about the pixelation, but that is subjective I guess, and not a show-stopper.The sound design and music is great.Progression is good, although mostly unguided. The world has visual cues about different things, paths, etc, and you will get additional abilities, although they are not introduced before-hand. You will discover them within the world, with a visual representation. This makes the game not a simple run-through or guided experience, but incontrary definitely adds to the plausible and consistent world and exploration aspects.It’s not an easy game. As you will not identify, find or solve everything on your first pathing, you will probably visit some places twice or more often.The world is well designed throughout, the world and story has room for interpretation, even beyond the playthrough itself (glyphs for translated texts etc). Everything is presented visually, some things, specifically combat and movement, is in no less presented with sound as well. Some scenes are very beautiful or even touching.If you like action games, an unguided but well designed exploration, and think you can handle fair/harder difficulty, this is definitely a great game to look at. A well designed experience throughout.			"

TL:DRI love this game, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it please.This game, as well as a select few others, have changed the way I look at games. I used to be one of those kind of gamers who played Call of Duty and went ♥♥♥♥ YEAH, SHOOTING! and all that, but after playing games such as Dark Souls, this game, and a little gem called Risk of Rain, it changed my perspective on video games.PROSThe music and the visuals of this game puts me at a loss for words. It's simply stunning. And once you figure out the lore behind the characters and the story itself, and how the game was influenced by the creator, The creator of this game actually was struggling with a fatal illness while he was making this game. It seems fitting somehow. you see the true beauty that is this game. Of course, we come to combat. It may be a little iffy at the beginning, and you may dash off and kill yourself a lot trying to dodge that one attack, but once you memorize your controls, as well as enemy attack patterns, you find yourself wiping the floor with these incompetent fools with grace, or sometimes with a decapitation.There's also a massive incentive to explore every nook and cranny of the map. I've only found half of the gear sets in the game, and I already beat the final boss.  I ♥♥♥♥ing hate Judgement with his charged beam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  Trust me, the gear you find in the game will be worth it if you put the time in.There's also a NG+ option, which cuts your health basically in half, and throws you against stronger enemies and bosses. A good challenge for those masochists.Then, once you've wrapped that up, there's a boss rush mode that allows you to challenge all the bosses in a timed run. You have limited access to healing supplies, and they don't respawn either. There are 3 modes for boss rush, but I'll let you figure that out on your own, should you buy this game.CONSNone. I couldn't really find a flaw in this game. I just liked it that much.			"

												This game is amazing. I don't write reviews very often, and I'm really picky with the games I buy. I do a lot of research prior to purchase. This game looked great on paper, but honestly it's 10 times better when played. The art, is amazing, and quirky. The characters, show detail. I LOVE how there are NO WORDS. The ENTIRE storyline/gameplay instrucitons are displayed through signals and it really lets your imagination fill in the gaps the same way a book does. It's really fun. Really action packed. Rewards curiosity. Honestly I'd argue this is probably one of the best games I've come across in the last decade. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU HAVE ASSIGNMENTS OR A HEAVY WORKLOAD IN THE NEXT  24 HOURS. MAY INDUCE BINGE PLAYING.			"

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game came out of nowhere and got its hooks in me.  One of those games in your library you don't click on right away but once you do suddenly it's 4 hours later.Great music, rock-solid controls, tons of secrets and replay value if you're into that, and it's ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful to boot.

												This game is one of my all time favourite games. It rivals pony island, the witcher 3 and the pokemon franchise for the top spot. The art is mystical and lends itself to the lack of voice/ text in the story. The gameplay mechanics are perfect. The flagging of attacks from foes allows for combonations of dodges and slashes that create a unique experince akin to that of the souls series. The exploration is fantastic and is made worth while by haveing items and skill points lying around unexpected corners. The boss design brings the combat into it's owns with some non flagged attacks and heavily flagged attacks really immersing you in the combat. The only complaint is that the controls can become a bit loose when using a controller and the game doesn't lend itself well to keyboard and mouse. The upgrade pathes make the combat even more fine tuned and create even more combos.The game has a very small tutorial at the start of the game teaching you the basics. It is a very hands off game in terms of help.The story is hard to follow but is told through little details and a repetion of things. Once you get the flow of it though you will understand it and there are plenty of videos on youtube giving a brief overview of the story.all in all I recommend this game to anyone who loves the combat of the souls series, Exploring lot's as your going to need to and someone who doesn't like long drawn oput tutorials.

												It's beautiful, it's fun, and it's definitely comparable to other amazing games such as Transistor, ABZU and Journey, in which gameplay is synonymous to art, and the player is expected to play the game without much preamble/instruction as most others are. The pastel/pixel style of this game definitely makes it stand out amongst the others in terms of its aesthetic, and the lack of clutter adds to the whole feel-good experience. Just as ABZU and Journey were, both the story and the controls are intuitive as well, and it's very easy to follow what needs to be done next.However, the drawbacks include things such as how insanely difficult the bosses are, and how there's a distinct lack of health packs around to keep you alive while you try to defeat enemies. One wrong button press, and you die, causing you to respawn at the very beginning of the area because the checkpoints are frustratingly spaced out in certain areas.This game's a solid 7/10 overall, rather than a 9 due to the difficulty of the combat. Otherwise, it's an amazing game, and it definitely has replayability value.			"

												People are comparing this to Dark Souls because that's the hot new thing to do now. And I would like to just say that they are waaay off the mark with that comparison.If you are looking for a modern day version of the classic NES Legend of Zelda then this is it. It's darker, tough and beautiful. I should be bannishing this game to 30fps hell but I can't. I just have so much enjoyment from exploring the world that this team created to trrying to figure out the lore on my own and wondering what the weird symbols mean. It's as the mysteriousness of FEZ snook up into Hyrule.The music itself is moody and at times strangly relaxing. It reminds me of meditation music, when you play this you'll be full of zen while slashing and shooting uniquely designed creaters. If you like classic tough NES games like, Contra, Zelda or something like Faxanadu, then this should belong in your library.			"

												Take Zelda; add a strange alien setting, some wub wub music, and Bloodborne's combat. Toss it all in a blender and hit start and you get Hyper Light Drifter. The game goes for a more ""artsy fartsy"" approach to storytelling with slide shows instead of text. But oh the hidden secrets, I've found hidden rooms within hidden rooms within hidden rooms. The 30 FPS cap does kill my throbbing erection this game's combat gives me but that's literally my one and only complaint. Verdct: It's slick, it's fast, it's fun and stylish as all hell.			"

												This game is an amazing work of art that more people should play.The combat is fast and fluid and complex its more like a dance if anything as you dodge around your enemies delivering swift sttrikes then taking a couple potshots at another while waiting for the tell that their going to attack. Not to mention once you clear  room full of enemies you fell like a complete badass.The scenery in this game is aww inspiring and bleak. Wheteher your looking out over the last remaining city or stareing down one of the titans courpse in the distance only to come and see it upclose further along in your travels it is just amazing.The music is amazing and spot on it does a great job of setting the atmosphere of your adventure adding to the sence of exploration and danger so prevolant in this games world.The story is ambiguos and doesnt tell you much. But it stays with you, it will make you want to look up and learn more about this world. As you look up hints and speculations as to what happened long ago there.My only real complaint is that one of the minigames (the one where you have to dash around) is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and needs to be made easier. It stops being skill after a while and devolves into tedium as you look for ways to make it easier out of frusteration where the best solution is to make scripts or chage your control scheme so u just have to press one button correctly literally 800 times.But besides that its a great game that everyone should own. Its well made and amazing with so much of the creators heart in it if you'll excuse the pun.10/10			"

												A mix between Zelda and Hotline Miami and dark souls, Hyper Light Drifter brings lots of exploration and high octane fighting. If you are a fan of these games, then I recommend you consider this game.Story wise your given the option to pay attention to the story, or skip it and head straight into combat which I appreciate. The game is not story driven per say, has more of a dark souls subtly which I can deal with but could be a deal breaker if you enjoy good stories. Story The exploration is amazing as you travel through 4 areas each with their own unique environments, enemies and secrets. Dungeons have lots of variety and play exactly like Zelda, do not expect an open world game expect a dungeon crawler. There are secrets hidden around the map but you don’t need to find them all to complete the game, backtracking and trying to find all the secrets without a guide adds more length to the games play time. Although I do wish there were more areas to explore, you will spend a lot of time going back and forth looking for secrets and credits. Story Combat feels genuine, the difficulty is comparably to dark souls where you must learn the attack patterns of enemies to be able to get the best results. Combat is like Hotline Miami you have your guns and melee weapons, although I do wish there was a little more variety in the weapons the upgrade system does make up for this giving the game more mechanics to learn.  Good game, play for an hour to see if the game is right for you.			"

												Very fun and atmospheric game.If you like both fast-paced, semi-challenging combat and exploration, this is the game for you.The use of sounds and music throughout the game really makes it immersive, and the vibrant colors in each area give the game a rather unique look.The game's story can be completed rather quickly once the player gets familiar with the controls but there's also a lot of hidden secrets and areas (even minigames) you can find, if you spend a little more time with the game.There's no (comprehensible) dialogue in the game, and the player has to figure out the story themselves with the help of NPC's giving clues through pictures and observing the environment itself. You could compare it to Dark Souls but with even less ""tutorials"".It's definitely worth the price, in my opinion. And if it's on sale, I would even recommend it as a must-buy.			"

This is an amazing game...You know when you stumble across a game and think: 'You know, this game is pretty cool, it was worth paying the money.'Well with this game you think: 'Holy sh*t, this is fu**ing awesome, it was DEFINITELY worth buying that game!'There are a good amount of secrets so it'll promise a longer playtime, the fighting is amazing and you can take whatever direction you want! Wanna start in the left area? You can do it! Halfway through it and you wanna go in the upper area now? Guess what, just teleport back and go there!One of the best things about this game is the Pixelart...Everything just looks so awesome! Not only that but the ambiance ist so good!You have a spooky, dark theme in the underground, a friendly and calming theme in the main town, a mysterious theme in the woods and so on...Now I'm not saying that this game no flaws.The framerate seems to drop quite a bit from 60fps to 30fps or even less if you are in the main town or in other bigger areas.Upgrades are HARD to get, but I guess that's just the natural dificulty of the game.A Story is there, though I don't see it... What I'm saying is that the fact that there is NO talking AT ALL makes it very hard to understand what happened here.'Good sir would like an upgrade?' 'Yeah sure what upgrade?' 'I don't know, I just have a little video showing what it can do, without a real discription of what it actual is.'The last point I wann make in favor of this game is it's name... ""HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER""??? THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST BADASS NAME AFTER DOOM!!All in all, I can just recommend this game to EVERYONE who likes adventure and exploring games! Hope I helped you making the right decision for you, would be bad if you would take the left decision... I'm gonna go hang myself now...			"

I do think that a bit more could have been done to shed light on the story, but I will admit that I am only 3 hours into the game. I love the art style and the smooth gameplay. The ability to dash or ""drift"" in all directions adds a new dynamic to the gameplay and combat and is quite refreshing to see. It is not an easy game. Took me quite a while to defeat the first boss, but it makes winning feel rewarding. Something about this game makes it so addictive. It is one of those games that is easy to pick up and play but hard to master. It leaves you wondering and wanting more.			"

TL:DRI love this game, ♥♥♥♥ing buy it please.This game, as well as a select few others, have changed the way I look at games. I used to be one of those kind of gamers who played Call of Duty and went ♥♥♥♥ YEAH, SHOOTING! and all that, but after playing games such as Dark Souls, this game, and a little gem called Risk of Rain, it changed my perspective on video games.PROSThe music and the visuals of this game puts me at a loss for words. It's simply stunning. And once you figure out the lore behind the characters and the story itself, and how the game was influenced by the creator, The creator of this game actually was struggling with a fatal illness while he was making this game. It seems fitting somehow. you see the true beauty that is this game. Of course, we come to combat. It may be a little iffy at the beginning, and you may dash off and kill yourself a lot trying to dodge that one attack, but once you memorize your controls, as well as enemy attack patterns, you find yourself wiping the floor with these incompetent fools with grace, or sometimes with a decapitation.There's also a massive incentive to explore every nook and cranny of the map. I've only found half of the gear sets in the game, and I already beat the final boss.  I ♥♥♥♥ing hate Judgement with his charged beam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t  Trust me, the gear you find in the game will be worth it if you put the time in.There's also a NG+ option, which cuts your health basically in half, and throws you against stronger enemies and bosses. A good challenge for those masochists.Then, once you've wrapped that up, there's a boss rush mode that allows you to challenge all the bosses in a timed run. You have limited access to healing supplies, and they don't respawn either. There are 3 modes for boss rush, but I'll let you figure that out on your own, should you buy this game.CONSNone. I couldn't really find a flaw in this game. I just liked it that much.			"

												I bought this game on an impulse. I looked at it, and I thought it looked like an easy, fun way to spend a few hours on a Zelda-like adventure. I was compleatly correct in buying it, but oh so wrong about why. This game is essentially a piece of art. It is elegant, smooth, and simplistic, while also being tough, gritty, and downright difficult. It is truly wonderful.Pros: - Great concept, the dashing mechanic makes your character feel lightweight, making it engaging to dodge attacks.- Gorgeous pixel art, seriously I dont think I've seen a more beautiful game than this in a while. The colors of the different sections of the game have a serious effect on you. For instance, the light greens and the blue of the water in the eastern area make the setting feel free and open, while the dark blues and purples of the west make the area feel repressed and dark.- Wonderful soundtrack, the creative electronic sounds add a certain weight to the music that I haven't heard from anything else.- Tells you virtually nothing except how to execute basic actions. Nothing about where you're going, why you're going, or how you're going. This allows you to create you're own reasons for doing what you do, and to really think about what is really going on. This is an idea that is becoming popular in today's gaming, like Undertale or any of the Telltale games, but this game presents the idea in a different way. Instead of making you choose what you're doing, it makes you wonder why you're doing it.Cons:- While the lack of direction in the game is extreamly well done in most places, there's a few things I wish were more clarified. For instance, the goal in the first three areas of the game is to acquire four of these little white diamond things to progress to the boss fight. This is not made clear to the player, and it took me a good amount of time to figure out what was happening and what I was supposed to do. Also, the first three areas can be completed in any order you like, but this was somewhat confusing and it left me with a feeling of doubt as to what I was doing was the correct thing to do. While I found these to be problem areas of the game, I'm sure some people would really appreciate these features, so remember this is only my opinion.- Some of the boss fights, to me, felt much easier than others. I feel like this would be ok, if they approached the game without letting you complete the first three areas in any order, but if they implemented that mechanic then they should have balanced the fights more. For example,  I completed the first three areas in this order: North, East, then West. Out of those three bosses, the North was the most challenging for me, the West the second, then the East by far being the easiest. The North and West bosses I spent at least an hour to two hours trying to complete, and when I finally beat them I had already memorized all of their attack patterns. However, I beat the Eastern boss in one try, and it barely attacked once before I killed it. It was so easy that I thought for a good thirty seconds that the real boss was going to pop out and kill me. But that was the actual boss. The North and West bosses are probably equal in difficulty, and the North boss was probably harder for me because I fought him first, while with the West I already had experience with the game, but the East boss was just stupid easy.Conclusion: While the cons section may appear thick with critisism, most of that writing is explanations for why I disliked a tiny detail. In all, those details do very little to affect the whole game, which is truly a masterpeice. I strongly reccomend purchasing this game, and I hope to see more from this developer in the future.Verdict: 9.5/10			"

												This game is amazing. I don't write reviews very often, and I'm really picky with the games I buy. I do a lot of research prior to purchase. This game looked great on paper, but honestly it's 10 times better when played. The art, is amazing, and quirky. The characters, show detail. I LOVE how there are NO WORDS. The ENTIRE storyline/gameplay instrucitons are displayed through signals and it really lets your imagination fill in the gaps the same way a book does. It's really fun. Really action packed. Rewards curiosity. Honestly I'd argue this is probably one of the best games I've come across in the last decade. DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU HAVE ASSIGNMENTS OR A HEAVY WORKLOAD IN THE NEXT  24 HOURS. MAY INDUCE BINGE PLAYING.			"

												Pretty awesome game. The comabt system is fun. Too many collectables in my opinion. The world is very detailed , the story feels really shallow though, even with all the stuff decyphered.The last boss is kind of disappointing. But it was fun overall so:75/100Also they are still rolling out updates! FPS lock didn't bother me at all.			"

												Pros: - Great combat mechanics, challenging.- Beautiful art style, everything looks gorgeous and inspired.- Amazing soundtrack.- Doesn't hold your hand, but still intuitive and easy to learn.- Minimalistic storytelling.Cons: - 30 FPS makes it feel clunky and not as responsive. Especially annoying during boss fights.- Minimalistic storytelling.			"

												First off, 10/10 gfx and sound blah blah. Congratulations Heart Machine, you've made audio/visual heroin.Hyper Light Drifter seduces you with it's shimmering prismatic graphics like a dancing peacock in heat, and it plays somewhat like filling your mouth with Pop Rocks, putting on a pair of cushy headphones, and letting someone stomp on your nuts.I spent the better part of an hour exploring, dashing about, and collecting hidden treasures while occasionally slashing at a monster or two. At one point I actually wondered if maybe we'd all been so distracted by the glittery package that we'd bought a game with no real content.And then I spent the next two hours swearing. I had fun, yes. I even laughed aloud. ...out of frustration after I cleared a gauntlet of nonsense and stopped to breathe a sigh of relief, when suddenly a bullet from offscreen! Splattered brains. The end. But yeah, there was certainly a ton of swearing.But that's because it just doesn't let up! Geez, Heart Machine! It's like someone's holding you down and tickling you until it's not funny anymore, and you're yelling ""STOP!"", and they won't stop, so you start to panic and get violent.So far, I'm in love with the game. I'm desperately hoping I'll be able to get enough upgrades and maintain head-to-wall-slamming stamina long enough to finish it. But I'm gonna be honest, if you're just in it for the artwork, and you don't like games that hold you down and tickle you until you're choking for air and wondering if maybe this is how your life ends... you might not enjoy it.There's a delicious buttery satisfaction in overcoming an obstacle that you've lost to over and over. Everytime you die, you learn a little, and you progress. But like many of the other reviewers have said, it's not a merciful game and it won't hold your hand.Much love to Heart Machine. Your passion and care for this game is apparent. Absolutely recommend.			"

												Vivid, sumptuous, suggestive, and detailed art. Ambiguous, ethereal story. Evocative, atmospheric, perfectly-matched music. Exacting combat, punishing of mistakes, requiring tight timings that naturally develop against the low-level enemies and optional environmental challenges. Bosses that teach strategy and awareness with each death.One of my favorite games.			"

												A wonderful blend of 2D Zelda adventuring and Dark Souls-esque world building. In Hyper Light Drifter, you are thrust into a post-apocalyptic world filled with once-great vistas, now reclaimed by the elements. As you travel in search of a seemingly forgotten foe, the aforementioned bringers of the apocalypse, you meet others who have accepted their existence in this world: those torn from their families, those who choose to continue the fight, and those who, like nature, reclaim as much of a hopeful life as they can. The game tells this story through evocative visuals and a mellow soundtrack, intentionally foregoing any dialogue or any sort of readable text. While at times this led to frustration, I ultimately found it to add to the charm and mood of the game. The interface and map are understandable from experimentation, as well as finding out how to progress your goals within the game. Thus, Hyper Light Drifter chooses to prop itself up using gameplay, which generally involves dash-dodging with swordplay and light gunplay elements. While your main source of damage comes from your gun, your ammo is charged by using your sword. This results in an aggressive gameplay style that encourages you to dash in to use your sword on weak enemies so that you can pick off stronger enemies with your guns. This gameplay flow, with the addition of light platforming elements, the occasional boss, and a variety of upgrades, easily stays fresh throughout the 8-10 hour adventure. Ultimately, Hyper Light Drifter is for those looking to explore an interesting world with an implied narrative. It's a combat heavy game that can be challenging and that holds plenty of secrets and winding paths. For those looking for fast and fun 2D combat backed by polished pixel-art graphics and a moody soundtrack.Sidenote: I also tried co-op, and it actually plays pretty well with the 2nd player being a 'shadow' character that can die but steals life from the 1st player when they spawn. The 1st player remains control of progress and of life kits etc. It feels a little tacked on, and definitely adds to the craziness of some of the battles, but it works well and is a lot of fun.			"

Some might be turned off by its lack of written and spoken narrative, but I personally find it the most intricate and masterful method of storytelling.So if you want to delve into a solid 8 hour-adventure that this game is, prepare to be overwhelmed by its gorgeous art and sound.

Hyper Light DrifterRelease Date: March 31st, 2016Genre: Pixel art / Indie / Hack n' SlashPrice: $19.99Demo: NoInput: Keyboard+Mouse / GamepadLength: ~7-9 hoursRating: 10/10Review: Hyper Light Drifter is a real piece of work, from the moment I started I knew I was going to enjoy this. The pixel art style is well crafted and outstanding, combat is fluid and responsive (specially on 60fps), and the storytelling through pictures couldn't have been done better. Although some bosses feel lackluster and are easy to take down if you play aggressively, I definitely look forward to eating those words when I revisit this game in the future with new game + and boss rush.

												Imagine yourself diving into an interactible living pixel painting, choking on gooey sprites and getting tangled in shiny particles and coughing out dazzling ornamental textures. That's how your experience with Hyper Light Drifter will be like.PROS:  -Storytelling. It's suffocating your curiosity with its humble storytelling style and lack of explanations, but those mysteries and some glimpses of understanding how this world works make you move further, exploring the surroundings of your character. This game will leave you puzzled for few days straight after you've finished it, and you will have an urge to read fan theories and so on to calm your head down.-Aesthetics and design. If you like the aesthetics of such ""not-explained"" worlds, like ICO had, for example (imo this game is really influenced by ICO's stylistics), then you will like this game aswell. Also it gives me vibes of The Heart of Darkness and 80-s cyberpunk. -Graphics. Graphics are minimalistic-looking but dont let that fool you. Animations are done extremely well and smooth, almost everything around you is not 100% still, it doesn't look cheap or dull. Reminds of Heart of Darkness' animation style, where it was pixelated too but really well done.-Gameplay. Very fair battle mechanics, you won't feel bad for dying because you will understand it's your own fault and not the game being unfairly difficult, so repetitive deaths will not deplete your motivation. Game world feels ""free"" though it's actually pretty linear in its exploration route, there are a lot of secret areas to explore and additional things to do. Gameplay is really smooth and not boring, it feels somehow satisfying and not repetitive.-Music and sounds. Mostly it's ambient-like music, but it fits the game so amazingly that you  can't stop playing. Sounds are incredibly pleasing, I had so much enjoyment hearing the SE of the ""diamond module"" you pull out off ground on different parts of levels and also  the ""rifle gun"" sound.CONS:- Length. It's really short; has replayability but still, i expected it to be longer.- Difficulty. Inability to choose higher difficulty right off the bat as I first installed the game was a bad thing for me. You're forced to clear it on normal first.- Bugs. There are a plenty of bugs in this game, including areas you can get stuck in if you dash there in curiosity to find a a secret and enemies damaging you while you're in menu sometimes, though game is constantly updated and cleaned up. My biggest concern is the button change bug, where you can't quit to game title if you changed your default confirmation button to something else.- Controls and ability timings. Purchased powerup controls are weird or maybe it's just me, it just feels inconsistent. E.g. there're two different powerup abilities: a slash-through (mb+space) and slash-push (space+mb) and their timings are so weird that it's sometimes really hard to pull it off mid-combat. Same goes for dash invisibility window, really weird timing. Those are the only things that frustrated me through gameplay.Overall: I'd rate this game 9/10, one of the best things that i've played in a while. Definitely recommending it.			"

												What more can be said of this game that hasn't been said already? Hyper light drifter is truly special. It clearly takes elements from other fan favourites like Zelda and Dark Souls as inspiration and repackages them as something fresh without being a mere rip-off; but it also brings its own beautiful art, music and world to the table. Every component of this game is well executed, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is up for a relatively challenging game.			"

Posted: July 14, 2016
												Main Explanation: (skip to bottom for quick overview)I picked up this game 1) because i saw it in a video stating its origniality. and 2) because I've had my eye on it for a little while. personally i liked this game you may see that i only have 7 hours when the game costs £15 i did finish the campaign but i didnt complete all the secrets ect. I liked hyper light drifter, quite a lot actually. it requires you to thikn about the story, not a huge huge huge amount but enough to where the story isnt simply handed to you on a silver platter. As for the story it can be a little bit different for everyone because you may infer certain events in different ways. I quite like this aspect of the game because if you have a friend that has also played the game i can garuntee you will end up talking to them about what they think happened, which can lead to an interesting discussion. The gameplay is smooth, espectially the combat which i have to admit is one of the best systems I've seen in a while, making it as equally satisfying as it is challenging. while the game isn't overly difficult you will die, and you will have to try again at some point. Boss battles are especially good in hyper light drifter as they ramp in difficulty as the game goes on and not just in the cheap ""more health, more damage"" cheap difficulty. Things get harder to dodge and move sets get less predictible, you will feel an acomplishment when you down the next one you find. In terms of progression, HLD has a LOT of secrets almost too many infact which would be one of my complaints... if they werent so easy to find most of them. There is a special symbol that appears wherever a secret is to be found, making them rather easy to locate once you get an eye for it. Obviously, you won't see all of them and you will find yourself backtracking to find something a few times while playing. This can be fustrating if you have gone through the same area a couple times and still cant find what your looking for. But if you pull through eventually finding it can feel amazing. Unlockables are a big thing in HLD including weapon upgrads, costumes and firearms. I won't go over all of them as there are too many but there are quite a few for you to find. This adds a lot of depth to the game and finding a hidden costume or gun can help you out a lot in the longrun depending on how it fits your playstyle. The music in HDL is also very good and fits with the game perfectly creating an ominous, mysterious tone, because of this i would also recommend the soundtrack for the game.In the short:Pros: Combat- extremely fluent and fast paced, enough to keep you quick on your feet.Story- while not obvious it does get you thinking and it portrays it in an original way. Progression- it always feels like your getting somewhere in HDL as you always discover things you missed.Music- fits great with the game and helps to immerse you.Cons: Almost too many secrets- towards the end finding a secret feels a lot less like an achievement and more so like a task.Backtracking- this isnt necessarily a bad thing, it can just be a little fustrating when you have been through the same area more than 3 times and still cant find what your looking for.Conclusion: HDL is an interesting, fun take on an RPG adventure game with a story and soundtrack to fit it well.Overall: 11.5/13			"

												This game is absolutely astounding from a stylistic perspective. The pink and purple hued post-apocalypse the Drifter explores is mysterious, dangerous, and full of secrets to explore. The game never explicitly tells you what the goal is, but I didn't think it was so obtuse that it was impossible to figure out. The four giant arrows in the middle of town are at once subtly intuitive and blatantly obvious - go here and find something shiny, but we won't tell you how to get to it. The game encourages trial and error and exploration, and you will find an astounding number of hidden things. I think the most exciting thing about this game, from a mechanical standpoint, is that every upgrade is optional. There are tons of hiddens paths that will lead to all manner of upgrade materials and new costumes, which could potentially make your life easier. However, you can complete the game without ever finding one of these secrets or buying anything from the shop. Even if you dig up every possible upgrade, there is no super weapon that will allow you to cut through enemies; timing and patience can get you all the way to the credits. I bought this game because I thought the name was cool and the graphics were pretty. What I got was a tightly packed experience that echoes Zelda and Secret of Mana, with a satisfying modern spin on the formula. A note for people who are worried about the difficulty: I am not someone who enjoys retro looking games that are super hard like whatever NES title they are trying to ape. This game certainly has its challenging moments, but it is far from insurmountable, and certainly doesn't revel in controller-breaking difficultly spikes. If you have patience to learn how to effectively utilize the sword, gun, and dash mechanics, the game will be an absolute joy to play.			"

												A+If you're unsure if you should buy this game or not, it's 100% worth the buy. Waiting to purchase Hyper Light when it's on sale is honeslty not worth waiting for. Just buy it, it's too good to wait for. The game is definitely challenging and will have you at the edge of your seat druing combat. You WILL die! It's inevitable. The only way to survive in Hyper Light is by combining and making use of ALL your skills to defeat the enemy while trying to stay agile enough to take as little damage as possible. If the mobs don't kill you, the environment will. Play the game smart, use the environment meant to kill you to your advantage and try to pull mobs back before charging in after them. If that doesn't seem like enough, Hyper Light, being a 16-bit game, has beautiful color, combined with it's sort of eerie music, really draws in the player to make you want to keep playing. I deleted my profile just so I could rewatch the intro to the game twice before setting sail into Hyper Light Drifter. Yes, it was that good of an intro. I give this game a rockin' 10/10.			"

												The good:This game has the same sense of mystery and exploration from old-school Zelda.The frantic, fast-paced combat is reminiscent of action-RPGs like Diablo and DMC.Like Dark Souls, this game is extremely challenging. Even basic enemies kill you very quickly and caution is advised when entering new areas.The pixel art in this game is beautiful. Lots of mysterious geometric glyphs, and contrasting blue/pink pastel colours.The bad:This fast-paced action game is locked to 30fps, which could cause discomfort.If you have poor reaction times or lack patience, this game will frustrate you.The weird:Similar to Dark Souls, this game has little in the way of dialogue or exposition. The story is told through pictures, the environment and vague cutscnes.This game lacks clear instruction about the objectives, requiring the player to figure out what to do and where to go from enviromental cues, exploration and trial/error.

												Feels a bit like Zelda with the exploration aspect.Movement and combat feel a little clunky early but it smooths out once you learn how it works and buy a few upgrades in town.Overall fairly simple, but it has enough neat little mechanics and good gameplay to carry it.+art is great+sound is nice+gameplay is good+indirect story and exploration is enjoyable-UI (could be better, but not critical)			"

												A wonderful blend of 2D Zelda adventuring and Dark Souls-esque world building. In Hyper Light Drifter, you are thrust into a post-apocalyptic world filled with once-great vistas, now reclaimed by the elements. As you travel in search of a seemingly forgotten foe, the aforementioned bringers of the apocalypse, you meet others who have accepted their existence in this world: those torn from their families, those who choose to continue the fight, and those who, like nature, reclaim as much of a hopeful life as they can. The game tells this story through evocative visuals and a mellow soundtrack, intentionally foregoing any dialogue or any sort of readable text. While at times this led to frustration, I ultimately found it to add to the charm and mood of the game. The interface and map are understandable from experimentation, as well as finding out how to progress your goals within the game. Thus, Hyper Light Drifter chooses to prop itself up using gameplay, which generally involves dash-dodging with swordplay and light gunplay elements. While your main source of damage comes from your gun, your ammo is charged by using your sword. This results in an aggressive gameplay style that encourages you to dash in to use your sword on weak enemies so that you can pick off stronger enemies with your guns. This gameplay flow, with the addition of light platforming elements, the occasional boss, and a variety of upgrades, easily stays fresh throughout the 8-10 hour adventure. Ultimately, Hyper Light Drifter is for those looking to explore an interesting world with an implied narrative. It's a combat heavy game that can be challenging and that holds plenty of secrets and winding paths. For those looking for fast and fun 2D combat backed by polished pixel-art graphics and a moody soundtrack.Sidenote: I also tried co-op, and it actually plays pretty well with the 2nd player being a 'shadow' character that can die but steals life from the 1st player when they spawn. The 1st player remains control of progress and of life kits etc. It feels a little tacked on, and definitely adds to the craziness of some of the battles, but it works well and is a lot of fun.			"

												One of, if not the best, indie games of 2016.Beautifully crafted story of a lone wanderer in a ruined world, that could be interpreted in a hundred ways. Some might be turned off by its lack of written and spoken narrative, but I personally find it the most intricate and masterful method of storytelling.So if you want to delve into a solid 8 hour-adventure that this game is, prepare to be overwhelmed by its gorgeous art and sound.

												From the hour or so that I've played as of now, I can say that though the story is a tad convoluted and at times difficult to comprehend due to the way the game is played, the game is extremely solid; combat feels intense and exciting as well as fluid in motion, the art style is simply stunning and blurs the line between simple game graphics and masterful pieces of art, the mechanics are very easy to understand and very simple, yet very fun, et cetera.  If you're planning on buying this game to understand and enjoy a massive story filled with secrets and the like this game isn't for you. There is no dialogue; any story points are spoken through images. I have played very little but from what I've seen I want to keep playing for a long while. This game proves that a story does not define a product completely, something which is necessary to be said with games forcing stories into situations where they aren't needed, which is a common sight to behold in games nowadays.

												It's beautiful, it's fun, and it's definitely comparable to other amazing games such as Transistor, ABZU and Journey, in which gameplay is synonymous to art, and the player is expected to play the game without much preamble/instruction as most others are. The pastel/pixel style of this game definitely makes it stand out amongst the others in terms of its aesthetic, and the lack of clutter adds to the whole feel-good experience. Just as ABZU and Journey were, both the story and the controls are intuitive as well, and it's very easy to follow what needs to be done next.However, the drawbacks include things such as how insanely difficult the bosses are, and how there's a distinct lack of health packs around to keep you alive while you try to defeat enemies. One wrong button press, and you die, causing you to respawn at the very beginning of the area because the checkpoints are frustratingly spaced out in certain areas.This game's a solid 7/10 overall, rather than a 9 due to the difficulty of the combat. Otherwise, it's an amazing game, and it definitely has replayability value.			"

												People are comparing this to Dark Souls because that's the hot new thing to do now. And I would like to just say that they are waaay off the mark with that comparison.If you are looking for a modern day version of the classic NES Legend of Zelda then this is it. It's darker, tough and beautiful. I should be bannishing this game to 30fps hell but I can't. I just have so much enjoyment from exploring the world that this team created to trrying to figure out the lore on my own and wondering what the weird symbols mean. It's as the mysteriousness of FEZ snook up into Hyrule.The music itself is moody and at times strangly relaxing. It reminds me of meditation music, when you play this you'll be full of zen while slashing and shooting uniquely designed creaters. If you like classic tough NES games like, Contra, Zelda or something like Faxanadu, then this should belong in your library.			"

												I would call this game something along the lines of a isometric view Darksouls type of game. The combat however frantic it gets is still exhileratting. The visual design is astounding since usually smooth pixle aimation like this is hard to come by, and the fact that the game shows you how the environment has changed has led to players like me experience goosebumps at certain parts if one chooses to explore deeply engough. So /i highly reccommend Hyper Light Drifter, it may not tell you its story through words, but it will still make you shiver.			"

												 I am here for the ones that have doubts about buying this game. I'll start by saying that i am a sucker for hard yet rewarding games plus this is my second review. And this game conviced me just after the 3-4 battles i did witch feel weighty and satisfying even though they where just lesser spiderlings! Slashing anything just feels so good! Your character feels hefty and i could platfom my way through the game endlessly just because of this.  The combat is a mix of ""Serious Sam"" mind gymnastics (enemies are aproaching and you have to time your attacks, hit and run patiently.) The enemy patterns and the loot that is scattered sometimes in anorthodox places also gives a roguelike aesthetic to it minus the perma death of course. Now about the Souls dudes who came here after hearing this game is Souls like. Yes this game has a different aproach of bringing you just about the same amount of difficulty and challenge. The visuals scream detail and quality! Every bit of this game is a pleasure to stare at and just made me feel immersed to this stunningly colourful world. Overall this game lived up to my expactations and its worth every penny no doubt about it! And yes the other reviews are not overexaggerations this game is wonderful and a great experience. I feel like its money well spent Dont miss out when its on sale if you can afford it, its a safe bet! P.S.For those interested this game was made as a tribute to one of the creators who has a heart disease. As great as the game is this is also a neat medium for him to share it by. I strongly suggest you to watch the video of the devs motivations for this game before jumping into it. It gives a great amount of depth.			"

												Just beat the game and it left me breathless with its beauty. A great experience and I'm sure I'll be soon trying out new game+ in search for more. The style of this whole game is so lovely.The world is immersive and all over supports the gameplay very well. It is addicting to try and explore every nook and granny for the numerous secret areas and collectibles. That being said sometimes I did get lost in the convoluted areas, trying to remember where everything was and where I hadn't yet been. Trying to find all the secrets without a walkthrough proved very difficult. To help these issues I think the map could be better. Coming to a new place, it'd be great if known rooms would have a different color tint to the unvisited ones. Maybe the map could even mark rooms that have been 100% explored, lessening chances of lingering about in wrong places. Might just be my inner completionist here, but I found myself thinking of these things in frustration as I scanned room after room in case I missed something.  Still overall those are minor gripes, mostly having to do with my playstyle. In my opinion this game was well worth the price. I actually regret I didn't get it sooner, because it was such an enjoyable ride. Hopefully there's more games in store for us from Heart Machine. "

												This game was one of the best experiences in gaming I've had. Reminded me of the talent that goes into indies.Hyper Light Drifter is expertly crafted in many areas. The gameplay is punishing to the player, but equally rewarding. The game rewards perserverance and paitence. Looking around and keeping your eyes peeled often gets you good loot. The soundtrack adds much to the game's experience. The music is mostly solemn and has a low tone, and this aids the player in understanding what the Drifter(who you play as) is going through. I personally also find the art in this game to be amazing, as the game uses a vibrant color pallete to create eye candy. The story in the game is heavily up the the player's interperetation. You're the one who's supposed to figure out what exactly is going on. In short, Hyper Light Drifter provides an amazing experience for players who enjoy great soundtracks, art, and punishing but rewarding gameplay.  "

												Very interesting game. Metroidvania mechanics with a unique ammo system. The background art, full of long-dead giants from an msterious conflict prior to the story, fits well with the character sprite animations. While current progress leads me to believe that there are only four worlds, they each have very unique designs that sert themselves apart from one another. The nonverbal narrative and ambient soundtrack make this a great game, whether you're looking to just chill and explore a reshaped world, or use combos to wipe out rooms of enemies. The best advice anyone could give when playing this game is to watch for symbols on the ground or hug walls in case you discover a secret room!			"

												This is an excellent game that reminds me of games like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 6 and other classic adventure/RPG games. The graphics are very original and nicely drawn. It has a retro feel to it without feeling old in any way. The gameplay is amazing. The controls are perfect (although like in many other games the corrupt game makers decided to only allow 2 brands of controllers to work, but you can get around it the usual way). I really enjoyed that story elements were not presented by text, but instead by drawn pictures about what the person is saying. The only really negative thing about the game would be that the story is unclear and vage. You start with a confusing opening and then you're like ""ok what the heck is my goal?"". I discovered the story watching a youtube video about the game where they said the story is ""your character is sick and you need to find a cure"" well actually I never thought of that to be honest. I just realized while playing that there are some triangles to be collected all over the map to fight some endbosses. That's all I can really say about the story of the game after beating it today. So if the story was just a little clearer it would have been 10/10 but like this I'd say 9/10.			"

												Somehow, at the impossible, tripped-out non-euclidian intersection between Link to the Past, Diablo, Fez, Hotline Miami, Dark Souls, Transistor, and Megaman Zero... Some game devs spilled their blood, sweat, and tears to make a game. But the blood grew into forests of fractal trees, and the sweat crashed like lightning and thunder, and the tears painted it all in black and red and green and neon pink.And thus, Hyper Light Drifter was released.And there was much rejoicing.

												Great game. Aesthetically pleasing with the pixelized graphics and the gameplay is fun. The soundtrack has some really great songs that fit the mood of the area your in. It starts off slow and doesn't really give you a direction to go, so be prepared to run around mindlessly a lot or consult to a guide. It is also more difficult than you think, you have to pay close attention to your health bar or you will find yourself on way less health than you think. The most frustrating part is the puzzles. They can be very annoying at times as the map you are given is not very detailed and just gives you a general idea of what is around you. The puzzles often lead you to optional things like upgrade square things, but the hardest ones are always when you have to get the diamonds which are required to progress. I find myself a lot going up and down and back tracking a ton because I missed a secret passage that was barely noticable. I wouldn't even call them puzzles because they are more of you searching for the right place to go and checking every corner for a passage way. If you can get past frustrating ""puzzles"" than this is a great game. Good music, gameplay, combat is extremely fun, and very visually pleasing. It provides you with an okay amount of hours, it's taken me 6.6 hours to almost complete the game on normal, but you can replay the game once you beat it on a different mode for extra challenge. Overall great game though, masterfully put together.!PLAY ON STANDARD MODE BECAUSE IF YOU PLAY ON NEWCOMER, A LOT OF ACHIEVMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO YOU!			"

												I have only played for around 3 hours but I know for a fact that I will be playing this game more and more as time goes on. It seamlessly mixes elements of The Legends of Zelda and Dark Souls while staying very different from the titles mentioned.  While playing, you will soon realize that the game will not help you in the slightest. It sends you off on your own, exploring the beautiful and unique world that Hyper Light Drifter has created. You will learn over time that trial and error will be your best friend in this game. I am loving the game and will play it until i run out of health packs!9.7/10			"

												A great, well designed world to explore in an action, top-down fashion.The pixel art is beautiful, well designed and consistent in the game world. Personally, I think the graphics could have been a lot more beautiful without pixelation, and at times I was a little bit annoyed or sad about the pixelation, but that is subjective I guess, and not a show-stopper.The sound design and music is great.Progression is good, although mostly unguided. The world has visual cues about different things, paths, etc, and you will get additional abilities, although they are not introduced before-hand. You will discover them within the world, with a visual representation. This makes the game not a simple run-through or guided experience, but incontrary definitely adds to the plausible and consistent world and exploration aspects.It’s not an easy game. As you will not identify, find or solve everything on your first pathing, you will probably visit some places twice or more often.The world is well designed throughout, the world and story has room for interpretation, even beyond the playthrough itself (glyphs for translated texts etc). Everything is presented visually, some things, specifically combat and movement, is in no less presented with sound as well. Some scenes are very beautiful or even touching.If you like action games, an unguided but well designed exploration, and think you can handle fair/harder difficulty, this is definitely a great game to look at. A well designed experience throughout.			"

												I never thought I'd get into a twinstick roguelike, but this game is just too perfect.  The combat feels way too good to become frustrating to me like happens with most games.  A couple of combat scenarios tripped me up enough to where I died about a dozen times, but it never felt like it was the game's fault I wasn't doing good at it, which kept pushing me forward until I did beat them, which always felt good.  Each enemy is completely unique, and in addition all eight bosses had a classic attack pattern that never felt too overwhelming and could be figured out and overcome.  There aren't a billion stats to keep track of, like in some action-RPGs, and I didn't have to keep track of meters all over the screen like in RTSes.  For the most part I was only thinking about how many enemies were around me/where they were, and how much health the enemy I was fighting had.  I didn't have to glance up at the HUD to know I was low on health, because there are auditory and visual clues.  There are also other gauges like stamina and ammo, but I hardly ever thought about it.  You can upgrade your weapon's ammo capacity so that's not an issue, and the stamina thankfully only applies to special moves that you buy.  Point is, the game lets you focus on one thing at a time so the skill doesn't rely on any sort of multitasking ability, and I am infinitely grateful for that.  This game made me realize that my problem isn't with action games but rather with the other genres that are typically paired with action.  You don't need any prior experience to become a master.This game has beautiful graphics and wonderful sound design.  There's just no way to really capture it in words.  It's full of bright colors, but it's never overwhelming and nothing feels out-of-place.  It has pixel graphics, but not in the sort of way that a lot of games use ""retro"" graphics as a crutch for lacking skill.  Rather, this feels like each and every set piece was hand-painted, and later rendered into a style where everything is aliased; if you're playing at a 1:1 resolution to the source, you may be tricked into saying so.  It really doesn't seem to be trying to emulate an old graphic style, yet it achieves its own unique style that completely works for it.It's set in an open-world environment where you can go at your own pace.  There's no shortage of collectibles hidden throughout, as you'll find not a single room that doesn't have anything hidden somewhere.  But don't worry about finding them all on your first pass.  Only after beating the game did I pick up on the biggest visual clue that a secret is nearby.  And there are plenty of guides to help you out.  After going through the starting area, you're put in a village with some shops.  You can see what sort of stuff you can buy and start to think about it.  But you'll head off in one of four directions.  It doesn't matter which, really, the first one will be the hardest of the three as you haven't picked up on skills or gotten any upgrades yet.  That's fine, though.  If you happen to go south, realize that area's only unlocked after the other three.  I went right at first because it's my natural tendency, and happily it's the direction that gave me the weapon I've been using ever since.  I'm so happy this game achieved a good open-world feel to it, where I feel like I'm advancing through the world rather than the game pushing me forward as most linear games tend to go.The only thing this game is missing is online co-op, but considering the nature of it in this game hotseat co-op is completely natural and I don't expect online play of any sort to be added anytime soon.  I don't know how restrictive the Game Maker engine is anyways, I don't think it has network support of any kind.			"

I love that there is not voice, the game only leaves you a few clues as to who, where you are and what you're supposed to do.  the combat is very challenging but very well balanced when playing with a controller (not impossible with keyboard but will make the gunplay a bit frustrating) and I'll say it again, it seems the game is silent and yet it's a joy to listen at every moment, zelda level sound design, yes I said that ! so enchanting !

I played this game using a controller after the 60fps Update was released. Don't use the coop feature, it's terrible and just gets in the way of enjoying the game.What should you expect? The game world is a beautiful, mysterious place with some nice variety in its setpieces. There is no fixed path, but a rough map, sub areas and some locked off doors ensure you don't get lost. Just poke at the enemies and feel out where you are comfortable to continue. Combat is fun and follows simple rules. There is a nice rythm to all actions and you will easily notice when you are doing the right thing. You need to learn enemy patterns and will greatly improve during your playthrough. The difficulty is challenging but not unfair. Plenty hidden items turn the downtime between enemies into exciting exploration. (If you want to) Upgrades provide character progression. Plenty upgrade points (and new guns) can be found along the way. They will gradually provide new combat, movement or defensive options.  A fitting story is told in sequences and some pictures, mostly left to interpretation.Speaking in terms of other games, imagine you mixed Dark Souls without the clunkyness and RPG elements, and A Link to the Past without puzzle rooms.

												A mix between Zelda and Hotline Miami and dark souls, Hyper Light Drifter brings lots of exploration and high octane fighting. If you are a fan of these games, then I recommend you consider this game.Story wise your given the option to pay attention to the story, or skip it and head straight into combat which I appreciate. The game is not story driven per say, has more of a dark souls subtly which I can deal with but could be a deal breaker if you enjoy good stories. Story The exploration is amazing as you travel through 4 areas each with their own unique environments, enemies and secrets. Dungeons have lots of variety and play exactly like Zelda, do not expect an open world game expect a dungeon crawler. There are secrets hidden around the map but you don’t need to find them all to complete the game, backtracking and trying to find all the secrets without a guide adds more length to the games play time. Although I do wish there were more areas to explore, you will spend a lot of time going back and forth looking for secrets and credits. Story Combat feels genuine, the difficulty is comparably to dark souls where you must learn the attack patterns of enemies to be able to get the best results. Combat is like Hotline Miami you have your guns and melee weapons, although I do wish there was a little more variety in the weapons the upgrade system does make up for this giving the game more mechanics to learn.  Good game, play for an hour to see if the game is right for you.			"

This is an amazing game...You know when you stumble across a game and think: 'You know, this game is pretty cool, it was worth paying the money.'Well with this game you think: 'Holy sh*t, this is fu**ing awesome, it was DEFINITELY worth buying that game!'There are a good amount of secrets so it'll promise a longer playtime, the fighting is amazing and you can take whatever direction you want! Wanna start in the left area? You can do it! Halfway through it and you wanna go in the upper area now? Guess what, just teleport back and go there!One of the best things about this game is the Pixelart...Everything just looks so awesome! Not only that but the ambiance ist so good!You have a spooky, dark theme in the underground, a friendly and calming theme in the main town, a mysterious theme in the woods and so on...Now I'm not saying that this game no flaws.The framerate seems to drop quite a bit from 60fps to 30fps or even less if you are in the main town or in other bigger areas.Upgrades are HARD to get, but I guess that's just the natural dificulty of the game.A Story is there, though I don't see it... What I'm saying is that the fact that there is NO talking AT ALL makes it very hard to understand what happened here.'Good sir would like an upgrade?' 'Yeah sure what upgrade?' 'I don't know, I just have a little video showing what it can do, without a real discription of what it actual is.'The last point I wann make in favor of this game is it's name... ""HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER""??? THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST BADASS NAME AFTER DOOM!!All in all, I can just recommend this game to EVERYONE who likes adventure and exploring games! Hope I helped you making the right decision for you, would be bad if you would take the left decision... I'm gonna go hang myself now...			"

												Imagine yourself diving into an interactible living pixel painting, choking on gooey sprites and getting tangled in shiny particles and coughing out dazzling ornamental textures. That's how your experience with Hyper Light Drifter will be like.PROS:  -Storytelling. It's suffocating your curiosity with its humble storytelling style and lack of explanations, but those mysteries and some glimpses of understanding how this world works make you move further, exploring the surroundings of your character. This game will leave you puzzled for few days straight after you've finished it, and you will have an urge to read fan theories and so on to calm your head down.-Aesthetics and design. If you like the aesthetics of such ""not-explained"" worlds, like ICO had, for example (imo this game is really influenced by ICO's stylistics), then you will like this game aswell. Also it gives me vibes of The Heart of Darkness and 80-s cyberpunk. -Graphics. Graphics are minimalistic-looking but dont let that fool you. Animations are done extremely well and smooth, almost everything around you is not 100% still, it doesn't look cheap or dull. Reminds of Heart of Darkness' animation style, where it was pixelated too but really well done.-Gameplay. Very fair battle mechanics, you won't feel bad for dying because you will understand it's your own fault and not the game being unfairly difficult, so repetitive deaths will not deplete your motivation. Game world feels ""free"" though it's actually pretty linear in its exploration route, there are a lot of secret areas to explore and additional things to do. Gameplay is really smooth and not boring, it feels somehow satisfying and not repetitive.-Music and sounds. Mostly it's ambient-like music, but it fits the game so amazingly that you  can't stop playing. Sounds are incredibly pleasing, I had so much enjoyment hearing the SE of the ""diamond module"" you pull out off ground on different parts of levels and also  the ""rifle gun"" sound.CONS:- Length. It's really short; has replayability but still, i expected it to be longer.- Difficulty. Inability to choose higher difficulty right off the bat as I first installed the game was a bad thing for me. You're forced to clear it on normal first.- Bugs. There are a plenty of bugs in this game, including areas you can get stuck in if you dash there in curiosity to find a a secret and enemies damaging you while you're in menu sometimes, though game is constantly updated and cleaned up. My biggest concern is the button change bug, where you can't quit to game title if you changed your default confirmation button to something else.- Controls and ability timings. Purchased powerup controls are weird or maybe it's just me, it just feels inconsistent. E.g. there're two different powerup abilities: a slash-through (mb+space) and slash-push (space+mb) and their timings are so weird that it's sometimes really hard to pull it off mid-combat. Same goes for dash invisibility window, really weird timing. Those are the only things that frustrated me through gameplay.Overall: I'd rate this game 9/10, one of the best things that i've played in a while. Definitely recommending it.			"

												This is an excellent game that reminds me of games like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 6 and other classic adventure/RPG games. The graphics are very original and nicely drawn. It has a retro feel to it without feeling old in any way. The gameplay is amazing. The controls are perfect (although like in many other games the corrupt game makers decided to only allow 2 brands of controllers to work, but you can get around it the usual way). I really enjoyed that story elements were not presented by text, but instead by drawn pictures about what the person is saying. The only really negative thing about the game would be that the story is unclear and vage. You start with a confusing opening and then you're like ""ok what the heck is my goal?"". I discovered the story watching a youtube video about the game where they said the story is ""your character is sick and you need to find a cure"" well actually I never thought of that to be honest. I just realized while playing that there are some triangles to be collected all over the map to fight some endbosses. That's all I can really say about the story of the game after beating it today. So if the story was just a little clearer it would have been 10/10 but like this I'd say 9/10.			"

												Great game. Aesthetically pleasing with the pixelized graphics and the gameplay is fun. The soundtrack has some really great songs that fit the mood of the area your in. It starts off slow and doesn't really give you a direction to go, so be prepared to run around mindlessly a lot or consult to a guide. It is also more difficult than you think, you have to pay close attention to your health bar or you will find yourself on way less health than you think. The most frustrating part is the puzzles. They can be very annoying at times as the map you are given is not very detailed and just gives you a general idea of what is around you. The puzzles often lead you to optional things like upgrade square things, but the hardest ones are always when you have to get the diamonds which are required to progress. I find myself a lot going up and down and back tracking a ton because I missed a secret passage that was barely noticable. I wouldn't even call them puzzles because they are more of you searching for the right place to go and checking every corner for a passage way. If you can get past frustrating ""puzzles"" than this is a great game. Good music, gameplay, combat is extremely fun, and very visually pleasing. It provides you with an okay amount of hours, it's taken me 6.6 hours to almost complete the game on normal, but you can replay the game once you beat it on a different mode for extra challenge. Overall great game though, masterfully put together.!PLAY ON STANDARD MODE BECAUSE IF YOU PLAY ON NEWCOMER, A LOT OF ACHIEVMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO YOU!			"

Some game devs spilled their blood, sweat, and tears to make a game.

												Missing out on playing this game or at least trying it is just outright criminal, in my opinion. Hyper Light Drifter has some of the best combat mechanics, enemy placement, level design, visual style and cinematography I've ever seen in any game I've played to date. From what I've seen (which is nearly 2 full playthroughs), this is a very demanding game that really wants the player to be aggressive, yet methodical and adaptive. It wants split second reactions and well though out manuevers simultaneusly and it gets that out of you whether it be by kicking you into a room full of high damage enemies or sudden pitfalls or excrutiatingly difficult bosses, needless to say, it's a very difficult game ESPESCIALLY on NG+ when you have only  1/3 of your normal amount of heatlh but its all worth it because of the beautiful animations and satisfying vibrations and noises when ever you cut an opponent down which is one of my favorite parts of the game (and why I haven't blown my own brains out), it's absolutely astonishing to me how amazing the animations are in this game. This sort of game is absolutely perfect for me, I've always been a rather aggressive player when it comes to Action RPGs as well as a few other genres of video games so if your like me in that regard then holy♥♥♥♥♥♥dude get in on this. But moving aside from the combat another thing with this game that really grabs my attention is its world buidling and its storytelling. The entire game's narrative is told visually, there's no dialogue, at least of any language we can understand and it's communicated in an inherently abstract kind of way considering it relies on set pieces and staging as well as a few images every now and again which is a pretty risky thing to do considering people can interpert the story in different ways but I'm pretty sure that was the intention. I think it works beautifully. Like I said before the level design is absoluteley perfect, there's a ridiculous amount of secrets hidden in each area of the game so much so that it seems impossible for me to find all of it even though I've owned the game for nearly a year now. The game is chock full of rooms with goodies that you wouldn't know even existed if you didn't notice a slightly ajar pixel. Every detail of the enviornments from the looping pathways right down to the positioning of enemies not only works as a way of conveying to the player the histories of the enviornments they explore but also progress the narrative in a very natural pace. It's a very engrossing method of storytelling that's punctuated by Disasterpeace's phenominal soundtrack which really commands a somber and macabre tone to match the game's imagery as well as seemlessly adapt to whether or not the player is in combat. There was a whole lot of talent and love put into this game and it really shows and I think it's the idyllic tale of a crowd funded game to me, they really didn't put any of the people's money to waste making it and delivered something that was better than I expected and that's saying something because it looked damn good before it came out. Hyper Light Drifter is most definitely one of my favorite games of all time and I seriously implore people who want a challenging game with some interesting concepts to pick it up and at the very least dip your toes in for a little while.

												I bought this game while it was 50 percent off...so I am a wee bit biased. Anyways, I have been playing this game for a little while now and oh my goodness.I couldnt be happier with it.So lets start with some of the great things about this gem of a game.First off, the 16 bit artwork works fantastic with this 2D hack and slash game. Esspecially with all of its super bright and neon colors.Next, the animation for everything, the sword, the gun, and the dashing looks wonderful. Even with the pixel art, the transitions and animation are extremely smooth.The music is really good as well. Each area has different music that I believe matches the tone of each area quite nicely. This game offers a really good level of difficulty which means you probably wont finish it right away which is nice and there is PLENTY to explore and find. Lots to discover. If you dont do some eploring, you wont learn more about the general story of the game.Each area has its own enemies which are quite different and require slight changes to fighting style. Although certain areas have a mix.I honestly cant even mention all of the good things about this game, there are too many.Moving on to some not negatives but not really...more like parts I guess didint quite satiate my gaming heart...So this game has wonderful music and all...but there is no dialogue. All the characters make are grunting noises. Now I know the game campaigned a little bit on the fact that it ""told a story without voice"" however, you only get a few characters you can interact with and each time you do you get a small comic. I feel that at my point currently, the stories from each character are different and not necesarily brought together. Now im hoping that as i continue to play and find more characters more will be revealed...On this matter I will probably update once I have finished the game.Although each area has its own enemies, currently I feel as though most of them can be defeated relatively easy and in the same fashion. There arent a ton of upgrades for your character...a total of 6 main ones along with being able to switch out weapons (i think. I have not been able to do that yet at my stage)The collectibles needed for upgrades are difficult to find and sometimes even more difficult to acquire due to the fact that if you die with one on before a save its gone...and most of the time they drop in mini boss like areas so you die frequently.Other than that I look forward to decipphering the story on my own. This game seems to offer alot of replayability in finding hidden stuff, extras etc. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a story a little bit on the mysterious side. The intro is amazing btw...I will update this review after I have finshed the game...until then the more negative part of this review will probably be a bit biased/untrustworthy.Like this if you want Heart Machine to release another well made hack n slash like this one!

												Moody, beautiful action explorer. Garbage boss combat--had to cheat engine through some of them after the hundredth crappy death. The game is great except for the Dark Souls-style impossible boss fights. I recommend it, but not if you don't have a ton of patience for learning and executing on boss patterns.			"

												 I am here for the ones that have doubts about buying this game. I'll start by saying that i am a sucker for hard yet rewarding games plus this is my second review. And this game conviced me just after the 3-4 battles i did witch feel weighty and satisfying even though they where just lesser spiderlings! Slashing anything just feels so good! Your character feels hefty and i could platfom my way through the game endlessly just because of this.  The combat is a mix of ""Serious Sam"" mind gymnastics (enemies are aproaching and you have to time your attacks, hit and run patiently.) The enemy patterns and the loot that is scattered sometimes in anorthodox places also gives a roguelike aesthetic to it minus the perma death of course. Now about the Souls dudes who came here after hearing this game is Souls like. Yes this game has a different aproach of bringing you just about the same amount of difficulty and challenge. The visuals scream detail and quality! Every bit of this game is a pleasure to stare at and just made me feel immersed to this stunningly colourful world. Overall this game lived up to my expactations and its worth every penny no doubt about it! And yes the other reviews are not overexaggerations this game is wonderful and a great experience. I feel like its money well spent Dont miss out when its on sale if you can afford it, its a safe bet! P.S.For those interested this game was made as a tribute to one of the creators who has a heart disease. As great as the game is this is also a neat medium for him to share it by. I strongly suggest you to watch the video of the devs motivations for this game before jumping into it. It gives a great amount of depth.			"

												This is by far one of my favorite games on steam, but that's what I always say. These pixel graphics are what makes the game scenic and appealing. It is also a difficult game that requires you to adapt everytime you go somewhere new, like early in the game turrets fire at you and you can't destroy them. Another thing is the combat system; when fighting off light groups of enemies you can't just hack and slash, you must slash and wait a second and then hack and then wait a second and rinse and repeat. I also like the story, no words or boring cutscenes.			"

												What am I doing?I'm not sure exactlyWhy am I doing this?i have no clueIs it fun?absolutely.This, is Hyper Light Drifter. An absolutely  BEAUTIFUl  little indie game where you go around slashing stuff and then shooting stuff. Not a single word is spoken in this game, the most text you will see is a simple line of text during the tutorial, no NPCs speak to you at all, but instead, give you a lil slideshow of images for you to interpret if they have anything important to ""say""I would highly reccomend anyone who wants an interesting game to play for a little while to buy this game, It'll last for around 10 hours on easy mode and will definitely be worth your time. by the way, did i mention that this game is not easy?

												The first thing that one notices on Hyper Light Drifter is its presentation. There is beautiful pixel art with a colorful palette and great atmospheric music with a slightly depressing mood to enhance the feel of a post-apocalyptic world.    You're someone with a disease which usually ends up with you coffing blood, and you're stalked by a strange black creature. There isn't much in the way of story here, but your goal is to activate certain structures throughout the gameworld in order to open a door. To do this you have to explore and usually defeat each area's boss.    The combat itself is really good. You're armed with a sword and a pistol, and you get more guns and sword moves as the game progresses. Apart from this you have a dash, 5 hitpoints and 3 medkit slots. Most enemies can do 2 HP worth of damage in a hit or stagger you long enough to do the same or more, making this a fairly difficult game to play.     Still, you're nimble and fast, and even though most encounters are hard they can be done after a few retries when you've already understood the enemy moves, ala Dark Souls. The game uses a checkpoint system and enemies do respawn when you return to an area, so the similarity is there.    Overall, it's a pretty fun game to play. The combat feels responsive and deadly, and exploration is both pleasant due to great visuals and sound, and rewarding.			"

												Great quality game. The music is captivating, the graphics pleasant to look at for hours, and the gameplay is smooth as silk. There's never a point in the game where I blamed the game for any failure I encountered. The difficulty is just right where you'll get upset from time to time, but never upset enough to quit. Just frustrated enough to know you can do it. Which you can.The amount of easter eggs and collectibles is also astonishing for a game that you would, at first glance, assume to be rather stale and empty. But the world of HLD is anything but.If you enjoy a challenge, a beautiful yet simplistic art style, as well as a captivating story with no dialogue, this game is one of the few diamonds that weren't neglected by its developers. And it shows.			"

												I was psyched about this game's art since the kickstarter, but I was hesitant to buy it because of the difficulty. So far, I am hanging in there. The bird boss took me a lot of tries but I got him by playing really conservative and then getting lucky when he started to turn half the floor into damage. I am a starcraft player so I know how to twitch, but hitting the chain dash timing is 50/50 for me on a good day, because I am always trying to activate the 2nd dash too soon (For those who haven't yet tried the game, this technique allows you to link dodges together without any cool-down time, but has an absurdly short activation window short of like wavedash or L-cancel in smash). Without dependable chain dashes, you have to be very conservative in your fights. Working hard to abuse enemy AI... Reminds me of playing video games as a kid again; it makes me feel clumsy. However, when you finally beat a hard room, it feels very rewarding... Carcasses don't fade away so when you're done you get to see exactly the body count you racked up. Sequences that have ravaged you again and again will suddenly give way to your ninja rampage when things finally click. Sword-swipes draw pistol energy from creatures, lending a cinematic run-and-gun flavor. The sprite and texture quality match the vintage zelda that inspired the creators, and the color palette and sound design eclipse their roots. It is a dark, dreamy, fractured hyrule, where ruin reigns in every sector, figment of a wind fish on acid. Though I can already say the game was worth the money, I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥as hell that the cape that broadens the chain dash timing window is hidden on the other side of one of the most feindish chain dash puzzles in the game. So you have to prove mastery of the punishing mechanic before having the constraints eased. "

												I don’t usually write game reviews, but I’ve enjoyed Hyper Light Drifter so much I feel compelled to do so. Additionally, I’ve taken care to keep this review spoiler free.At first glance the gameplay is familiar, and is something akin to A Link to the Past. This coupled with the old-timey graphics gives it a nostalgic feel, but HLD is much more than a reskinned Zelda clone. First, the game is challenging and at times down right hard. However difficult, I found the game to be fair. In fact, HLD rewards good planning and practice. For instance, practicing timing drifts/attacks, and making thoughtful use of each firearm will make or break some fights. There were some battles that I was simply overwhelmed the first couple of attempts at them, but after some reflection and planning, I would breeze through what I previously thought to be near impossible.What struck me next was that HLD is an explorers dream come true. The game is packed full of secret areas to uncover. In these areas could be anything: new customs, currency, weapons, or something more mysterious. In fact, the element of mystery and discovery is a major theme in HLD. The story in HLD is not told in a simple spell it out for you sort of manner. Quite the opposite actually.  Instead, you are left to piece together cryptic clues about the broken world your character lives in. Again HLD reward being thoughtful and meticulous. It is entirely possible to traverse the entire game and not understand what is happening.Finally, the world is perhaps my favorite aspect of HLD. The music and the masterfully crafted zones invoked powerful emotions. At times I felt excitement, wonder, but also sorrow. By the end of the game I felt connected to the world, its inhabitants, and most importantly compelled to uncover its darkest mysteries (an ongoing process for me and many others). Really my only complaint is that of any great gaming experience, the journey while enjoyable is over far too soon.TLDR: Hyper Light Drift has great music and pixel art, is challenging but fair, and drops you into a mysterious shattered world that begs to be explored end to end.

												a Zelda-esque world with the vagueness & mystery of Dark Souls, and the peaceful, ambient atmosphere of Fez. Hyper Light Drifter's vividly imagined, post-apocalyptic sci-fi world is brought to life with some of the best looking pixel-art you could hope to find in a game, and a brilliant ambient soundtrack courtesy of Disasterpiece. The attention to detail on display in each of HLD's 4 areas is astonishing, with all its strange creatures and enemies animated to perfection, and numerous secrets always hidden just out of the corner of the screen. Every inch of game's world seems to provide clues to its lore.Despite HLD's peaceful appearance, it quickly becomes apparent that the game's combat is brutally unforgiving. It's reminiscent of a top-down, faster-paced Dark Souls. Go into the game with the mindset you would go into a Dark Souls game with, and you'll gradually start to learn enemy patterns, work out how to deal with large groups of enemies, know when to attack and dodge. The more your play improves and the more abilities your character unlocks and upgrades, the more enjoyable and satisfying the combat becomes, as you dash around the screen, reflecting enemy bullets and slicing rockets in half, dodging enemy swipes and responding with your own. The boss battles are also a joy, and represent the steepest challenges of the game. If you are used to the bosses of Dark Souls, of hitting your head against a wall over and over until you learn the boss' patterns and how to deal with them, you will be right in your element here.The game can be frustrating at times, but to what extent this hinders your overall enjoyment will depend on what types of games you enjoy playing. If you are willing to face a bit of a challenge in order to immerse yourself in a beautiful game world, you'll love Hyper Light Drifter.9.5/10			"

												I'm only a few hours into the game, and I've more or less completed 1 out of the 4 main areas with no upgrades at the time; so I will post a temporary review, that is as spoiler free as I can hope to make it, and I will come back and edit as I progress.General consensus: This game is great if you are into the minimalist style of gaming. This game delivers on everything from its colorful pixel art style to its atmospheric soundtrack. If you like Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Metroid, Dark Souls, Fez, Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP; or any combination of the above, then you'll love this game.Controls: The controls are pretty easy to pick up on, even without going through any kind of tutorials or having your hand held all the way through the game. This game feels like it's catered toward a gaming fanbase that has played enough games of this style, that it's almost a universal language between what's on screen and what you need to do next. I'm currently using a PS4 controller, so I'm not having any problems, although I've heard people are not having as much luck with Xbox Controlelrs or Keyboard and Mouse setups. The only issues I have are no vibration with a wired controller yet, and when it comes to exploring the world, some leaps are almost impossible unless you are lined up just perfect, so you may end up jumping to your death trying to get to some collectibles (worth it).Music: Probably one of the main reasons I bought this game. Disasterpeace will undoubtedly go down as one of the best game composers in the future. He is able to incorporate conditional algorithms with his musical textures so that it builds perfectly as you enter points of action or step into new areas. To see this work seemlessly with an art style this minimal is always refreshing. See Fez if you haven't played it yet. Disasterpeace's composition, arrangement and sound design are about as professional as you may come across for Indie Games.Art: This game is getting compared to a lot of other games such as Bastion, Transistor, Titan Souls, etc., but I can't help but to also think of Swords and Sworcery EP as this game seems so musically driven as well. The color palette is very interesting for a pixel art style, and the contrast really works to make this game stand out from the rest. The minute animations that go on, such as birds flying, animals walking or swimming around, weather effects, to something as simple as your cape fluttering in the wind in a not so obvious repetitive pattern; really helps to show that years of attention to tiny details is what is making this release something a bit more than just another pixel art style game. I look forward to every new area, and I feel like there's a secret within every room.Difficulty: This brings me to the next part. Many people are complaining that it's too hard, and this apart from the framerate complaints seems to be most consumers' biggest gripe and fear. I'm not going to claim I'm a great gamer or anything, as I've died probably 50 times or more already within the few hours I've played. I've laughed at myself more than getting angry at the game. The respawn times are not that bad, and better yet, the music is more or less unaffected, so it doesn't kill the mood at all when you do die. You just want to keep right on playing and try again. I didn't find the first boss I fought to be that difficult, as I pretty quickly picked up on its patterns, and played it as safe as I could and healed when necessary.Tips: Save your health packs for only when necessary. It's okay to die in this game, so hold on to them until you really need them. Check every nook and cranny, hug every wall, and check every object that looks suspicious. You will find a lot more gearbits (currency) than you may expect that will help you buy upgrades. Being able to deflect back projectiles or dash through them will help you alot for mini-boss/boss fights, as well as when you get surrounded by a lot of people shooting projectiles at you at once. Don't give up on the game. Just go explore another area, fast teleport to the areas where you can heal for free, and search for gearbits to buy upgrades; then go back to the area you had problems with before and try again. The difficulty of this game is not as hard as many are making it out to be. They are just first day reviewers with little to no patience with their character that probably has no upgrades yet. Be patient and do what the game suggests. ""Explore a beautiful, vast and ruined world riddled with dangers and lost technologies."" You'll find what you need to help you progress further, just like in any Zelda or Metroid game.Final Verdict: I'd be kidding myself if I came to any conclusions before I've had one good full playthrough yet, so I'll come back to edit this later. From the short amount of time I've put into it so far; I highly recommend this release, and I feel like I've already got my money's worth.8/10 at the very least, and that's if you're a rage quitter.

The Good:The music, while mostly forgettable, is well composed and world fitting.The combat is solid and rewards timing attacks versus rushing through.The pixel art on display is gorgeous and vibrant.The Neutral:(See Below for reasons)The controls can be cumbersome and rigid, especially the Chain Dash.The Bad:(See Below for reasons)Some In-game Challenges are heavily stilted against the player.Knockdowns are plentiful and, usually, deadly.Comments:I, at first, absolutely despised Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) and I still sort of do in a love-hate kind of way. HLD is an Open-ended Action-Adventure game with lovely pixel graphics, a noticeably decent soundtrack, and aspirations to be a Dark Souls-esque game. However it doesn't really stack up to that last part, with much of the difficulty being attributed to HLD's design and engine limitations, one such example being Knockdowns are everywhere. The animation to get up from a single knockdown is long and non-cancelable, plus you're not invincible while doing so which can lead to tons of deaths from enemies and even the hazards peppered around the world. However, that's nothing compared to the controls being what they are, even on a decent machine.Really it wasn't the difficulty, the gameplay, or even the style of the game that reinforced my gamer rage; it was the controls. The controls were god aweful when I first picked the game up and even with some of the most basic upgrades they felt stiff. This I can only attribute to the GameMaker engine that they used to create HLD. That doesn't mean the controls didn't grow on me over time, say for the Chain Dash, but in certain situations they still feel this way. It also doesn't help that there are virtually no cancels on actions, which harms the fluid combat already in place. There's no canceling an action to dodge which can lead to getting hit quite frequently earlier in the game, as there's no way to really attack and dodge at the same time. It's really when the two dash attacks are finally obtained HLD's combat becomes bearable and coupled with certain pieces of equipment it becomes actually fun to play. Even with the controls and the mechanics being issues in places, one thing I cannot accept is the optional challenges for the 100% completion. Two such barriers come to mind when seeking completion of the game, The ""800 Consecutive Dash"" and some of the 8-Module Area Challenges. The Area Challenges can be brutally annoying to complete, but at least they have alternative methods of getting through them. However, The 800 Consecutive Dash is one of the worst design choices I have encountered in recent memory, as it's painfully dreadful to sit and press the dash key that many times. I attempted it and got to around 500 with a gamepad before I gave up, eventually I installed a hotkey program to actually complete the challenge. This 800 Dash requirement was a painful slog and a terrible means of padding out the game, which in turn harms the completion aspect to the game.Overall, my recommendation is to play Hyper Light Drifter and love it for what it is, but just don't expect it to love you back. It's not Dark Souls, but Hyper Light Drifter for what it's worth is forged in similar fires with lesser materials.			"

												It’s hard to find a game that takes strides from classic titles without finding itself trampled underneath them. Hyper Light Drifter is a game of beats from classic titles all measured and laid out in a neat lines for an enjoyable 5 hour experience. The influence of titles like the Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid are there but they’re not overbearing. In fact, the game oozes its own show don’t tell style. Right away, a heavy whir of synth and apocalyptic imagery cuts an otherwise vibrant palette before plunging you into the game. Every part seems lovingly crafted from the pixel art to the distortion and tones pulsing in sync with beats in the cutscene. Suddenly, a flash leaves the player in a strange world to cipher out details from each bit of the scenery. There’s no dialogue, no flashing GPS system guiding the player, no lectures. Hyper Light Drifter simply shows you a map and some pictures and lets you sidle out into the world to come to your own conclusions.	A beautiful introductory cutscene and some style shouldn’t be enough to sell a game on and, while Hyper Light Drifter makes a strong case for this, the game does more than just poignant atmosphere. The gameplay itself fuses gunplay and swordplay and bounces the two off each other naturally. Each successful sword swing gives you more energy to shoot and shooting inherently carries less risk. Most notably, the game also gives you a dash to move around enemies with and it’s the dash that’s my favourite part about this game. Hyper Light Drifter doesn’t give many invincibility-frame--or i-frames--in the dash.* Fans of games like Dark Souls would understand the power of the roll in that game. The player used the roll less like an evasive maneuver and more like a portal to another dimension; Players would simply roll and disappear from the world when they thought an attack was coming and would pay little attention to the properties of the attack itself. Hyper Light Drifter recognizes this fact that made us complacent: thoughtlessly dashing through attacks. Instead, the game forces you somewhat early to learn enemy patterns and move around them rather than through them. In the end the game is entirely more 	At its worst, Hyper Light Drifter is frustrating in its difficulty and too short of an experience. At its best, Hyper Light Drifter is just that--a polished journey through an entirely foreign world that’ll both challenge you and make you wish there was more.*=(Fun fact, it used to not have any but they somewhat recently patched in a few which I’m somewhat conflicted on.) Ayo sucks also			"

												I don’t usually write game reviews, but I’ve enjoyed Hyper Light Drifter so much I feel compelled to do so. Additionally, I’ve taken care to keep this review spoiler free.At first glance the gameplay is familiar, and is something akin to A Link to the Past. This coupled with the old-timey graphics gives it a nostalgic feel, but HLD is much more than a reskinned Zelda clone. First, the game is challenging and at times down right hard. However difficult, I found the game to be fair. In fact, HLD rewards good planning and practice. For instance, practicing timing drifts/attacks, and making thoughtful use of each firearm will make or break some fights. There were some battles that I was simply overwhelmed the first couple of attempts at them, but after some reflection and planning, I would breeze through what I previously thought to be near impossible.What struck me next was that HLD is an explorers dream come true. The game is packed full of secret areas to uncover. In these areas could be anything: new customs, currency, weapons, or something more mysterious. In fact, the element of mystery and discovery is a major theme in HLD. The story in HLD is not told in a simple spell it out for you sort of manner. Quite the opposite actually.  Instead, you are left to piece together cryptic clues about the broken world your character lives in. Again HLD reward being thoughtful and meticulous. It is entirely possible to traverse the entire game and not understand what is happening.Finally, the world is perhaps my favorite aspect of HLD. The music and the masterfully crafted zones invoked powerful emotions. At times I felt excitement, wonder, but also sorrow. By the end of the game I felt connected to the world, its inhabitants, and most importantly compelled to uncover its darkest mysteries (an ongoing process for me and many others). Really my only complaint is that of any great gaming experience, the journey while enjoyable is over far too soon.TLDR: Hyper Light Drift has great music and pixel art, is challenging but fair, and drops you into a mysterious shattered world that begs to be explored end to end.

												It’s a good game, not as difficult as some say so don't be scared away by that. There is also now an easy mode. Bosses do favor an aggressive play style. Controls and moves take just a little getting used to. Combat is good and enemies provide a good enough challenge. New game plus however requires near flawless execution because of low health. The game rewards exploration very well and it is one of its strong points. If you don't like exploring or find small exploration puzzles boring I wouldn't recommend this. You gain weapons, new items, money, and extra tidbits of what little story there is by exploring. The soundtrack is good but not outstanding (the Southern dungeon being an exception). The art is the best part of this game. It’s well presented and you can tell that every single screen was given a lot of attention. I HIGHLY suggest playing the game with a console-esque controller and not the mouse and keyboard. I used a Playstation 3 DS3 controller using SCP driver package to trick the computer it was a Xbox 360 controller over bluetooth and it was fine.			"

The Good:The music, while mostly forgettable, is well composed and world fitting.The combat is solid and rewards timing attacks versus rushing through.The pixel art on display is gorgeous and vibrant.The Neutral:(See Below for reasons)The controls can be cumbersome and rigid, especially the Chain Dash.The Bad:(See Below for reasons)Some In-game Challenges are heavily stilted against the player.Knockdowns are plentiful and, usually, deadly.Comments:I, at first, absolutely despised Hyper Light Drifter (HLD) and I still sort of do in a love-hate kind of way. HLD is an Open-ended Action-Adventure game with lovely pixel graphics, a noticeably decent soundtrack, and aspirations to be a Dark Souls-esque game. However it doesn't really stack up to that last part, with much of the difficulty being attributed to HLD's design and engine limitations, one such example being Knockdowns are everywhere. The animation to get up from a single knockdown is long and non-cancelable, plus you're not invincible while doing so which can lead to tons of deaths from enemies and even the hazards peppered around the world. However, that's nothing compared to the controls being what they are, even on a decent machine.Really it wasn't the difficulty, the gameplay, or even the style of the game that reinforced my gamer rage; it was the controls. The controls were god aweful when I first picked the game up and even with some of the most basic upgrades they felt stiff. This I can only attribute to the GameMaker engine that they used to create HLD. That doesn't mean the controls didn't grow on me over time, say for the Chain Dash, but in certain situations they still feel this way. It also doesn't help that there are virtually no cancels on actions, which harms the fluid combat already in place. There's no canceling an action to dodge which can lead to getting hit quite frequently earlier in the game, as there's no way to really attack and dodge at the same time. It's really when the two dash attacks are finally obtained HLD's combat becomes bearable and coupled with certain pieces of equipment it becomes actually fun to play. Even with the controls and the mechanics being issues in places, one thing I cannot accept is the optional challenges for the 100% completion.

on the faulty scale1) Essential purchase2) Recommended purchase3) Recommended purchase during a sale4) Not recommended unless heavily discounted5) Not even recommended for Steam game collectorsWhat makes Hyper Light Drifter such a fantastic game?Hyper Light Drifter somehow manages to be one of the most soul-crushing, punishing games out there, while balancing it with a constant and satasfying learning-curve, mixed with the same feeling you get when you go on a killstreak in Cod, or  massacre players in GTA. This game will emotionaly reward you whenever you stumble upon the obvious but well hidden loot, or beat a very difficult enemy or dungeon, it will constantly keep you learning in order to survive your combatant ordeals, and will remain interesting throughout all of the game by using it's abstract and mysterious methods of image-only story telling. The developers have ensured that each new area will be a test of your skills, and occasionally a test of your patience and persistence with the immense difficulty of their mobs. The design team and music composer have also strickly inforced beauty and abstract thinking into all of their art work and music design, giving you a unique feel to every location, using the 16-bit images as an advantage rather than a downfall with their creativity. Hyper Light Drifter it's self is sure to blow your mind in the ways you didn't know it could be blown.If you have the patience and the persistence, buy  this  game. "

												I don't think I have just simply enjoyed sitting down and punching through a game for a while this much since Dark Souls.  This game is truly something special.  This game may appeal to you if you are a fan of the Souls games, Legend of Zelda, or amazing pixel art.  It is not super easy, but not super hard either.  During combat you will get killed fairly quickly and often, but you are never truly punished for it because you spawn close by.  This allows the game to be mechanically difficult, while still keeping you interested.  It is a great experience, but is not the most lengthy game.  However, even though the game isn't that long, there are options for longer gameplay, such as NewGame+ and looking for collectables.  I don't think the length of the title is truly an issue with how well the game is made, and I think you will agree with me when you play through it.  If you are thinking about buying Hyper Light Drifter just do it, you will thank me later.     What makes this game so good is the stunningly gorgeous art style, combat that requires you to think (and think quickly), and story elements that will leave you wondering.  While the later may not be the most important aspect, I really enjoy such things from games.     All in all, this game approaches what we are already kind of familiar with (games such as The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls) and executes it from a different angle.  It is very well made, and just damn fun.  My only gripe is that it is a quite short game, but honestly I will take quality over quantity any day.			"

Posted: October 20, 2016
												Oh man, where do I even begin on what might very well be my favorite game of all time now? For the interests of the reader, I'll keep the intro short and the important bits... Less so.THE GAME: It's a bit like if 2D Zelda banged Dark Souls, as many before me have said. The gameplay largely consists of gadding about the labyrinthine-but-not-too-labyrinthine game world hunting for secrets, piecing together the game's story and lore from the gorgeous, gorgeous environment and activating switches until you stumble across a posse of rap warlock parrots who then proceed to completely wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is where the Dark Souls half of the equation comes in. Combat is based around using your mobility to avoid your foes' telegraphed attacks before they mob you. The feeling of zipping around like a pixelated space ninja, dodging gunfire and shurikens while you bisect a goblin on the way to the rifleman is one I have yet to find in another game.PROS!:- Is pretty! If you like eye candy, you will not be disappointed. The lonely, just-bleak-enough ambiance is also top notch.- Well paced! Happy walks through the crumbling yet vibrant world are broken up by spots of intense combat at just the right times, creating lovely differences in kind.- Organic! The vast majority of optional challenges are reached not through an option menu, but by trotting over to their location in the game world. You will both find and unlock them through diligent exploration, which you will be rewarded handsomely for by the game with just about everything you need to survive the aforementioned rap warlocks.- Challenging! This is the sort of game where if you fly in with no plan but mashing buttons you will be turned into an amateur butchery project in a cool four seconds. The game rewards observation and fast, precise action, and you will feel the pressure to Git Gud. As a bonus, the AI in this game is nigh flawless.-Good Guy Devs! Since I bought this game in April Heart Machine added a Filthy Casual (*ahem* Newcomer) mode for those weak in the way of the ninja or with♥♥♥♥♥♥to do, a Boss Rush mode for madmen like myself, 60fps even though they had to rewrite half the game's code to do it, and local co-op too because why the hell not? The love is evident not only in how gorgeous and elegant the game is, but also in the developer's continued support.- Rich! All of the game's story is told pictorally or through the environment, mostly the latter. If you keep an eye out you can piece together a whole world and timeline just through bits of scenery, corpses and some logic.CONS:- Spotty Difficulty: Maybe I just Got Gud too fast but the game spikes hard in difficulty when you're in your first zone (you can tackle three of the game's four in whatever order you wish!) and still getting your bearings, mellows out slightly in the middle once you've gotten some upgrades under your belt and figured out how to chain dash (you did unlock the chain dash first, didn't you?), then spikes again in the fourth zone as the developers know you'll be coming in strapped. The bosses are also an order of magnitude harder than any combat encounter you'll run into elsewhere. Not a deal breaker, but has to be said.- Spotty Checkpoints: For a game as hard as Hyper Light Drifter it sure likes to put you juust far enough back to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you die, but not far enough to be rage-quit worthy. Deliberate?- Opaque: Want to know what the hell is going on with the story? I hope you have your detective hat on because the game sure ain't spelling out♥♥♥♥♥♥ This would be fine (even a draw!) if it didn't also extend to quite a few features as well, like the fact that you can find outfits that buff your Drifter, what those buffs -are-, and Horde Mode. You'll need to scour the earth for keys if you want to access Horde Mode too, so if you just want to slash toad ninjas in half you better get hunting or grab a guide. The in-game map is also just a little garbage. I figured out how to use it by checking it for landmarks about, oh... 12 hours in.- The local co-op feels a little lacking, but the game is best experienced alone in the ruins of once-great civilizations now infested with bleary-eyed new life so I'm just nit-picking now.So that's it! TL/DR: Legend of Dark Souls! Zippy Skippy Space Ninja In A Bleak Yet Colorful World! Devs keep adding♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dense and solid as a brick to the jaw! 10/10 would get eaten by a flash mob of parrots again.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a well rounded adventure action RPG. As far as I've played, there are absolutely no 'words,' only pictures to guide you. It is mature, and beautiful, while still keeping an eerie feel to the atmosphere.  It IS best played with a controller.When others say 'Merciless' they mean it, this game isn't a walk- or slide- in the park. As there is no real direction, be ready to figure things out for yourself and uncover the story on your own.I highly recommend this game for lovers of fast paced combat, minimal story telling, and pretty colors.

The new 60fps update is perfect, and the new boss rush mode adds a new challenge after you finish the game. (Would be nice if they added a global leaderboard for Boss Rush though.) Trophy list looks reasonably difficult and thoughtful, instead of just tacked on trophies.And it has massive skill based speedrun potential.

Sometimes, this game sometimes has it's repetetive moments, when you fail at something, and have to restart, and have to re-collect all the collectables... I wish there could be a button for skipping the ""animation"" or transition so to say, when picking up something that is related to the quest/thing you are doing, if you do not wish to see it.Despite this, I believe that this is a wonderful game, and deserves more than it does currently.

												Legend of Zelda+Dark Souls=HLDPixelated masterpiece! Controls are very responsive and extremely rewarding once you get the gameplay mechanics down. I had so much fun exploring the game's beautiful landscape and listening to its serene, yet chilling, soundtrack. Dashing aka drifting becomes second nature as you weave through waves of enemies and traverse the different dungeons within this alluring yet dangerous world. The lack of narrative maybe seen as somewhat of a negative at first glance, but it succeeds in giving the player a true sense of being alone in this vastly alien universe. Where it is short on dialouge, HLD makes up for it in its solid combat mechanics and rewarding exploration. Avoiding enemy attacks and navigating your way through the game's dangerous dungeons requires plenty of timing and precision. Once you get the hang of it, however, stringing multiple drifts together while reflecting bullets back at your enemies using your sword becomes second nature as you slay hordes of baddies- like some sort of 16-bit Jedi on a warpath, although your character looks closer to Bobba Fett.As someone who is a big fan of the Dark Souls franchise, I highly recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a familiar, yet fresh challenge that is grealy rewarding and beautiful. I wrote this review after only beating the game once, but I can't wait to start NG+ and try out the Boss Run challenge!			"

												Oh man, where do I even begin on what might very well be my favorite game of all time now? For the interests of the reader, I'll keep the intro short and the important bits... Less so.THE GAME: It's a bit like if 2D Zelda banged Dark Souls, as many before me have said. The gameplay largely consists of gadding about the labyrinthine-but-not-too-labyrinthine game world hunting for secrets, piecing together the game's story and lore from the gorgeous, gorgeous environment and activating switches until you stumble across a posse of rap warlock parrots who then proceed to completely wreck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is where the Dark Souls half of the equation comes in. Combat is based around using your mobility to avoid your foes' telegraphed attacks before they mob you. The feeling of zipping around like a pixelated space ninja, dodging gunfire and shurikens while you bisect a goblin on the way to the rifleman is one I have yet to find in another game.PROS!:- Is pretty! If you like eye candy, you will not be disappointed. The lonely, just-bleak-enough ambiance is also top notch.- Well paced! Happy walks through the crumbling yet vibrant world are broken up by spots of intense combat at just the right times, creating lovely differences in kind.- Organic! The vast majority of optional challenges are reached not through an option menu, but by trotting over to their location in the game world. You will both find and unlock them through diligent exploration, which you will be rewarded handsomely for by the game with just about everything you need to survive the aforementioned rap warlocks.- Challenging! This is the sort of game where if you fly in with no plan but mashing buttons you will be turned into an amateur butchery project in a cool four seconds. The game rewards observation and fast, precise action, and you will feel the pressure to Git Gud. As a bonus, the AI in this game is nigh flawless.-Good Guy Devs! Since I bought this game in April Heart Machine added a Filthy Casual (*ahem* Newcomer) mode for those weak in the way of the ninja or with♥♥♥♥♥♥to do, a Boss Rush mode for madmen like myself, 60fps even though they had to rewrite half the game's code to do it, and local co-op too because why the hell not? The love is evident not only in how gorgeous and elegant the game is, but also in the developer's continued support.- Rich! All of the game's story is told pictorally or through the environment, mostly the latter. If you keep an eye out you can piece together a whole world and timeline just through bits of scenery, corpses and some logic.CONS:- Spotty Difficulty: Maybe I just Got Gud too fast but the game spikes hard in difficulty when you're in your first zone (you can tackle three of the game's four in whatever order you wish!) and still getting your bearings, mellows out slightly in the middle once you've gotten some upgrades under your belt and figured out how to chain dash (you did unlock the chain dash first, didn't you?), then spikes again in the fourth zone as the developers know you'll be coming in strapped. The bosses are also an order of magnitude harder than any combat encounter you'll run into elsewhere. Not a deal breaker, but has to be said.- Spotty Checkpoints: For a game as hard as Hyper Light Drifter it sure likes to put you juust far enough back to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you die, but not far enough to be rage-quit worthy. Deliberate?- Opaque: Want to know what the hell is going on with the story? I hope you have your detective hat on because the game sure ain't spelling out♥♥♥♥♥♥ This would be fine (even a draw!) if it didn't also extend to quite a few features as well, like the fact that you can find outfits that buff your Drifter, what those buffs -are-, and Horde Mode. You'll need to scour the earth for keys if you want to access Horde Mode too, so if you just want to slash toad ninjas in half you better get hunting or grab a guide. The in-game map is also just a little garbage. I figured out how to use it by checking it for landmarks about, oh... 12 hours in.- The local co-op feels a little lacking, but the game is best experienced alone in the ruins of once-great civilizations now infested with bleary-eyed new life so I'm just nit-picking now.So that's it! TL/DR: Legend of Dark Souls! Zippy Skippy Space Ninja In A Bleak Yet Colorful World! Devs keep adding♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dense and solid as a brick to the jaw! 10/10 would get eaten by a flash mob of parrots again.			"

												It's pretty and cool and you can dash a lot. I like to dashFor real though, this game is like A Link to the Past meets Dark Souls meets a schmup with cotton candy visuals and a soundtrack that's reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The new 60fps update is perfect, and the new boss rush mode adds a new challenge after you finish the game. (Would be nice if they added a global leaderboard for Boss Rush though.) Trophy list looks reasonably difficult and thoughtful, instead of just tacked on trophies.And it has massive skill based speedrun potential. Hopefully the speedrun community doesn't sleep on this game.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a well rounded adventure action RPG. As far as I've played, there are absolutely no 'words,' only pictures to guide you. It is mature, and beautiful, while still keeping an eerie feel to the atmosphere.  It IS best played with a controller.When others say 'Merciless' they mean it, this game isn't a walk- or slide- in the park. As there is no real direction, be ready to figure things out for yourself and uncover the story on your own.I highly recommend this game for lovers of fast paced combat, minimal story telling, and pretty colors.

												Legend of Zelda+Dark Souls=HLDPixelated masterpiece! Controls are very responsive and extremely rewarding once you get the gameplay mechanics down. I had so much fun exploring the game's beautiful landscape and listening to its serene, yet chilling, soundtrack.

												I don't think I have just simply enjoyed sitting down and punching through a game for a while this much since Dark Souls.  This game is truly something special.  This game may appeal to you if you are a fan of the Souls games, Legend of Zelda, or amazing pixel art.  It is not super easy, but not super hard either.  During combat you will get killed fairly quickly and often, but you are never truly punished for it because you spawn close by.  This allows the game to be mechanically difficult, while still keeping you interested.  It is a great experience, but is not the most lengthy game.  However, even though the game isn't that long, there are options for longer gameplay, such as NewGame+ and looking for collectables.  I don't think the length of the title is truly an issue with how well the game is made, and I think you will agree with me when you play through it.  If you are thinking about buying Hyper Light Drifter just do it, you will thank me later.     What makes this game so good is the stunningly gorgeous art style, combat that requires you to think (and think quickly), and story elements that will leave you wondering.  While the later may not be the most important aspect, I really enjoy such things from games.     All in all, this game approaches what we are already kind of familiar with (games such as The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls) and executes it from a different angle.  It is very well made, and just damn fun.  My only gripe is that it is a quite short game, but honestly I will take quality over quantity any day.			"

												After finishing normal mode I decided to make a review.Gonna start out with pros and cons..Pros:1) The game has good textures for a pixel type game2) Combat is good especially when you're low on health with no heals during boss fight.3) Interesting story. Even though its hard to understand what was happening a bit in the story I do often find myself thinking ""why is this here"" ""what happened to these people..?"" (seeing the skeletons) ""What are these robots?"" ""Why is the Drifter blue?"" but that isnt really a bad thing for me which is why I say its a good thing. I like using my imagination alot so yeah.4) Fun boss fights. The bosses in this game were really fun to fight. You die a few times learn their skills...when or when not to attack with your sword...etc5) Dungeons. If you like games with dungeons then this is a good game to check out. I liked exploring the dungeons in this world a lot.Cons:1) The MAP. The map confused me too much...especially when i went East where the ninja frogs were. I had a really hard time figuring out where I was due to how the map is made. Usually it shows where u are EXACTLY on the map but it doesnt in this game. AKA: When u move then check the map u dont move on the map.Honestly the map is the only problem I had with the game. Hyper Light Drifter is worth the cash you spend on it. Its a very nice action game with good visuals for a pixel game and a good game to pass the time while having fun at the same time c:Rate: 9/10 You should buy this game if you have a few bucks lying there! (10/10 if the map wasnt so annoying.)			"

 Hyper Light Drifter Why I recommend it:Hyper Light Drifter is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Why it's good:Hyper Light Drifter has the best god damn pixel art that I've ever seen. From the moment you launch the game you are treated to a fantastic art style and a punishing game. The difficulty is set just high enough that you want to get better, but it's not so difficult that you'll quit... maybe.I've actually heard of people who got so damn fed up with the game that they outright thought their progress was blocked. Those people probably suck at this game. I'll admit, my first playthrough I died A LOT. However, every playthrough after was way easy, so I decided to take on NG+ (Which was HARD).Currently I speedrun this game[speedrun.com], and it's FUN. Even though we've broken most patches of the game to a mess, the remaining game is still fun to play over and over again. I hope to play this game at AGDQ or SGDQ 2017 so if that happens, you can watch me live! (Fun, right?)This game is just a masterpiece. It's fast paced, beautiful, clever, and filled to the brim with secrets.Although it's relatively short, the game is definitely worth picking up for $20.The spoiler below is for SPEEDRUNNERS ONLYMan, f*ck ninjas "

												This game is pretty solid, if you catch my drift.Hyper Light Drifter may have some flaws but in return it gives a pretty unique experience... especially after the GLORIOUS 60 FPS PATCH that convinced me to buy the game. I really cannot stress out enough how much I was impressed by the developers' efforts. Instead of running away with money, they listened to the feedback and criticism regarding the framerate and worked hard on fixing it. Hyper Light Drifter after updates is now a completely different beast. Not only looks amazing on still images as previosly, but now also in motion too. This highly competents game's satisfying combat with snappy controls and responsive movement. Everything is now smooth as the butter. You gained my respect, Heart Machine.Game is not only a joy to play thanks to good combat and rewarding exploration. The look of the game's world is award-winning and adds very much to the experience. People may became reserved regarding pixel art in games, but it's unfair to label all games with such style. While other devs slack off and take pixel art as ""an easy mode"", others put their heart and skill into the work they create. Every location in the game is really remarkable with tightly crafted decorations and details. With complement of the great Disasterpiece's soundtrack and stellar sound design, atmosphere is definitely here and it's worth experiencing. You definately WILL get goose bumps on the stellar first act of the game.I mentioned some flaws and there are some to point out for future reference. First off, the map in the game is absolutely, near objectively THE worst in the whole action-adventure genre. It's unintuitive and incomprehensible at times, making first few hours in the game painful as you try to get your character where you want. Dungeons are really open-ended, twisted and with tons of optional chambers to visit, which makes navigation even more crucial factor of the game. Players should have tools to counter those twisted mazes and all they get is a vague strap of beautifully pixelarted, but unusable map.After you get your bearings straight, game is a smooth sail until the end of the game. Last level is short, sudden and doesn't really fit as a proper climax with anything interesting at all. All you get for the whole game of build-up is a small corridor and the easy final boss. I was really expecting a full-fledged final level which didn't really happen. It's such a missed opportunity and game really suffers from it. Story content also ends abruptly, with many questions and only tiny bit of answers. It's not bad in it's open for interpretation nature, but I expected a little more story bits throughout the game. HLD's world is intriguing, inviting and full of surprises. There is some visual storytelling here and there, but I'm glutton for more. Or, alternatively, make main character's struggles as he succumbs to terminal disease more varied (we get many repetive hallucinations that alternatively could be expanded as the game progresses).I could nitpick even more things: like a tiny central area that could be greatly expanded (it is only as a tiny buffer between dungeons) or some difficulty issues here and there... But all in all, I cannot rate Hyper Light Drifter negatively. It's an one of the kind adventure which is a feast for exploration oriented gamers like me. I really enjoyed my time in this world and I leave it with a honest smile in the direction of the beautiful, deep-blue sky.			"

												2D Zelda had a baby with Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP, and then Dark Souls abducted it, and made it fight in the baby pits until it was strong enough to climb out. The family resemblances are strong, but this game shows its upbringing.Pros:Nothing past the controls is explained.You will die over and over.Gameplay is hard to master.The art is intimidating, leading, and gorgeous.Combat is lightning quick, and you need to be aggressive to succeed. Cons:The game doesn't seem to play with your expectations the way DS does - it's not cruel.I'm two bosses in so far, and the fights haven't been as imaginative as the setting.It gets a little platformy at times. I'm not a fan of timing puzzles.All in all I would give murderhobo simulator 2016 a decent chance of being my favorite game this year.			"

												It took me a little over 6 hours to beat Hyper Light Drifter. 6 hours of atmosphere, intrigue, loss, anger, and, ultimately, victory.Fantastic Aesthetic and Sound DesignLet me start off by saying: wow. Without spoilers, the intro definitely sets the stage for the rest of the game. The environments are intricate, with plenty of little details and set pieces to satisfy any eye. This game has some of the best pixel art that I've seen, and its effect on the player is further amplified by the atmospheric music.Challenging GameplayHyper Light Drifter expands its gameplay in meaningful ways. In this game, ""experience"" is in the form of fragments, which you find by exploring the map, slaying bosses, and killing certain enemies. Collect enough fragments, and you can upgrade a skill or weapon. My only complaint about this system is that some skills are far more useful than others. If you chose a skill of less use than the Improved Dash or Sword Reflector, you would probably have a much harder time beating some of the crazier, bullet-hell bosses. Regardless, you learn to beat bosses by memorizing their attack patterns, and damn does it feel good getting that last hit/shot in.Wordless Storytelling I'm a huge fan of games that show us, rather than tell us, what's happening in the story. Other than a few text hints that pop up to explain gameplay mechanics, there isn't a single line of dialogue in Hyper Light Drifter. By not having any words, the game nudges you to look at the lovingly-crafted, pixelated environments for answers. But there is also a downside to this approach: even though I beat it, I still don't understand aspects of the story. This might irritate some people, but if you're like me you don't mind if some things are left up to the imagination.ReplayabilityI didn't 100% the game. I did not discover all items, secrets, and nodes (what I call the purple shining diamond thingies). I only picked up one of the little robo companions. Hell, I just found out after-the-fact that there are alternate capes with special bonuses. I definitely think there's more value here, especially since the game's secrets are tucked away pretty neatly. There's even a New Game+, which seems far more challenging since most attacks will kill you in one hit.In ConclusionIf you want an awesome, short-but-sweet, challenging experience, I highly recommend Hyper Light Drifter. For those 100%ers out there I think there's plenty here if you want to go beyond the basic requirements for beating the game. Otherwise, to anyone about to buy the game: enjoy the taste of blood in your mouth.			"

												I have been following this game for a while for its unique beauty and now the time has finally come. This post apocalyptic neon covered action adventure game developed and published by Heart Machine is a very impressive introduction to the developer. If you're an aspiring video game designer using game maker studio, this is a perfect example of what the software can do. What I liked:- Very atmospheric game- Varied enemies that attack differently and look very different from each other - Several upgrades that keep the game interesting- Interesting bosses that all have diverse move sets and character design- Fantastic sound design and soundtrack - Beautiful visuals that are teeming with color and character- The combat is incredible and feels amazing, really my main reason for falling for this game.What I didn't like:- Bare minimum options - 30 fps locked (C'mon, it's 2016)- Cutscene volume obnotiously loud- shakey start- basically useless map which will further confuse the player.Some of my additional opinions:- The story is very confusing and never explained out in the open its for the player to decipher for themselves. I really like this and I'd rather let the environment and NPC's tell me the story without spoon feeding it to me. (NPC's speak in pictures which also makes it a bit difficult to understand)- This game gets really difficult and may not be for everyone- I really enjoyed New game + I feel like it changed up the base game more than other New game +'sConclusion:I bought this game for $17 and I do not feel ripped off, not in the slightest. This is a really fun yet challenging game that harkens back to classic video games such as Zelda and Metroid without ripping them off. The game envelopes the player in a world bursting with color and imagination. The combat is fluid and reminds me of dark souls (a game I might add, that has mastered melee combat) Lastly the soundtrack is jaw dropping and further immerses the player into the world of Hyper Light Drifter. This game is not for everyone, if you're ready for a challenging video game with no hand holding buy this game.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. The soundtrack is amazing on its own, and coupled with the beautiful graphics and effects, it creates a masterpiece. The pixel graphics perfectly convey the story to you, and every single ability upgrade in the game seems to work very smoothly to fit into the game, with no insanely overpowered abilities. The game provides a genuine challenge, especially if you try to get the achievement for beating the game without dying once. The game also provides little challenges for you to try, such as the soccer field to the southwest of the main town, and the dashing game in the dash shop. The game contains a plethora of different vanity items for your sword, companion, and cape/robe thing, allowing for difficulty finding all the hidden goodies. The combat is all very smooth, and the boss fights all seem well constructed. Overall, the game is a masterpiece with its amazing soundtrack, pixel graphics, and gameplay.			"

												I highly recommend playing Hyper Light Drifter. The story is fantastic and vague in a good, mysterious way. The world is very elegant and beautiful while still being full of danger. The music is very immersive and fits every part of this game perfectly. It is a good game to play and even though it is brought up around the basic concept of good guy fights bad guys, finds artifacts, saves the world type of scenario, it is much more then that.			"

												Hyper Light Drifterhas been my favourite release of 2016 so far.It's pixel art motif, along with smooth animations and a vibrant colour pallete combine to provide a graphically striking experience, that delivers its' story entirely through pictographs and an introductory cut scene. When I say story though I mean that in the loosest possible sense as due to the nature of the game and its' lack of dialogue the events that set up your adventure as well as those that follow are entirely subject to your interpretation of them.On the gameplay front it plays like a tough as nails version of the 2D Legend of Zelda games with some elements of old school SNES classic Terranigma. You start the game with the ability to dash and swing your sword, shortly and shortly thereafter you'll be provided with a gun whose ammo is refilled by sword swings so it cannot be spammed; something I consider to be a particularly clever design choice.Bare in mind that there's no hand holding and the brief tutorial in the beginning of the game is about as forgiving as this game gets. You'll need to pay close attention to enemy attack patterns along with the environment, whilst exploiting all your abilities and upgrades to the fullest if you hope to reach the game's ending. And I do mean all of them as though the game can be completed without most of the upgrades, they do make it substantially forgiving. One of my biggest pet peaves in games is when the upgrades on offer wind up being a waste of in game currency however Hyper Light Drifter does an excellent job of offering a modest number of upgrades that are all highly uaeful in their own way. The game never feels like it's cheap or any death was anything other than your mistake and thankfully the liberal use of auto-saves ensure you'll never find yourself too frustrated. I found that any time I was confronted with continued failure a short half hour break was all I needed to overcome any challenge. I've heard some compare the difficulty to Dark Souls and Blood Borne, however as I haven't played either of those games I can't weigh in on that opinion.Finally there's the music. You won't find epic sweeping scores that get the blood rushing here however the music by Disasterpeace is amazing at creating an atmosphere if of solemn and lonely exploration of its' post apocalyptic world.Overall Hyper Light Drifter provides a fun, challenging, visually stunning and engrossing experience with ambient music to suck you in further. On first playthrough it took me about 10 - 15 hours or so to complete and now that I'm on my second playthrough attempting to uncover all the games secrets I can safely say that Hyper Light Drifter is well worth the price of entry.The only criticism I can possibly level at this game is the subjective experience of the game's story, however I personally love a game that asks you to try and put together its' lore or make up your own mind about the story, so this was in no way a problem I had whilst playing.10/10			"

There is a simply beauty to it. It personally reminds me to a slightly cyber version of  ""Nausicaä of the valley of the wind"". The game is very much a teach yourself as you go game, only giving you minimal hints here and there. To me that makes the game even more interesting and out of the norm.

												Sweet Jesus...Hyper Light Drifter is absolutely fabulous.  The soundtrack is wonderfully eerie, and works so hand in hand with the art that you feel like you've been transported to another (beautiful) planet.  The art is insane.  So beautiful and so well crafted, I find my jaw unhinged often.  Gameplay is incredibly fun and rewarding.  Enemies pack a serious punch, and there are often many of them in a very confined space, but you have the tools to prevail.  Once you start getting comfortable with those tools, the combat is fair, but challenging.  The boss difficulty has been seriously overblown; this game is no walk in the park but is completely fair.  Don't let the Rock Paper Shotgun review deter you from buying; this is not the bullet hell insanity of Nuclear Throne (which is great mind you) or the monotonous boss fights of Titan Souls.  In my opinion the devs have struck a perfect cord of beauty, fun, exploration, and challenge.  One of the best games I've played in a while.10/10			"

												You have a vision: A gleaming city resting in a fertile valley. A quartet of glyphs held by angular beings activate, one by one. Suddenly their lights give way to an apocalypse. The city seems struck as if by a hurricane, and all it's wonders and horrors, crumble and rot in a matter of seconds. The once blue waters of the valley become as scarlet as they fill with the bodies of millions of dead. A crawling shadowed mass pursues you, it's touch a mark of infection, and looming mortality. There is something that can save you, a luminous crystal. You reach for it, but the shadow snuffs it out and covers you. All goes dark. You awaken to a storm.Welcome to Hyper Light Drifter. This is a game that drips atmosphere from every single one of it's stylized pixels. Atmosphere, mystery, and death.Professional reviews I've read tend to give it comparison to franchises like Zelda, or Dark Souls. Zelda, due to it's exploratory dungeon crawler set up. Dark Souls, for it's punishing difficulty. Even the game's lead director, Alex Preston makes mention of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, as an inspirational source, along with another famous dungeon crawler, Diablo. But from my perspective, Hyper Light mostly pays clear homage to the console gaming golden age of the Eighties and Nineties. As I've played, I've felt the ancestral spirits of other titles like Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man, Robotron, Strider, Contra, and Metroid looking on and nodding a solemn ascent. Hyper Light, like these, is a reflex game. A death game. And if your reflexes are not up to par, if you have a low threshold of patience, and you expect it's world to welcome you and give you a handguided tour to the end credits, Heaven help you. In the wilds and dungeons outside the tranquil town hub, enemies come at you in droves and there is not a single one you will meet that is a pushover. Each one has a pattern of attack that demands study and practice, and just when you think you have that enemy figured out, and take him down, three more just like him take his place, and seconds into THAT fight, eight completely different NEW enemies show up, just for good measure. You've never seen them before, they're faster. Now young Skywalker, you WILL die. It takes time and patience to learn how to fight, how to kill, how to live. It takes time to learn what it is you're even supposed to be doing with your life, such as it is, in the game overall. What are you trying to accomplish? Where do you go? The map you earn in the town hub, for example, gives you an idea of where things are, but only in symbols and vauge approximations of distance and location. You refer to the map rather than rely on it. And the assorted menagerie of beings who inhabit that tranquil town hub I mentioned? Most of them won't understand a word you say, and you won't understand them either. This is a genius move on the part of this dev team. You are in a world of visual communication. If there was literacy here, it's long gone, along with the ruined city. Those who you CAN understand, relay their stories entirely in images, and their information may or may not be in service of your vague quest. Even when you speak to the vendors in the hub, who offer new moves, weapons, and upgrades, they aren't giving you a clear picture of how to pay for those upgrades. You have to parse that out through exploring and figuring it out while delving and salvaging in the wilds.Some professional reviewers seem to fault the developers for choosing to be so cryptic, but they seem to miss the point. The game uses the atmosphere of it's world to relay the story, rather than depend on long tiring dialogues. It uses the environment to remind you over and over again, that you can only truly rely on yourself and your instincts. You are a Drifter after all, cut off from this alien culture you don't understand, trying to solve a mystery. And the only way to solve that mystery is to embrace it, descend into it, and accept the risk of death that comes with exploring it. Hyper Light is an immersive experience, a doorway to another reality, and it is superbly put together. Control of the Drifter in and out of combat is simple and tight, but subtle pros and cons are attached to each part of your arsenal. For example, you can teleport a short distance in any direction you like, at any time. But each ""blink"" takes the briefest of instances to recover from. In a pitched battle, such an option of movement causes you to feel powerful and vulnerable all at once. Blink with skill and you feel like a god, blink wrong, and you've blinked your last. The four world areas that seemlessly connect to the town are menacing, yet beautiful places which beg you to seek out every hidden wall, room, and underground labyrinth. The color paletes used to bring them to life are a delight to the eyes, lulling you into complacency, while warning you of the savagery they contain. A forest of trees with blood red leaves jut into the sky from ground where pale turquoise crystal spires are nestled in grasses of deep blue. Snow capped moutains of black and gray stone tower into the heavens, dead and dying villages of thatch and glowing gem computer boards hanging off their cliff faces like nests. The sound design joins with the colors and leaves you in awe. Dungeons hum, with the thrums of forgotten computers and generators the size of skyscrapers rattling your subwooffer, wind moans through those snowcapped black mountain peaks and whipsers threateningly through those scarlet trees.  A seemingly endless and ethereal electronica soundtrack rounds out the package, ebbing and flowing over you like a tide. It grows in intensity the closer you come to a turning point, discovery, or conflict and changes subtly with each area explored. Hyper Light Difter is indeed a game of atmosphere, mystery, death. It takes time to get to know, patience to learn, and it will not coddle you in any way. But it is also a game of life. It asks you to breathe and observe and contemplate and act. Like life it also takes time to know, patience to learn, and will not coddle you in any way, but not because it doesn't have confidence in you. Life is not easy, Hyper Light Drifter is not easy, but both are beautiful and worth exploring, even with the pain inherent in the process. HeartMachine has created a masterpiece of a game with a genuine soul. I am honored to play it, and while it makes me throw the controller down quite often, I continue to give it a chance and accept it as it is. I hope that many others will as well.			"

												Like Zelda and Dark Souls had a baby and that baby ate FTL and gained its pixel powers. Absolutely incredible. HELPFUL FYI IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH A CERTAIN BOSS[minor spoilers]Going north, toward the bird mountain, is NOT the easiest place to start. You may have gone this way becuase of old-drifter's notes on the table which seemed to suggest it, but the best starting point is actually over toward the east in the water-village. A little dog tries to lead you over this way, but he's easy to miss. If you're getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by Birdguy, go over there and play through that section - you'll have a more gradual skill curve and can collect the gold you need to get the health/chain-drift upgrades that make that fight a lot easier. Also, FYI, none of the zones are blocked off to start except the bottom. If you're REALLY getting crushed, you could just grind the starting points of all of them! "

I backed Hyper Light Drifter on Kickstarter for $40, which got me a copy of the game on launch, a giftable copy for a friend, and a copy of the digital soundtrack and digital art book.Hyper Light Drifter is a blend of its peers that seemingly inspired it; Studio Ghibli, Akira, Diablo, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls. This is evident from the beautiful opening animation that stylishly hints at a greater world, one that seems to have been fractured by some nebulous but terrible event, beautiful but broken and now tainted by a spreading darkness. Atmospheric music and sound and wonderful pixel-art work together to create a hand-crafted and gentle neon apocalypse tinged with grittiness.After a short intro sequence that sets the scene and provides some minimal tutorial, you are off into the world. There are dungeons to go into, bosses to defeat, weapons to upgrade, secrets to find. It's part Diablo and Legend of Zelda in terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, by way of Dark Souls in terms of storytelling and difficulty. This is a difficult game. But don't let that put you off. When you die you respawn at the last checkpoint (they are numerous, at a minimum once per 'area transition', but often more frequent). The challenge comes in trying to learn the enemies, how they move, what they do, and then deal with them with a minimum loss of resources. The bosses, all of which I found fun, are actual credible challenges requiring multiple attempts. They require you to learn their moves and timings, to vary your tactics, to try again and again, learning a little more each time until you can get them. And you will get them, eventually. They each took me about 20 - 60 attempts, some taking a couple of hours to master. On one I had to go away, thinking that returning later with new items and unlocks would help, but ultimately it was all about learning, timing, and trying again.I completed the game in about 20 hours, which included a lot of travelling off the beaten path looking for secrets. The game is divided into three 'regions', and a fourth that unlocks once the other three are complete. In these regions you have several 'dungeons', partly linear but with multiple entrances and routes through the regions, it always feels like there is a lot to explore. You'll get lost, you'll go in circles, you'll find dead-ends and eventually begin to figure out the layout and what the requirements are for advancing in each area, you'll discover secrets... I was immersed in this cycle of exploration, discovery, challenge and story. I've seen some people say they've completed the game in about 6 - 7 hours, I can only assume they are much, much better at the boss fights than me, and likely made a dash for the finish line and ignored most hidden areas and side content.In terms of story, whilst it is by no means groundbreaking, it is well told and does a good job of immersing you in the world of Hyper Light Drifter. I loved it, it is understated and subtle and slow, hinted at rather than told outright. Ruins, bodies, glimpsed vistas, flashbacks and so-on will drip-feed you the context-delivered story. There is no dialogue, no text to read, you discover it all through images and discovering scenes and putting pieces together. Each region has its own story thread, that ties into the piece as a whole, and you discover some context through finding survivors and other wandering adventurers who offer a glimpse of context through some pixel-art still scenes of their experiences. At the end of it all, I'm not 100% certain I understood what transpired, but I have an idea, the essence of the story pulled me into it and immersed me, I was going with the broader strokes and the finer details seemed unimportant come the final showdown.

												I picked up Hyper LIght Drifter after being drawn in by the pretty visuals and promise of Dark Souls-like difficulty. I ended up getting a refund because the difficulty wasn't in the timing or attacks, or learning enemy attack patterns, it was instead reliant on clunky controls.The Good:-Gorgeous and simplistic visuals-Immersive soundtrack that draws on the surreal cyberpunk/fantasy aesthetics-Combat feels good and satisfying when the game engine allows for it-Moderate array of weaponry allows for healthy variety in gameplay-Non-linear progression promotes explorationThe Bad:-Controls are not 100% responsive-Can't dash through enemies, but they can pass through you with attacks and you can dash over gaps. Sends mixed signals to the player.-Mechanics could use SLIGHTLY (and I mean miniscule) more explanation. This also ties into exploration which is encouraged because of upgrades but secrets were too tedious to look for.-Ranged weapon aiming is just straight garbage using controller or mouse. Where I aimed would consistently not be where my character would actually shoot.Overall this would have been a 100% recommended game but I have little patience for games that promote crushing difficulty but hide it behind poor technical limitations. This game was shooting to be a 2D Dark Souls game with much better art direction and soundtrack but the loose combat and unresponsive controls made me feel like I was fighting the game engine instead of the enemies on my screen.

												Should you buy this game?Yes.Why?Becasue it's awesome.Why?Fluent combat, great music/sound effects, and graphics. This game is like smelling happiness from a unicorns breath as you ride on its back into a sunset with butterflies on a rainbow while in outerspace with robot Abraham Lincoln as you fly around throught the universe with Bob Ross and Morgan freeman combining their magnificent voices and afro's to give an experience equivalent to finding the Holy Grail, in Atlantis, on the moon, inside a puppy dog's eyes.Also at first I thought developers were being stingy with how long the game was taking. Then read bout the guy's heart problems and how they wanted it to be perfect. Then waited (for a sale admittedly) to get the thing I've been looking forward to for like 2 years. If you want to just hang around with a pretty nice retro-ish but still new and original game buy this thing and then thank the guys at Heart Machine for making this wonderful game.But there are some minor visual glitches for various enemies. Not sure why or how they happen but it doesnt effect the game play at all so it isnt much of a  problem. Also game can now run at 60fps and looks freaking beautiful.			"

												This games has one of the most beautiful pixel art of the moment. For someone like me who like to see the game design beside the gameplay is a perfect game for you.Your gameplay are specific for patient gamers, because there's no instruction about how to play or what to do, u have to discover 80% of what do you have to do and how to do it for your own. For the ones who like this, enjoy it =D.The soundtrack are good at the begining, but if you play for a long time, can boring you. I guess is the one think that call my attecntion for a not so good think in the game 8D.For last, i can say that Hyper Light Drifter is a old school game like Zelda or Terranigma, with a topside vision, a good character evolution, good secrets and maps and a curios plot.I really recommend this game.

												This game, is AMAZING.It's like Zelda, Bastion and Dark Souls had a 3 way 8bit baby10/10 - visuals and gameplay7/10 - Music*Don't buy this game if you are easily frustrated. You will die countless times trying to finish one instance, or a boss encounter, especially if you don't take the time to prepare.The storytelling is simplistic, mostly done through images and small cutscenes, it succeded in captivating me right away.Althought there is a small toutorial, I loved that you have figure out how everything works, by actually playing the game. Trial and error so to speak.This game is on par with the original Zelda on NES			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent video game by Heart Machine. A few of its influences are clear from the get-go, such as the top down Zelda games, and having played through it, even recent games such as Bloodborne came to mind. That said it is still its own thing, with its own strong identity. This is helped by the brilliant art direction and pixel art animation, which is hard to fault. Disasterpeace’s soundtrack is moody, atmospheric and just plain gorgeous. The goal of the game is to activate the four pillars located in the Northern, Western, Eastern, and Southern areas. The game could best be described as action adventure, with a heavy emphasis on combat. You start the game with a sword and pistol, as well as the ability to dash. Using the combination of these three tools is key to progressing through the game.  The combat can be fast at times, although in some trickier areas a slow approach may be advisable. The enemies are well varied, with some being particularly aggressive. Most of these feel challenging and yet fair, although a certain plant enemy did aggravate me especially with its hard-hitting attacks. Often you may need to switch up the way you face the larger enemies, and it helps the combat from becoming too repetitive. You will find various other weapons throughout the game, and also purchase new abilities or upgrades. In the main hub area you can find a selection of shops to do so, and deciding what to spend your currency on can be difficult in itself. Unlike many games such as the Zelda series, the currency is a rare resource, with 4 small ‘blocks’ being used to make a big one. The big ones are then used to purchase new gear. These blocks are found hidden among the environment, or after defeating certain enemies and bosses. If you find an area or boss too difficult, you may want to search these out as the upgrades can help tremendously in the long run. Exploration is another big aspect of the game. From the outset, you have access to three of four main areas - each having a unique look and feel. These are linked to underground areas, which are filled with hidden paths and secrets. Finding the majority of these hidden paths isn’t required to complete the game, but there are still some you may need to find to progress. This brings me to the map, which I feel could have done with a little improvement, since it can be a little dubious at times. A marker system, similar to the one found in Axiom Verge, could have been a great addition especially when looking for a particular item or place. Of all the areas, I found the eastern area to be particularly confusing when going back to search for secrets. The boss battles are by far the biggest challenge in the game. The bosses guard the pillars at the end of the areas, and, as in games such as Dark Souls, can be as frustrating to fight as they are rewarding to defeat. Each will test your skills, in both dodging and attacking. Again the variety here is great, with each presenting a different process to defeat them. And well done Heart Machine to making retrying so painless; if you die in an area you start the area again with exactly what you entered it with. This makes it easy to get straight back into the action, and I feel a lot of modern games could learn from this (although loading times can’t be helped in games sometimes, but that’s another discussion in itself.) Music and sound design are excellent; from the more ambient sound to the more upbeat tracks everything suits the design of the game. The sounds are great, such as the satisfying noise from your sword swings or the little beeps your companion makes, nothing felt out of place. Overall both music and sound only enriched the game experience. Having taken around 16 hours to complete Hyper Light Drifter I’m extremely satisfied with the game, and yet I also want to go and play more, to discover all the hidden secrets I’m yet to find. Far from an easy game, it may put a few people off, but bear with it and you’ve got an excellent adventure. I found the game as compelling as it was addictive. While there have been a few bumps in the release, Alex Preston and his team has delivered a quality video game, one that I hope many others will play and enjoy. Their hard work and dedication should be recognized with such a well-crafted game.  I can’t wait for whatever is next.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter: the world's first Zeldroidvania game!This is my early pick for indie Game of the Year.Excellent, precise controls. Classic NES gameplay action. Intellectually satisfying. Ambient, beautiful music which never gets tired and always adds to the dark atmosphere. Text-free storyline and sub-plots. Easily some of the best pixel art ever to grace a video game. Possibly my favorite animation since Jordan Mechner's original Prince of Persia.Criticism of this game has been confined to difficulty. These gripes are legit if you're too young to have played 80s-90s classics like the first Castlevania games, games which were challenging on a level that makes Skyrim and Fallout look embarrassing by comparison. This game is not a walk in the park. You should not buy it for the pretty pictures alone. Expect to *play* this game. You'll need skills and brains.As for critics saying, ""First boss is impossible, I quit --"" this mentality is a lot like, ""Great Expectations was an excellent novel until it got too hard for me to read.""Zelda's overworld + Metroidvania game motifs + art for miles + thought-provoking puzzles + evocative storytelling = indie GotY.Get a copy. Don't even wait for Steam sales or Humble Bundles (which may not happen). This game is *easily* worth 20 USD. If you liked the original Zelda for NES, Castlevania IV -- Symphony of the Night, and/or Super Metroid on SNES, then this should be one of the best games you've played in a long time. If you love all three, Hyper Light Drifter just might make it into your Top 10 forever.			"

												MISERABLE SLOGI backed on Kickstarter because I was interested in a pixel-art RPG about exploration, and instead I got something else entirely.The Good: The art, the style, the worldbuilding, GREAT soundtrack by Disasterpeace (even if it does sound too much like FEZ from time to time)The Bad: The Difficulty Curve is terrible. Most games introduce a technique, allow you to become comfortable with it and then combine it with a different technique. HLD just throws some stuff in your face and expects you to keep up. First time you've seen a rolling plant-monster, you'll have four of them trying to kill you. Where is the RPG part of this game!? No dialogue trees, no NPCs, no levelling up - only some very obtuse upgrades. The 30fps design choice seems a bit eye-swimming at times.The Ugly: Boss Fights are on the far end of the difficulty curve, and require patterns to be learned and mastered. Apparently I no longer have the twitch-gaming skills of an Adderall-popping teenager because THE BOSS FIGHTS SUCK.I have all four triangles in the East, West, and North areas, have found a few ""extras"" and after numerous deaths have only completed one boss fight (East). At some point it stopped being fun and became a miserable slog.			"

												I wish I could give this a positive review.  For most of my play time, I really enjoyed it.  However, I feel obliged to give this game some much-needed negative feedback for the low-quality Linux port.  If you aren't on Linux, disregard this (since no one else is complaining of these problems, I assume they're Linux-specific).The game would sometimes stop playing music entirely, and the music wouldn't restart until I restarted the game (and sometimes even then it wouldn't play).  At first I didn't know it was a bug, until I found myself fighting an intense boss battle with no background music and I was like, ""hang on, this can't be right.""What really sealed the deal was when I beat the final boss, after countless tries, and then, as I was making my escape from the crumbling ruins... the game crashed.  No error, no nothing.  The window just closed.I restarted the game, hoping that perhaps it saved AFTER beating the boss.  Nope.I was INCREDIBLY hyped for beating that boss.  I missed out on an experience that I don't think can ever be recreated, and I doubt I'll ever be able to enjoy this game after that.  It has just left such an incredibly sour taste in my mouth.			"

												Brilliant visuals and game world design. However, the enemy numbers and damage are much too high for the relatively unresponsive controls. I want to like Hyper Light Drifter, but wasn't able to overcome the repetitive scenario of getting through an area with no save points and one health point left, then being swarmed by 6 shooters and 5 melee grunts at once. Perhaps the top 10% of skilled difficulty-lovers will be able to play and enjoy this, but unfortunately I was not one of them.			"

It reminded me of MegaMan, Akira, and Another World.It also had a dog that reminded me of my dog and I didn't have story elements shoved down my throat. I'm not really sure what is going on. I think its about a guy's struggle to stop smoking or save a dying world through the ceasation of smoking. The combat is excellent.			"

												Beautiful aesthetic, interesting gameplay, nicely done ambient music, frustrating problems.  I know this seems to be an indie darling right now, but already I find myself constantly annoyed with the game.The artwork looks nice in stills, but in practice leads me to be constantly unsure of what things are.  Is that something I can stand on, or will I fall?  Is that a wall, or something I can walk past?  Is this something that will block projectiles?I am also annoyed by the animations.  The animation for healing makes you briefly stand still, during which time you still take damage.  When you are knocked down, you are still capable of being damaged as you get up - or in some frustrating cases, knocked down again.  When you dodge, there is a brief period where it looks like your character is ready to attack but cannot.  Sometimes when dodging I can pass through projectiles without taking damage, but other times I cannot - I still do not know which is the intended result.Less annoying but still questionable is the decision to give as little information to the player as possible.  The first time I went into a store, I had no idea why I couldn't purchase something.  I was similarly confused when I got my first piece of currency, when I pulled my first purple arrow thing out of the ground, and when I had a key and could not enter a locked door.  I was also unsure about which direction I was meant to set out in, and apparantly picked the most difficult dungeon first.The negatives out of the way, I want to talk about the positives.  The setting of the game is mysterious and beautiful, the kind of place you want to learn more about.  The music I thought was very fitting for this, and combined with the sound effects the game was quite a pleasure to hear.  The enemies are varied and interesting, and this leads to combat that is surprisingly well done for such a lo-fi game.  The developers have put some great work into the game - it originally was released at 30 fps max, but after player requests they went back and redid everything to make it run at 60.Overall, I felt the flaws outweighed the positives.  I know other people will be able to get past them to appreciate the game underneath, but I found myself constantly frustrated by the problems above.			"

												Warning: PLAY THE GAME WITH A CONTROLLER YOU REM... that is allI've been waitaing a very long time for this pixel art gem. and Its just as good as I was hoping it to be.To break up simpley, overhyping is bad. However since I gave it the appropriate hype It was actually better than I already thought it would be.Major elementsSmooth movement and a very steep learning curve at the beginning, this game is truely to be admired for its level of pure expertise put into every section. Every area I walk down is beautifully handcrafted pixel art, the best pixel art I have personnaley ever seen. A story, that on the surface, is simple but has so much depth within it. Set in a world similar to ghiblies nausica and the valley of the wind dystopian world. With a war long forgotten yet still leaving its imprints on the world around you. Great giant beasts long dead. And a very mysterious antagonist of dark power who is somehow a figment of your sickness but much more. A creature resembling a dog of great power that somehow, needs your help. I gathered all this from pictures and the landscape around you. Its a visual story and an excellentley beautiful pixel one at that.GameplayTo put it as simpley as I can, legend of zeldas top down sword gameplay combine with a dash move that you have to master to not get hit. With the added bonus of a large mix of weapons to boot. And upgrades that basically add a whole new way to play but also make certain tasks slightley easier. There are also health packs which are scattered across the level to insta heal your tiny block health bar. And ammo that us used for all your weapons in your inventory recharged by slashing your enemies to pieces. You may also cross pits by dashing over them which can be sped up by spike traps littered on the platforms. In short:A hack'slash'n'dash with guns and Isometric platforming. With pin prick accurecy built in to it all.Level designThe level design here is just ♥♥♥♥ing beuatiful. Not only leading to intresting enemy encounters, but multiple paths to traverse the area and traps like sentries or spike traps to boot. There is a very adventureous feel to it and backtracking for mysterious never gets old because of the beautiful landscape or new items you find on the search. Puzzels and secrets are very well hidden but in a way to be enjoyable enough to find with the right amount of effort giving a great pay off when eventually do find them. The isometric parkour adds a lot as well, being so accurate that even non intentional areas can be landed on, which in my opinion is a blessing and a curse in the best ways especially because of the dash. The world itself is split up into 3 sections a forest, a snowey mountain and a aquaduct each with different types of difficultey but being about eqaul in how hard they are. Each one is better suited for certain abilities within the game that you can buy. There also warp gates you can activate inside the worlds which better help you replenish your ammo an health and make travel easier. While I won't spoil anything, the south area can only be played last.You acess all these worlds through a main hub world where you can purchase upgrades and do little minigames.To sum it up: Legend of zelda's multiple worlds with a hub world, underground and upper ground gmaeplay and isometric parkour. With many traps and puzzels.MusicIt has the stylings of a mix of adventure 8bit music, varieing in different areas with a slight Journey instremental thing going on. Its pleasurable to listen to and doesn't get to repetative when your listening to the same track. A beuatiful OST with a very slow and mysterious theme only picking up during boss fights. It is almost always a beuatiful noise to listen to.So very simple put:A very mysterious, mood setter sound track that does it job very well. Not somthing I'd listen to while working though. Just excellent for what its meant to do. I love hearing it every time I enter a different room with different music.Graphics( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)This is the best pixel out right now, no competition. Everything is beautiful to look at, everything is very well hand crafted, with beautiful backgrounds to suit. The shading and waters effects are *kiss kiss* un le buea. Though if you get motion sick easily then the backgrounds moving with you will make you very, very ill. but everything in the art department is basically perfect.in short:The best pixel art in the world right now.Boss fights:One of the biggest parts of the game, the boss fights lead up to the end of an area. They are also all almost impossible without better weaponrey. Ludicrousley hard without upgrades. And all with loving time in care into there very clever attack patterns. Though somtime I question their design choices. Each has a melee a ranged and a splash but the way they are dished out is very different (I think 2 don't have melee (-_- ;) ) You may find the bosses unfair, but once you've learnt their attack pattern you have no one to blame but yourself.In basic:Basic Isometric boss ideas, made creativleyThe game breaking glitch:I think this might be steam fault but my game keeps crashing on the end credits. This pisses me off to no end. Also don't leave it alone for to long then come back because the frame rate will dip like nachos in sauce.Summarey:10 capes outta 10-Excellent combat system-Zelda gameplay style with a unique spin-A no word story-The best pixel art currentley on the market-Isomextric platforming with great acuracy-Epic level design-mestyrious music design-Basic boss ideas with great new takes on them-Upgrades that make the game feel diffrent :OAnd all for its cheap price tag on steam at £15.00 (£14.99 = $21.33) is worth every penny and more9.5/10 because 10 is just unreachable, nothing is perfect. This is prettey close.This game barley ever gets old unless you do the same room again and again and again so its got great replayability to that 100%minor negatives-disturbingley steep boss learing curve at the beginning of the game-Accidental deaths through unpredictable cirumstances-Frame rate dips from playing to longand a personnel not of I can not beat the game until steam bucks up how well it can handle the ♥♥♥♥ing end credits XD-a game prone to motion sickness for those with that problem ;(...

												After waiting for this game for 2 years.  It finally arrived, but at the cost of the game promised kickstarter strech goals features, that is still on the way.  Thankfully the base game itself is very much a complete experience.  Don't expect a long game, it will take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete.  Which to me is fine and the replay value is pretty high.  Hyper Light Drifter is a top down action/adventure game that is set in a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy world of the unknown.  You play as a Drifter who suffers from a nasty disease and must traverse into this strange unknown land to find a cure, while dealing with all sorts of pearls.  The story has no dialogue, its instead told by the visuals and photos of what has transpired here.  It offers good clues and histroy about this world before everything became a nightmare.  I only wish the game did expand upon it, if it did have more levels.  Hopefully it'll come in later weeks or months.Gameplay is probably one of the most fun experience I had in 2016.  It mixes combat bits from Bloodborne, Legend of Zelda and Diablo into a single game.  The result is a brutal, challenging combat I have ever played.  Be warned that it's one tough game, but I honestly think it's one of the most fair games ever made.  There's not one moment that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off.  A lot of deaths will come by your actions, so you have to be very careful on how you deal with tough situations in either 4 levels that you can start with at anytime.  Boss Fights are fun and fair, the enemies are designed well enough (thou I wished they added more, but we'll see.), the controls and combat mechanics are solid.  I do recommend playing with the controller either the PS4 or 360 is up to you.  The Keyboard & Mouse controls are underwhelming, it's very customizable but the experience is better played with the controller.  Level design is solid with good amount of secrets to find and loads of hidden story bits to discover.  You'll be sucking the life outta this game for some time, if you want to see it all.Visually, it's one fine looking game.  I do think most indie games that tried so hard to capture the old school visuals of the past, but Hyper Light Drifter to me looks more interesting than Undertale.  The detail is solid and the animations are slick and beautiful to look at.  The Soundtrack is also good and it fits well to the game's grim nature.Overall: While Hyper Light Drifter doesn't provide the ultimate complete experience that we were promised but I do hope Hearts Machine will continue supporting this game for quite awhile.  There's a lot of love been put into this title.  It isn't perfect as the game short lengh and only 4 levels begs for more.  But I strongly recommend this game.  It's challenging, fun and highly replayable.  It might be the best indie game since Shovel Knight.			"

The last theme is really good.the world is interesting and there are good upgrades to be foundDifficulty is hard but not too hard to be funBad:Enemies can be cheap. You'll fall ont he ground and still get hit. The ending is anticlimatic and abrupt(you'll know it's coming but it is underwhelming; the credits are 100X longer than the ending).Collectibles are lame. I looked for stuff but didn't get alot of it, reagrdless i still maanaged to get all the upgrades i wanted.  you can also get new cloaks but i never found any. The dash system could be much better.Wouldn't reccmmend it at $20. Would reccommend it at $15. I did not rush through the game at all and I died quite a bit and it only took me 6 hours to beat.			"

												This game plays a little bit as if Zelda had a child with Dark Souls. The game is challenging while not being unfair and the difficulty and power lvl scales great.  You start with very basic attacks but as the game goes on you get new weapons and abilities that help through your journey.  The lore of the game is fairly obscure and there is absolutely no dialogue (story is shown through ""visions"" or pictures).  The boss fights are really something else and you will need to use everything at your disposal to get past them.  Regarding the boss fights and the game itself:  The game may be more challenging than some people may get used to. However with the 60 fps patch, the developers decided to address this.  There is now an option for the game so that people that do not like that type of challenge to also enjoy it.  The game is easier but without access to some achievements.  It should be easy for pretty much anyone to play.What brought me to this game was honestly the art style.  This game packs some of the cleanest and best pixel art I've seen in a very long time. It plays great and the world was a wonder to explore.  All in all I would highly recommend to it to anyone that's curious about it just from the videos and images that pop up.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. I STRONGLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO THOSE LOOKING FOR A BEAUTIFUL STORY.The Story:The story to this game is much richer than any other game I have ever played. It constantly keeps you in the mood to keep playing and I am tempted to play the game through another time. If this was just a book, I would definately pay $20 just for that alone. 100000000000000000000000000/10 storyGameplay:You won't find any other game that has boss battles that compare to this one. The boss battles inside this game are an essence of true challenge and are a constant fun. Though some may look back at this review and say "" that boss battle was too hard!""; that is also mainly because this game is almost entirely skill based. Though there are certain skills and such that would help, it is purely based on the essence of timing and reactions. If you aren't very good at skill based games, don't worry, because this game will almost teach you these reactions in a way. 10/10 gameplaySoundtrack:The soundtrack itself is just amazing and adds so much to the story. If it wasn't for the soundtrack I wouldn't have bought this game in the firstplace. The music inside the trailer tempted me to test the game out and see what it was really for; I can only say that it was well worth it. 10/10 soundtrackOverall:This game is honestly the best game I have ever played; that could just be because my bad choice in games but nothing beats the beauty of this game. Though it only takes 20 hours or so to beat and 14 hours for me in my case, it is well worth it. If you can't really afford this game save up and buy it another time because it will be well worth it. I would only not reccomend the game if you are just looking for a grinding type game and only want a game that you can grind a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of hours for, however, if you are looking for a game that will make you cry at the end, this is it.P.S. DON'T WATCH WALKTHROUGHS ON HOW TO BEAT BOSSES, I PERSONALLY NEVER DID IT (except on one boss and it ruined that boss battle for me) BUT FIGHTING THE BOSS'S OVER AND OVER AGAIN CAN REALLY BRING OUT A LOT OF FUN IN THE GAME. I WOULD ONLY RECCOMEND WALKTHROUGHS IF YOU ARE PURELY STUCK AND CAN'T FIND THE MODULESI also reccomend watching a video explaining the lore ONLY ONCE YOU HAVE FINISHED THE GAME. It ties so many ends and makes your day :)Good luck, and have fun playing if you're going to get this game! 11/10 would definately reccomend buying this game			"

												I'll be brief! Responsive controls, lovely art style paired with really zen music, and a vagueness to the plot and direction that actually leaves you feeling good about exploring and finding things out for yourself. My complaint? Those ****ing BLOCKS ARE RUINING ME. But for real, this is a delightful game, if you enjoy zipping around and slashing through enemies, platforming by using dashes as opposed to jumps, and a new soundtrack to hunt down online- this game is for you.P.S. The soundtrack can be found on Disasterpeace's Bandcamp page.			"

												With its slash-dodge-and-heal gameplay loop, it invokes Bloodborne and the Souls games, while also incorporating their difficulty. I'm not an animator, but as someone who creates from animated source material, I appreciate the attention to detail on visuals, which match that of games developed on a scale larger than even its own. The omission of any text from NPC interactions, and even the skill tree, recalls the minuscule nature of Journey, resulting in an experience that transcends spoken languages. The soundtrack is good. You can listen to it for yourself.Buy, play, and appreciate Hyper Light Drifter if any of this resonates with you.			"

												It's utterly beautiful and once you get the gameplay mechanics it's rather engaging with exploring being often highly rewarding, though you need to have decent reaction speeds + co-ordination and using a controller is highly recommended. In other words, if Dark Souls was painful for you, don't buy this. Unless an easy mode is added that is, which I would love for those moments my brain decides to pack in :P  "

												Very fun and atmospheric Zeldalike with some pretty unforgiving combat. If you can handle a challenge and/or beating your head against a boss for a while until you finally succeed, you'll have lots of fun. At somewhere around 8 hours to beat, it isn't too long but there are lots of secrets to find, many of which I haven't even begun to uncover yet.			"

												This game plays a little bit as if Zelda had a child with Dark Souls. The game is challenging while not being unfair and the difficulty and power lvl scales great.  You start with very basic attacks but as the game goes on you get new weapons and abilities that help through your journey.  The lore of the game is fairly obscure and there is absolutely no dialogue (story is shown through ""visions"" or pictures).  The boss fights are really something else and you will need to use everything at your disposal to get past them.  Regarding the boss fights and the game itself:  The game may be more challenging than some people may get used to. However with the 60 fps patch, the developers decided to address this.  There is now an option for the game so that people that do not like that type of challenge to also enjoy it.  The game is easier but without access to some achievements.  It should be easy for pretty much anyone to play.What brought me to this game was honestly the art style.  This game packs some of the cleanest and best pixel art I've seen in a very long time. It plays great and the world was a wonder to explore.  All in all I would highly recommend to it to anyone that's curious about it just from the videos and images that pop up.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a worthwhile experience. The combat is incredibly satisfying. Both the in game graphics and music are breathtaking. The world is fun to explore and exudes atmosphere and story without ever uttering a single word of dialogue or text. For some this would be a turn off looking for a more concrete narrative, myself included, but I was able to quickly get over that. My only complaint is that some of the enemy encounters can get a little cheap, stun locking you to death a few times. Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough and urge anyone to give it a shot and see if it hooks you.			"

												Very neat game with the beautiful colors and nice sound. A bit challenging sometimes but don't worry - it's far from the real hardcore. The best part in the whole HLD is the world where the story takes place - combination of fantasy and post apocalyptic themes brings us all interesting locations with the beautiful backgrounds (I'd like to see even more parallax effect on it, but c'mon, it's good anyway). Well if you like oldschool Zelda-type games you definitely should give HLD a shot.P.S. The game's world and the music reminds me of Adventure Time for some strange reason :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun. The best way to describe it is a fast 2D Bloodborne, but even that doesnt fully capture everything about this game. The graphics are beautiful, and the imagery is original and breathtaking. Throughout the game's environments you're constantly running into pieces of giant robots and abondoned artifacts, and all of it mixes so well together in a technologically advanced post-apocalypse. The first time I saw the gameplay a few years ago, it reminded me of an obscure Kojima game called ""Boktai"" and I wasn't totally wrong. It's a top-down, somewhat isometric view (think zelda), and you have two different types of weapons. first is your sword, which if very quick and satisfying, and second is your gun, which you can aim in a circle and fire in any direction. Your gun has limited ammo, but it can be recharged by fighting enemies and destroying objects. this works especially well during the boss fights, because you can stay far away and fired off a few shots from your gun, then when there's an opening you can get close and get some hits from your sword. During normal gameplay, each kill recharges one bullet, and during boss fights, each sword hit on the boss recharges one bullet, making it really easy to switch between the two tactically. You eventually get more guns and a grenade that recharges over time, and these also have a lot of tactical value. For mobility you have fairly average moving speed, but you also have a dash that can be used continuously. This works both to clear gaps, and as a ""dodge roll"" to avoid incoming attacks. You can upgrade this dash with other abilities, like lower cooldown so you can chain them together, and an attack that can be used during a dash. You don't have a lot of health, but you can find and carry med kits (like blood vials or estus flasks) to heal when you need to, but it has a delay that makes it necessary to use caution when in combat (still like blood vials or estus flasks). The enemies aren't very difficult individually, but when you encounter them in groups, it begins to be a challenge. I've been hearing a lot of people say this game is ""too difficult"", but I found it to be just the right amount of challenge, it's just something you have to keep retrying, as you do better and better each time you revise your strategy. The game isn't very punishing at all, when you die you restart at the beginning of the room or encounter, and it doesn't take long to reload the save. You definitely have to manage your health pretty heavily, and make sure you have enough estus -- I mean med kits to keep yourself alive. You always have the option of backtracking to heal or find something else to help you (med kits, upgrades, etc).The bosses are where everyone seems to be ragequitting, saying they're ""impossible"" and ""way too hard to enjoy"", but honestly I don't see that at all. The bosses only seem as hard as the normal encounters, and while I haven't finished the game, I am pretty far (I've completed the north area), and I can say that the bosses are something you chip away at and try not to get frustrated over. If you've ever played a Souls game, then you should be familiar with the concept of retrying a boss over and over and over again making slight amounts of progress each time, only those games are much, much more punishing. I only had to retry about fifteen times to kill the north boss (bird magician), and each try took about three minutes at most. Once you see the patterns and get into a rhythm, it isn't really very difficult or unfair. Now look, I'm not gonna say it isn't difficult, and that's because I'm not that great at very many games. I quit games that are too hard all the time. But if I'm interested enough in a game, I put in the effort to ""git gud"" and move forward. There are too many games that I've quit for difficulty and come back to so I could push myself to finish them (Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2 (the hardest game I've finished probably), Mega Man X 4's final boss (the hardest boss I've killed), Zone of the Enders 2 (which ironically is one of the easiest games for me now), Dark Souls (which I still haven't finished), the list goes on), but I'm glad to say so far this isn't one of them.To everyone who's stuck in this game, good luck, keep trying, and explore some and maybe you'll find something to help you.

												At first I was kind of scared seeing that this game had some ""game breaking bugs"" so I held off for a day and then apparently all the bugs had dissapiered. After that I got the game and immediatly fell in love. Beautiful graphics, amazing atmosphere, and combat that is familiar yet new. I will admit that at first the complete lack of any text except for the title screen and the menus, made me think it would be hard to follow the story or use the stores, but the way this was handled was great, with use of somewhat of a slide-show when talking to NPC's and cutscenes that leave you in awe (or in some cases great shock). Definately recomend the game, 8.5/10. Would be 9/10 or maybe even 10/10 if it weren't for the occasional crash or bug, and the fact that the combat is tricky to get used to at first, but don't worry you should have it down by the time you beat the first boss.

It has the feel of Dark Souls, without all the item management.It has the look of classic 2D adventure RPGs (LoZ).If the quality of the music in the first 10 minutes alone doesn't ""sell"" you, then you might be lost here.I would most definitely recommend that you play this game with a controller; I've been using a DualShock4 and it plays beautifully!It caps off at 30FPS, and I have heard of some issues re: frame rate dropping in the ""main town hub"" of the game.This is actually one of the few games that I WANT to see it through to the end.

The game is all about fast paced action and a lot of the times there's just not enough updates on your screen to keep track of your character through all the chaos.Other than that, the graphics are sublime, the music is excellent, the level design is great.It's short though. I'm about 11 hours in and on the cusp of finishing it. And that's split between 2 play throughs! I started playing at home, and had to restart on another computer.I'll probably go back and try to 100% it.			"

												This game has a ""what the hell just happened"" moment right of the bat. Spoiler, it doesn't get any less confusing. It's one of those games that is so vague as to what is going on and why your doing what your doing, that you want to see it through. Paired with great game play, it's a great game, maybe not for everyone, but still a great game.			"

												This game has really good controls and great gameplay feel (on a controller), just moving the character around feels good, which works wonders since the game is heavy on exploration. The combat might be tricky to some, and even though the game isn't overly difficult it can be challenging at times. Once you get the hang of it though it becomes greatly satisfying.The world is not only amazingly beautiful, it's also well thought out and seasoned with lore. The levels are really well designed and filled with secret items and paths. It all comes together with an outstanding atmospheric soundtrack by Disasperpeace.All in all it's a solid and memorable experience and a GOTY contender on my list.			"

												Okay first off this game is great fun! Or it was... The game is ALOT harder than it used to be.Thanks to the continuous updates I refuse to have this game in my library anymore either. They decided to cater to the hardcore masochistic gamers with their updates therefore eliminating anyone who isn't the best at games like this. Also they mentioned an ""EASY MODE"" many weeks ago after they made the game much harder. The ""easy mode"" is nowhere in sight to this day.I HAVE BEAT THIS GAME. But didn't get to find all the secrets due to a very limited data internet provider and this game's constant nagging updates and various betas. They put out updates weekly and sometimes bi or tri weekly in the game's launch weeks. By now the updates have gone far above what the game initially was and the UPDATES ARE NOT SMALL. Dark Souls 3 has WAY SMALLER UPDATES!!! WHAT THE F#&%!? I would also like to add they don't give patch notes for every update.. so you can accidentally update to something you didnt want and have to redownload the previous beta all over again.I'm so done with this game it's not even funny.

												Wow... This is a damn good game! Great pacing!Very rarely did I get stuck trying to figure out what to do next thanks to the awesome level design. The game didn't hold my hand like I was incapable of using my brain as a human being.Challenging! You will die, but not unfairly, just like the well-designed games of the 8 and 16 bit era.Pick this up! This is NOT just another ""oh look, cool visuals"" indie game. (On a side note, I see a slight resemblance to Out of This World in the artwork. -I wanted to point that tidbit out just so you know that I have been playing games longer than most of the teenies who are making comparisons to Dark Souls in these reviews) "

												One of the ten best games I've ever played. It starts beautifully, and quickly draws you in, but don't be fooled, there's SO MUCH MORE to the game than you might expect from it's retro styling and tropes. It plays like classic Zelda I, with all the open world ambiguity and lack of guideposts, however every system is deeper and more refined than what you may think. Playing the game expecting just a nostaligic romp will lull you into a sense of security that only starts to unravell as you travel deeper into the world - put the time in and be delighted! Two examples (of many):  Hyper Light Drifter offers a map like you'd expect from the explore the world style of game with ability gates. However this is not a map that will help you find secrets or even track progress. It's more like the paper map in teh back of a SNES manual, a tantelizing hint. You're position is not even accurately shown on the map, just your rought area, you have to use the landmarks to accually orient yourself and find the paths you want to chase down. You want to track down all the secrets? You're going to have to bust out pencil and paper old school!Combat in Hyper Light Drifter makes you feel amazing ... when you can pull it off. Your character practices a style of sword and gunplay that is fittingly reminescnt of Lord Yupa in the movie Nausicaa. However unlike other games where you execute button sequences to trigger daring combos, here you actually have to learn how to do it all yourself from a combination of only three basic actions. It's thrilling combination of delibertae slow paced pataince, and super rapid execution, and when you pull it off you feel like you're really earned being the hero.Highly, highly, recommended!			"

												Overall, this game really impressed me. It proudly wears its Zelda influences on its sleeve and uses them in ways I haven't seen before. It's level design - for the most part - is outstanding and flawlessly feeds into the player's sense of progression, bar a few instances where it requires you to be more meticulous during exploration than it perhaps should. It's aesthetic, music, and overall artistic implementation can stand with the greats in terms of immersion and a host of beautiful vistas. The underlying combat mechanics are sound and ensure tough but varied enemy encounters. HLD does have a few caveats that shouldn't be overlooked, though. Even my biggest caveat of lacking 60fps support has been fixed (about a day after I released this review), so responsiveness should now be increased. You might feel somewhat disoriented when you first start playing since you're not given clear directions, or even much of an indication, what you're objective is. Nevertheless, If you can look past those imperfections I'd strongly recommend you give Hyper Light Drifter a try. It's not only just the right amount of challenging but features a world you'll want to explore for yourself.Full review on YouTube:

												I really wanted to like this game. The art and music are dope and I love what it tried to do with the mechanics. I'm even willing to look past the *too* vague application of story but a game which is supposed to reward fast paced, precise play is fundamentally flawed when there is a delay after dodging and a lock at 30fps which makes it very difficult to play with precision when thinks get busy on screen.

												As a consistent keyboard + mouse player I was immediately drawn to play by WASD for this game, as I've gotten used to in most other games. Unfortunately Hyper Light Drifter seems to be very poorly optimized for anyone arguing against using a controller, which I don't have the ability to play the game with in the first place. As much as I'm willing to sacrafice a joystick's versatile direction scheme for the simple and stupid eight directions WASD allows, I can't tolerate the fact that certain functions of the game seem to be broken by K+M use in the game.My problem is only this for the time being: it doesn't seem to be possible to change chain dashing direction with just WASD. I can't complete several portions of secrets to the levels in the game without being able to do this. Until an update is released that better accomodates the use of a keyboard, I'm afraid I'll have to shelf HLD. I hope the developers find time to address issues like these in the near future.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of the most beautiful, atmospheric games I've ever played. The wordless storytelling is very creative and evocative, and it's impressive how it manages to convey information and mood. There are plenty of times where I could have been frustrated by the game's difficulty, but having multiple areas open to explore made me more likely to just go ""eh, I'll come back to it later,"" than feeling like I was bashing my head up against a wall. And that feeling of accomplishment when you come back to what was giving you issues before and realize that you've gotten better at the game? Priceless.Anyway, I can't recommend this highly enough.

												This is the most gorgeous game I've ever hated to play.Hyper Light Drifter is a game where controls need to be ultra-crisp, logical and responsive; it's a game where combat is lightning-fast and death comes easily.Instead, it's a game where most of the toys you need to survive past very early fights are locked away, there is zero in-game explanation of the mechanics other than a basic control schema, the controls feel mushy (especially mouse-aiming and mouse-dashing, which both appear to be suffering from resolution-based calculation errors), and the framerate is slow enough to be a bit annoying.The gameplay isn't so much ""unforgiving"" as ""unforgivable"".  This is a Zelda-esque game where your player can get stun-locked and insta-killed by characters in a split-second, where your gun's aim-point is frequently not where the cursor is, where the sword's field of attack is so limited that you frequently miss enemies even though they're in the hitbox zone while the animation is still playing, your character can get stunned but enemies never leave their timing, get knocked back, etc., etc., etc.  It's like going back in time, to play a game whose art clearly offers nods to classics like Out of This World or Zelda, to discover that the developers paid very little attention to just how carefully those old-school games were engineered, especially in terms of the fundamental combat mechanics and handling of situations like getting hit while executing an attack animation (hint: it's un-Fun to cancel the attack animation and cause the player to die from the second incoming hit, devs... especially since you can't do that with the sword yourself).It's a wonderful work on the art, music and sound-design side.  I'd play it with God Mode on, if it existed, just to see the art.  Most egregiously, death robs you of the most important resource of all; your life on this planet.  Die (and you will, and often) and you'll be ""rewarded"" with a long death animation, followed by a long, long walk back to wherever you last died, in yet-another arena fight.  A game where death is so commonplace shouldn't work like this; a game where you might have to re-do multiple arenas in a row should *definitely* not work like this.I quit after going North, defeating the Bird mini-boss, and then discovering an encounter where you have to defeat not one but two of a new enemy type, survive a tricky mini-arena, and then activate a switch.  On the way back, block-traps that got activated suddenly killed me... and I would have had to do the entire difficult sequence all over again, because activating the switch didn't trigger an auto-save.  This was after dying 3 times on the early part before figuring out that I could cheese the mini-arena's mechanics, which are buggy.This is game-design in 2016?There are no difficulty settings; apparently, the developers think that if you want to see their story and content, you should just suffer through the gameplay until you gitbtrn00b.For $20, which is what I spent on this, I have pretty high expectations from an Indie title, and the content, which I'll never see because the gameplay annoyed me, is probably worth seeing as an example of how much can be done with limited-palette game art; what I got to see before giving up was beautiful.  It's just a shame that the core game experience is so bad, largely because of the ""little things"" that really matter- difficulty settings, accurate controls, combat mechanics that feel sensible, and not wasting my life having to re-do so much stuff every time I die.

TLDR:Pros:This is just effing amazing!Amazing art and music. The ambience is just sublime.Combat is fun.Exploration is amazing.All in all it’s my GOTY for 2016Cons:Background foreground differentiation a little bit blurry sometimes.Sound glitches detract from beautiful soundtrack.No maps for items.Sometimes the game just refuses to recognise my controler (xbox 360 or steam).There’s one secret that I can’t get because something that should be in screen is not.All of these are minor details.Review:I have to say that I love everything about this game. I’m sitting here trying to think of something that I don’t like… I’m drawing a blank.Let’s start with the obvious, it’s gorgeous. The color scheme and the artistic direction of the game are right up my alley. Each part of the world has a particular handcrafted feel that makes you want to explore, just for the pleasure of looking around. The attention to detail, the way secrets are hidden, but just visible enough to be found by the attentive explorer… The only gripe that I have is that sometimes the background and the foreground are difficult to tell apart, which can have you spending precious life jumping of ledges, just to make sure.Next the sound design and the music of the game. Fantastic. The music and the graphics come together in a  harmonious ensemble that is nothing short of breathtaking. The only gripe I have here is that sometimes the game inexplicably glitches the soundtrack, so you get this funny little cutout wobble thing going on. Minor details…Gameplay… Everything comes together here. This is the real stand out part of the game. Combat: The combat is interesting and fluid, with each upgrade contributing to the feeling of mastery of the game. There’s nothing better than striding confidently into an area you have already cleaned out, that was quite difficult before and finishing it without being touched. At the same time the game avoids the sometimes frustrating need to learn every pattern of by heart before you can advance past a new enemy, making the game more fluid and easier to get to like.Exploration: The visuals of the game combine with immaculate level design and intriguing lore to present you with a world that is yours to explore. I must have been back over every inch of the world 2 or  3 times and I still get a little thrill when I find an item that had previously eluded me, or remember the way the things were placed in plain sight in order to conceal.Length: The game is rather short, at 5-10 hours of playtime on your first run to finish the main story line, however this can be overlooked when you consider the story of the developer and the overall quality of the game. I mean damn!All in all I spent a little over 24 hours with the game in a weekend. I could not look away. I know that i’ll be back further down the road to test out the co-op options as well as launching boss rush and ng+, but even if the game didn’t have any of this it would still be my GOTY for 2016. Wow, just wow!			"

												Amazing game by a dedicated group of artists. It has beautiful sound and music with gorgeous 8 bit art. Yes, its actually 8 bit and they make it work. A whole lot of blues and reds. The action is fast. Its like if you took the dash from any game with a dash and put it in the original Legend of Zelda and replaced all the text dialog with single frame diaramas for the character speech.Sometimes the controls are a bit funky but I've gotten used to it. Its a hard game even when everything technically works. Great challenging design.			"

												The first time I dashed through a group of enemies to deflect a bullet with the same slash that killed two samurai just as my thrown bomb pureed a pack of space wolves was pretty satisfying. HLD is one of the first games in a while that feels like I'm developing a unique skillset through playing it. So many games now rely on artificial progression systems in the form of rising statistics to add that feeling. There are unlocks in this game, but I'm the one getting better at playing it, not just my character. The different abilities complement each other well once you learn to use them.HLD might be one of those games that could be great to come into knowing nothing about it. On the other hand, I've found that knowing about the lead developer's heart condition has changed how I see the game in interesting ways. You're free to see what you want in the imagery. But what I've seen so far is a story about a character with a terminal illness, wandering a dying world in search of something. And the quality of the art and sound really helps to sell the gravitas of that story.Be warned that the game is not easy. Some of the bosses are very difficult, in my opinion. But the game is open enough that you can always come back to an area later if you get stuck. There is a lot to explore, and the game rewards you for doing so. There are many times when you may have more options than you think.			"

												As a fan of ACT for a decade, I'm more than satisfied with the combat system and style of this indie game. Honestly, I never thought that a 2d pixel-graphic game could deliver such experience comparable to all those great titles I played like DMC series and Ninja Gaiden. Plus, the developers are all about quick updates which supposed to fix all the bugs I personally never encountered... And as if the graphics aren't artistic enough already, they improved the textures with two updates in less than 2 weeks... I don't know what to say guys... well...maybe...DID YOU ♥♥♥♥ING SEE THAT FROM SOFTWARE?!			"

The biggest difference I'd say is that instead of having different kinds of items that do different things as well as figuring out puzzles in the dungeons, the game is more combat and platforming based. A very solid game that I would highly recommend picking up, sale or no sale.			"

												This game is narratively weak. This is sad because i believe it had much potential.Inpiring  recent and much older games, HLD feel like the creative mind behind it took many games and threw them in a blender.HLD reminded me of:*Hotline Miami for it fast-paced combats and fast respawns*FEZ for its music and cubic-inclined pixel artstyle*Super Metroid for it love for elevators and approximative maps*Dark Soul for it ability to induce me in rage from it difficulty and it criptic lore... or wannabe criptic lore, in HLD's case.The lore litterally feel non-existant, being too rushed for the game lenght. ""Hero comes and do his thing and leave""There's barely any hint of what happened before, or what your goal is, beside bleeding everywhere.I know there a way to decypher the pillars (FEZ-style), yet it only reward you with too previsible lore taken straight out a 80's kidcartoon: Previsible, over-used and pre-heated narative.It's a massive bummer for me. I was this close on giving up and getting this bland mess refunded but i said ""NO, no wait a♥♥♥♥♥♥game like this gonna make me ragequit""... to my bigest disappointement. If i had let my ego out, i'd be richer of 20$ (a lot of money for a game only sitting on it's aesthetics to tease innoncent boys like me.All the time i was fighting to keep on beating it, the game felt unnecessary challenging, using it absurd earlygame difficulty to stretch the sauce. Among with the very punitive exploration, killing you fast for hugging all the ledges for secrets and sweet sweet money...3/10			"

												If A Link To The Past, Super Metroid, and Bloodborne had a threeway, this game would be their mutant offspring. And by 'mutant', I don't mean in the super ♥♥♥♥ed up way, I mean in the ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's the X-Men"" way.I've been waiting for this game since I saw it on kickstarter and it's finally here, and this game has overdelivered to all hell. Everything in this game is amazing and you tell they've put a lot of work into it. The Soudtrack, sound effects, art style, it all combines to give you atmospheric as hell game, despite it being in two dimensions.The Combat is also amazing, it's as if they took Bloodbornes combat style, teaked it a little, and then almost perfectly translated it into a two dimensional plane. You'll find youself dodging around a lot trying to get behind your enemies to get a hit into them, or trying to back off so you can use a medpack in the corner and continue the fight. And the guns work well, too, they have some sort of soft-lock which can miss at times, but you can manually aim them if you wish to do so.The game encourages you to backtrack to areas you've been before after finding things from different areas to find more secrets or loot that you couldn't find beforehand, and the game takes on A Link To The Pasts mentality by letting you do the areas in any order you like, reguardless of what gear you have.The Bosses are well designed and an absolute blast to go against. At times it can feel as if a boss is too hard and that it has a cheap way of being difficult. it doesn't every boss I've encountered so far has the potential to be beaten without being hit once, and they all clearly tell you or let you know what the bosses attacks will be by the enemies you encounter in the area beforehand.I've not finished this game yet, I have a feeling I've got another 6 or so hours to go, maybe longer. I'll update my review when I finish the game.As of this point in time when I've completed 3 areas, I give the game an 8.5/10.If you've been looking at this game and thing you should get it, the answer is a resounding yes, as you will definately NOT be disappointed.

												EXPLORE - FIGHT - SURVIVE*....cough*Jokes aside, I would say that this is well worth $19.99 USD (got on sale for $17.99 USD)!If you like games that do not hold your hand, this is for you. It has the feel of Dark Souls, without all the item management.It has the look of classic 2D adventure RPGs (LoZ).If the quality of the music in the first 10 minutes alone doesn't ""sell"" you, then you might be lost here.I would most definitely recommend that you play this game with a controller; I've been using a DualShock4 and it plays beautifully!It caps off at 30FPS, and I have heard of some issues re: frame rate dropping in the ""main town hub"" of the game.This is actually one of the few games that I WANT to see it through to the end.

A.k.a. complex and hard rpg's with a minimal story told mostly through the enviroment to have gameplay at the top of anything else.No, this game is not for you buddy.Yes, Praise the sun and play this if you've got the time/money.Also, unlike the original Dark Souls, it's easily run at 60fps.

												Amazing game with some minor issues.The biggest one I've noticed is the forced 30 fps limit. The game is all about fast paced action and a lot of the times there's just not enough updates on your screen to keep track of your character through all the chaos.Other than that, the graphics are sublime, the music is excellent, the level design is great.It's short though. I'm about 11 hours in and on the cusp of finishing it. And that's split between 2 play throughs! I started playing at home, and had to restart on another computer.I'll probably go back and try to 100% it.			"

												After waiting for this game for 2 years.  It finally arrived, but at the cost of the game promised kickstarter strech goals features, that is still on the way.  Thankfully the base game itself is very much a complete experience.  Don't expect a long game, it will take you about 5 or 6 hours to complete.  Which to me is fine and the replay value is pretty high.  Hyper Light Drifter is a top down action/adventure game that is set in a mysterious Cyberpunk/Fantasy world of the unknown.  You play as a Drifter who suffers from a nasty disease and must traverse into this strange unknown land to find a cure, while dealing with all sorts of pearls.  The story has no dialogue, its instead told by the visuals and photos of what has transpired here.  It offers good clues and histroy about this world before everything became a nightmare.  I only wish the game did expand upon it, if it did have more levels.  Hopefully it'll come in later weeks or months.Gameplay is probably one of the most fun experience I had in 2016.  It mixes combat bits from Bloodborne, Legend of Zelda and Diablo into a single game.  The result is a brutal, challenging combat I have ever played.  Be warned that it's one tough game, but I honestly think it's one of the most fair games ever made.  There's not one moment that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the hell off.  A lot of deaths will come by your actions, so you have to be very careful on how you deal with tough situations in either 4 levels that you can start with at anytime.  Boss Fights are fun and fair, the enemies are designed well enough (thou I wished they added more, but we'll see.), the controls and combat mechanics are solid.  I do recommend playing with the controller either the PS4 or 360 is up to you.  The Keyboard & Mouse controls are underwhelming, it's very customizable but the experience is better played with the controller.  Level design is solid with good amount of secrets to find and loads of hidden story bits to discover.  You'll be sucking the life outta this game for some time, if you want to see it all.Visually, it's one fine looking game.  I do think most indie games that tried so hard to capture the old school visuals of the past, but Hyper Light Drifter to me looks more interesting than Undertale.  The detail is solid and the animations are slick and beautiful to look at.  The Soundtrack is also good and it fits well to the game's grim nature.Overall: While Hyper Light Drifter doesn't provide the ultimate complete experience that we were promised but I do hope Hearts Machine will continue supporting this game for quite awhile.  There's a lot of love been put into this title.  It isn't perfect as the game short lengh and only 4 levels begs for more.  But I strongly recommend this game.  It's challenging, fun and highly replayable.  It might be the best indie game since Shovel Knight.			"

Took me a little while to figure out how the traders worked because I am a numpty, so if you're also prone to being daft the purely visual explanation may throw you a bit.At present the overall aim is unclear although I am enjoying unveiling aspects of the game as I go along.

												This game is fantastic. I stumbled upon it on the day it released because I happened to see it on the front page of steam and decided to give it a try, I had no idea it was pretty much exactly the game I've been looking for. By the time you read this you'll probably have already seen the beautiful pixel art, but the gameplay and story that compliment it are really what made this game great.Gameplay: I'm a big fan of metroidvania style games, with the 3D ones I've played being my favorites (Metroid Prime and Dark Souls, mostly). This game incorporated elements of some of my favorites, the fair but challenging difficulty of Dark Souls, and the exploration and upgrades I enjoyed from the Metroid series. The gameplay is similar to games like the 2D Legend of Zeldas and the Diablo series, and boy is it satisfying. The controls are precise and the combat is fast paced, making every encounter a fight for your life. With the upgrades and different weapons you can find, you always have a number of options for how you approach each group of enemies, which are always varied and interesting.Story: This game has no words, no text, no numbers. The story is told entirely wordlessly, but what a powerful story it is. It's best if you play the game yourself, but I'll say that the story was influenced/inspired by the health issues lead creator of this game, Alex Preston, has dealt with all his life. I love environmental storytelling, and this game did it really well. I got a sense of this deep and tragic world, its inhabitants struggling to survive in the wake of incomprehensible destruction. The details are unclear, but that's what I love about this style of storytelling, much is left up to interperetation and I'm certain there's more I could learn by playing the game again to explore areas I missed on my first time through.Difficulty: If what I've said so far makes the game sound like it's one you'd like, be warned. This game is very difficult! With only 5 health points and some enemy attacks that do two damage, you can die very quickly. You have to be careful and make split second decisions in the thick of a fight, such as ""Do I try to dodge the next attack and heal, or go in for the kill?"" Any indecision and you may not survive. The boss fights are excellent, but don't leave much room for error. I found myself starting over many times on each of them, and sometimes surviving with only one health and no health packs left. However, despite this difficulty, the game is fair. I always felt like failure was my own fault and I could learn something from how I died, and when I finally triumphed, that made it even more rewarding.Basically, the only things I would warn you about are the potentially prohibitive difficulty and shorter length of the game (about 7.5 hours for me, that's without exploring for hidden areas much). Nevertheless, if you enjoy fast paced gameplay akin to the 2D Legend of Zelda games, don't mind--or think you would enjoy--the challenge the game offers, and like environmental storytelling, you should absoultely give this game a try!Hyper Light Drifter, Revisited: Coming back to play this game again a few months after it first came out, there have been a lot of improvements! In updates there has been added difficulty levels, local co-op (which is great fun), and the game now runs at 60 FPS instead of the initial 30. In playing though it again I've also explored a lot more to find all the hidden areas I can. To my surprise, hunting for secrets and trying to unlock everything has made my playtime almost twice that of my first playthrough! With these improvements, and now that I realize the game can be a lot longer than when I initially rushed through it, I can no longer come up with any complaints worth voicing aside from a warning to those who are easily put off by difficulty. I think I can say now that Hyper Light Drifter is among my favorite games of all time.			"

												Okay, so I'm a little bit torn on this one. It's still a recommendation, but only barely.The gameplay is solid. It's part Dark Souls, part 2D Zelda, part Metroidvania. You run around and slash up baddies, collect some guns and fight huge bosses. Basically what you expect from a 2D exploration game. Everything else though...it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is wrong, but I'll give it a shot. The game is very minimalist and this was done so by choice. There is no real story, no interaction with NPCs other than watching a few pictures, and the map is god awful. You will get lost just because the map says you're somewhere you're not. At that point, just remove the map altogether please.The fact that it's an ""open world"" game does not make a lot of sense to me either. Here's why. From the starting point, you can go in 3 directions and buy sword, dash, health and gun upgrades with your funds. These directions and upgrades are not at all similar in terms of difficulty and knowing which way to go and which upgrade to purchase is almost crucial to make the later parts of the game easier to handle. Yes, we could argue that placing the items and areas in a set order would make it a lot more similar to traditional Metroidvania style games, but those games are good for a reason. Now, some new players will turn away from this game with a bad taste in their mouth because they didn't go the right direction or buy the right upgrades and were overwhelmed.Once you figure out you can in fact go those three directions right from the get-go and buy the double dash and the dash that blocks bullets, the game becomes pretty interesting. Finding strategies for all the enemies and bosses is actually pretty fun, and the devs made sure that even the normal enemies can be challenging. The areas look pretty good, too. The game expresses its own art style, which is hard to do in a world with thousands of indie games per day that are very similar.There are 4 major bosses and a final boss, and each area takes a couple of hours at most. The game is not very long in that regard, but there are a ton of optional secrets you can find. I would go back to find all these secrets, but the fact that the map is not at all helpful in any way kinda turns me away from this. To clarify: the secrets are usually hidden by a wall that looks exactly like a normal wall, so you'll find yourself derping into every single wall in hopes of finding them. I'm not particularly looking forward to doing this when there's no map to tell me I've already been there. What I'd really like to see is a patch that includes an actually useful map. Also, make the double dash and protective dash the first upgrades that you have to buy before you can buy anything else. That way, new players can't go wrong anymore and everyone can enjoy the game for what it is. "

												Good, but not as great as the reviews would have you believe.Summary:HLD is an indie zelda clone combining dungeons of the endless art style with punishing dark souls-like game mechanics.  It has some RPG-lite item and ability paths that provides a sense of empowerment as you progress, as well as a ""look at me, I'm ambiguous"" story that lends some artificial depth to those that strive to understand it.  Taking your time and struggling through takes 5-10 hours, with moderate replayability in New Game+/Challenges/completionist activities.What I Enjoyed:The over production quality is high, with solid gameplay, great sound and music, and the obvious retro-inspired art style.  The length/value/fun for cost is excellent.  There is a clear sense that with some dedicated time, you could master the frames and become nearly invincible.  What I Didn't Enjoy:1. Unbalanced.  Certain weapons and abilities are significantly better than the others and genuinely change the difficulty of the game.  Playing the first time without guides, you will not have enough information to identify these and invest correctly.  2. Obfuscation.  The map is purposefully basic and poorly designed.  It will help you as much as frustrate you.  There are a few hidden paths (some that are essential to progression), which have no markers or are hidden under trees.  The only way to find these is to walk into every wall/corner, under every tree - this isn't fun exploration, this is frustrating gameplay held over from nearly a decade ago.3. Punishing.  If you're into the dark-souls/rogue-like's, you can dismiss this; I personally dislike artificial challenges.  Enemies you can't see because of walls.  Spikes that have inflated hitboxes.  Rockets that can track you in circles.  Death by stun lock.  Bullet hells that become nothing with the right skills.  Moving corridors of death in the dark.4. Artificial Story.  It's clear they want to bedazzle you with a grand, yet mysterious story, but its over-the-top dramatic like a teenager's homemade comic book sketched alone in the corner of the cafeteria.  The story is disconnected from the gameplay, which in turn is disconnected from your motive.  I have no idea why me/my character cares to go through all this fighting and suffering except that a god-dog compelled him to.  This is usually where indie games do better than AAA titles, and this was a let down.  Conclusion:If I could go back in time, I would play it again, but I'd read a spoiler-free skill guide about an hour in.  Recommended only with caveats.			"

												I cant think of a more beautiful, challenging, and clever game. Hyper light drifter is a mystery driven adventure, A majority of the game is left up to player interpretation from sounds to illustrated pictures NPCs use to communicate with the main player. Any direction the player wishes to go is completely up to them, upgrades and abilities are relevant to when and what the player wants. This game uses an amazing enviroment and sound design to build a atmospheric feel. if it isnt that the level design and quircky puzzles are just amazing. The art is amazing, the sounds are amazing, the designs are amazing, and the gameplay is extremely challenging.  I came into this game not knowing anything about it or reading any guides, learning the mechanics of each enemy type and boss has been so incredibly rewarding. I really love this game. :3			"

												This is an absolutely fantastic game! As soon as I saw a couple of gameplay videos I was hooked by the visuals and the world-building. Luckily, on playing the game, I was not disappointed by the gameplay either. You really feel like you deserve a no-hit encounter with a group of enemies as it requires skill, timing and tactics in equal measure.Negatives? Very few. Seeing Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian's names in the 'special thanks' section annoyed me but it also goes to show that a developer with different political views than myself can also love all the things I do regarding the 8-bit era aesthetic and soul-crushingly difficult gameplay!In conclusion, go buy this game if you love beautiful, crisp, colourful, 8-bit graphics, subtle world-building and lots of hidden secrets and collectibles.

												As much as Hyper Light Drifter wants to be an homage to A Link to The Past or  Super Metroid, it keeps frustrations to such a high level that it will never be as endearing or enjoyable as the games it set out to emulate in it's current state.It has some very unique elements that can provide fun moments of gameplay but those are eclipsed by the crushing difficulty that makes this feel like an unfinished, beta version of a game that could be a classic if it was polished properly. Pros: Setting and storytelling cutscenes are engaging. Beautiful, chunky, pixelated art style.The weapon systems are awesome. Gaining ammunition by engaging in sword combat is an awesome idea. You're never really stranded without ammunition, and you are almost always able to beat up something to get it. Cons:The Bosses need their health nerfed about 25-50%The dash mechanic needs to be more accessible; I spent way too long learning to chain dash. Would it really be so bad if people could nearly button mash to dash and enjoy the game a whole lot more? Why not have discoverable health increases and health increase rewards for beating difficult areas? Those five blocks of health get stretched very thin.  The existing mechanic of recovering health needs to be instant. Forcing players to develop a strategy to find 3 seconds to restore health during combat is just punishment for the sake of being nasty. Remember how in Zelda, when you drink the potion, time stops while your health refills?  The player needs to get stronger and their attacks need to be more effective as the game progresses. This is attempted by having a power up market in the town, but fails as the yellow upgrade cards are few and far between. I sincerely hope there are updates to this game as it is so close to being a classic.			"

												Let me just start this review off by saying, I don't completely dislike the game.  It does a few things fairly well.  The combat is fun and fluid, the art is great, and the soundtrack is nice.However, I feel like the game does a lot of things wrong.  For starters, my biggest complaint with the game is the world in it.  You have a decently sized world, but it feels completely lifeless.  None of the characters in the game actually have any dialogue, and all speak through pictures, the story is very loosely explained (And even then, it's EXTREMELY vague on what's actually going on), and while this has sort of become a trend in certain games, it just leaves me feeling disconnected from the game's world, and I don't feel ""invested"" enough into it.The other complaint I have, is a lot of things feel too same-y.  The areas in the game, the enemies, and even just the core gameplay itself.  The main areas in the game have a lot of different rooms and whatnot within them, but there's really not much that makes them feel unique.  The enemies are kind of the same in this regard.  There's just not a lot that really stands out at all, especially compared to the first Kickstarter trailer for the game, which showed a lot of unique and interesting content that was apparently cut from the final game.Now, while the combat in the game is fun, that's really all there is to the game.  There aren't any puzzles, there aren't any gripping cutscenes or conversations, there aren't any sidequests, or really anything to break up the hack 'n slash gameplay.  It just felt like I was wandering endlessly, killing everything in sight, with no real purpose or goal in doing so.As someone who followed the game since it was first announced, and eagerly awaited its release, I was fairly disappointed with the game, and while I didn't actually complete it, I was right at the end, and just couldn't bring myself to bother finishing it, as silly as that may sound.

												Short review: If I hadn't kickstarted this game, I would have refunded it.Long review: Don't get me wrong, there's a lot to love when you at first start playing this game, gorgeous graphics, beautiful music, an intriguing world, interesting enemy design,...The experience is however ruined by a game that has only one difficulty setting, and that one setting is onerously unfair. This game's idea of difficulty is throwing wave after wave of enemies at you at once, making it essentially more of bullet hell game than anything else. Upgrades exist, but will barely improve your survival chances. The main character is slow, unresponsive (30 fps ahoy) and has a far to large hitbox, making enemies with projectiles a hassle to deal with.The game leaves you completely free to choose the order in which you tackle the different area's and their respective bosses, but these regions are definitely not balanced, and 1 of the bosses is a lot harder than all of the others.To top it off, the chain dashing mechanic required by the game to obtain currency for upgrades and key for completing the game, essentially locks these items behind a deeply frustrating rythm mechanic for which there's barely any proper cue which is the proper rythm unless you crank the sfx volume way up, what's even worse is that the animations don't sync with this rythm.The developers and fans of the game cite a Dark Souls inspiration or even a Zelda one, and try to justify the difficulty of this game in doing so. It seems to me they've clearly never played those games. While Dark Souls may be hard, it's definitely not unfair, this game is. Although the difficulty in Zelda ramps up throughout the game, it never really becomes overly hard, and genereously awards players with more and more equipment and health to take on tougher enemies, don't expect such generosity here however...All in all, this could have been a great game, but it has been ruined by the developer's choice that only those with the perseverance and the time to suffer through their random mechanics get to enjoy the game. After dying countless times on yet another impossible path, I simply gave up.			"

												The gameplay is reasonably tough and makes you feel like a nimble badass. The tightness of the controls leaves a bit to be desired for combat as unforgiving as this (30fps lock everyone!) but it's functional. Gamepad and K+M both work but encourage different playstyles.Searching for secret rooms turns you into a methodical wall-hugging machine which clashes directly with the sense of adventure and wonder they're supposed to bring, not a good way to execute such stuff.The ambience of the world is great, though there's not much of an actual story unless you're obsessively into cipher puzzles and overinterpretation.Ultimately, a very pretty game and a satisfying experience, though far from perfect. 20€ might be a little steep.

												This may be one of the best games I've ever played. Maybe its just because I'm a masochist, but I got insanely addicted to this game, and after beating it on NG+, I really, really want DLC or a second campaign. The story, art style, and gameplay are all amazing, and the fact of how rage inducing this is just makes it better for me. Note: this game also has an insane learning curve. At first, it took me 20+ tries to beat the first boss, and now I can kill the final boss in 1-3 tries. But trust me, its definitely worth it not to rage quit and not play the game through. If you want a game that's hard, fun, and a really good game just to sit down and play for a few hours at a time (until it sucks up your life), please buy this game.			"

												HLD is a fairly solid action title with a good aethetic, as you can probably already see from the screenshots on the store page.  Its really hard to say anything exceptional about the game either good or bad, just because not much is really striking beyond the aesthetic which is already apparent.  This is a good thing though.  The game is very solid, doesn't have any great failings, and its generally fun to play. Combat is not greatly diverse in enemy types or player moveset, but what is provided is sufficient.  By this I mean the gameplay is designed fairly well for what you have to work with and what you fight.  Bosses and enemy groups are pleasantly challenging and pressuring, and you can vary your approach to fights.  Its not perfect, but it works well.Platforming in this game only consists of dashing across gaps to platforms.  Sometimes this felt unecessary (a minor complaint), as many gaps between platforms merely existed to make the player press the dash button rather than being a meaningful obstacle to your progress.  Platforming can be a bit bothersome in that controller responsiveness sometimes felt off.  I could chain-dash for a challenge about 30-60 times in a row consistently, 128 times for a record, but othertimes could not even initiate the chain dash when I needed to.  Yet the KB+M controls I used for the 800-chain-dash challenge, linking dashes was easy.  This could possible be an issue of dropped input from my steam controller, but I have seen a few other complaints of the same nature in discussion forums.Searching for collectables is the last point I'd like to address.  Of the 5 types of collectibles (money, keys, triforce pieces, tablets, and gear), only one is marked on the map after it has been collected.  Money and tablets leave evidence behind on the screen if revisited, but not the map.  Keys and gear only leave evidence is you dont smash the corpse that you picked them up from, otherwise you have to rely on memory.  I eventually just opened a guide after being tired of cycling through dungeons to find the last of the collectibles before finishing the game.  The game uses the somewhat annoying design choice of hiding things away from the player's view via camera angle or obscuring obstacle, that would otherwise be obvious to the character, but at least the game has a recurring visual cue to signal to the player that something is hidden.  Gear gives no feedback about the bonuses it gives to the player, another piece of information that is perhaps needlessly obscured.  Thankfully there is also more money in the game than needed to fully upgrade your character, a great design decision.  Story is vague (and includes an alphabet cipher language that a player who doesn't resort to a guide may not wish to puzzle through) but again is solid enough to be sufficient and vague enough to give the player some room to fill in their own answers.  It works well, and the decision to present it without written words or dialogue worked out too.  I would have liked a little more in the way of player interaction or involvement in the story, or on the other end more narration and lore building, but that's just my preferences.Overall the game is about 15hrs for a mostly-100% NG playthrough, more if you decide to tackle NG+ (essentially hard mode rather than a true NG+).  Its fun, got a good aesthetic and a modest amount of challenge.  I'd really recommend it!This game is functional with a steam controller, although I did not use the touchpads or remap any functions.  I used it as I would any normal game controller.  While the game suggests at the start that it is best played with a controller, the mouse and keyboard controls seem like they wouldn't be very difficult to use.  Controls cannot be rebound, however, so that is an element where the steam controller may shine as you may simply rebind various functions as you wish.  There are no ingame button prompts past the tutorial and shops to confuse you.			"

												At first I was confused as to what I was supposed to do and where I was supposed to go, but as I progressed further into the game, it got much more fun. The game nevery gets clearer as to what your character is doing or why he coughs up blood alot, but that does not detract from the experience I had while playing this game. It is very difficult and requires timing and precision, but once you get into the rythm of it, it doesn't seem as hard.Overall I found this to be a very fun game and I would definitely reconmmend any of my friends to finish it or at least try it.

There is minimum, or dare I say none at all, mindless grinding or meaningless wandering about (unless you get lost, then it's your fault), and every challenge has a unique design (except for a few chain-dash levels).Update: Yay for 60 FPS! Co-op mode is fun too! Most of the bugs have been ironed out. Though it's less challenging since only bosses get doubled HP and other monsters stay the same.			"

												This is an excellent action RPG, with combat that focuses on precision and skill rather than hack'n'slash.  Charging in blindly and pounding the attack button will generally get you killed.  Instead you must think about the attack patterns of your enemies, and strike when you see an opening.  Bosses are a prime example of this, and most offer a very satisfying challenge requiring several attempts to conquer.Exploration is highly rewarded in the form of upgrades, keys, and equipment.  Secrets abound throughout the apocalyptic future world, and uncovering each new surprise for yourself will fill you with excitement.The story is told entirely with pictures and movies, with no words at all either written or spoken.  Even the other characters you interact with will ""speak"" to you through pictures, showing you images of their past experiences or of future threats you can expect to face.  I do not find this feature entirely to my taste, but it works well enough and serves to give Hyper Light Drifter a unique flavor.I can definitely recommend this one.  It's an excellent addition to the genre.			"

												Super fast and super satisfying, likely to run on any pc. It's a bit of a stretch to call Hyper Light Drifter a hack n' slash as there tends to be a lot more strategy to movement that first appearances suggest. With artwork reminiscent of Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery but combat more akin to Dark souls style of high risk high speed reflex oriented attacks. The minimalist setup of the game only tends to add to the appeal in my humble opinion.   If the game is not challenging enough for you then the New Game+ mode should sate you. The normal play through has you resting at 5 health boxes, with most attacks chipping 1 and a few heavier attacks costing you 2. New Game+ leaves you with 2 health boxes making many previous hits instant death. GLHF!			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of the most beautiful, atmospheric games I've ever played. The wordless storytelling is very creative and evocative, and it's impressive how it manages to convey information and mood. There are plenty of times where I could have been frustrated by the game's difficulty, but having multiple areas open to explore made me more likely to just go ""eh, I'll come back to it later,"" than feeling like I was bashing my head up against a wall. And that feeling of accomplishment when you come back to what was giving you issues before and realize that you've gotten better at the game? Priceless.Anyway, I can't recommend this highly enough.

												One of the ten best games I've ever played. It starts beautifully, and quickly draws you in, but don't be fooled, there's SO MUCH MORE to the game than you might expect from it's retro styling and tropes. It plays like classic Zelda I, with all the open world ambiguity and lack of guideposts, however every system is deeper and more refined than what you may think. Playing the game expecting just a nostaligic romp will lull you into a sense of security that only starts to unravell as you travel deeper into the world - put the time in and be delighted! Two examples (of many):  Hyper Light Drifter offers a map like you'd expect from the explore the world style of game with ability gates. However this is not a map that will help you find secrets or even track progress. It's more like the paper map in teh back of a SNES manual, a tantelizing hint. You're position is not even accurately shown on the map, just your rought area, you have to use the landmarks to accually orient yourself and find the paths you want to chase down. You want to track down all the secrets? You're going to have to bust out pencil and paper old school!Combat in Hyper Light Drifter makes you feel amazing ... when you can pull it off. Your character practices a style of sword and gunplay that is fittingly reminescnt of Lord Yupa in the movie Nausicaa. However unlike other games where you execute button sequences to trigger daring combos, here you actually have to learn how to do it all yourself from a combination of only three basic actions. It's thrilling combination of delibertae slow paced pataince, and super rapid execution, and when you pull it off you feel like you're really earned being the hero.Highly, highly, recommended!			"

												Overall, this game really impressed me. It proudly wears its Zelda influences on its sleeve and uses them in ways I haven't seen before. It's level design - for the most part - is outstanding and flawlessly feeds into the player's sense of progression, bar a few instances where it requires you to be more meticulous during exploration than it perhaps should. It's aesthetic, music, and overall artistic implementation can stand with the greats in terms of immersion and a host of beautiful vistas. The underlying combat mechanics are sound and ensure tough but varied enemy encounters. HLD does have a few caveats that shouldn't be overlooked, though. Even my biggest caveat of lacking 60fps support has been fixed (about a day after I released this review), so responsiveness should now be increased. You might feel somewhat disoriented when you first start playing since you're not given clear directions, or even much of an indication, what you're objective is. Nevertheless, If you can look past those imperfections I'd strongly recommend you give Hyper Light Drifter a try. It's not only just the right amount of challenging but features a world you'll want to explore for yourself.Full review on YouTube:

												Superb artwork, a phenomenal soundtrack, and crisp mechanics come together to create a stellar action-adventure game. Definitely easier to play with a controller, as the game intially warns, but it is fluid enough with a keyboard and mouse. Try re-mapping your controls a little. For example, I set heal to 'R'.I've found that there's a lot of replayability with all the secrets, the completionist-style achievements (collect all of this or all of that), and new game plus. You can beat the game and still have many things left to do.My only qualm is that you have to go out of your way to earn the vast majority of the achievements. Earning a bit more for doing things that are part of the natural progression of the game would have been, in my opinion, a better design. But this is a small complaint which is dwarfed by the game's numerous strengths.All in all, a very solid experience.			"

												My first review. Man, this is a beautiful game. I've been searching and searching for something that gives the feeling of exploration, discovery and achievement of 8-16 bit games of Nintendo's glory days. This definintely fits the bill. The controls, art and challenge are just perfect for me. Steam, please point your wishlist algorithms towards this game!			"

												+ gorgeous, gorgeous animation and visuals+ sound design is thick and stellar+ music is minimal and flows nicely+ MOST of the game flows well so you naturally move from place to place+ skills and weapons have various weight and make you understand quickly how to use them+ the difficulty is good. Honestly it's only hard for the first hour or until you beat your first boss, then you latch on pretty quickly as you understand the timing of the mechanics and start to collect enough upgrade points to make meaningful changes.......................................................................................................................................................~ no direction which can be good but sometimes you get catastrophically lost......................................................................................................................................................- this is the worst map I've used in a long damn time. I can't remember for the life of me when I had so many issues with an overly artsy map with so little function. I don't know why we had to move away from simple maps that Metroid and Castlevania mastered so long ago.......................................................................................................................................................This was a pleasant surprise. I kickstarted this back on a whim and never followed any of the development. Luckily I came back to an outsanding game with a few caveats as noted above. This is well worth the full price and you should jump on it given the chance.			"

												Beautiful.Hyper Light Drifter is a game that isn't afraid to challenge its players. It asks for your attention not only for the gameplay, but everything else as nothing on this game is on the nose. The story is interpretative all the way down to the personal snippets you get from the side characters. The visuals are minimalistic, sometimes lean on the abstract, and actually make you stop and think about what you are looking at. The music makes the atmosphere distinct from any other game I've played and it's clear that close attention was put into every single sound effect.Like movies, you could say all games are techinically art. But this is one of those pieces that was given so much care in every facet that it actually deserves to have its art label highlighted and celebrated.Buy it now. "

												This is without question one of the single best games I've ever played in my life. Yes, it is flawed, like all games, but its flaws are outnumbered and overshadowed by its immense beauty, nigh impeccable gameplay, and perfect soundtrack, not to mention the mindblowing lore and world building which is fed to you in great detail whether you realize it or not.The gameplay is insanely fluid, ridiculously fast, explosive, and mechanically challenging if you choose to explore and experiment with it. There are some videos on my profile that may give you an idea of the possibilities presented with the combat system, if you're looking for a more in-depth and visual example.As if that wasn't enough to satisfy my needs, this game boasts some of the most mind-meltingly beautiful pixel art I've ever had the privelege to witness. The intro sequence alone assured me I was in for a unique and well constructed experience.Oh, and the soundtrack is auditory perfection.Buying this game for $20 is a steal, and as of writing this review, it's currently half off.I've only been playing this game since September, but it has made itself perfectly comfortable in its spot as one of my favorite games of all time.

												Incredible 16 bit aesthetics, just want to take a screenshot of every frame for a wallpaper. The game has very challenging mechanics and doesn't hold your hand in any way, which is a great throwback to the firsts TLOZs and other SNES era games with a more modern perspective and outlook. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great gaming experience.EDIT: I don't think it's accurate to compare it to the Souls games saga, the only thing I found in common was the ""How the ♥♥♥♥ I'm supposed to beat this boss"" feeling but you can go back to explore for more credits and upgrade your skills which is totally unlike the Souls games.

It's incredibly hard but not unfair, so it's not for everyone. The satisfaction from beating a large group of enemies without fail is enough to keep me going. It might already be my favorite game of 2016.			"

 You won't be careful… YOU'LL BE DEAD!!! You will die - a lot, yet the high level of difficulty is well considered and appropriate to the nature of the game.As a lifelong gamer. there are only a few games I consider impossible to overrate.  Among them would be Legend of Zelda and Metroid.  Hyper Light Drifter borrows from these titles, but like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, this game is completely its own entity.  Hyper Light Drifter draws from the best, and for an assortment of reasons ascends to my pinnacle of video games.Story - 9/10 - What story?  The raised eyebrow, the questions; that is the point of the cryptic presentation.  A lot can be drawn from what you see, but nothing is clear.  You are among a class of warriors, on a quest.  Meaningful dialog is shown via storyboards as opposed to text or dialog.  The land, characters, and yourself suffer from a sickness - which clearly drives the need to fight.  The environment bleeds a textured darkness.  An era beyond nightmarish accomplishments, where titans and terrors of technology destroyed civilization, only to die themselves.  Your character survives as part of a small, desperate remnant of the past.  Not unlike the future era of Chrono Trigger, or something out of The Dying Earth or Book of the New Sun.Characters - 9/10  Really only two main characters - yourself and a mentor.  A mentor who has little to offer beyond a residence in the central town, and occasional mysterious appearances.  There are a wide assortment of encounters with random NPC's who offer small amounts of information about quest goals, trials against enemies, and their general suffering.  Many of these moments are poignant including shacked slaves, and the hard luck traveler betrayed.  More than once I wanted to know more about an enemy I had slain - I'm reminded of a battle sequence in the anime Battle Angel where she incinerates a particularly frightening techno ninja.  Evil and persistent though he was, there is something tragic about his erasure.Graphics - 10/10.  Hyper Light Drifter contains superb graphics and animations.  Everything is consistent, crispy clear, and a joy to behold.  While future-retro games are not new with members like Shatter, Cave Story and Shovel Knight - Hyper Light Drifter takes intentional steps backward, and in doing so moves forward to new heights.  The motion blur on your dash, the laser light on my favorite gun, the personality of all enemies whether boss or mob - all well thought out, and artfully executed.Music and Sound 11/10.  Not like the overclocking nob on my MSI mobo that goes to 11 (while not including a 3, 5, or 7...) This soundtrack is strait up Spinal Tap, when 10 isn't enough, go all the way to 11.  The soundtracking is a perfect cross between ambient sound, and very listenable electro.  A bass heavy system will really show the range of sound which I never found annoying, and often mesmerizing.  Sound effects are just one more element in the *more than the sum of its parts* construction.  This game lives, breaths, and has a heartbeat.Gameplay 10/10.  Hyper Light Drifter is one of those games that just feels right.  While a certain 1K combo would take some sort of machine to achieve, I never felt this game asked too much of me in any circumstance.  Like a Metroid game, the abilities work seamlessly together, and when in a groove your character dances invincibility.  But you are vulnerable.  A mistimed dash may take one unit of health, and this error can become magnified in a later confrontation.  Healing isn’t guaranteed like in a Dark Souls game, and an attempt to regain health can not only fail, but leave you open for a finishing blow.  There may be more ways to fail than succeed, but the gameplay is truly freeform, and a victorious sword stab into the ground can feel very well earned indeed.Overall 10/10.  Like any old school game, the most important qualities are presentation, gameplay, and fun factor.  Hyper Light Drifter delivers all three to anyone who enjoys a new experience with a classic feel.  The world needs more video games with this quality of excellence.  I believe that games with small teams of developers, strong leadership and a clear vision have an easier time achieving the most elusive of video game qualities: a soul.  This game may not require bleeding edge hardware to run at top settings, but I would argue this doesn't keep Hyper Light Drifter from being state of the art.  Like REZ and Radiant Silvergun, Hyper Light Drifter achieves a perfect unison of graphics, gameplay and sound - and unlike the previous titles, this is an action adventure, and not a shooter!I can't recommend this game enough - and I feel lucky to have played through the final boss (though far from finding/achieving everything!).

												============================================Hyper Light Drifter makes me a Hyper Tight Dripper ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)============================================No, but in all seriousness... Buy this game.(this is my first real review please enjoy!)==================================================PROS-It's like a Souls game, Legend of Zelda, Nuclear Throne, and something beautiful, and unique had a very special hug. Its like these games are very similar but yet very very different.-The soundtrack= ""omfg yes why u so beautiful?!"" -me- This game had me engrossed and in awe from the very title screen! The begining is so mysterious I couldn't peel my eyes from my monitor.- The combat= 10/10. You actually have to think in order to fight unlike many other games. I LOVE the dash mechanic! (idc if you don't think its a combat maneuver it is extremely important for survival in combat) - The Colors.... dude just look at the damn photos and tell me that ain't beautiful.- The soundtrack.. oh wait I alreasdy said that.- Just the whole big bundle of the beautiful, unique, awe-inspiring game that is Hyper Light Drifter. Like no joke I am predicting this game to be one of the top 3 most played games in my library by the end of this year.==================================================CONS[do keep in mind it did come out yesterday 3/31/16]-For me, it takes a while to start up. That might be because my PC is literally♥♥♥♥♥♥- Just a few bugs. It did just come out though.- The long♥♥♥♥♥wait we had for it to be released.==================================================So, it's all up to you to buy this game but please listen to my opinion on it and buy it. you'll thank me I promise "

												Been anticipating this game for a while and everything seemed to have lived up to expectations.  World is unique and very serene, especially with the lovely Disasterpiece music.Going in gameplay can seem pretty challenging but once you learn the ropes you gain a lot of momentum (and because of this difficult curve can lower off midway through)Exploring is fun and exciting but the backtracking not so much,  the map design is unique but difficult to understand.  Looking for that last collectible in an area turns into a big chore.  But all that aside I enjoyed it enough to beat it basically overnight,  combat is fast quick and satisfying and bosses even more so.  There are many complaints about framerate, checkpoints, and the minimal ui but none of this was a problem for me (I also played with Keyboard+Mouse and didnt have much trouble)Get this game!			"

												This has to go down as one of the greatest games of all time. (Scroll down for tl;dr).I'll start off with the game's biggest strength and weakness.- The story will go over some people's heads. The game communicates everything visually and sonically, there is no real world language used in the game. This fits in nicely with your character being an outsider to this world, so of course they can't understand it's inhabitants. I think if there's any flaw in this game, it's that it could spend a little more time hinting at the deeper meanings, or connections to the narrative that each little thing the player will see. It does give hints, but the player has to really connect the dots all on their own, which is fine by me. There are people who have made youtube video dissecting the overaching narrative which actually blew my mind. And that's okay for me, I don't think every game should be so easy and obvious for every average joe blow to understand from a cursorary viewing. I had a very emotional and profound experience playing this game, it wasn't necessary for me to undersatnd every little thing about the story, but all credit is due to the designers who were able to make this game so some people WOULD be able to figure it out.The other great stuff:- Amazing art style and visuals, so much detail and variation.- The soundtrack by Disasterpiece is phenomenal and works with the game's other elements very well.- Simple but deep action-fighting mechanics which you build upon as the game progresses.- Exploration is encouraged and rewarded.- Interesting puzzles based around the fighting mechanics of your character.- Unlockable mini-games diagetically attached to the game's hub-zone.Tl;dr: This game is really fun, beautiful, and obviously made by a really caring creator who put their heart and soul to create a masterpiece. You can enjoy this game without having to go into it's depth, but if you do... oh boy, you're in for the ride of you life. "

I think it hit the ""harsh but fair"" mark perfectly so that it makes you master dash/slice/shooting around until you feel like Neo.  Not for the faint-hearted, but not a total ragefest either.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is probably my favourite game ever, a year after playing it through.  It's got gorgeous art and sound design, a world that's full of detail and implicit worldbuilding, and moments that will take your breath away.  The combat and general movement system is also great - simultaneously strategic and dynamic, all about pacing, and satisfyingly crunchy.  It's the kind of game you revel in.  There's a button to sit and gaze into the distance.I don't really have anything to say that hasn't been said before, but two notes - one, people complain about the controls.  If you're not someone who can internalize timing at all, then this isn't a game for you but I'm not an amazing gamer and still ; additionally, it's designed for gamepad and probably best on it, but I played it on mouse and keyboard and it was great once I turned my mouse sensitivity way up.  Two, *after* beating the game once go check out the developers, find the making of video - but not before.  Seriously.  You'd regret it.			"

												✔ Impressive pixel graphics, amazing animations✔ Solid game mechanics, Metroid-like✔ Nice (dynamic / layered) soundtracks by Disasterpiece✔ Good sound design overall ✔ Intriguing and original universe, ""show, don't tell"" type of story-telling✔ DRM-free build exists! (Humble store)✔ GNU/Linux support! ✘ Still many glitches and bugs remaining to be fixed (thanks GameMaker)✘ Can be very frustrating at times, because of frame dips and input inconsistencies✘ No option to disable bright flashesThe game doesn't perform very well on low end specs, so be wary of that.Highly recommended.

												============================================Hyper Light Drifter makes me a Hyper Tight Dripper ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)============================================No, but in all seriousness... Buy this game.(this is my first real review please enjoy!)==================================================PROS-It's like a Souls game, Legend of Zelda, Nuclear Throne, and something beautiful, and unique had a very special hug. Its like these games are very similar but yet very very different.-The soundtrack= ""omfg yes why u so beautiful?!"" -me- This game had me engrossed and in awe from the very title screen! The begining is so mysterious I couldn't peel my eyes from my monitor.- The combat= 10/10. You actually have to think in order to fight unlike many other games. I LOVE the dash mechanic! (idc if you don't think its a combat maneuver it is extremely important for survival in combat) - The Colors.... dude just look at the damn photos and tell me that ain't beautiful.- The soundtrack.. oh wait I alreasdy said that.- Just the whole big bundle of the beautiful, unique, awe-inspiring game that is Hyper Light Drifter. Like no joke I am predicting this game to be one of the top 3 most played games in my library by the end of this year.==================================================CONS[do keep in mind it did come out yesterday 3/31/16]-For me, it takes a while to start up. That might be because my PC is literally♥♥♥♥♥♥- Just a few bugs. It did just come out though.- The long♥♥♥♥♥wait we had for it to be released.==================================================So, it's all up to you to buy this game but please listen to my opinion on it and buy it. you'll thank me I promise "

												This is without question one of the single best games I've ever played in my life. Yes, it is flawed, like all games, but its flaws are outnumbered and overshadowed by its immense beauty, nigh impeccable gameplay, and perfect soundtrack, not to mention the mindblowing lore and world building which is fed to you in great detail whether you realize it or not.The gameplay is insanely fluid, ridiculously fast, explosive, and mechanically challenging if you choose to explore and experiment with it. There are some videos on my profile that may give you an idea of the possibilities presented with the combat system, if you're looking for a more in-depth and visual example.As if that wasn't enough to satisfy my needs, this game boasts some of the most mind-meltingly beautiful pixel art I've ever had the privelege to witness. The intro sequence alone assured me I was in for a unique and well constructed experience.Oh, and the soundtrack is auditory perfection.Buying this game for $20 is a steal, and as of writing this review, it's currently half off.I've only been playing this game since September, but it has made itself perfectly comfortable in its spot as one of my favorite games of all time.

												Superb artwork, a phenomenal soundtrack, and crisp mechanics come together to create a stellar action-adventure game. Definitely easier to play with a controller, as the game intially warns, but it is fluid enough with a keyboard and mouse. Try re-mapping your controls a little. For example, I set heal to 'R'.I've found that there's a lot of replayability with all the secrets, the completionist-style achievements (collect all of this or all of that), and new game plus. You can beat the game and still have many things left to do.My only qualm is that you have to go out of your way to earn the vast majority of the achievements. Earning a bit more for doing things that are part of the natural progression of the game would have been, in my opinion, a better design. But this is a small complaint which is dwarfed by the game's numerous strengths.All in all, a very solid experience.			"

												When top down pixel zelda (Link to the Past) meets Dark Souls.  A true masterpiece full of stunning pixel art and amazingly ambient music, Hyper Light Drifter is a dream come to.  The game is difficult and unforgiving, but it is fair. You will struggle and die, but you will learn to overcome the challenges as you learn the enemy movements and harness your strengths.Hyper Light Drifter offers quite an expansive world, many colorful npcs and interactions, and so much exploration.  You will find yourself really enjoying your stay and wanting to understand more of the world.			"

												Full disclosure, I pre-ordered this game months ago. I saw it and knew it was going to be a game right in my wheelhouse, so I am a bit biased towards the game from that perspective. I have about 2 hours into Hyper Light Drifter and it is wonderful.   The game is gorgeous, the controls are satisfying, and the soundtrack is very atmospheric. If you like atmospheric games with a more skill-based lean than story-driven narrative, this game will be right up your alley. I honestly have very little understanding of what is happening in the story or why my character is driven to do the things he is doing but I'm really likining the game regardless.   The biggest problem with this game is the 30fps lock. I really wish this game was able to get up to 60fps. Occasionally the frames dip as well when there are a lot of enemies on the screen and my computer is pretty powerful so this may be a struggle for lower end PCs. On the other hand, my CPU is my bottleneck so that could be the issue.   Play this game, If you're anything like me you'll enjoy the hell out of it.			"

												I have never written a  serious review so bear with me.This game is amazing and you should buy and play it right now. Like one reviewer said, its the perfect child of Zelda and Metroid, however, this game is HARD. AS. ♥♥♥♥. You will die, alot. No matter your skill at games, you will die at least once, more than likely a ton more times.But that is what makes this game so special. The main character's goal is to find a cure, AKA closure to his illness.We seek closure by wanting to finish this hard game. His hardships of having this perhaps terminal illness are represented by the hard as hell enemies. Either my AP English is making me overanalyze or this was a clever way to explain the AI.4/4 would go on a square triangle hunt again.(please make another one so I can)			"

												Admittedly I hadn't followed this game too closely, but the art style was enough to have me interested. So much so that when I'd heard that it was an action RPG, a genre I don't typically enjoy very much, I was still determined to buy it.I am pleased to say that this game exceeds any and all expectations.The story is masterfully and uniquely told, but I'd rather not give details; it's best experienced first hand. As far as gameplay goes, there are comparisons to be made between both the original Zelda for it's lack of explanation of who you are and what you're supposed to be doing and Dark Souls for it's combat that rewards finese, skill, and efficiency.  You may find yourself lost at first since, as I said before, you're told nothing and are thown into a huge world. It's a bit disorienting, but you'll eventually find your bearings and the world is an absolute joy to explore. The atmosphere is spot on, the landscapes are beautiful, and it manages to capture the scale of this broken, dying world tremendously. A particularly striking moment was when I went up a mountain and in the distance saw the broken down, snow-covered corpse of an enormous mech of sorts lain on the side of a cliff. After further investigation of said mountain, I found myself next to that very same corpse; dwarfed by it's hand alone as it's lifeless body menacingly stared up at me sporting a gaping mouth and blank, dead eyes.This game did something to me that no game has done in quite some time. It turned me into a kid again. I was on a journey in a fascinating, mysterious, and hazardous new world, trumping my adversity with the skill and precision I'd gained along my grand adventure. I wasn't traversing dangerous cliffs and trap puzzles because I was told to. I wanted to know what was in store if I'd completed said challenges. I wasn't angry when I was killed by a boss because I'd learned something from it and I was sure if I'd just adjusted my tactic I could defeat the new relentlessly fierce opponent. That said, this game isn't for everybody. Even basic enemies can make quick work of you if you're not careful with your approach and bosses are unforgiving to put it lightly. Interestingly, though, the bosses combine the abilities of all the mobs in their zone which, in my opinion, was a fantastic design choice that forces the player to strategize, time their attacks and dodges, and really  make sure they know how to control the avatar. So they're challenging, yes, but far from impossible and certainly can be beaten in a rather reasonable amount of attempts. My gripes with the game are minimal; a birdman NPC blinks in and out of existence for some reason, there's a strange bug where gear bits appear in one place but can be picked up in another, and I did have some slight issues with lag. That could just be my computer, though. It was really strange as well to make it so the player has to aim their gun with the left stick instead of the right; you get used to it, yeah, but I don't see why it couldn't have been the right stick seeing as it has no function anyway. Also I feel like it would have been better to not have a tutorial to add to the ""figure it out"" aspect of the game, but that's highly subjective and I wouldn't dock any quality points from the game because of it.Overall, if you want a game that gives you beautiful scenery, fantastically satisfying combat, and a uniquely presented and gripping story, this is for you. This may not be the game for more casual gamers, though, as those bosses can definitely give  you a run for your money. I'm not completely through with the game just yet, but as of right now it's an 8/10 for me. If the ending is good enough I can easily bump it up to a 9/10.			"

												(10 hours of my game time is in BETA build)Finally finished Hyper Light Drifter... I will regard it as one of my dream games.I can go on about the breathtaking pixel artstyle and excellent sound design... but I will choose not to as you already can get the hint from the trailers and other users.What I will be describing here is my personal unbiased experience of the gameplay.PROS:1) Fluid and Responsive combat: that requires the right timing in order to overcome your enemies. Every enemy has a window of oppurtunity to strike them hard including the super challenging bosses. Resulting in a deadly dance of death as you drift around the battle field slashing your enemies before they can strke you and drifting away at just the right moment. Rarely have I played a combat so satisfying, easy to learn and hard to master.2) Bosses: seldom have I faced challenge in recent past when a game threw me a boss. Reminded me of the good old days when overcoming a boss felt like a real achievement to show off. Every boss fight is unique and memorable!Those negative reviews that you have been reading about super hard bosses is only a complaint of people who didn't try enough. Personally it took me around 10 tries for each boss to beat (including the last one). I am not a super pro at games and consider myself average. The key is knowing your enemy and timing your attacks and using your upgraded abilities by thinking on your feet. It is NOT unfair. Bosses are supposed to be super hard. Deal with it.3) Exploration: The world of HLD is brimming with secrets galore... every nook and cranny can lead to a secret pathway containing rare gold artifact that you can use to buy upgrades for your arsenal.4) Enemy Variety: Every region has seprate enemy units, behaviour and asthetics. Never did the game become boring slash and hack button smasher as every new enemy makes you think on your feet to deal with.CONS:1) Short: yes you might argue good things come in small packages but yes I believe they could have expanded each region further and add more sidequests than the overarching quest you already have. More dugeons would have helped feel the RPG and exploration aspect too. However they chose to focus and make this game purely action oriented. A lost oppurtunity if you ask me.The intense actions sequences could have been more paced out with longer gameplay and the loot collection meta game could have breathed more space with more environments and dungeons.2) Upgrades: Though each sword and dash upgrade is unique and useful in their own way, I felt guns could have  been added with more interesting modules and addons such that modifies the shot pattern or bullets. They could have hidden these modules in secret places to make things more interesting... instead of plain upgrades to magazine. Bastion is a fine example of how to enhance gameplay by adding tactical addons to your existing arsenal. I felt HLD creators lost a lot of oppurtunity here in that regard.3) Lack of Adventure: You already have all the map revealed to you in the very beginning of the game. I felt it kind of personally took away the wonder and adventure of the game which is based on exploration. Yes the map is abstract, yes you dont know the terrain or the enemy positions of the regions before you visit them, and yet I felt kind of put off by it.4) No proper quest system: Except your main quest you never encounter any NPCs giving you sidequests of clearing dungeouns / discovering hidden artifacts in lost temples. This serously kind of bummed me as I expected it to be an Action-Adventure-RPG instead they focused it on Action-RPG.This could have elivated the game to an altogether different level. Side quests could have been equally cryptic in nature I wouldn't have mind that.The game therefore feels a LONG fetch quest for your main questline.RECOMMENDED If you like intense action RPG with a challenging gameplay and breathtaking art and sound production. HLD is one of those rare indie gems that comes out once a blue moon.It has its shortcomings only because they could have made this into a even bigger and better masterpiece of a game than what it already is.Rating (if that matters): 8.5/10			"

												One of the most beautiful and detailed games I've played. The story is mysterious and doesn't reveal itself right away, rather through the enviroment. If you pay attention to the opening cutscene and think about it some it starts to make sense and it is certainly not as limited as others say. The combat is fair but challanging. The bosses will take some repitition and learning their patterns is the best way to go about it. This is not a hack n slash and combat is more like precise dueling than some sort of slamathon WWE poundtown. Strike when an oppertunity is available, then retreat and if possible throw a few shots from range. Just play patiently and you will be rewarded. When I died to bosses I found myself encouraged to go again rather than getting frustrated and quitting (which is my normal experience with difficult games ie dark souls).The art is tremendous and really sinks you into the world. Make sure you take time to appritiate the details and enjoy the vistas, they are part of the experience! Don't rush through to complete this quickly as you won't understand the game or enjoy it as much. And while you are enjoying it, look for secret walls or cliff edges, they hold worthwhile rewards.In all, I highly recommend this game. The difficulty is there but does not alienate those not typically fond of that (me). The art kept me motivated when I struggled and gave me time to breathe. The story kept me enthralled and thinking, but thinking is definitely necessary if you want to understand it. The $20 price tag may seem steep on entry, but the time I've put in this game (6 hours right now and I'm about half way through) does not reflect my enjoyment of this game. I'm usually the cheap kind of gamer but I picked this up first day 10% off and wouldn't regret paying full price.edit: Now you can play at 60 fps so there is literally no reason not to buy this			"

Its theme is like a dance party in the 80's put on by Zelda and Black Science with a dash of FEZ.  Everthing is fine and everyone is having a good time when Dark Souls crashes the Neon party forcing its flavor of design and challenge on everyone. But somehow it works and works really really really well together. I would hit this if i were you.			"

The game has very challenging mechanics and doesn't hold your hand in any way, which is a great throwback to the firsts TLOZs and other SNES era games with a more modern perspective and outlook. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great gaming experience.EDIT: I don't think it's accurate to compare it to the Souls games saga, the only thing I found in common was the ""How the ♥♥♥♥ I'm supposed to beat this boss"" feeling but you can go back to explore for more credits and upgrade your skills which is totally unlike the Souls games.

												A love-letter to an era of ""less is more"" game design. Before I go on, wanna say I really enjoyed it.Engaging combat, though with some pretty unavoidably hardcore difficulty that had a tendency to snowball you into insta-death scenarios. I appreciated the upgrade paths allowing me to tech towards a particular playstyle.Understated but beautiful story. Even better that it was told without words.Only negative part of the experience for me was having some navigational issues. There were moments mid-dungeon or during some backtracking section when I didn't know where to go and struggled to find the critical path for upwards of 15 minutes. Visually speaking, I felt like some of my navigational issues were due to tricks of the eye or walls that looked like doors, or ledges that looked like background.			"

												The game look and sounds incredibly. It plays well, and with certain amount of time and effort you can master it, making enemy encounters into a deadly and elegant dance of whatever this is getting to over-complicated.It's good when you learn how to play.The story is a letdown. It doesn't follow ""show, don't tell"" as much as it doesn't follow ""tell, don't show"". It doesn't tell or show you anything and leaves it up to you and the INTERNET to uncover all of it's secrets. There's a hell lot of pixelhunting and locked doors here, by the way.And even after you've done uncovering all there is to find you still have to interpret what you obtained. Too. Much. Hassle.			"

												I added the game to my wish list and bought it half off - It's a pretty game, and I enjoyed the blend steam punk type of mixing old and new technology (swords and laser/light guns, robots and ancient magic). The story is so vague though. It's all told in pictures, and after completing the game, I still have only a partial understanding of the story. I think the picture storytelling idea is cool, because now ideas aren't lost in translation (seems to be a Japanese style game), but it leaves A LOT out. For example where did all these titans come from we find scattered across the land? They seemed to have died due to some huge explosion from a crystal, but by who and why was the crystal activated? What is my character (and others) sick from (was it the crystal or the final boss)? This story just don't make really any sense and requires alot of out of game explanation.One of the game mechanics is a PAIN IN THE BUTT. The chain drift is timed better on sound than visuals, but you wouldn't get that from an in game explanation. I found this out after frustratingly trying and dying about 50 times on a part that requires you to perfectly time your chain drifts and then searching online to see what the hell i was doing wrong. I know it's one mechanic, but you use it so often and some parts require you to be able to do it well to progress.The game is also very short unless you're seeking after the extra, pink triangles that don't give any more plot detail and just help you customize your wardrobe with a few boring stat increases.All in all, it was a pretty game with some fun ideas, but a really cool story is always just slightly out of reach and it's just vague enough to inrigue your interest, but then never actually enough to satisfy it. If you have the drive to master very technical, unexplained mechanics, for an ending that doesn't explain anything, have at it.			"

												Let's be concise here:Gameplay is important and combat needs to be fun. It's masterfully subtle how Hyper Light Drifter delivers a smooth and satisfying gameplay and combat experience.Like great TV, food, drink, or sex you don't realize how good it was until you're suffering the mediocre stuff later on.

												WAIT! WAIT!I can see you jumping to conclusions at quite literally seeing red on my rating for this game. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not trying to say this game is awful, certainly not on an objective level. There's a lot to like about this game, and as my total play time would imply in this context, I was compelled to play quite a hefty chunk of this game. This, if anything, is one of those situations where I'd prattle on for a bit about how much better it would be if Valve implemented a rating for ""Mixed"", or at least somewhere in between a binary ""yes or no"" rating.There are plenty of things I can praise about Hyper Light Drifter - the art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the way it handles sweeping landscapes through layered 2D backgrounds is spectacular. There's a lot of visual panache on display, and massive kudos to them. The combat also has a nice amount of weight to it, with melee attacks having a satisfying delay to them whenever they connect, and some of the guns feel quite nice to use as well. And controls-wise, I have to say that I had no problem with playing this game using a keyboard, despite what they say during one of the splash screens about how controllers are recommended. Granted, I had to change the controls in the options menu so that I dashed in the way I was moving rather than the way I was aiming, but it's not a big deal.Where it all starts falling apart for me is in the overall gameplay loop. The idea is to roam throughout each of the four sides of the map and collect four triangular macguffins for each side, and activate one of four monoliths on each end. To what end, it's not entirely clear, especially not in the way this game handles dialogue pictorially. That's not a bad thing in and of itself, particularly given the gorgeous imagery at play here. However, I can understand if it does give people less of a reason to care at a much earlier point in the game than it did for me.It gets especially bad when you have to negotiate fairly complex underground areas in order to find these macguffins. The map screen helps alleviate this somewhat, but the unfair checkpoint placement and the obnoxious difficulty of the combat inflated further by the overreliance on stunlocking the player makes it feel needlessly padded, even before some of the more egregious areas like a darkened room.As for the boss fights that punctuate the near-end of each of the segments (Except the southern one, for some reason that feels more like innovation for innovation's sake), I can leave aside my frustrations with trying to beat them (I mean, I'm the guy who enjoys Furi, so the difficulty by itself wouldn't be the issue), but with this colourful, captivating aesthetic, they really feel like a wasted opportunity by being nothing more than slightly larger than the regular enemies with arrays of hard-to-dodge attacks. If you're going in expecting to fight anything like the three giants depicted in the game's opening, you're going to be sorely disappointed, at least for the majority of the time.I really wanted to like this game, and at the end of the day, my issues with it stem more from my own personal preferences more than anything else, to the degree where I am willing to say that it's more of a case of this being a game that's simply not for everyone. It's certainly not an awful game, it's perfectly playable regardless of whether you stick with a controller or a keyboard, the art style is gorgeous, and the world this game creates through imagery alone is a fascinating tale.However, if you have even the slightest doubt as to whether this game would be for you, for the love of God, wait for a sale. It's nowhere near as egregious a case of questionable pricing as, say, The Witness, but at £15 or your regional equivalent, I can't say I recommend it, certainly not to your average conoisseur of indie games.2.5/5			"

												Disclaimer: I only finished the north route, then returned the game. ~2.5 hours playedThe art blew me the away. The intro had me pumped up, the gameplay was exciting but the story... wasn't there. I bought this thinking it was going to be like Zelda as a lot of reviewers told me, but there were no puzzles. The combat mechanics were better but the enemies were the same most of the time. Sometimes the rooms had decent variation to make the fights exciting, but they rarely asked for any kind of unique solution. You just had to dash around a little more than usual, maybe fire your gun in this spot instead of another.While the combat was good, the routes/dungeons were like Skyrim dungeons, very much kill this hall of enemies and then grab the ""loot"" at the end. Because all of these dungeons are hallways, the scenes blend together.It might be open world, but there may as well be four levels. When you go north, it doesn't seem like you can go west or east from north. It's very on rails for an adventure game.I like games without dialogue, and I thought the ways that the game conveyed dialogue and story were useful and valid. The vagueness of the pictures telling you a story is cool. The evidence left around could have been cool as well, maybe if they had been surrounded with better story. The problem is, there's barely any story to tell. There's clear evidence that something happened before, but what that something is you can't know. Or at least, it doesn't feel well eluded to. You see dead giants, worn robots and broken buildings, but that doesn't tell you anything besides that the game you're playing is some post-ruin setting. There was nothing to piece together, only lots of clues that left you going ""Huh. Cool."" Nothing in the game changes when you progress. The bird person didn't care that I defeated the bad bird man. Everything was the same. The village didn't change. If this is an adventure game or RPG, I'd like the game to progress as I do. Be it through world building, which would have suited this silent game well, or through changing character dialogue, I want SOMETHING to happen. Anything. This didn't seem to occur in HLD, except that other routes open up.The soundtrack was great. Art was amazing. Premise was solid, the fighting mechanics were good. The lack of invinciblity in the dash didn't matter to me, you can learn to play around it. But the story? Non-existant and that's why the game didn't hold my interest. I'm still going to follow Heart Machine and I'd definitely follow the release of a Hyper Light Drifter 2. This premise was REALLY COOL, but it really just felt like ""Look at this amazing premise also here's a game."" It just felt flat to play.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a phenomenally pretty action game.  The gorgeous artwork combines with the moody soundtrack to evoke senses ranging from awe-inspiring wonder to suffocating menace.  Hyper Light Drifter displays a masterful sense of atmosphere that few games match, which in addition to the quick and brutal combat, hightens the excitement of fighting your way through desecrated homelands and ancient battlegrounds.  Your repetoire of tools for dealing with the waves of varied enemies in a given encounter is relatively simple; you have your basic three-hit combo of sword atttacks which charge ammunition for your ranged firearms , a purchaseable grenade, and your dash.  Waves of melee enemies will attempt to flush you from cover to give ranged attackers a shot at you, forcing you to dodge back into another group of deadly foes.  You need to quickly identify who, what, and when to attack.  If you make a mistake, you'll likely be punished, and punished severely.  As you die and retry, you'll go from reacting to impending threats to conducting the cadence of battle.  Combat is less about flashy button combinations and manual dexterity than quick wits, careful positioning, target prioritization, and stricking swiftly when you identify the opportunity.  The combat in Hyper Light Drifter is a dangerous and exciting joy.However, murdering your way through the beautiful environments alternates between being the only enjoyable way to interact with the world and being the ONLY way to interact with the world.  Exploration involves fighting the game's nigh-useless map in order to reach the next combat encounter until you come face to face with an area's boss on the surface.  Delve any deeper, and finding the hidden secrets in the game involves obsessively hugging walls and edges to the point of tedium in the hopes of locating a hidden path or invisible walkway.  These secrets can lead to extra health or currency, indecipherable glyphs, a new color scheme for your character, and, if you're lucky, an exciting new encounter to test your combat skills in.  Never do you find any narrative payoff.Which is both astoundingly dumbfounding and disappointing.  For all the care gone into crafting the world, the game has, literally, NO plot.  The events of the opening cinematic, the events you play through in game, and the events revealed once you vanquish the final combat challenge are never connected or given reference in-game.  Whatever transpires between starting the game and viewing its credits is entirely dependant on your interpretation of how to connect the vague dots on display.  In practice it could mean anything.  In effect, it's meaningless.And so Hyper Light Drifter is a phenomenally pretty action game.  If you want anything else out of it, be prepared for disappointment.			"

												This is one of those old-school difficulty games, which is fine. I was excited to buy this, everyone seems to love it, but it just doesn't do it for me. Right now the biggest problem I have are the controls. I play this on a mac and I don't know of an easy way to connect a PS4 or XBox controller to my laptop without downloading anything so I go without. I never really felt hindered by this as games like Half-life and Shovel Knight work fine without it. However, Hyper Light Drifter was clearly made for consoles. At their best the controls are here stiff and awkward. It makes parts of the game frustrating and borderline unplayable--parts that I know I'd be able to do easily with a controller now push the boundies of my patience. This wouldn't be such a problem if it didn't force you to use the keyboard and the mouse. I'd rather just attack in whatever direction I'm facing, like in Zelda; I don't like having to be constantly aware of where the mouse is on-screen. I've gotten myself killed because I've forgotten point in the direction I wanted to attack. I'm sure having that second analog control is necessary, but I'd sacrifice the gun's accuracy any day if it meant not having to worry about pointing at a target just to hit it with my sword.If you play on a computer and you don't own a controller I can't recommend this. If you do, give it a shot. The art is beautiful, the music and story are interesting. I'm also not a fan of how ambiguous everything is. I often find myself wishing for dialogue or at least some basic explanations of how things work or what's going on but that's another story.P.S. Your character will sit down after a while. This is novel at first but to have you study obstacle patterns, waiting for the right moment to move, then DIE because your dude took too long to stand up is the cheapest thing this game does.			"

												This is the first review I've ever written, and possibly the last.  This game is such a work of overwhelming beauty I felt compelled to voice my opinions.Gameplay - When I first started playing Hyper Light Drifter, I questioned how well an action game without I-frames could work - the equivalent idea being an action game with no I frames is like a shmup with no bombs.  As I played more, I realized that when the mechanics are designed to perfection, when every error can be attributed to ""no one's fault but my own"", it became clear to me that I frames would have been an unnecessary bandage on polish resembling an unblemished mirror.  Aside from the major issue of the game's complete absence of I-frames, the responsive controls and the demanding chain dash timing makes every encounter feel like a personal victory - the drifter never gains level, the stats that grow belong to you, the player.Aesthetic - A beautiful dreamy pastel haze, contrasted heavily by low fantasy brutality where no detail is spared.  Painterly backdrops of ruin placed at choice locations to set the tone for the upcoming area.  Besides the UI, there is not a single word voiced the entire game, however the tone and the ambience do more than necessary for successful storytelling.Soundtrack - Dynamically shifting music that is always tone appropriate, the quality of the soundtrack is on the same level as Bastion or Transistor.  However the decidedly low-fi instrumentation are chosen specifically to compliment the art design.Overall - Hyper Light Drifter is a game that is completely uncompromising in every sense of the word.  Everything about this game is honest, from the very demanding difficulty, to the heartbreaking world it's built around.  HLD is a game not only action fans would enjoy, but anyone who's sick to death of formulaic games targetting the greatest possible target audience with no regard to integrity or concinnity of design.  HLD is an original artistic vision that has been fulfilled in the most elegant way possible.tl;dr - it's really good go play it.personal PJSalt - where's my achievement for beating Newgame+ :(			"

												This review is written with 2h gameplay of the beta build and 2h gameplay of the final version of the game. No spoilers aheadAtmosphere: The game is just beautiful. Gorgeous. The feeling and atmosphere of the game can be predicted by the 3 trailers, but what you couldn't know is the love to details. The Birds still fly away if you walk near them, so this is a thing. But where I really was suprised is when there was a mirror which had a) a reflection of the player and b) I hit the mirror and it broke! That is just such a need detail. 11/10The music fits the game great. After hearing that the music of the first trailer (which i love to death) was not composed by the composer of this game I was disappointed. When the second trailer was released I was worried, because, well I didn't really liked the music. Suprisingly the music just melts wonderful into the game while playing and just underlines the overall theme of the game.The game has a feeling of solitude and mystery to it. There is not one english letter in the game so far. Just some mysterious symbols. The story is told by pictures. If you talk to story relevant NPCs they will tell their story by several pictures which you have to interprete as you see fitting. This was again rather suprising but in a good way, because this as well fits the overall theme great in my opinion.The controls are pretty responding and feel very good, which is the foundation of such a game. It is hard. The combat is fast paced and punishing. If you don't time your attacks or movement well you will die. If you get hit by certain attacks you will get punished by falling to the ground, so if you rush headless into some enemys and one hits you once, it is almost certain that the others will hit you afterwards without giving you a chance to avoid it, because of the first mistake you made. You have environmental obstacles which can kill you and will force you to think how you aproach a certain situation. So you will die a lot. Speaking of dying. You can't save the game whenever you want, it has like a checkpoint system. If you reach the checkpoint the game will save. So far these are in fair distances to one another and if you wan't to quit the game there's a message telling you how long ago the last save was.The game offers a lot of secrets, path's you can't see on the first glance. Like in the beta there are invisible platforms, but it looks like that you can make them visible for a short time if you a) stand on them (makes the whole path visible) or if you are at the starting point you can use your companion (which gives you a signal that something is there) to make them visible. So far I haven't understand how the level system (if this even is one) works (or rather what improves if you level up) or how the currency works in this game. Maybe those two are connected. The game will give you a really short tutorial, but it looks like you have to figure out most of the mechanics, which i really like. Hate those tutorials and taking all exploration out of a game by forcing everything down your throat.Just one thing. When I close the game it will crash. That is probably not a big thing, because I wanted to exit it anyway, but it just shouldn't happen after such a long development time. A beta for a game was originally a thing to test if a game is running properly and if I will stumple about bugs or if the game won't start (error message) for other people (which i've read on KS) and other systems. If something the game crashes, bugs or similar, that is a no go. You (developer) deceided to exlude most of us from a real beta test and you did this intern for story and suprise purposes (which i can kinda understand), we got ""just"" a preview build. So I hope you made sure that the game will work properly! Anyway great Game.			"

												As much as I want to fully complete this game, there's honestly no reward besides a nice soundtrack and grinding achievements. I thought it would have the same feeling as Bastion or Transistor, but it does not come close to being comparable besides the visuals and soundtrack. This game is honestly missing a narrator or anything that can talk. Anything to give direction or a backstory to what's happening or happened. I'll go more in-depth on other aspects of the game that are flawed based on my few hours of gameplay. Yes, I did beat the game, but to say I completed it or enjoyed it throughout the game says otherwise through my hours. Controls: The controls for PC feel so unresponsive and delayed. Dashing has a half-second delay and it just feels terrible. Not making it happen immediately just crutched this game dramatically considering that dashing is probably one of the few things making this game unique and the most used ability/mechanic as well. Carpal tunnel is real if you play this game. Combat: Attacking is more spam and luck than timed, coordinated attacks. Maybe I should have played it with a controller as the game suggested, but then it just defeats the purpose of playing on a PC. Trying to combo dashing and attacking is just horrendous. No fluidity at all. It's more going commando and killing the enemy before the enemies wrecks you. Enemies:Pretty much useless. No exp system and a rare coin drop chance (for upgrades) basically means enemies are there to waste time, to unlock rooms (if applicable), or to get lucky with coins. There are rooms where the enemies are going to be easily smashed or just a grinding pain to fight. It's easier and more worth your time to just skip them completely if you can. Bosses: Learn their movements. Check. Try to dash and fail. Check. Keep trying to dash and fail. Check. Congrats you probably died more times than necessary because the dashing is so atrocious. It's sad to say that a samurai mini boss was the hardest out of the other ""main"" bosses and the end game boss is honestly a joke. It's like subbing this game's final boss for mario vs. bowser and putting it against dark souls' bosses.Map: Borderline useless. Hard to tell where you are, where to go, or where you've been. Prepare to walk back and waste time becasue you forgot which room had two paths. But who cares about good map design when you can make the visuals good :^) Hidden Paths: I wouldn't have hated this game's hidden paths if it at least let you know what to look for. I was 80% through the game story wise when I just realized what to look for. All the times I was confused about why I couldn't unlock certain doors or progress further in certain areas was because I  didn't know what to look for. Would've been nice to have something tell me ""Hey, look there, what's that strange symbol on the floor? You'll think it'll lead somewhere?"" - Narrator from Transistor. Overall, this game is not worth $20 or the $10 one-year anniversary price. Maybe one dollar for each hour I played so $5? I'm a visual person, but this game's visuals made no sense to forming any type of story or backstory. Through my eyes, this game is about a guy who is chasing a diamond, but gets wrecked by the end game boss. Somehow, he survives and is on a quest to activate monoliths to defeat the end game boss. That's it. Nothing about how it happened, when it happened, why it happened. The game left out who,when,where,why,how and only gave you the what. But hey, atleast the visuals were good right?  "

												Beautiful and vibrant pixel art, tight controls and combat timing, and very interesting story presentation.Hyper Light Drifter is both unique and also barrows (perhaps unintentionally) from games like Transistor and Bastion but gives it a Dark Souls feel. It's a difficult game, but with repetition comes a mastering of the tools at your disposal. The combat is simple and balanced but open enough to allow a few different play styles.Also worth mentioning is using a controller will enhance the feel ten-fold. The mix of great sound effects and synced controller vibrations is very immersive, and helps even more to bring you into this foriegn world.There is one word of caution however, be alert and stay vigilant. Many traps and secret passages lay around the levels.It's worth every penny. If anything I said interests you I guarantee you will not be disappointed.			"

												ok now the major problems seems to be patched out . the art design is really great,if you are able to open yourself up to those kind of games .The controlls are suprisingly very smooth and responsive, in my opinion the 30 fps lock don'thurt that much. combat is punishing fluid and fun . at the moment i have no real complaints about this game .

												So Hyper Light Drifter.First, I'd like to say the game is a complete 10/10 in my book. I'd recommend anyone play it if they enjoy difficult games. I've also not beat the game in New Game + yet, I'll get to that in a few days.Alright, onto the review.Let's start with the combat system. It's great, easy to pick up. It's satisfying, challenging, fun, and balanced all at once. Enemies can attack through your attacks most of the time, meaning there's no stunlocking any enemies. You have to strategically plan your hits to make sure you hit the enemies enough times and then dash out of the range of their attacks. Multiple enemies can be hard to deal with, but that's why the game includes ranged weapons. Not meant to be used as primary means of damage, but the ranged combat is an easy way to lessen the numbers of enemy groups into more manageable sizes. Bosses, on the other hand, are really, really tough. You've got a lot of health to get rid of, and you only take a few hitsNext up is the visuals and sound. Both are fantastic, truly masterpieces. The visual style is simple in color, but the lighting and quality of animations and detail makes up for any and all mistakes made. Those mistakes are very few and far between, and very hard to see when you're just playing the game. The music is amazing, each area's music slowly changes depending on where you are and what's going on around you. If you're underground, if there are enemies around, if the room you're in is more of a puzzle room, the little touches make it all that much better. What else did we expect? Disasterpiece did the music for the game.Alright, now we'll look at general gameplay. Most of it's self-explanatory. The movement system is great, just the perfect blend of slippery but perfectly controllable. The dashing system is a nice way to get around fast, and with some practice, Chain Dash can get you around even faster. There's been a few times when I've fallen off of ledges due to minor things, but it doesn't punish you much for falling out of the world. Health packs are thankfully abundant, if you explore enough. The upgrade system is straightforward, but I wish there was a liiiitle more variety in the way of things you can collect for upgrades.There's nothing really to write on the story of the game, it's really vague. Play yourself or watch someone else play, then figure out what you want to think of it.			"

												This. This right here. I love it. The best single player game i have ever played. I first saw a screenshot, I thought this game looked amazing. Idk why it was so alurring, but it was. So i get the game on a whim, watched no reviews or anything. I am normally the guy to reaserch a game to the bones before I buy it but I just went all in. It was totally worth it. I watched the openning cinimatic and I came. The art, the sound track, (omg dnt get me started on the sound track, the credits at the end of the game, the song was amazing. I would 100% buy the soundtrack to this game) the passion and the work put into the art was absolutly stunning. I got into the game shivering not sure what to expect. ""I mean it is just and 8-bit / 16-bit game right?"" I was dead wrong. The combat and the feeling of reward after every kill is what drives the game. Kill one little enemy with only 3 hit hp bar felt satisfying knowing even that could kill you. The progression in the game isnt just you getting some op♥♥♥♥♥gear and going along ur way thanking the RNG Gods for a sweat drop. You dnt get op gear what you get is learning the game a new skill here and there and knowing every boss or area you beat you earned. I 100% recomend this game to ANYONE who wants to spend a decent amount of hours to experence a masterpeice. I have only one problem. The game may still be new and I encountered a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. The only problem is the creators behind this game going to make a sequal. Because I NEED IT!! 10/10----100% -----and all that sweat jazz.			"

												SUMMARY: Beautiful, moody, and difficult, Hyper Light Drifter is a (mostly) nonlinear action adventure in a post-apocalptyic world - ""Dark Souls Meets Zelda.""  Must-buy for fans of action-adventures looking for a challenge, the the design work is amazing and artistic.Hyper Light Drifter starts with an 8-bit voiceless introduction about a strange, ill wanderer in a ruined land.  It soon leads to a central hub where the Drifter in question begins his adventure - with nary a voiceover and spare text to instruct him.  From there, it's up to you to find your destiny.It's hard to not talk about the game's artistry - the 8-bit look includes amazingly crafted backgrounds and enemies.  The music is moody.  The story is told through visual clues and ""conversations"" that show still pictures or simple displays.  The entire experience feels incredibly crafted.""Crafted"" also applies to the gameplay.  As your nameless hero (heroine?) and their helpful robot/assistant venture into this strange ruined land, you'll need to think about how you play.  Enemies have specific movements and patterns, environments can be used to your advantage - and most things can kill you surprisingly quickly.  The game's layout and enemies are crafted - so must be your actions.The game largely focuses on wandering around trying to unlock other areas.  Wandering into new places usually means a confrontation with enemies, a hostile environment, or both.  Your response to these challenges requires thought and precision - button mashing isn't always the solution (though sometimes it actually is, but in a precise way).  Each location has a puzzle-like quality, and though you'll die (often) you usually blame yourself for your mistakes - and try again.The environments are semi-linear, loaded with secrets and challenges, and with their own stories to tell.  When not adventuring, there's a central hub town that lets you improve your abilities.  The relative lack of direction leaves you many options, though smart layout design gives you a reasonable idea of what to do.It's hard to find a flaw with Hyper Light Drifter except it is very challenging, and unapolagetically so.  It's not a game to play to relax, unless pushing yourself and puzzling out things is your idea of relaxing.  If it is - or if you're in a mood for that - you'll be happy.A must-buy for people who want a challenging top-down actioner - and the wonderful art and music turn it into an experience not to be missed.

												Since there is no option for neutral review, I'm going with ""not recommended"". The game left me longing for more, but not in a good way. Fun for few evenings, but definitely not worth the asking price.I see Zelda quite often referenced when the topic is Hyper Light Drifter, but the only thing in common is the camera angle. I had hopes for a adventure like top-down Zelda with smooth and rich combat, as the reviews sold the game to me as such. Hyper Light Drifter is more like a top-down Devil May Cry. This game has no puzzles and no new items at the end of the dungeons, and no challenging exploration either. The dungeons are mostly fights after fights and a few hidden rooms that require pixel hunting to access. The fights are smooth, but feel samey from the beginning to end, as there are no real combo moves or enemies requiring advanced tactics. It plays excellent, but can only just hold my interest for the 6 hours of gameplay the game has to offer. The game has some gorgeous pixel art scenery, but it seems that the aesthetics were the top priority and actual content was lacking.Don't bother playing the co-op. I began this game as a co-op experience, but my partner got bored after an hour, since player 2 is severely crippled. Player 2 can only follow and fight, but cannot heal herself, pick up any items or interact in any way with the game world. Local co-op is clearly implemented as an after thought.Hyper Light Drifter is both overhyped and overpriced. If you're looking for smooth combat and a few evenings worth of gameplay, wait for the game to be discounted and then go for it.			"

												I've put in just over an hour into the basic gameplay but I played the beta for hours on end. Don't know why Steam doesn't show all my hours. Overall it's about what you'd expect plus more. The game is so challenging I actually lost count how many times I got close to dying. It plays like a mix of a zelda esque type deal with difficulty mechanics not seen in any other game like it. You won't find enemies just standing still the whole time and just waiting for you, the game will send them all at once at you, with no mercy whatsoever. But with the how stylish and fluid the combat feels, it's super satisfying clearing out a whole room with a mixture of dashes, slashes, and shooting stuff up. The overall atmosphere is just amazing, no level feels the same as the last with every room and every new area practically having it's own story. The soundtrack is downright awesome with it's different ups and downs moments and it makes every cutscene and every level you play through feel practically like a movie. Been waiting for 2 years for this, Heart Machine, you guys really nailed it. Can't recommend any harder, wish I could.			"

												Is Hyper Light Drifter a good game? Yes - Here is why I believe so:Hyper Light Drifter is a call back to the games of old - before the internet and online guides were prevelant. During this time frame (more so the nes/snes era) games had an air of mystique, most things were never told, and the world was experienced and not explained. This is the world of Hyper Light drifter.Also do you remember the music of your favorite games of old? You probably do. Why do you remember this? Because the music helped to build the moment, and it was integral to the world building of the game that you played. Disasterpiece (who scored Fez) did a brillant job with the score. You really feel like a wander in a strange, but not outlandish, land. The highs and lows of the music correspond with the setpieces known as the backdrops.Besides the atmosphere being a call back to older games, this game also calls back to a time before there were difficulty levels. This game is difficult, but not impossible. When you die, you don't feel like you were cheated - you just feel like you messed up. I feel like this is the mark of a well developed game - and Heart Machine should be applauded for their first time effort.The gameplay of this game is like a mixture of zelda (the grand adventure), and the combat of modern ninja gaiden (fast and furious, with multiple weapons). The movement system that they implemented - a chainable dash - was a great idea as it makes traversing the huge map quite easy (you also have the ablity to teleport to certain locations at any given time - even in dungeons).The last time that I felt so good about a neo-classic game was when I played Fez. The difference between this game and fez however (besides the genre/gameplay/etc) is that when playing this game, you will know if you missed something. You will not need ultra complicated maps, decoder rings, etc to be able to get the most of the game. Take your time, enjoy the ride. You will find all sorts of secrets that will make you feel proud of yourself.So is Hyper Light Drifter a good game - in my opinon - yesIts a throw back to the difficult and yet imaginative days of old - yet its formula helps it to be able to stand on its own without nostalgia.

 Magic No other word, just pure magic. When art, design, music, gameplay, mechanics ... everything mixed, fitting perfectly, creating something truly unique. Creating a feeling, a dream-like atmosphere, a different experience... It's just beautiful. Something you need to experience for yourself. The game is hard, a lot. The combat speak for itself, precise and ambitious, smooth... but very hard too. It's ""Prepare to Die Edition"", you will die a lot in here. The game doesn't guide you, doesn't explain anything, you have to discover its secrets, its gameplay, a new world opens up to you full of beauty and dangers. The game oozes love on each pixel. Its music is an amazing work of art. It has many hidden mysteries. There's no languaje, everything is very cryptic and intuitive. You also have the freedom to choose your path and face it. Alex Preston and his team made for us a beautiful and unique journey in a vast, fantasy-ruined world, with lost technologies, ancient artifacts, unknow dangers and strange creatures... like they said ""Inspired by nightmares and dreams alike.""

												Absolutely loving, challenging but not difficult or unfair game with outstanding artwork and sound design and a story told only by the game itself.The creators put a lot of love for detail in it's environment and it feels smooth all through the game.The secrets are well hidden, the enemies always challenging.The only things for improvement i see are the difficulty of the bosses which on most cases are fairly easy and the drifting which does not feel very intuitive.But since those things do not pull any fun out out of the game, tough it can kinda get frustrating, it's still worth a buy.I had roughly 14 hours of fun, i guess more casual gamers will pull somewhat around 20 hours of gameplay out of it.

												I would just like to say, the level design in this game is one of the best I've seen in a while. Every secret, every hidden area, has a way to be spotted. You do not need to randomly rub your face against a wall to find a secret. May it be seeing it from another area, or an enemy walking through, or a tiny path.The games difficulty is great, you can get ability upgrades and more ammo for your guns, but from what ive seen, most enemy types have the same health, take the same damage, and deal the same damage. Many would say that that sounds easy and not hard, the difficulty of this game doesnt come from ""bullet sponge enemies"" or stacking enough health to survive. It comes from using your abilities  to avoid damage and deal damage. The game is great and I highley reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a difficult, artsy, game with an amazing soundtrack.Edit: I would also like to add, the way the story is told in the game is amazing. Charecter do not speak what so ever. No dialogue, instead the story is fleshed out through the environment, and picture driven narative. It's great it really makes you feel like you have gone to a foreign world, were you understand nothing and no none of the history and are left to explore and discover and it is so fufilling.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is an amazing game! while there isnt any major story being develivered there is a plot shared from the art alone. I have died so many times and yet I keep coming back for more. The combat is strongly based on attacking and dodging at the right times. Over dodging or under dodging will end with your death. The game teaches you how do deal with enemies quickly without any sort of tutorial. once you have fought a med size enemy it likes to ambush you with multiple of them and a bunch of smaller enemies and tells you ""good luck"". this game throws you in head first into the deep and and I am enjoying every second of it!

												Only played this game for around 30 minutes, but can't wait to give comment about it.Will update it after I play more, but here is my early reaction to the game:Pros:- Fantastic atmosphere thanks to the beautiful visual and music.- The basic gameplay is strong enough to make it fun to play (for now).- I don't know why, but I really like playing as The Drifter.Cons:- Why not make aiming controlled with right analog? That way the flow of the battle can be more dynamic. I guess there are reasons later in the game why they don't want to implement this.Mixed:- Still not sure about the whole non-verbal experience. It works great on games like Journey, but on Hyper Light Drifter it might not work as great.			"

												I backed this game on Kickstarter a while back: September 2013. The presentation of this game was what really caught my eye and the beta that came midway during its development helped remind everyone what this game was all about.Quite frankly, I've never been so mesmarized by an atmosphere since FTL and Dark Souls. Hyper light drifter did just that and more without any dialogue whatsoever. The game is mysterious and unfolds at a pleasant pace. The soundtrack is very grandiose and dynamically changes depending on the scenery.The combat is very fast paced and it'll have you looking around like a bullet hell game ; paying attention to enemy movement and closing in at an opportune time. Even the creator of this game shared his thoughts on his game's combat mechanic, saying that he prefers smarter enemies over larger ones, and boy did he drive that point home! Even the easiest of enemies can dodge, lure, ambush, and flank the player during encounters!  Yes, I am in love with the amount of hard work that has been poured into the game and I truly hope there will be a sequel very much like this. Truly worth the investment.			"

												Hyperlight Drifter is an action/adventure game reminiscent of the the Legend of Zelda from the NES. You play as the Drifter, and view the world from a bird's eye view. The game world is open and vast, and you must go undertake a quest to save existence. Along the way, you will find better equipment, and currency which you can then use to upgrade your equipment and skills.This game is gorgeous. Its art style is very reminiscent of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras of videogames, and it certainly plays like a game from that era. The game is challenging, but not brutally difficult. Combined with the music, it is very easy to get lost inside the world of Hyper Light Drifter. Did I mention that this game is gorgeous?The story is vague, and told purely through visuals, as there is no spoken language or written english text in the game. There is a coded language than you can decipher (I believe other players have deciphered it) that offer additional clues about the plot for you to interpret.The gameplay is both fast-paced, with peaceful lulls in-between, to explore and find the game's countless hidden secrets.This little game is a lot of fun. A must play for anyone that loves action games, pixel-based art, or longs for the old days of NES adventures.The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that the Steam achievements don't seem to be working properly at the time of this review. However, that's such a minor detail that will probably get fixed, and does not really affect the game itself. This game truly is a gem. I hope Heart Machine adds more content to this game, or simply makes other games. Treat yourself. Play this game!EDIT: The game has now been updated to 60 FPS with new playmodes.			"

												By far this is one of the most beautiful games I have played in years. Everything about this game is beautiful: the music, the artstyle, everything! I have no issues recommending this game to any fan of retro-style games. This game is like a mix between Samurai Jack, Dark Souls, Legend of Zelda, and Metroid. What could be better than that?			"

												This game was wonderful. Played amazingly, the scenes portrayed by the pixel artists for this game were breathtaking, and I left it a bit sad that there wasn't more.Interestingly enough, the bosses get easier as you play, only because the controls start feeling more natural, and once you finally get in that groove with the blink ability, the game becomes so much better. The boss-fights were the shining crown to what was already an excellent experience.I was able to beat it in 5 hours, and have decided not to go into New Game+, as the New Game alone kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ but the game is stellar and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge, especially those of you who enjoyed Dark Souls.

												Besides the motion sickness person, every bad review of this game is about the difficulty. To those people: Get better at games and you might enjoy them more.The good:The soundThe graphicsThe world buildingThe difficultyThe choice to make dodging a necessary and core mechanic from the beginningThe choice of silence and storyboards to keep the immersionThe bad:There's some places where direct progress is too hidden. Like, after you complete the first boss, it should be more obvious how to continue forward. Same with the entrance to said boss.I definitely won't complain about the crazy number of secrets and mandatory exploring, but main paths should never be hidden.You guys need to watch strangers play your game, without telling them how to progress, and figure out where they're getting tripped up. Do this at least 50 times. Tweak your levels when there's something at least 5 people are getting hung up on understanding that is actually mandatory.I didn't figure out the chain dash until I had it for 30+ minutes, went back to the dash test room, and noticed the counter. Even then, it took 5 minutes of futzing around to figure out how to use it. "

												Hyper Light Drifter Is a 2D top-down action RPG that's been making headlines for a while now, mainly thanks to its admittedly gorgeous art direction and pixel-art. However, dig underneath the pleasing aesthetic and you'll find a surprisingly engaging and well-designed game well worth your time and money.Don't let the beautiful graphics fool you, this is a devastatingly hard game. Starting off with a simple sword and weak laser pistol, HLD will test your reflexes and timing in incredibly smart ways. I've always enjoyed games that offer great depth with a small amount of mechanics and HLD shows this magnificently, with several enemy types and puzzles that'll pull you apart if you're not careful.Story-wise, it's very minimalistic. Save for a stunning opening intro, everything is kept very vague and only shown through small interactions with NPCs. Nothing to really dive into, per se, but does a great job of making the player curious.The RPG side is handled very well too. Due to the Metroidvania style of the world that you explore, upgrades are either found after defeating (very hard) bosses, or bought at vendors in the starting hub. A small gripe for me personally is the slow rate at which you acquire these. The currency system is done so that buying upgrades is very long-term, which can slow the pace a bit.There aren't many negatives for me to mention really. My only main criticism is that the pixel-art can sometimes clutter the screen a bit because of the immense detail. Not so bad when exploring, but making tight jumps and fighting large groups of enemies can be hard to clearly see. The running speed of the protagonist is a tad slow too. I found myself dashing everywhere just to get a move on. There may be an upgrade to improve this, but not having some sort of speed early on can be annoying.Overall, Hyper Light Drifter is definitely a massive recommendation from me. If you're looking for a beautiful RPG that'll test you in all the right ways, get this immediately.			"

												Rarely a game comes along that gets me excited enough to buy it the minute it comes out. Hyper Light drifter is one of those rare games, and it doesn't dissapoint.At the time of this review I'm only two hours in, but I'm already hooked. Hyper Light Drifter is a hack and slash that hits every note with perfect precision, and manages to add it's own beautiful twist that makes it unique. Let me explain.The Atmosphere: You are probably already aware that the art style is absolutly fantastic, but the trailers don't give away the full story. Each set piece feels like it is well thought out, and each screen is beautifully composed. Even more so, the music adds to the atmosphere and mood without being distracting or obtrusive. The sound of this game strikes a fantastic balance between emotive expression and being a delicate background foundation to the game. Even the sound effects feel masterfully created. I can not rave about the way this game presents itself more. It is top shelf.The Story: So far I'm only right at the very start of the game, but the story has already drawn me in, and it has managed to do so with absoltly no text. This game takes the idea of ""show, don't tell"" very seriously, and it absolutly delivers. It didn't take very long at all for me to become invested in the characters, and the world feels very real and lived-in. It is hard for me to find fault. Granted, this early on it is entirely possible for the story to fall appart later on, but given how expertly the beginning of the game is constructed, I highly doubt the rest of the story will be anything but fantastic. I'm excited to discover more about this world and the people who inhabit it.The Combat: No game is perfect, and Hyper Light Drifter is no exception. The combat feels tight and responsive, but beyond that it doesn't really introduce anything too exciting. Combat is neither brutally hard nor boringly easy, but it can be a little frustrating. Enemy's attacks will follow you accross the screen after you dash out of the way, which can lead to the annoying experience of dodging an enemy's attack only to have the enemy fly accross the screen and kill you anyway. Combat is a little punishing, with enemy's two-hitting you from very early on, meaning you have to play perfectly to progress, and might need to retry a fight ten or more times before you can move on. The ranged weapon feels pretty underpowered, with very limited ammo and an awkward aiming system. Using the gun often feels like a waste of time and effort. Your sword is much more effective, and doesn't cost ammo. On top of that your abilities are the same powers we've seen a hundred times over. One melee attack, One ranged attack, and a dash. Don't get me wrong, the combat is /fine/, but it is only fine where the rest of the game is great. All up this game does not dissapoint, and I'm excited to see where the game takes me and what the company produce in the future. Solid performance.TLDR; Game is good. Spend $$$.			"

												Alright, I helped make this game as a KS Backer and I have to say that the wait was worth it because the promises were delivered.  The animation sequences are beautifully done, the art, and feeling like I'm playing a grown up Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past style game.  My one quip about the who matter is my XBone controller sometimes stops working for the game unless i unplug it then plug it back in.  Isn't happening anywhere else, so maybe I'll just have to wait for an update.Also, this is so much better stoned.			"

The game also doesn't explain things through straight forward methods so you should be prepared to be slightly confused.			"

												+ Combat system shines as the best aspect of this game. Just look up some footage of it, you'll see what I mean.+ Heavy music combined with beautiful scenery creates a jaw-dropping atmosphere. + Game does not hold your hand on this one. There's no help button, no hidden hints. You just have to figure it out. Personally, I like that.+Cheap I bought this game on a whim, with no knowledge of what this game was, nor did i hear the massive hype train that appearently rolled in with the Steam release of this game. What I did hear was the stunning soundtrack of this game...and lots of death screams. Lots. P.S. use a controller or suffer.			"

												This game is difficult, rewarding and hauntingly beautiful. The particulars of the gameplay are covered very well in other reviews, I simply want to say that I backed this game based purely on the aesthetic and the music and that these alone are worth the price of admission.The boss fights in this game are incredibly punishing. Get ready to die again and again (and again!) and to accidentally punch your ceiling when you finally succeed. After beating the Western Boss with just 1 hit point left, I felt like I was about to have heart failure.10/10 would risk death again.			"

												An excellent title, especially if on sale. The presentation is unique and well crafted.  The principal of ""show-don't-tell"" is embraced to the limits - there is nothing in the way of exposition or dialog. Even in-game stores and menus eschew words in favor of images. Your enjoyment will depend on a willingness to go along with this quixotic approach to gameplay and storytelling, but it’s worth it.			"

												Incredible game. It feels like a top-down pixel art version of Dark Souls with faster combat. The combat is very tight. Precisely timed dodges with attacks weaved in between is the only way to succeed in this game. The world is very intricate, and feels rewarding to explore. I felt compelled to search for extras even if I wasn't required to do so. The atmosphere is also very well crafted. You feel like you're exploring a world ravaged by some unknown disaster, and you're just trying to pick up the pieces. The story is conveyed exclusively through cutscenes and still images. NPCs do not tell you their background, but rather, show you cryptic images of their past. The game allows the player to craft the story based on the bits of information left throughout the world. One of the best action games of its time.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is one of the most perfect ""indie"" games ever created. It excels in so many ways, but, for me, the two most compelling things are the gameplay and its completely unique style. In terms of gameplay, the multiple comparisons to Zelda are apt, although HLD is significantly more challenging in combat. Between dashing, reflecting, shooting, and slashing, the Drifter is always in motion, which is critical to juggling the constantly challenging mix of enemies. The game is hard, and you will die frequently--but as you find items and grow in power, you'll add more abilities and tricks to your arsenal, and it's satisfying to master them all. The controls are tight, and it's an absolute joy to play. HLD is also one of the most visually unique games I've ever played. I personally don't have that much nostalgia for the retro-pixel look, but there's something about HLD's pixel art that, when combined with its gorgeous neon color palette and eerie alien world, achieves something close to sublime. HLD is so confident in its craft that it refuses to feature any comprehensible spoken or written text, which furthers the strangeness and alienation of its world. HLD is a monument to what gaming can achieve--it's hauntingly beautiful and engimatic and new, but still plays like something classic and familiar. HLD is simply a marvel.			"

Product received for free
												This is probably gonna be my first ""serious"" ""review"" that I'm gonna do, so brace yourselves.""Hyper Light Drifter...sounds like an 80's movie."" ~Me, Today.Here's the first thing you need to know about this game:it doesn't just tell you very little at the start, it tells you a big fat pile of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. All you know is that you are a genderless blue humanoid being with a blue sword. There's also some weird black stuff, and according to the steam trading card, it's called ""Judgment"". Neat.So now for the presentation: IT IS AMAZING. There's actually not that much music in the overworld, just relaxing ambience. It's an experience bordering on stop-and-smell-the-roses. There were so many points where I just wanted to take a break and enjoy the atmosphere. The spritework and animation is better than any game I've seen with sprites. The vivid colors and surreal atmosphere just make it feel even more like an 80's movie.Now for gameplay.I'd say it's something like Bloodborne, mixed with a bit of Zelda. It's very much based on timing and precision, as well as the occasional puzzle. I say Bloodborne instead of Dark Souls because you also have a gun. The gun is pretty interesting in terms of combat, as it has only a few shots, but you regain them by slashing things with your sword, or as I call it, the ""Razor Blade Whappin' Stick"", making both options viable.And I can't think of anything to put here for an end, so...OK review over now.UPDATE: OH NO I FORGOT TO ACTUALLY SAY IF THIS GAME IS GOOD OR NOTyes, it is a good game.

												I really wanted to like this game.I did.Until i realized that this, this pixel game, this less than a GB game.Runs like a potato.this is saying something, Csgo runs faster than this, and that's a 9 gigabyte game with 3D rendered graphics.So please, tell me, why does this game run like my grandmother in a steel tomb?Until this game works and i can get past the raining sequence, and it takes less than 15 minutes for my character TO STAND UP FROM BLEEDING, then i will play it and give it a good review. But until then, ♥♥♥♥ this.			"

												Game has great atmosphere/aura. I love the combat (the game upgrade system is cool, it is just hard to figure out how to use it, but I won't spoil it) the weapons/abilities make it really unique and fun. I also like how mysterious it is, your are put into a world with no explanation, only your own exploration will slowly shape the story for yourself. Overall, DEFINITELY worth the money.10/10, would bye againThose god**** spiders won't leave me alone.			"

While I beat the last boss after 8 hours, I didn't really ""complete' the game - There are a ton of secrets that I never discovered, doors I never opened, and so on. I think that over the next few weeks a lot of really interesting stuff is going to be unveiled about the game. There is a lot to chew on already - people are deciphering the runes used throughout the game, figuring out the story, and so on.			"

												I'll try to say things which haven't been said (that this is a very difficult Souls-like; well, you die a lot more but death isn't nearly as punishing.  There are checkpoints everywhere.  But there's the same emphasis on deadly fights and big, connected maps.) and which aren't apparent from the trailer (both the art and sound design are gorgeous).1: Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the map design.  There are a bajillion nooks and crannies and hidden paths.  Exploration is _very_ much rewarded.  And it's not like some games where it's a matter of pressing the A button or the E key on every single wall.  There are a lot of nice patterns as for figuring out where the hidden panels are, and the game does a nice job of training you to see them.2: The balance is _perfect_.  You don't have any stats which increase over the course of the game (closest thing to getting more health is getting more capacity for healing potions).  Yet you definitely feel like you're getting stronger as you progress through an area.  The upgrades are great, but they can pretty much only be used to exploit a weakness once you've figured out an enemy's pattern.  This means that even though the game branches out very early on, you don't have to worry about being too OP and tearing through the area you choose last, or getting crushed in the area you choose first.  In any case, enemies are introduced gradually, so you get trained in how to fight them before you see too many of them.  Exception being those charging plant monsters.  ♥♥♥♥ them D:3: Try to buy the dash chaining upgrade as soon as possible.  It's so hard to get good at but it's soooo much fun.			"

												Fantastic game. I've beaten 3 bosses now in a little under 4 hours (i left the game open when I went to eat). The game is punishing, yet rewarding. Graphically it's astounding. Play wise it's the exact opposite  of child's play. Let's cut to the meat here.Pros-1. Reminescent of Zelda, while having difficulty and mechanics you wouldn't find in a LoZ game.2. Astounding soundtrack, with music that helps set the tone for every area you're in.3. Stunning visuals. I've never had a game that I walk in to a water area and just stopped to look at how beautiful it is.4. It makes you think. Exploration gives you upgrades, and upgrades keep you alive, though admittedly they are not completely necessary.5. The story telling is done in a way that I haven't seen done this well in a long time. There's no words. When you meet an important NPC they show you what they need to in pictures. There's no ""hey go here"". There's only a picture of the boss killing people followed by two more somewhat similar pictures.Cons-1. This isn't a con for me, but some people do not like the ridiculous difficulty. This game is not easy. It's not even normal. It can be downright frustrating. The fact that it's not a 3d game like dark souls with hidden mechanics and such can make it even worse. All I can do is shoot, cut, and dodge, it can't be that hard right? Wrong.2. Personally I like the exploring and using your brain to look in to every crevice. Most parts of the game are telegraphed, a line of tiles on the floor, a bunch of enemies on the way. Sometimes, however, you find you can go in to a building or another area, and there was no hint at all. For some this might cause frustration, though I really think at that point you're not playing the game to enjoy the game, you're playing the game to beat it.3. This game felt wrong on the keyboard. It feels like it was build to controller. If you don't have a controller, you're in for a rough time.All in all, Hyper Light Drifter is a masterpiece of a game. I haven't had this much fun in a single player game in a long long time. I had to force myself in to bed at 1 AM last night, because I only have a little bit more to go, but life doesn't stop because a fantastic game such as this came out.10/10.			"

												THIS GAME DOESNT RUN AT 144FPS, ITS NOT VR COMPATABLE; CANT RUN RESHADE/ENB, ITS TOO HRAD AND THE MUSIC DOESNT EVEN HAVE ANY DROPS OR BANGERSWORST GAM EVR DO NOT BUY UNTIL DEVS SORT THIS TRAVERSTY -666/10----------------------------------------------------------------------------------April fools, this game is absolutely incredible.The visuals have so much obvious love and care poured into them.  Although the game does have some occasional issues with visual clarity and clutter, it's more than made up for by the sheer amount of excellent visual storytelling, alongside animation that is both attractive and integral to the game's Dark Souls-seque combat system.  Gorgeous use of shape and colour, too.The audio is an absolute treat.  The game's hazy, SNES-influenced soundscape mixes perfectly with Rich Vreeland's predictably wonderful musical score, that sounds not unlike what would happen if Tangerine Dream and Boards Of Canada did the sweetest damn collab ever.  Moreover, both the sound and music tie in to other aspects of the game on a  deep level.  Sound is often used to highlight enemy attacks and pinpoint hidden secrets, and the music swells and modulates in such a way as to offer punctuation and drama to the visual storytelling on offer.  It really is a treat.The gameplay is tight and responsive but challenging, and punishes sloppy play.  Easy to pick up, tough to beat, satisfying to master.  This game wears its Legend Of Zelda and Dark Souls influences on its sleeve, and is all the better for it.  Bosses can occasionally feel cheap, but this is less down to overall unfairness as it is to complex attack patterns and strategies.  You will try, try and try again, slowly learning how best to chink away at its armour, and when you eventually defeat it, the sense of accomplishment is wonderful.This game is not for everybody.  I imagine some people will bounce off its offputting initial difficulty curve and that the bosses will cause many a smashed joypad and ragequit.  However, for those willing to be truly challenged in exchange for some of the best audiovisual storytelling and exploration in videogames, then you can't get much better than this.  I've waited since the Kickstarter back in 2013 and I am in no way disappointed.It's an absolute masterpiece.			"

												This game is amazing. The game has great graphics, great soundtrack, etc. The game is like Legend of Zelda, and Dark Souls, and I absolutlty love it.This game doesn't really have a story, and if it does, then I don't understand it. But, I don't really care about that. The game handles well, although some of the dash upgrades are a bit difficult to use. The game has a fantastic graphics that make the game breathtaking. The bosses in this game are pretty difficult, but once you get the shotgun, you should be able to take them down no problem. Each boss requires quick reactions, for they attack rather quickly. I wish you could get a health upgrade in the game, but the health restores upgrades are still good.Overall, as I said, I LOVE this game. It is soo cool, and soo much fun. I highly recommend it to everybody. I would just say to wait to get it until it goes on sale.			"

												I enjoyed this tremendously.Zelda meets Dark Souls. While I beat the last boss after 8 hours, I didn't really ""complete' the game - There are a ton of secrets that I never discovered, doors I never opened, and so on. I think that over the next few weeks a lot of really interesting stuff is going to be unveiled about the game. There is a lot to chew on already - people are deciphering the runes used throughout the game, figuring out the story, and so on.			"

												This game was the best thing I've ever had the pleasure to experience.the music was perfect,the gameplay was perfect,the level design was perfect,the visuals were perfect,the difficulty was perfect,the controls were perfect (if you use gamepad),the story was PERFECT!!!I would still buy this game if it was $500 because it was just that awesome, and I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good challenge. My favorite game used to be Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker but this game just blew it out of the water. PLEASE if you can get this game or support the devs in any way do it, they deserve a lot more than they got!			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is much like Dark Souls in the way that it has gameplay revolving around hitting enemies with a sword, occasionally with a ranged weapon, and then moving out of the way very fast. While that seems to be a rather generic relation this style of gameplay has a sort of charm that you just can't escape.In my opinion this game is much better than anything the Dark Souls series has to offer, It has a far more compelling story told with beautiful and colourful art rather than words as well as a unique ability to keep me interested in the gameplay even after I've fought this boss 100 times already and I've got to do it another 100 times before I can beat it.The gameplay is also much more accessable, using a 2D top down perspective gives the player complete vision of the area around them allowing for better planning and maneuvering. The change in perspective and the removal of one dimension really give the gameplay a massive boost in enjoyability.However, HLD does not hold the same level of difficulty as Dark Souls. It is comparatively very easy but only because it plays fair. Dark Souls has a tendency to throw enemies at you that have stats far higher than you could possibly achieve at that time without grinding. HLD fixes this issue by doing away with stats entirely. Your damage output only changes when you unlock new abilities and even then the more powerful attacks have drawbacks. This system results in a balanced game where the only reason you're being killed over and over agains is because you're not skilled enough, not because the enemy is a higher level than you.HLD does, however, have its drawbacks. The entire game goes by with no narrative or guided tutorial. To teach you the mechanics it puts you in situation where you're forced to use the new mechanic. This is generally done well but there are a few cases where it's not clear what you're supposed to do and it can leave you very confused for a long time. This lack of instruction caused me to not buy the chain dash until the very end because the visual demonstration was just someone moving in a triangle shape. I thought it was some useless dodge move that just moved you in a triangle and left off buying it. It's actually one of the most useful items in the game.After you've beaten the game you can start and NG+ run to play the game again but harder or you can hunt for all of the secrets and collectables to 100% it. Perhaps there's a hidden ending, I wouldn't know because I haven't found everthing. Yet.Overall, Hyper Light Drifter is a fantasticly beautiful and atmospheric game that has some of the most enjoyable gameplay I've experienced in a long time. The main story will probably take you about 8 - 10 hours but with collectables and NG+ you could potentially put in many, many more. Pick it up, it's worth the full price.			"

												Bought this game when it was on sale, loved it so so so much, bosses were very challenging yet not impossible. Pixel art is my favorite to this day, I feel the devs in one way were inspired by Fez, the game gave me that vibe. I don't agree with the price tag, but it is worth every penny I spent. At moments gameplay may feel repetitive but the game always somehow keeps me sucked in. Btw, I have more hours played, just offline.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a work of art. The story is unexplained but interesting, the combat system is fun and fairly simple, and the pixel art is beautiful. The game is rather difficult, but extremely fun to play. However there are many hidden areas that seem almost impossible to find. The game stands out in the crowd, because it is so original and well made, unlike a lot of games. If you like Zelda, you will probably enjoy this game.			"

												This game was the best thing I've ever had the pleasure to experience.the music was perfect,the gameplay was perfect,the level design was perfect,the visuals were perfect,the difficulty was perfect,the controls were perfect (if you use gamepad),the story was PERFECT!!!I would still buy this game if it was $500 because it was just that awesome, and I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good challenge. My favorite game used to be Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker but this game just blew it out of the water. PLEASE if you can get this game or support the devs in any way do it, they deserve a lot more than they got!			"

												As a dark souls fan with a low end PC, this game was at the top of my wishlist for a long time. The gameplay is brutally fair and every death is 100% your own fault and while it's very easy to die, this game punishes caution and fear, making for intense battles where being on the offensive is always rewarded and even the lowest 'level' enemies can kill you if you give them the chance. The exploration and art are extremely well done and secret finding is very satisfying and gives the game some replayability. The fact that this game contains little or no text outside of the pause menu and no speech at all and still[/l] manages to tell it's story better than most games is a real credit to the art direction in this game. tl;dr:gr8 m8,8/8 "

												I've invested 45 hours in this game and have finally achieved 100%, and this game is now one of my favorites.There is no dialogue whatsoever, so you can basically go and do everything withotu getting dragged down by long cutscenes, but if you finish the game and look up the lore, the underlying story is very interesting. The art style is great to look at, and the gameplay itself is amazing. It's a very difficult game; you'll spend the time in your normal file learning what everything does and getting used to all of your unlockable powerups, and you'll spend time in your NG+ file just trying to get through it. If you're into games that require keen observation, there are plenty of hidden secrets and such that actually contribute towards your game, and if you're into fast-paced fighting, every fight in this game requires all of your focus; brute forcing your way won't work (especially in NG+), so you actually have to be smart with the way you approach enemies.The game mechanics are surprisingly intuitive; there was only one powerup that confused me at first (the chain dash), and I figured that out within a minute or two. The only thing you'll need to figure out for yourself is what you're trying to accomplish, but you'll actually figure that out AS you're doing it, so don't even worry about not making progress. I give this game a 9/10 (not a full score only because, sometimes, the dashing is a LITTLE finnicky.)			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is an excellent game. 9/10. Would recommend. Read below for further details.PROS - Atmosphere: From the very beginning you are sucked into this world. The music and art design blend together wonderfully creating a drive to explore your surroundings.- Combat: Battles require precision over mashing. The controls felt tight and once you understand what enemies are capable of battles become a dance. You'll battle melee and ranged foes, sometimes at once. Dispaching a room of enemies without taking damage is very satisfying. - Level design: There are four distinct areas to explore in HLD. There is a minimap but I rarely had to use it. The levels have enough branching paths but not too many that you get lost often. There are NUMEROUS hidden nooks and crannies to find. There are some environmental tells but the visuals are so cohesive that the player really has to look and explore to find extra goodies. This is where the dash movement mechanic really shines as you'll constantly find yourself dsahing across gaps to small ledges in search of secrets. The developers really did setup the environment to syngergize with the core movement mechanic of dashing.- Boss Battles: While many people feel the battles are too hard, I though the difficulty was well tuned. All of the bosses have a unique visual design and require different strategies to beat. There was never a boss I had to replay more than seven times (including the final boss). You revive right outside the boss room and a recent patch sped up the player death animation so restarting was not frustratingand after every death. The battles are tense and require constant focus but that makes victory that much more satisfying. I was able to beat the entire game without buying any healing upgrades so with healing fully upgraded I feel many players can complete the game if they learn the patterns and stay determined.CONS- Upgrade System: Melee attacks, movement abilities, and the secondary gun can be upgraded along with a few other things. In keeping with zero dialogue or explanatory text the upgrades merely show a quick clip of what they are. This does leave some ambiguity in what new abilities do. Also, as all upgrades can be purchased from the beginning, choosing an upgrade is simply guesswork. All of the abilities are useful (to an extent) but the currency to purchase them has to be found through exploration so new upgrades can only be purchased so quickly. Buy one you won't need for some time and you're out currency and the gameplay doesnt change. I did a decent amount of additional exploration and did not find enough currency to upgrade everything. Not a problem to me personally but then I was happy with what I chose to upgrade.- Autosave System: I understand why the game has auto-save. It allows the devs to provide difficult sections of the game. The game saves so often I don't think I was never bothered but life does happen so be aware you can't stop playing whenever you want (unless you don't mind replaying a section).- Length: I was only lost once that I can recall and I didn't waste much time dashing around (for a certain achievement) and I beat the game in six hours. I was hoping for an 8-10 hour experience. There is a new game plus and I didn't get all the collectables but for what I'm calling the main game, it was a tad short.Overall Impression- Hyper Light Drifter was worth the 18 USD (sale price). Some of the best boss fights I've played. Great combat. The story presentation being purely visual challenged me to think about the world and what the Drifter's purpose was. Is the game difficult? At times, but you are given all the tools to overcome. Like many of the best indie games, Hyper Light Drifter provides a unique and focused experience you will not get anywhere else.			"

												I just defeated the second boss (went East first, North second) and I must say I am very impressed with this game!  I've been playing with a steam controller and it has been a wonderful experience. I've not played a top-down game this challenging for a very long time!        I'm loving this game so much! I simply cannot believe how much  great it is to dash into a group of enemies and blast them with a gun then use the sword to sweep up the rest. I haven't felt this kind of acomplishment with a game since Dark Souls.        If you don't enjoy dying in games, or exploring without really knowing where to go, you will probably get frustrated at some point. There is a map with points showing you where you need to go, but it is not as exact as a metroid game.       This game relies on you to learn from your mistakes and get the timing down. I've probably died well over 100 times already but I don't mind at all! Its been fun trying to master this game!       Also, I feel I should mention it only runs at 30 fps. But it is worth a try atleast! I don't mind the 30 fps and the Dev has mentioned why it is locked at 30, but I know a couple people have been complaining about headaches. I've never gotten headaches from any game except when I play Stereoscopic 3d for too long.			"

												Amazing game. Here is why:-Very smooth and, for the lack of a better term, controlable controls. -Fair challenges. I have never died and thought ""that was bull.""-Exploration is very rewarding.-Gradual upgrades keep combat fresh.-The world is immersive. You can see the art but that is not the only thing. Every sound for movements/actions, music, atmosphere, and even dialogue (not actual dialogue. There are pictures in speach bubbles that tell a story quick and beautifully).-Fights are challenging and fun. Every fight including boss fights (for the most part), can be boiled down to maybe...two minutes, but the difficulty will have you trying again and again. Sounds frustrating but it is not as much as it seems. Travel time back to where you died almost always is zero. You almost always spawn right before your big battle. You only get punished with travel time if you die in...say a platfoming area.I honestly think that anyone giving this a bad rap because of difficulty really has never been challanged before and is used to the new formula of games. I call them interactive movies. It's a big topic but I think you get the gist. Get this game if you are willing be immersed in it with difficulty and all. If trying hard isn't your thing, look elsewhere. Those who stick with it will be rewarded greatly.  "

												Hyper Light Drifter: A Modern MasterpieceHyper Light Drifter has easily taken the place of my all-time favorite game. The game is a masterpiece in all aspects, combining challenging combat reminiscent of Dark Souls with a unique style all it's own. The art style of this game escapes what can be described in words alone, a stylistic blend of otherworldly sci-fy and post-apocalyptic adventure, the game takes pixel art to an entirely new realm of graphic excellence. The beautifully crafted scenery and enemies are a delight to the eye, with the pixel graphics providing just enough fine detail to provide rich, engaging visuals while still allowing the player to apply their own imagination to the scene. The same can be said for the awe-inspiring story, told through vague images and leaving much to speculation. The story is exciting and engaging, but at the same time seemingly absent. The only clues to what you must do are the occasional vague hints told through images, leaving the player to their own devices. This seemingly utter lack of direction allows the player to make their own story, rather than having it spoon fed to them as so many modern games do. The beauty of this game is how it forces you to make your own choices and theories, not knowing if they are even remotely correct. This amount of freedom is liberating- nothing is given easily to the player, they must earn it through skill and perserverence. That level of satisfaction gained from overcoming an obstacle that this game provides in ample supply is essential to connecting and engaging with the player, and is missing from far too many games. The combat is tough but fair, constantly keeping the player on their toes. Combat is fast paced, yet crisp and responsive, with varied and challenging enemies. The soundtrack is a wonder of audio engineering, with scores ranging from light, enchanting melodies to dark, gritty anthems that set the player on edge. The music completes a rich, ambient overall style with the artwork, a beautiful blend that engrosses and envelops the player. TL:DRThis is a masterpiece of modern game design and it would be a disservice to both yourself and society as a whole to not buy it.Overall rating: 10/10; Pinnacle of modern game design.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a game I'd been excited for for the past couple years now and I'm happy to say it does not disappoint. The visuals are some of the most beautiful I've seen in the pixel art genre, and there are various astonishing sights to see, some of which I would stop to study for a couple minutes. The soundtrack is great too, Disasterpeace does some of the most unique chiptune music I've ever heard.Before playing I was a little worried since a lot of people have been saying the game is too hard and frustrating to be fun, but after playing it through I wholeheartedly disagree. The bosses are very hard, that I wont deny anyone, but I found all of them really engaging and never frustrating, even though I died repeatedly on a few of them. Combat in this game is more about being aware of your surroundings and timing your actions than simply mashing buttons. I'm not against the idea of an easier difficulty setting for people who don't play this type of game often, but the experience of finally getting it down and sticking it to a boss is really satisfying. Some of the game's appeal would be lost without it.I finished the game in about 8 or 9 hours of play time, though I feel like there were a lot of secrets I missed, and there is a new game + mode as well so replay value seems good. Definitely will be playing this more in the future.			"

												Where to even begin....I rarely do product reviews...especially for things I like or cherish because I typically feel like whatever I may type cannot give a just picture of what I experienced. There are parts of this game when the music, visuals and mechanics sync up and manage to pull literally every emotion in the spectrum from you. I have played indie games before, but for me personally, this was my ""Fez"" moment; my 'Bastion"" (and I played/own Bastion!!); the kickstarter I wish I had backed. It had just the right thematic/mechanical elements to keep me hooked deep in. I have read this in reviews below and I completely echo the sentiment: if Zelda: Links Awakening and Darksouls had a sweet, sweet love child while listening to the Tron soundtrack; this be it.Above is a mish mash; an amalgalmation of my euphoria when playing this game. More of that to come. The boss fights are challenging and rewards you (the player) for finding the right combination of moves by getting to witness  the drifter dance to victory; not unlike perfect choreography. The landscape/environs are brooding, surreal and meaty; which is incredible considering the Isometric perspective of the game. The music. The F********* MUSIC!!!! I am literally going to pick up Fez because of the music in this game alone. I found myself purposely dash chaining through sections (especially in the eastern water section) to hear the unique backing tracks SEEMLESSLY blend into eachother. Intro music is easily one of my top ten intro songs. It is a feature light game with single player and co op campaign options ( hooray local coop; I hate online coop and like eating pizza and crushing dirks with my friends IN PERSON) and a new game plus option. Thats it and it makes the game a much more focused experience because of  this fact.I waited for the game to go on sale to pick it up and after my positive experience with Bastion's soundtrack edition,decided to spring for the soundtrack edition for this as well. Easily one of the best bargains/purchases i have ever made. I am completely invested in the indie craze now!!!Brass Tacks:Sound: 10/10Controls: 10/10Story: ?/10*My only small nitpick (F****** microscopic): I wish their would have been more in game cinematics; They were too gorgeous. Since the story is told entirely in cenematics and images (no this is not an unironic statment nor is it a pun on the visual nature of video games). That being said, the story leaves enough breadcrumbs (or images of breadcrumbs) to have many different people draw many different conclusions and craft unique narratives. For me that makes this game EVEN more awesome hence my ""?/10"" for unlimited potential.Replayability: 7/10* This is not bad that I gave it a 7; I like that the game is feature light, I think its a strength in an atmospheric game. When measuring longevity, however, features go a LONG way in shaping that fact. Final verdict: 8.5/10 Would punish that A****le toad boss again. "

The game saves so often I don't think I was never bothered but life does happen so be aware you can't stop playing whenever you want (unless you don't mind replaying a section).- Length: I was only lost once that I can recall and I didn't waste much time dashing around (for a certain achievement) and I beat the game in six hours. I was hoping for an 8-10 hour experience. There is a new game plus and I didn't get all the collectables but for what I'm calling the main game, it was a tad short.Overall Impression- Hyper Light Drifter was worth the 18 USD (sale price). Some of the best boss fights I've played. Great combat. The story presentation being purely visual challenged me to think about the world and what the Drifter's purpose was. Is the game difficult? At times, but you are given all the tools to overcome. Like many of the best indie games, Hyper Light Drifter provides a unique and focused experience you will not get anywhere else.			"

												So this has been often compared to Dark Souls, but I believe a more apt comparison is to older Legend of Zelda games like 'Link to the Past' & such. The game is hard, but not impossible. Death just puts you back at the start of a room. The pixel art is smexy, the music & environments are moody. The gameplay is very fast-paced. With a host of hidden items, costumes & other secrets Hyper Light Drifter is definitely worth $20 (unless 30 fps caps are a deal breaker for you).Edit 10/13/16:The dev has taken the argument for 60 fps to heart & has reprogrammed the game for 60 fps. So things are a bit snapier & more responsive.			"

												Just beat it, and what a joy it was. This game made me feel oddly cozy (amazing sound track), and yet feel like such a badass.It feels a bit like Zelda / metroid / darksouls. Art style is great, combat is smooth. The boss fights can be a bit hard compared to the overworld (West boss was the hardest for me, also my first boss) but not impossible.Well worth it even at full price.side note, if you are getting this for a younger person, there is blood / head chopping / other graphic images that could be too much for some, just something to keep in mind.

												Hyper Light Drifter does not hold your hand, it does not give you thorough tutorials, it does not explain what you're doing and why, and it does not go easy on you. This game may be a response to modern games that are overly expository but offer no challenge. This game is very challenging and offers no explanations. It lets you figure everything out on your own. And by God is it good. The game plays a little bit like a 2D Zelda game. You're given an top-down perspective and need to explore and battle your way through a mysterious world with your sword and other weapons you find along the way. Battles involve dashing, slashing, and shooting enemies. They're fast-paced and satisfying, relying almost entirely on skill. Like Zelda, it also has puzzles and a great deal of exploration. The world is large and mysterious. Secret areas and hidden items are scattered absolutely everywhere and it's fun and always worth it to explore and find them. The visual style is distinctive and striking, yet minimal, relying on neon pixel art. Very few bugs popped up during my playthrough, and the game is constantly receiving updates and fixes. The game isn't particularly long: It's only around 8 hours straight through for a decent player, but the sheer amount of collectibles and secrets make up for that.It's not a perfect game: the story might be too cryptic for its own good. After playing through the whole thing, I'm still not entirely sure what it's about. Its high level of difficulty can occasionally be frustrating, especially in the boss battles, which can be quite hard. This game is also the best argument for octo-gates on a controller I've seen: it's hard to line up dashes perfectly horizontally and vertically, but thankfully the game compensates for that a little.Overall it's a fantastic game. Many indie games on Steam try to bring back the challenge and style of 8 and 16-bit console games, but Hyper Light Drifter succeeds. It's not for everyone, but I would highly recommend it for those looking for an old-school challenge....I just intended to post a quick review to get that Steam badge. How did it get this long?!			"

												a very bothersome cyst in my ear popped when i finally beat the gameThe combat is very inspired and very fast paced, and is quite well executed too. A bit like Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, and although the action/attack choices arent as broad, they never feel tiresome or dry.Exploration was fairly rewarding. This game will suit the completionist or the achievement hunter.The music was good. It goes a little subtle while exploring, then ramps up appropriately with the action. The cutscene tracks were the best, I think.The art was good. Many varying tones and colors on a pixel landscape that made the environment pop without taking focus away from the badass Drifter.The story was captivating enough without taking away from the action, but I don't think the lack of dialogue did it any favors.If you're looking for a challenge, Hyper Light Drifter has got you covered.

												Hyper Light Drifter is a beautiful pixel-art game, with minimalist storytelling, and tight, precise controls.After some short exposition, you are essentially given the freedom to explore the world, and discover things to your leasure. I loved how the various weapon mechanics worked, between the swordplay and gunslinging. The movement also feels very fluid once you get used to the dashing mechanic.All in all, a very solid game, and a great choice for anyone who enjoys a bit of a challenge! "

												Well I stumbled upon this game, when the devs where posting a notice that they'll release this game on the end of march. Intrigued I checked what this game was supposed to be and I was immediately interested. The game industry doesn't have many zelda-esque titles that spice up the game with story, dungeons and compelling boss fights like The Legend of Zelda. Though games that knock on the TLOZ like Dark Souls, Darksiders and Okami are a dime a dozen. So I asked myself will this be another dime. In my opinion it is a worthy game to play looking away from clunkiness and time.The story starts wiith a cutscene that shows a catastrophic event. No further information, but the visual of the cutscene is given and it relies on your speculation what happened ( of course if you weren't spoiled). You are a drifter, who is haunted by mysterious visions, that you cant explain. With no more information you are dropped into the game and through progress you piece the story together.Pros:- interesting pixel art that seems to capture the technological and eery feeling of the world presented in Hyper Light      Drifter.- Exposition of the game world is not presented through speech, but by perception and visuals. More information about the game world is leaked by beating the areas, which for me is an incentive to pursue the story till the end.- hard and challenging bosses, that drop there unique weapon after beating them.-different platforming tools to experiment with and find collectibles.- a fast but hard combat system, that feels rewarding if mastered.-Boss rush modeCons:- The game is short and can be casually beaten in about 6-7 hours.- If you don't use the 60 fps mode of the game, the game may seem sluggish, since in order to master the combat you need to time your inputs.

												I'm not crazy about the sluggish controls, how vulnerable you are at the end of a dash, or how long it takes to recover from a swing. Enemies are brutal, and bosses are rediculously hard. The world is nice, but the story is paper thin, and presented with blocky images. It's not that I don't recommed this game, because I do want to like it. But the difficulty level is frustrating at best, and impossible, requiring absoute precise timing and skill at certain points.I like the graphics. But I must say, I don't really care for the music's ""whiny"" synth sounds. The music is a bit like the old Miramax Minds Eye vids from the 90's. That's not a good thing.So check it out, especially when on sale. But don't expect to beat it in one go. You may even have to give up at some point. Like I did...If you like really hard games, this is for you.			"

												The game suggests that you get a controller.Get a god damned controller. The difficulty is already above average for games of this kind, mostly in a good way. The PC controls do precious little to help this.The cursor blends into the background, which is bad enough. What really throws it off is that the cursor's position also shifts as the camera moves. This means that through scene transitions, camera-shake with certain effects, and any cinematic movement with the camera will require you to manually track where the cursor has moved vs where you left it.The cursor determines where you are aiming and also what direction you dodge in. In a tight situation with alot of chaos on the screen, it is woefully easy to lose track of where you are pointing, which can lead to alot of pointless deaths. It also means that you cannot dodge in one direction while shooting in another, which is not a small limitation given what the challenge demands.Though, the theme and overall execution really carry this through. Especially if it's on sale, pick it up. Even if not, still worth the buy.			"

												Read the full review.  I have a major problem with this game, other than that its excellent and should be played by anyone teen and up.Hyper Light Drifter is an intense, moody, atmospheric adventure game, in the vein of Legend of Zelda.  You are a Drifter, professional adventurerer  and hunter of the world's lost secrets.  You are dying and trying to find a cure.  You set off on a past where other Drifters have failed, stopping the bad guys who have sacked the various cities in the region and activating the cores for some unknown purpose.The production values are excellent.  The music is moody and atmospheric, complementing the beauitful, pixelated world you see.  Combat takes a 21st century spin on 2-d LoZ games.  Your character has a sword button and a dash button, which make up the meat of the intense combat.  Unless LoZ, you get a gun, which you can aim and shoot with the analog stick and trigger.  You can upgrade special abilities only by collecting upgrade tokens.  These tokens are assembled by four pieces, like Heart Containers in LoZ, and unfortunately, some are too well hidden for their own good.  More on that later.There are four ""dungeons,"" which are cities ruined by villainous races.  In these areas, the Drifter must combat large numbers of enemies and work through a wide variety of hazards to activate the keys that unlock the door to the boss.  I find these dungeons unpleasant.  Not because of the enemies, the combat difficulty is perfect.  But because I was always lost.  REALLY LOST.  I recently dug this game out of my backlog to force myself to finish by putting up a Youtube walkthrough and imitating it, frame by frame so that I could find missing keys and upgrades.  The solutions didn't make me feel stupid: they only made me angry.  Critical paths or secrets would be hidden by requiring you to stand on the right tiny square and hit the button, or by going through a hidden path on the walls.  This means for a player to be able to play this right without a guide, they have to spend the whole game hugging every wall and probing every cliff for an invisible secret.But if Youtube is what it takes for you to finish the game, by all means, do it.  The game is still a wondeful experience.  Just be cognizant of when you are frustrated and be prepared to pull Youtube out.+ Phenomenal production value and atmostphere+ Intense combat that puts Legend of Zelda to shame- I had to stand THERE?  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?!			"

												Just Nominated this game for the Test of Time award. I believe that this was the best game of the year and should be an instant classic right along side Mario or Legend of Zelda. A silent story that has more going for it due tone it sets up. I just love this game. I cant wait for any DLC they might do or dont. Either way it is a game I will be coming back to again and again.

												Truly something special. Feels like A Link to the Past's combat with Dark Souls' atmosphere of oppression and being stuck in a dying world that hates you. Completely dialogue free storytelling at it's absolute finest.My only criticism is that the dash challenge is sadistic. Can highly recommend.			"

												Read the full review.  I have a major problem with this game, other than that its excellent and should be played by anyone teen and up.Hyper Light Drifter is an intense, moody, atmospheric adventure game, in the vein of Legend of Zelda.  You are a Drifter, professional adventurerer  and hunter of the world's lost secrets.  You are dying and trying to find a cure.  You set off on a past where other Drifters have failed, stopping the bad guys who have sacked the various cities in the region and activating the cores for some unknown purpose.The production values are excellent.  The music is moody and atmospheric, complementing the beauitful, pixelated world you see.  Combat takes a 21st century spin on 2-d LoZ games.  Your character has a sword button and a dash button, which make up the meat of the intense combat.  Unless LoZ, you get a gun, which you can aim and shoot with the analog stick and trigger.  You can upgrade special abilities only by collecting upgrade tokens.  These tokens are assembled by four pieces, like Heart Containers in LoZ, and unfortunately, some are too well hidden for their own good.  More on that later.There are four ""dungeons,"" which are cities ruined by villainous races.  In these areas, the Drifter must combat large numbers of enemies and work through a wide variety of hazards to activate the keys that unlock the door to the boss.  I find these dungeons unpleasant.  Not because of the enemies, the combat difficulty is perfect.  But because I was always lost.  REALLY LOST.  I recently dug this game out of my backlog to force myself to finish by putting up a Youtube walkthrough and imitating it, frame by frame so that I could find missing keys and upgrades.  The solutions didn't make me feel stupid: they only made me angry.  Critical paths or secrets would be hidden by requiring you to stand on the right tiny square and hit the button, or by going through a hidden path on the walls.  This means for a player to be able to play this right without a guide, they have to spend the whole game hugging every wall and probing every cliff for an invisible secret.But if Youtube is what it takes for you to finish the game, by all means, do it.  The game is still a wondeful experience.  Just be cognizant of when you are frustrated and be prepared to pull Youtube out.+ Phenomenal production value and atmostphere+ Intense combat that puts Legend of Zelda to shame- I had to stand THERE?  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?!			"

												The game suggests that you get a controller.Get a god damned controller. The difficulty is already above average for games of this kind, mostly in a good way. The PC controls do precious little to help this.The cursor blends into the background, which is bad enough. What really throws it off is that the cursor's position also shifts as the camera moves. This means that through scene transitions, camera-shake with certain effects, and any cinematic movement with the camera will require you to manually track where the cursor has moved vs where you left it.The cursor determines where you are aiming and also what direction you dodge in. In a tight situation with alot of chaos on the screen, it is woefully easy to lose track of where you are pointing, which can lead to alot of pointless deaths. It also means that you cannot dodge in one direction while shooting in another, which is not a small limitation given what the challenge demands.Though, the theme and overall execution really carry this through. Especially if it's on sale, pick it up. Even if not, still worth the buy.			"

												I have only been playing this game for a couple hours, and I'm absolutely entranced by the art style and design. The pixel art is absolutely beautiful and you honestly should buy it just for that. Furthermore, the soundtrack is very nice and relaxing and honestly is probably one of the best I've heard in any game. The gameplay is difficult. I've never played Dark Souls, but the way that I hear about Dark Souls sounds like my impression of the combat in this game: absolutely unforgiving. You have 5 health, that is all. Attacks do 1-2 points of damage depending on the enemy--though any that do two points of damage instead of just one tend to be pretty difficult to somehow get hit by. It's a lot of twitch reaction stuff, essentially watching every enemy around you trying to figure out what they might do next. Once they add enemies that have actual ranged attacks (aka they have a gun, too), the game becomes significantly more difficult. The save points are often but are sometimes quite brutal if you're having issues with a room, you clear it, and then die in the next part, it is very likely that you will have to redo the room you were struggling with since the game decides seemingly randomly sometimes when to save the game. I am barely even in the beginning of the game, and I can't imagine how much more interesting the game will become. I do find the non-verbal narrative charming, but can't help but wonder what is going on sometimes (compare to a particularly confusing panel of a manga with no text to help; sort of just staring trying to figure out what the pictures might mean). I'm sure that if something were really that confusing I could find an interpretation of the story online somewhere, but that would ruin the fun of the game. :)			"

Product received for free
												I got this game as a birthday gift. These are my FIRST IMPRESSIONS of playing the game a few minutes (I might update it when I finish the game).- The graphics are just lovely and the music is too.- At first it was very confusing for me to know where to go or what to do next but, since I'm a persistent person and wouldn't give up exploring and clicking everything, things started getting a bit more intuitive after a while.- I have attention deficit and the color scheme for this game doesn't seem to be helping. I get stuck a lot, not knowing which path to take and I can't quite realize where the map ends, thus ending up falling down and taking damage from it quite frequently. I guess my brain will need a bit more time to adjust, but that's me.- I really like the jump ability. Not only it allows you to jump a significant distance, but it is also quite useful to evade long range mob attacks during combat.- I quite like the combat system. Most pixel RPGs have a turn based combat system. That is not the case with this game. The character moves effortlessly in a very fluid way. It reminds me of a pixel version of an mmorpg combat system. I just love it.- I also like the ""bullets"" and the healing system. Make me feel like I have self sustain, even though I still die quite easily to the mobs xD- The way you go up and down the walls is also pretty cool. The teleport system across the map is nice too.- I just got to the first town and interacted with the NPCs in the shops. That was very confusing for me. The whole thing is images only and I'm used to text with dialogs and explanations. I didn't quite get that system yet (what the NPCs want and how I'm supposed to interact with them), but I'm sure I'll get used to that too.- At first I wasn't sure about the auto-save feature. Personally, I prefer games where I can control my saves. But this feature saves frequently enough, so it's actually a good thing. I can just explor the map and enjoy the game and not have to worry about saving.			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. I'd been itching to play an RPG-kinda game, and this definitely delivered. One of my top ten games, easily. A little walky, and story driven, but the fighting mechanics are good and the fact that you can understand what's going on without reading anything within the story is awesome.			"

												Will update review later, but so far this game's really good. The soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay are all great. I like the focus on getting straight to the meat of the game, rather than starting things off as slowly as most current-gen games do. There's absolutely no handholding here.Gameplay is like Dark Souls meets 2D Zelda or something like that. You hit the enemies, and you dodge their attacks. Game is brutal in terms of difficulty too. I love it.And the game has support for PS4 controllers. Not many other games can say they have native PS4 controller support.			"

Without anything approaching a word being uttered, just the sublime soundtrack and astounding pixel art, I felt more of a connection to the Drifter than to many other characters in books, films and videogames. And the game just kept delivering.For anyone that complains about the story being too vague, I feel that this simply isn't the case. HLD does a good job at world-building, and the little animations and 'text-boxes' that you see when interacting with NPCs highlight how the world is calm in the city-hub, but outside it there are all sorts of dangers. All the gameplay elements are on-point. Combat feels satisfying and rewarding, suitably Souls-esque with Zelda thrown in for good measure.Admittedly, I did get stuck at some points in the game, but a quick glance at a walkthrough will set you on the right path.All in all, Hyper Light Drifter is a thought-provoking, satisfying, mesmerising powerhouse of a game that I cannot recommend highly enough.

												An amazing game, beautifully done. Gameplay is hard but rewarding when you start to get into it. Story is down to your own interpretation, this may be a plus or a negative depending on your point of view. If you've got the cash, send some money the developer's way by buying the game.My only regret is that it isn't longer. I encourage multiple playthroughs.			"

												I absolutely recommend this game. I'd been itching to play an RPG-kinda game, and this definitely delivered. One of my top ten games, easily. A little walky, and story driven, but the fighting mechanics are good and the fact that you can understand what's going on without reading anything within the story is awesome.			"

												a very bothersome cyst in my ear popped when i finally beat the gameThe combat is very inspired and very fast paced, and is quite well executed too. A bit like Dark Souls in terms of difficulty, and although the action/attack choices arent as broad, they never feel tiresome or dry.Exploration was fairly rewarding. This game will suit the completionist or the achievement hunter.The music was good. It goes a little subtle while exploring, then ramps up appropriately with the action. The cutscene tracks were the best, I think.The art was good. Many varying tones and colors on a pixel landscape that made the environment pop without taking focus away from the badass Drifter.The story was captivating enough without taking away from the action, but I don't think the lack of dialogue did it any favors.If you're looking for a challenge, Hyper Light Drifter has got you covered.

												Well I stumbled upon this game, when the devs where posting a notice that they'll release this game on the end of march. Intrigued I checked what this game was supposed to be and I was immediately interested. The game industry doesn't have many zelda-esque titles that spice up the game with story, dungeons and compelling boss fights like The Legend of Zelda. Though games that knock on the TLOZ like Dark Souls, Darksiders and Okami are a dime a dozen. So I asked myself will this be another dime. In my opinion it is a worthy game to play looking away from clunkiness and time.The story starts wiith a cutscene that shows a catastrophic event. No further information, but the visual of the cutscene is given and it relies on your speculation what happened ( of course if you weren't spoiled). You are a drifter, who is haunted by mysterious visions, that you cant explain. With no more information you are dropped into the game and through progress you piece the story together.Pros:- interesting pixel art that seems to capture the technological and eery feeling of the world presented in Hyper Light      Drifter.- Exposition of the game world is not presented through speech, but by perception and visuals. More information about the game world is leaked by beating the areas, which for me is an incentive to pursue the story till the end.- hard and challenging bosses, that drop there unique weapon after beating them.-different platforming tools to experiment with and find collectibles.- a fast but hard combat system, that feels rewarding if mastered.-Boss rush modeCons:- The game is short and can be casually beaten in about 6-7 hours.- If you don't use the 60 fps mode of the game, the game may seem sluggish, since in order to master the combat you need to time your inputs.

												Hyper Light Drifter does not hold your hand, it does not give you thorough tutorials, it does not explain what you're doing and why, and it does not go easy on you. This game may be a response to modern games that are overly expository but offer no challenge. This game is very challenging and offers no explanations. It lets you figure everything out on your own. And by God is it good. The game plays a little bit like a 2D Zelda game. You're given an top-down perspective and need to explore and battle your way through a mysterious world with your sword and other weapons you find along the way. Battles involve dashing, slashing, and shooting enemies. They're fast-paced and satisfying, relying almost entirely on skill. Like Zelda, it also has puzzles and a great deal of exploration. The world is large and mysterious. Secret areas and hidden items are scattered absolutely everywhere and it's fun and always worth it to explore and find them. The visual style is distinctive and striking, yet minimal, relying on neon pixel art. Very few bugs popped up during my playthrough, and the game is constantly receiving updates and fixes. The game isn't particularly long: It's only around 8 hours straight through for a decent player, but the sheer amount of collectibles and secrets make up for that.It's not a perfect game: the story might be too cryptic for its own good. After playing through the whole thing, I'm still not entirely sure what it's about. Its high level of difficulty can occasionally be frustrating, especially in the boss battles, which can be quite hard. This game is also the best argument for octo-gates on a controller I've seen: it's hard to line up dashes perfectly horizontally and vertically, but thankfully the game compensates for that a little.Overall it's a fantastic game. Many indie games on Steam try to bring back the challenge and style of 8 and 16-bit console games, but Hyper Light Drifter succeeds. It's not for everyone, but I would highly recommend it for those looking for an old-school challenge....I just intended to post a quick review to get that Steam badge. How did it get this long?!			"

												After completing the Northern area and dying like 30 times by dashing off the sides too often. It's a very fast paced game totally worth the $15 I'd even pay $30 for it. Infact I did picked up 2 copies one to share with a buddy who's into 16bit games. The music is great and I'm really happy that Heart Machine took their time to finish their game. The game doesn't hold your hand you'll learn all you need over time even how to get upgrade points for your sword and gun everything just falls into place. I've waited since their kickstarter appeared and the wait has been totally worth it. For those of us who love to find everything there is a lot of little secrets all over the place well hidden paths. The game handles pretty well on keyboard and mouse though I'd personally recommend a gamepad.			"

												It'll say 0 hours played because I downloaded it off steam first. Still I'm gonna keep this short and simple.Good Things:It's a beautiful game- the controls are tight (although getting used to the dash always going to the mouse and not the direction your pushing is a bit akward at first) and combat is challenging, rewarding smart choices and punishing key spamming rather harshly. Storywise its sort of like a wordless wonder, you have to figure a lot out on your own and game awards you for exploration. You can head to any zone you want at the start of the game (in fact exploring all the zones before doing bosses is probably a really good idea.)Bad Things:The respawn animiation is agonzingly slow- you'll die quite a bit in this game and this becomes more tedious then I like to admit but that isn't the real issue. While respawning you are not immune to damage, so if you happened to be a 1 health prior to dying and respawn near an enemy that enemy will repeated kill you before the animation is complete preventing you from playing - literally locking down your save file and forcing you to start over. So far I've only had this happen once and I pray it never happens again. Aiming with the pistol also seems really wonky- this maybe intentionall but when your ammo is limited and your shots don't go exactly where your aiming it can be a bit frustrating.Assuming this (VERY PAINFUL) bug gets fixed I'm really enjoying this game.Hint: Best way to avoid the bug is after Gauntlets (you get locked in a room with enemies and have to kill them all) always heal if you have less then 3 health, that way the respawn animation will have time to end before whatever little bugger kills you hopefully.

												This game is beautiful, seriously, this is some of the best pixal art I've ever seen. The soundtrack and atmosphere are unbelievable and the world is an all around joy to explore. Be warned though, this game is hard and vague on what you're supposed to do. I enjoy this form of storytelling , it's somewhat similar to DS, just don't expect a gripping story.			"

												Really loving this game so far. The controls are tight and easy to learn. The story isn't forced down your throat, and neither is how to play. If you are naturally curious you'll figure out just about how everything works in the first couple hours. I'm really enjoying the art style of the game, and the soundtrack more than I expected too. It also has really good conveyance,  so even though it doesn't tell you how to do or where to go, you get to figure it out in a way that makes you feel satisfied, but not wandering around thinking ""where do I go... whata I do...."" Very well designed and enjoyable.			"

												Great game, very original and refreshing; it's hard to compare to anything but for me, it has a Legend of Zelda vibe to it, especially A Link to the Past.It's not possible to fully advance into the game without exploring A LOT. You'll hug walls, cliffs, edges, trees, everything. If this is something that does not interest you, you might find the game tedious in the long run without a walkthrough. I'm trying to find everything I need to get (I think) the best ending and without any guide, it's becoming quite a chore because there are little to no indications.Combat is visceral, fast-paced and when you use all of your arsenal, you get pretty powerful. It's not perfect, but it's unique and satisfying. You can unlock a couple new moves and ranged weapons that helps a lot.  Some people have been mentioning the difficulty, but I haven't run into any difficulty wall, most bosses were one-shot except a few that killed me once or twice. Even if it did go well for me, it is probably the hardest game I've played of this genre if you compare it to Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Soul Blazer, Terranigma, etc.The story is not told with words. When you talk with NPCs, they respond with sounds (the non-important NPCs) or images (those ones explain what happened/is happening in the world). Though I have not experienced the ending yet, I'm hooked. The emphazise on exploration really makes you observe the world with all of its details and that's how the story/universe of Hyper Light Drifter unraveled for me. Your character also goes through a lot of mini-cutscenes as you progress which kept me captivated. The whole setting is kind of mysterious.I'm 9 hours into the game and I've killed the last boss. I'm exploring the maps to find everything I'm missing to see if the ending change. I haven't tried new game + yet. Expect 8-10 hours of story on your first playthrough. There's a hidden gauntlet/monster arena to complete and a lot of collectables that I have no idea what they unlock yet, it's exciting. If you're in for achievement/trophies, there's one that requires you to not die at all during a playthrough. That's plenty of hours, I'm sure.TL/DR fast-paced and moderately difficult action/adventure/RPG with minimal rpg elements (unlock a few abilities and such through the collection of tokens), heavy exploration, lot of collecting to do, great pacing and memorable world/ambiance. Just get the damn game.			"

												TLDRGood -Art Style - Visuals are excellentUnique Setting - Alien WorldCombat - Could be Improved but SatisfiyingAc/Dc -Dialouge - There isn't any...so no Planescape Torment here you can take it or leave itSound - Effective EnoughDifficulty - Somewhat Tough - Pattern Learning Required to Beat BossesInstructions - MinimualBad -Exploration is really just a Pixel Hunt for the same two treasures screen after screenRepetitive and overlong at certain pointsLack of a concise storyMy Verdict?Very.....Okay. Reminds me of Axiom Verge and Zelda.Which is good in certain aspects such as excellent retro style art (not just pixel graphics) and it's adherence to theme throughout the expierence. The visuals are really a shining point for this game.However like Axiom Verge this title suffers from some retro game problems that have no place in modern games. I found the exploration portion of the game (it's a substantial part...like most of it) grew tedious as you pixel hunt each area trying to find extra loot hidden all over the level. The loot itself seems to be either health refills or coinage...and that's it. I mean if I'm searching for something and I stumble upon a seceret it would be nice to have some mystery as to what I was going to find there but some of you may enjoy getting the same christmas presents year after year. The combat style is sort of a mish-mash of button mashing and screen dashing that comes off okay. It could defintely be smoother but if you are technically precise and know what you are doing you will be successful. That's easier said than done as mob rushes are common and can be overwhelming.  The fact that you just start over at the begining of the screen is an old and tired mechnic that winds up having the effect of not caring one bit if I roll off a cliff or get KO'ed right before I kill the last bad man on screen.If your looking to scratch your Zelda itch and enjoy the aesthics of video games this a pretty solid title. I would say it needs some serious revamping to elevate itself up to Titan Souls or Shovel Knight territory.6/10 --- Solid Fun mixed with some tedious searching sets this as a slightly above average title in my book. While the price might be a bit too high for the gameplay itself the unique setting and visuals makes up for a bit.			"

												Phemomenal gameIt stutters a bit but thats on my end, not the games, (HP Laptops amiright)Gameplay is smoothDialoge is great ChallengingBeautiful visualsAs in other reviews, this game does not hold your hand. When you drop your guard you will die, well loose 2 health but in a game where health packs aren't falling from the sky, each tick of health is valuable. Dashing wiill save your skin, but can also lead you to death. Sword & gun combo is nice, although you regen ammo from slashing enemies down, they will disappear quickly. Acquiring upgrades takes time and exploration. and when you do get a chance to acquire an upgrade choose wisely.The music adds to it all, Ominous and eerie, it adds to apocalyptic setting, Dilapidated buildings surround you as you explore to find the ""shards"". Enemies lie waiting for you at the top  of the crumbling staircases within the moss/vine covered ruins, snowy peaks, and in the depths below.This game has me hoooked. ill be spending much more time in it, most of which will be trial and error deaths and doing the same things contiually,			"

												I don't really write reviews often.. blah blah, you all know the rest.I'm going to be quick and honest with this, the game is nowhere near being for everyone. If you're into actually having to think before each fight and adapt during them, then just go and buy the damn game already, you'll most likely enjoy it. Now if you're the kind of filthy casul who will most often get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with the game for dying repeatedly (and there's nothing wrong with that.), then the game is probably not for you.Also, don't expect to buy the game and immerse yourself into some extraordinarily deep story, since you'll probably understand almost nothing on your first playthrough.

												This game is absolutely incredible. The combination of a beautiful landscape, secret pathways hidden literally EVERYWHERE, and challenging bosses that sometimes border on absurd is a great mix. The ""story"" so to speak is very linear, and to be honest, hard to understand due to the lack of any actual text in game. But this doesn't detract from the game. If anything, it adds to it, because rather than being invested in certain characters and hoping for certain outcomes, it just becomes an endless battle for survival. This game requires good timing, you must learn the enemies attack patterns, and develop your own methods for dodging/ignoring them.That being said, I have one MAJOR complaint, and it relates to the final boss. One of the bosses attacks shoots out from the front of their face, and can literally one shot you if you are in the center of it. But that's not the issue. The issue with this attack is that if you are standing directly behind the boss, which is the ideal place (pretty much the ONLY place) to deal damage during this move, the attack can still hit you, ending what would have otherwise been a perfect attempt at it. Considering that during this attack is the only time you can deal 6 damage to the boss from melee range in one go, this seems like a large issue, as I have had many attempts where I got the boss below 6 health, only to die while standing completely on the opposite side of the boss when it attacks.

												I'm a backer, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, if you must.If you are a super busy person, here's the short of it.Reviewer quip: It's like if Shadow of the Colossus went through a pixelated, neon filter and came out on the other side as a Zelda game with an actual combat system.Pros:- Artwork is absolutely fantastic.- Story is conveyed with no dialog. Increases the myth of the world around you.- Combat is difficult, yet so satisfying once mastered.- Go into any area at your own will. Every area is accessible from the start.- Music adds a layer of atmosphere to each pixelated landscape.- UPDATE: 60 FPS makes this game's art and animation shine through.- UPDATE: Co-op mode is a neat little thing.Cons:- Locked at 30 FPS. No gameplay hindrance, but still significant IMO.- Controller issues at launch. (My PS4 controller works now, but do some research if not using a DS4)- The game is difficult. A few players probably won't finish the game because of this.- UPDATE: No online support for co-op.Pros:I backed this game several years ago, and it is beautiful to see this artwork come to life. The environments, the characters, the frames for the cutscenes are all fantastic. In my opinion, this is one of the best examples of pixel-art that I've seen in years. The closest thing I could compare it to is FEZ, both in style and quality. And that is some pretty high praise. The environments and the character designs do so much for this game. You get this sense of history from all of these gigantic shells scattered across (or a part of) the land. The narrative is told entirely without dialog. All relevant information is conveyed through stills, cutscenes, and the environments from before. I have not been this intrigued simply by the land and architecture of a video game since I played Shadow of the Colossus on the ol' PS2.I can see the combat in this game being divisive, but I believe it for the wrong reasons. YES, this game is DIFFICULT..... when you begin. I think, if you have played any game before with a rather unforgiving combat system (Dark Souls, Devil May Cry, etc...), you will get the hang of it by the time you beat the first boss (which you can do in any order!!). I was absolutely destroyed in EVERY encounter I got into when the game started. And, I'll admit, the thought went through my mind: ""Am I bad at this game, or is the game simply unfair?"" After a while, I learned to dodge more than I attack, prioritize certain enemies, and heal in appropriate situations. All of a sudden, the game clicked. My combat wasn't perfect, and I definitely still died a handful of times up to the end, but it is manageable if you give it a chance. And nothing beats that sense of accomplishment after clearing a room full of enemies and your characters slams his sword into the floor.The music is definitely good, the moody synths fit whichever environment you are in, but I can't say a single track ""stood out."" Then again, I don't think that's necessarily the point. The point of the music in this game is to simply add some atmosphere to wherever you are or whatever you are doing. It definitely succeeds in that area.Cons:The big debate at the moment seems to be with the developers' choice to lock the game at 30fps. Personally, I did look for the option to make that switch when I started playing, only to be surprised that there were only two options for the display: Windowed or Fullscreen. No option to change between 30, 60, or even higher FPS. I was slightly disappointed, because I feel like the artwork in this game would have flourished running at 60 FPS, but nonetheless, life goes on. Despite what you may read in other reviews, this does not make the game unplayable and you won't be throwing up out of your eyeballs because the option does not exist. I and plenty of other people have beaten the game at 30 FPS, and you should be able to as well. No longer an issue. Developer has updated the game to allow 60 FPS.Another issue I had was setting up a controller. The issue seems to be fixed now for PS4 controllers (I used a PS4 controller to play through this game in its entirety), but I cannot speak for the XBOX game pad.All in all, this is a solid game, one of my favorites I've played in a while. While I'm just one out of thousands, I feel great knowing that I helped these people achieve their goal and helped bring their project to life. That may affect my opinion of this, but I feel pretty confident that I would have my eye on this release, regardless of my backer status. The art is too good, the combat too sweet, and the world they have built is just so interesting.			"

												Have been looking forward to this quite some time, unfortunately it didn't blow my mind like I hoped it would. Gorgeous and fun little game though.Hoped this to be much larger and more complex. Like those early Nintendo action adventures with lots of different weapons and spells and whatnot. Devs seem to have aimed for some focused retro clone (which they definitely delivered on).If you are frustrated by the game's difficulty, you might try some upgrading first. After that the difficulty is just about right.+World. Swords, blasters, neon lit ruins. Sweet science/fantasy juice with some nice 70s flavour.+Pacing. Moments of calm bliss sliced by lightspeed conflict, everything spiced with some satisfying hunt for secrets.-Protagonist. Most NPCs look way cooler than me.-Size. Like fine cuisine there just isn't enough to fill an honest stomach.			"

												In lieu of a longer review, some quick combat tips:Healing takes time. Not a lot, but enough to get killed if you're careless.You can quick-fire your gun in the direction you're facing without aiming. This works better with some guns than others. Ranged enemies tend to fire a bit behind you, while melee enemies track your position more precisely.Make good use of save spots and health packs. Don't be afraid to repeat a room if you think you can do it better.The game has a lot of Metroid-like secret rooms. Hug walls and warp off the beaten path to get more upgrades. You can upgrade the sword to reflect projectiles. This is even better than it sounds.  Many find East the easiest way to start. Some of the rooms are pretty hard, but the boss is less difficult than the other three and you get the shotgun right after, which is a game-changer.  "

Gorgeous art, excellent gameplay mechanics, well done level design, and a fantastic soundtrack to bring it all together. One of those I had to come home and hop right back in. Even a decent amount of collectibles and unlockables to occupy the completionist in me. Wish I had picked this game up sooner.Looking forward to the first NG+ run!			"

												Been waiting for this for quite a while. I love the difficulty, it is never unfair, and always seems to rely on your skill as a player, this forces you to learn the game and it's nuances.The game isn't perfect, I've noticed some slow down issues but it was honestly never enough to distract me from the battle at hand. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a solid casual play.			"

												This is a beautiful game, both in its art and design.  Music and sound design is exceptional as well. Pros ------------- Only one difficulty level.  I like it when a game designer knows exactly how hard they want their game to be. No text in the game.  The story and ""quest"" are told through pictures.  Once in the game, you navigate the menu exclusively through pictograms. Controls feel very good.  I played on a PS4 controller. You can beat the game without upgrading or finding a single new piece of gear or new weapon.  They start you with everything you need and everything else you find is just a bonus. Cons ------------- Game is short.  I beat it in about 15 hours.  I spent a few hours in NG+ before moving on. There are really no ""puzzles"".  You pretty much just have to find keys to doors.  I was expecting, and would have appreciated some Zelda-esque puzzles. Final boss is a little too easy.Overall though, fantastic and absolutely worth the $20.			"

												Hyper Light Drifter is a very nice beautiful and somewhat challenging hack n slash pixelart game with sooooo much thrown away potential .... don't get me wrong the game is very good but it could be better!like for example you see those giants in the opening scene though your playthrough you see some dead bodys of them but you sadly never get to fight one ;(the game is quite short within 7 - 10 hours of  gameplay and exploration i found many secrets but not all some are well hidden but some are just too obvious!as mentioned early the game is ""somewhat"" challenging the combat is quite punishing but with a bit experience you can get out of the battle alive easythe upgrades you get are nice to have but some seem to overpowered (yes i mean the dash that absorbs bullets)the enemys are different from every of the four ""stages"" from frog ninjas to bird mages OVERALL: a very nice game with too little content i'd love to see more of it in a sequel or something .... if you like hack n slay get it but if you think 7 - 10 hours of gaming is too little for 20€ get it in a sale			"

												TLDR:bad: 6 hours to beat the game.good: fun 6 hoursIt's simply a fun game you zip around slashing and shooting enemies without any dialogue.The game excels with is music and art making otherwise boring scenes of walking through empty rooms an enjoyable experience.The combat is a skill to learn for sure which makes beating bosses and multiple enemy encounters feel rewarding.I'd like to see weapon and armor upgrades/more character building into more difficult encounters. More content. I beat the game in 6 hours with a lot of running around looking for the last triangle I couldn't find.My main complaint is the searching. If the game didn't have fantastic art and music, spending thirty minutes searching the edges of all the maps would have made me put this game down.			"

												Great game though frustrating at times. Amazing pixel art that lets you forgive it when it betrays you by hiding ledges that are invisible because of the 2D perspective. The sound track is simple but resonates perfectly with the rest of the game.The combat is very satisfying but it expects precise input which can be frustrating against some of the bosses since you can't take many hits. The battles with the smaller enemies are where it shines as you dash in between enemies and projectiles to drive home killing blows.			"

Not for the impatient, but utterly beautiful nonethelessI am, due to current financial constraints, not accustomed to buying games outright, especially not at full price. But I had anticipated Hyper Light Drifter for a few months simply going off the trailer, and incredibly, it actually fully held up to my internal hype. The world is absolutely gorgeous, from the central hub to the various worlds to the north, east, etc. Each area has something unique to offer visually and strategically, and while it can be fairly linear in it's pathing to objectives, it also rewards the player that decides to explore, and solve the various puzzles hidden throughout the levels. As for the combat, I'd liken it to that of Bloodborne, oddly enough. You will come to areas where there are several enemies, all of which are stronger than you, and your only advantage over them is their specific attack pattern that you need to learn and counter. You will die. A lot. But as you progress, you will unlock new abilities and hone your reflexes, to the point where things that seemed impossible will be laughable. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ is it ever satisfying when you finally clear an area you've been working on for the better part of an hour. In conclusion, if you like beautiful, meticulously designed worlds with a diverse array of enemies and plenty of hidden passages to explore, you'll love Hyper Light Drifter. Personally, it was worth every penny.			"

												Really Really Really Awesome game.I've felt that this game is kind of a hack'n'slash but retro style in some way(As i've played only 2 hours to make this review, my analysis can change)This is the kind of game that make you feel that you are playing a 2d old game (in a good way) it has an awesome gameplay,if you enjoy exploring hidden areas in games and to discover all alone by yourself without any help from the game then this is the game for you.Pros:* Simple UI* Simple Gameplay (but awesome)* Awesome artwork and animations (yes it was all created manually by hand)* You need to play in order to figure out the story, nothing is really told to you (some npcs show you images of what happend to them)* There are some upgrades which you can make to the character (such as gun improvements, bombs, new guns, new jumps, and many more.)* The bosses make you feel like you are playing some true retro game, because they have kind of special movements and they are not easy to beat (i've battled a big frog and for just 1 point of life i've won)* Soundtrack very simple but it fits the style very well* Sound effects are awesome everything you do have a special different sound effect that when you hear it you will sense what you are doing* It doesnt make you addicted to play more and more which is the profile of game that i am always looking for* It has a co-op option which i didn't tested but i think it would make my experience even better with a friend (which i dont have :V )* It has some kind of puzzles inside the game and hidden items in hidden areas which make your experience even better* The game has a fast travel featureCons:* Sometimes the game gets boring for me (this is a personal question, you can feel different about it, it must be the soundtrack i think)* You don't have a tutorial about the UI, although that it is very simple to understand* The objectives are stated on the map but you don't know exactly what you are looking for, so when you are new to this game you will feel lost sometimes( I dont know if i can state any other thing which i didn't liked, i think this game don't have bad features )My actual note for this game is: 8 / 10			"

												That feeling when beating some kid in a football minigame is more difficult than destroying the eldritch nightmares that haunt every second of your waking existence...Bloody hell the football minigame and the hyper-dash-challenge-thing are massive difficulty spikes.

												So I almost never write reviews for games, but this game is something different.At first, after reading some reviews, I thought that it might be too difficult. It was. After dying at least 100 if not more times I had finally finished the game and it was so worth it. If you think that this game isn't for you because you hear its difficult, get it anyways. The feeling of defeating a boss or just even clearing some of the areas before the boss fight is so rewarding. All in all, this game, coupled with beautiful pixelated scenery, an amazing soundtrack, and challenging yet rewarding gameplay makes Hyper Light Drifter easily one of the best games I've played in a long time.

												Hyper Light Drifter is an amazing game that I would recommend to any ""Find all the secrets"" gamer. There are tons of secret areas and rooms that you need to find to get to unlock upgrades (otherwise you would have a lot of difficulty fighting the bosses). The difficulty bar is set at a moderate height, the game's difficulty is hard enough, but the game itself is generous as it gives you everything you need to not die. The multiple deaths on boss fights can get frustrating, but it doesn't take awy from the game. As for the story, it's only really explained with pictures, which is okay for me, and is quite original. The game doesn't guide you, so you have to figure out a lot of things on your own. I love the pixel art style and soundtrack. It's definitely worth a try, and without question a game to have had the priviledge of playing. I rate HLD solid 9/11			"

												Note:  I have not played this with a keyboard and mouse.  Runs REALLY well on a 360 Controller.I really like this game.  It's been a long time since I ran into a game that grabbed me like this one has.  The entire overworld is super mysterious.  Combat is fast, tight and challenging.  The gameplay deftly balances exploration and combat.  The game reminds me of Ys and Dark Souls and has difficulty to match.  It has that 'HARD but fair' balance that keeps you coming back for one more try and once you finish that section or finally kill that boss, success is sweet.  Really satisfying.  Rounding out the package is the art and music.  Both of which ooze style and atmosphere.  The backgrounds and environments that you traverse are gorgeous.  Not much else to say really.  TLDR: Looks great, sounds great, plays awesome.  Buy the game already.			"

												9 / 10A truly deserved rating, this game is the destination in storytelling that so many other indie games have tried and failed to reach. With a fantastic and creative world to explore, difficult to master mechanics and an immersive soundscape, Hyper Light Drifter left me wanting more, but more than satisfied with what I got. Its cryptic hints at a background story and its beautiful art whet my appetite in a way no game has since The Legend of Zelda. A series based on this game could have the potential to become a major hit in the indie gaming world, and far beyond.We can only hope for a sequel.			"

The game doesn't guide you, so you have to figure out a lot of things on your own. I love the pixel art style and soundtrack. It's definitely worth a try, and without question a game to have had the priviledge of playing. I rate HLD solid 9/11			"

												Note:  I have not played this with a keyboard and mouse.  Runs REALLY well on a 360 Controller.I really like this game.  It's been a long time since I ran into a game that grabbed me like this one has.  The entire overworld is super mysterious.  Combat is fast, tight and challenging.  The gameplay deftly balances exploration and combat.  The game reminds me of Ys and Dark Souls and has difficulty to match.  It has that 'HARD but fair' balance that keeps you coming back for one more try and once you finish that section or finally kill that boss, success is sweet.  Really satisfying.  Rounding out the package is the art and music.  Both of which ooze style and atmosphere.  The backgrounds and environments that you traverse are gorgeous.  Not much else to say really.  TLDR: Looks great, sounds great, plays awesome.  Buy the game already.			"

												This game is absolutely astonishing.The graphic is stunning, really the best pixel art along with superborthers in the entire gaming industry in my opinion.The gameplay is a brick ton of fun: combine a zelda with the fast-action placed combat of a bloodborne. Simple in the appereance but very deep in actual gameplay, and really challenging. No explanation is giving to the players, the game does not hold you by hand but instead it says: ""yeah A is for this, B is for that, now go and play by yourself"", and is is effing awesom. There are elements from a megaman, zelda, really big focus on exploration rewarded not only by armors (with different effects), ""exp"", secret areas, monolith, but also with georgious place and details. You could finish the game pretty quickly (there is a new game plus with new features) but if you are the type of gamer that reserch every collectables and go for the 100% then you could easily reach the 10+ hours. Without a proper guide the game really incorage you to -think- on finding secret areas and keys.Really a must buy. Thanks to Alex Preston and his team to make this type of game in 2016, a time when games like this is more than ever needed.			"

The gameplay is something most hack and slash games desire. It is tough which makes you try and try again, learn your weaknesses and learn your enemies.

												TLDR:bad: 6 hours to beat the game.good: fun 6 hoursIt's simply a fun game you zip around slashing and shooting enemies without any dialogue.The game excels with is music and art making otherwise boring scenes of walking through empty rooms an enjoyable experience.The combat is a skill to learn for sure which makes beating bosses and multiple enemy encounters feel rewarding.I'd like to see weapon and armor upgrades/more character building into more difficult encounters. More content. I beat the game in 6 hours with a lot of running around looking for the last triangle I couldn't find.My main complaint is the searching. If the game didn't have fantastic art and music, spending thirty minutes searching the edges of all the maps would have made me put this game down.			"

												A terribly good game, IF you like a challenge.Sometimes pixel graphics are labeled as ""retro"", but the style of Hyper Light Drifter is infact modern, unique and will probably be stuck in your head just as you may have experienced with games from 20 years ago. I stopped playing anything else after I started playing this game. I died a lot, i learned, i started dying less and finally beat the game after some 15 hours. What really struck me was the wonderful storytelling. Hyper Light Drifter doesn't need to provide you a single text in a language you do understand to tell it's tale and to show you it's world and characters. The colors and the soundtrack create a haunting atmosphere that might leave you with the hope for more.I wish more games were so perfectly done. Bravo!			"

												A difficult yet gorgeous world to explore. I once spent 2 hours trying to find a way to open a locked door (still haven't). The dashing mechanic allows for some interesting swordplay, and the bosses are frustratingly, yet enjoyably difficult. Overall the game allows for some great sword maneuvers and amazing exploration; my only complaint would be the underexplained story, which often left me confused. An unlocked FPS would be nice as well.EDIT: The creators of the game have unlocked the framerate, glorious 60 FPS!			"

												With top down gameplay inspired by zelda with a dash of unforgiving fast paced combat, HLD was worth the price of admission. The music atmosphere and animations make enemies and the main character a pleasure to watch as they attempt to dismantle eachother. The game is also dense with secrets, with unfortunately some boiling down to running against walls and leaps of faith.I would wadger that a casual play through might clock in at 7-8 hours, depending on how many upgrades your willing to search high and low to finance. Almost all important additions to your abilities are bought from trainers, with the exception of guns that mostly lie behind the games major boss fights. Some are more useful then others: the chain dash is extremely important but upgrading your pistol clip or learning the slash into dash can wait.There are issues: frame rate can make executing some of your moves difficult. Your character will sometimes drop dashes when chaining them and there's not much to do, and it gets annoying trying to execute a 7+ chain dash required to clear some of the more difficult puzzels and your imput dropping or your character skidding to his certain death. The secrets in some areas are well marked, but those same markers in the same broad area might just be junk on the floor. It is compounded partially by the style of graphics: the charming pixels with tons of doo-dads on the walls and floor mean that it looks like everything might have a switch or passage behind it.You can't track where you've found things aside from the games diamond shards (which act as keys for progression) so you might wander an area for hours trying to find elusive secret collectables only to learn apon consulting a map that you've already cleaned it out long ago. Most of the rewards as you move to full collections tend to be minor: there are outfits that have different effects on them of varying use (some are quite subtle) but the most powerful effects they have are generally obtained past when they mattered anyway. That being said there's a lot of fun to be had exploring and buying upgrades and fighting some very intense ambushes and bosses in the grim but very colorful ruins of hyper light drifter.			"

I wish the devs had thought up a different mechanic for doing these kinds of character modifications in the game.Besides that, the game is obviously great.			"

												fantastic game for people who love to explore and want to diligently cover all areas of a map and check every single corner and edge for potential hidden areas. swing your sword at everything, keep an eye on your companion to see if they can reveal hidden paths for you. if you dont like that sort of thing, it's not for you. i Highly Recommend you get the dash/drift upgrade FIRST. it'll help you in fights and exploration. if something is too hard for you (ie bosses) i suggest drifting more and learning patterns. movement is key, otherwise you'll have a Bad Time in a bullet hell like situation. the game does not give you instructions on where to go, it's entirely up to you (and progression blockers) but if you hit a dead end, simply explore another area until you can unlock new paths to traverse (or look around your current area to see if you missed something). it's all about exploration and map clearing and item finding. again, if this sounds like a chore, this game is not for you. yes, there is backtracking for things like locked doors or obstacles that were previously impassable. there are also portals which act as fast travel. you can use them at any time once you activate them for the first time.final note, theres no dialogue. all information you will recieve is visually represented by symbols. beautiful art syle, lovely music, combat feels good, responsiveness is good, difficulty moderate once you acclimate (and get used to drifting), overall a great game, but not for everyone. can easily turn frustrating if none of the above is your cup of tea. but for me, it's just amazing. im very happy i backed this			"

												Great game, very original and refreshing; it's hard to compare to anything but for me, it has a Legend of Zelda vibe to it, especially A Link to the Past.It's not possible to fully advance into the game without exploring A LOT. You'll hug walls, cliffs, edges, trees, everything. If this is something that does not interest you, you might find the game tedious in the long run without a walkthrough. I'm trying to find everything I need to get (I think) the best ending and without any guide, it's becoming quite a chore because there are little to no indications.Combat is visceral, fast-paced and when you use all of your arsenal, you get pretty powerful. It's not perfect, but it's unique and satisfying. You can unlock a couple new moves and ranged weapons that helps a lot.  Some people have been mentioning the difficulty, but I haven't run into any difficulty wall, most bosses were one-shot except a few that killed me once or twice. Even if it did go well for me, it is probably the hardest game I've played of this genre if you compare it to Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, Soul Blazer, Terranigma, etc.The story is not told with words. When you talk with NPCs, they respond with sounds (the non-important NPCs) or images (those ones explain what happened/is happening in the world). Though I have not experienced the ending yet, I'm hooked. The emphazise on exploration really makes you observe the world with all of its details and that's how the story/universe of Hyper Light Drifter unraveled for me. Your character also goes through a lot of mini-cutscenes as you progress which kept me captivated. The whole setting is kind of mysterious.I'm 9 hours into the game and I've killed the last boss. I'm exploring the maps to find everything I'm missing to see if the ending change. I haven't tried new game + yet. Expect 8-10 hours of story on your first playthrough. There's a hidden gauntlet/monster arena to complete and a lot of collectables that I have no idea what they unlock yet, it's exciting. If you're in for achievement/trophies, there's one that requires you to not die at all during a playthrough. That's plenty of hours, I'm sure.TL/DR fast-paced and moderately difficult action/adventure/RPG with minimal rpg elements (unlock a few abilities and such through the collection of tokens), heavy exploration, lot of collecting to do, great pacing and memorable world/ambiance. Just get the damn game.			"

												TLDRGood -Art Style - Visuals are excellentUnique Setting - Alien WorldCombat - Could be Improved but SatisfiyingAc/Dc -Dialouge - There isn't any...so no Planescape Torment here you can take it or leave itSound - Effective EnoughDifficulty - Somewhat Tough - Pattern Learning Required to Beat BossesInstructions - MinimualBad -Exploration is really just a Pixel Hunt for the same two treasures screen after screenRepetitive and overlong at certain pointsLack of a concise storyMy Verdict?Very.....Okay. Reminds me of Axiom Verge and Zelda.Which is good in certain aspects such as excellent retro style art (not just pixel graphics) and it's adherence to theme throughout the expierence. The visuals are really a shining point for this game.However like Axiom Verge this title suffers from some retro game problems that have no place in modern games. I found the exploration portion of the game (it's a substantial part...like most of it) grew tedious as you pixel hunt each area trying to find extra loot hidden all over the level. The loot itself seems to be either health refills or coinage...and that's it. I mean if I'm searching for something and I stumble upon a seceret it would be nice to have some mystery as to what I was going to find there but some of you may enjoy getting the same christmas presents year after year. The combat style is sort of a mish-mash of button mashing and screen dashing that comes off okay. It could defintely be smoother but if you are technically precise and know what you are doing you will be successful. That's easier said than done as mob rushes are common and can be overwhelming.  The fact that you just start over at the begining of the screen is an old and tired mechnic that winds up having the effect of not caring one bit if I roll off a cliff or get KO'ed right before I kill the last bad man on screen.If your looking to scratch your Zelda itch and enjoy the aesthics of video games this a pretty solid title. I would say it needs some serious revamping to elevate itself up to Titan Souls or Shovel Knight territory.6/10 --- Solid Fun mixed with some tedious searching sets this as a slightly above average title in my book. While the price might be a bit too high for the gameplay itself the unique setting and visuals makes up for a bit.			"

When you drop your guard you will die, well loose 2 health but in a game where health packs aren't falling from the sky, each tick of health is valuable. Dashing wiill save your skin, but can also lead you to death. Sword & gun combo is nice, although you regen ammo from slashing enemies down, they will disappear quickly. Acquiring upgrades takes time and exploration. and when you do get a chance to acquire an upgrade choose wisely.The music adds to it all, Ominous and eerie, it adds to apocalyptic setting, Dilapidated buildings surround you as you explore to find the ""shards"". Enemies lie waiting for you at the top  of the crumbling staircases within the moss/vine covered ruins, snowy peaks, and in the depths below.This game has me hoooked. ill be spending much more time in it, most of which will be trial and error deaths and doing the same things contiually,			"

												Have been looking forward to this quite some time, unfortunately it didn't blow my mind like I hoped it would. Gorgeous and fun little game though.Hoped this to be much larger and more complex. Like those early Nintendo action adventures with lots of different weapons and spells and whatnot. Devs seem to have aimed for some focused retro clone (which they definitely delivered on).If you are frustrated by the game's difficulty, you might try some upgrading first. After that the difficulty is just about right.+World. Swords, blasters, neon lit ruins. Sweet science/fantasy juice with some nice 70s flavour.+Pacing. Moments of calm bliss sliced by lightspeed conflict, everything spiced with some satisfying hunt for secrets.-Protagonist. Most NPCs look way cooler than me.-Size. Like fine cuisine there just isn't enough to fill an honest stomach.			"

												well animated cyberfurriesemotionally effective story told through environment and a few picturesvery satisfying dynamic soundtrackquite upsetting!!responsive and engaging movementlargely timing/pattern memorisation basedvariety and improvisation in combat is fun and effectiveall items except health packs are recharged in combatvariable difficulty - can explore elsewhere for upgrades if scene is proving too difficulttook about 8 hours to beat normally, missing a reasonable amount of secretsnew game + unlocked, start with upgrades but less health (also nice cloak)occasional collision bugs lead to a little lost health by accidentally falling downa couple characters are missing a frame of animation (turn invisible for 1 frame)			"

												In lieu of a longer review, some quick combat tips:Healing takes time. Not a lot, but enough to get killed if you're careless.You can quick-fire your gun in the direction you're facing without aiming. This works better with some guns than others. Ranged enemies tend to fire a bit behind you, while melee enemies track your position more precisely.Make good use of save spots and health packs. Don't be afraid to repeat a room if you think you can do it better.The game has a lot of Metroid-like secret rooms. Hug walls and warp off the beaten path to get more upgrades. You can upgrade the sword to reflect projectiles. This is even better than it sounds.  Many find East the easiest way to start. Some of the rooms are pretty hard, but the boss is less difficult than the other three and you get the shotgun right after, which is a game-changer.  "

												Like if Fez and Zelda has a baby. Good combat/ asthetics/ level design. Could do with being a bit longer, or maybe I just enjoyed it too much!			"

												This is very beatiful mechanically driven link to the past + titan souls type game.I would really apreciate if this would support 60frames per second because having the 30frames in secound in this type of game is very annoying.  The game shoots itself on the foot there!otherwise very very good game.			"

												A terribly good game, IF you like a challenge.Sometimes pixel graphics are labeled as ""retro"", but the style of Hyper Light Drifter is infact modern, unique and will probably be stuck in your head just as you may have experienced with games from 20 years ago. I stopped playing anything else after I started playing this game. I died a lot, i learned, i started dying less and finally beat the game after some 15 hours. What really struck me was the wonderful storytelling. Hyper Light Drifter doesn't need to provide you a single text in a language you do understand to tell it's tale and to show you it's world and characters. The colors and the soundtrack create a haunting atmosphere that might leave you with the hope for more.I wish more games were so perfectly done. Bravo!			"
