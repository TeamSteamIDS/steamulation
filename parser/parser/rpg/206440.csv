												Video games often deal with larger than life situations, and yet it tends to be the simpler things that hit home the most. Borrowing elements from films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Pixar's Up, this is the story of a man on his deathbed attempting to fulfil his lifelong dream to visit the moon. To go into anymore detail and risk spoilers would be a crime, but know that To The Moon stands as one of the most heartfelt stories of any game I have ever played, and when paired with the immaculate score composed by my much beloved Laura Shigihara, I can hardly imagine how someone could play through it without feeling something.It's worth noting that what is here consists almost entirely of exposition. This is in by no means a slight against the game, just a fact that needs to be mentioned so you know what you are getting into. I realize that many have a disdain for games that barely warrant being described as such, but in this case I beg that they put aside those prejudices, as I feel if anything could change their minds To The Moon is it.To say that Freebird Games creation was emotionally affecting to me would be an understatement. Despite coming close on many occasions, I can scarcely recall any game that managed to make me tear up the way To The Moon did. It's a remarkable achievement in not only videogame storytelling, but as a narrative in any medium, and you would be an absolute fool if you passed it up!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Wow.To be brutally honest, I loaded this game up today thinking that I would just play around for a few minutes and then put it away, unlikely to ever play it again. In reality, from the point the story began to unfold I decided that I wouldn't ... or couldn't stop until it was completed. It's amazing what Freebird Games managed to do with the RPG Maker tool. With some subtle animations, lighting, and movement, it didn't take long for me to forget the 'low budget' visuals and imagine as the game and story elements unfolded in whatever resolution my mind can create. I will admit that this isn't what a person could call a gameplay heavy experience. However, the way that the elements are woven into the story are creative and even add to the story. I think as a medium we hurt ourselves by calling our games 'games' at all... however, I was able to complete the journey through my own interaction with enough perceived freedom that I didn't feel corralled into a corner. Mostly the story itself made me want to push to the next story element or conclusion... it was simply that good. It's sad, really, that a small time developer like Freebird can craft something with such a small budget that is so moving, yet all the big AAA developers can hardly bring me to laugh let alone shed a tear. Speaking of laughter, the pacing of the story is impressive with some comic relief to mix up the joy and sadness. Although I will admit, a few times I thought one of the main characters was a little over-the-top silly... but that may just well be who he is.When I was in college I took a movie class where the instructor said it was a travesty to ever watch a movie in pieces... and in this case, if you can free up a few hours, I think that this dish is best served in one sitting. Just keep a box of tissue next to your monitor.			"

												I like to think of myself as a human being in touch with my emotions. I feel, love to feel and don't stray away from bad or good. I admit, sometimes I tend to overreact, but my opinion is that things like that can't happen if you don't care. However, I am not easily touched by art. The last time I've cried is also the first time, as far as I can remember. Back in the nineties, when I was five or six, I've watched this movie... I can't remember its title, but I remember the dread and tears rolling down my cheeks during the final movie scene where character visits his buddy's grave. His deceased friend is his circus monkey and instead of flowers, he's bringing him bananas. Something about it disturbed me deeply.Since then, I had a few emotional rollercoasters where consuming art made it harder to swallow or breathe, but I was never moved completely.Steam Awards this autumn had To The Moon nominated by a buddy of mine. I was suspicious about it; hey, it's Enterbrain's engine RPG, which means Game Maker, which means, dude, stuff like that can't move you. I didn't really point it out to my friend, but could he feel I was skeptical? Could be, because I've received it as a gift. So, at least I could give it a try, right?At first sight, To The Moon looks childlishly naive. It's a simple 'walk-in-four-directions' RPG game with limited interactivity and no combat system. It gives an impression it wants you to explore its world, however, soon enough you will discover the game is rather linear.Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts of Sigmund Corp. have a rather peculiar job - they rearrange memories of dying people so they remember their life differently seconds before dying. The new technology allows them to fulfill dying person's wishes. They didn't expect visiting Johnathan Wyles would be anything more than a regular night on the job. However, things turn out to be rather complicated when they find out they need to fulfill Johnathan's dying wish - make him travel to the Moon.It doesn't take very long to get tangled into a four hour story choke full with symbolism and emotions, aiming and succeeding in shattering you to the core. This is a game that thrives on its lack of stereotypical heroes, big quests and otherworldly ideas. Meeting Johnny (Johnathan's nickname) proves to be a gutwrenching, slowbuilding experience. Nothing in To The Moon happens too fast or too slow; the story is perfectly timed and it's progressing toward the epic finale one step at a time. Both humans and certain objects are pieces of grandiose puzzle. However, motif is not onedimensional - it consists of several layers and, as you piece it together, it takes away your breath, masterfully emphasizing tearjerking moments by utilizing comic relief in form of Dr. Watts dialogue lines which are often used to break the fourth wall and make the world even more beliveable. And while moving and interacting mechanics are not something that game should be proud of, they're basically non-important. On the other hand, music composed by Kan R. Gao, game's writer and director, proves to be a moving force behind the title and catalyst for game's story. It works wonders in creating atmosphere, be it moments of light comedy or heavyweight anxiety. As the game progressed, I felt it coming: I knew To The Moon is actually influencing my mental state and changing my perspective with each passing minute. I knew I was getting attached to the characters, their ideas, fears, thoughts, doubts and hopes. By the end of Act 2, it was getting harder to breathe and my emotions evidently grew stronger.As I was approaching the game's climax, I felt my eyes were burning and body's temperature rising. And then it hit me so hard, the way I wasn't struck by anything in art since that monkey scene from a movie I no longer remember - To The Moon made me cry and it didn't stop there. As I was gasping for air and being thankful I was home alone, I couldn't stop myself. Emotions were too strong, no matter how hard I fought against them. I even tried concentrating, meditating on my breath, thinking crying over game is probably silly because I'm causing pain to myself... But I was wrong. I was so wrong.To The Moon made me cry during playing, step away from a keyboard and cry for another half an hour after finishing it because it was so liberating. It was an unscrewed valve releasing tons of pent-up emotions from who knows where. A silly little game I knew nothing about proved to be one of my favorite games ever, one I will ALWAYS recommend and the one I will measure interactive art from now on.Few months ago, I was at home, nervous about some basically unimportant reason (could it be money, or recent  unemployment or what?). My daughter was sitting by the window, her elbows on the window sill. So I was nervously pacing through the room when she turned to me and said: ""Dad, come here with me, let's look at the stars.""And I've really turned around, somehow, the fate didn't allow me to miss out on that opportunity. So we sat by the window and we've looked at the starry sky and then she said to me ""Look at the stars, Dad. Stay here with me. We'll look at the stars. Aren't they beautiful?""So I sat there and gazed upon the shiny dots thinking that, as we grow up, society murders something good in all of us and that our kids are the only way we can, at least partially, get it back.So, just as my daughter on that very night, this game did the same thing for me - with its story of hopes, dreams, fears, love, life and death, it made me feel a little bit more human. And I'm forever thankful for that.   *** You have reached the end of a review.

												This game had me from the start. I knew I was going to be filled with emotion following the story and the soundtrack. This was truly a little piece of hidden art. I actually did not want it to end and I must admit that I may have shed a tear. This is one of those stories that makes you not want to take a break to eat or take phone calls.

Exquisite, emotional storytellingTo the Moon was released late 2011 to immense critical acclaim - it received several awards as one of the best Indie-games of 2011. Steam user reviews are also ""overwhelmingly positive"" (97% positive out of nearly 12.000 reviews is really impressive). That's already quite an achievement by itself, as it was the first game made by the then new and really small development studio ""Freebird Games"". So I went into this game with quite some expectations, and I am very happy they were all fulfilled, and more.To put it frankly: as a game that wants to tell an original, emotionally involving story, To the Moon is simply among the very, very best. Its story is so original, so gripping and so sad at some points, that I found myself completely absorbed by it, and I played through the entire game in one day and almost in a single go. That's no exceptional feat: it's not very long, I needed just under six hours to reach the end. But what wonderful six hours these were! Since To the Moon relies for more than 90% on its story and its twists and turns, I won't spoil anything here. Suffice it to say that I felt involved in a way that a good book or a good movie can achieve -and maybe even more.It's not only the story that is gripping, there is more to it. To the Moon dwells extensively on very important social and philosophical questions, such as the desire to develop one's individuality amid a rather bland society, or man's right to decide (or not) on his own life's ending. Heavy and even depressing as this may sound, in reality the game succeeds wonderfully in touching these delicate issues in a subtle way, made all the more digestible by its great use of humour. I found myself quite often laughing aloud, only to feel tears coming up the next minute or so. It's this so difficult to achieve balance between humour and depth, that makes this game outstanding and a true piece of art. Dialogues, of which there are plenty, are simply masterful: all credits to the story- and copy-writers for this one.Not everything is perfect, though: the actual gameplay is rather bland and even repetitive, since it mostly involves moving the two playable characters around on a small map and interacting with objcets and other persons in a rather straightforward point-and-click adventure-syle. Happily, the inventory is kept very simple, but there are is a whole series of mini- (even micro-) games that is simply boring. But even this rather disappointing gameplay vanishes into nothing thanks to the story and the emotions it evokes. The subtle 16-bit graphics are quite interesting: even though heavily pixelated, they manage to bring across quite some detail, even on an emotional level.All in all, this is a gem of a game; a testimony to the fact that Indie-games have evolved into gamings most innovative department, where content is so much more important than package. It's a must-have for anyone who takes his gaming even a tiny bit serious.Overall score: 9.5/10			"

												So...There's always a lighthouse...?This game is astonishing, it is like a wonderful novel, or like a brilliant movie. The story is so touching, so full. Just...such a HUGE LOVE and amazing dream! I can compare this game with one of my favourite movies ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Spectacular dialogs, emotional roller coaster, great humor. And main piano theme ""For River\To the moon"" it is....I am speechless. 10 out of 10 from a sentimental dreamer.			"

OverviewTo the Moon is not so much a game as a story driven interactive narrative. The gameplay is minimal and it mainly consists of moving around, but once you get into the story, believe me, you won't give a s#!t. This is an absolutely AMAZING game that will make you both laugh and cry. Words cannot describe my experience with it. Just... Just play it.The Pros:Amazing Story - I will not spoil any details about the story, but I will vouch for it's quality. You play as a pair of scientists who work for a sort of ""Make a Wish"" foundation, but which use an Animus-like machine to enter peoples memories and alter them in order to grant the dying person's wish. The story is divided into three acts, and takes about 4 hours to naturally progress through. Some may argue the story elements are a bit cliche, but frankly it was so well executed and related that I cannot say that bothered me. Also, great piece of advice from me: Pay close attention to everything. Even something that might not seem relevant will prove to be a foreshadowing of a greater truth. It's worth it to pay close attention to surroundings, dialogues, scenery, anything and everything. Great Characters - The characters' personality is well defined, and you will grow to like them, especially Dr. Neil Watts, one of the controllable characters, who is the comic relief of the story and does a great job. But in all seriousness, everything is so amazing about this story.Amazing Music - If anyone says music in gaming doesn't impact on experience they have obviously not played this game. The music is absolutely amazing and only hearing different tracks can put you in a different mood. You can go from happy to sad to worried to sad in a few minutes.Beautiful Pixel Art - The game's retro RPG style graphics is a strong point in my opinion. It makes you concentrate more on the story. Anyways, the environment is beautiful, lighting is superb and I've never admired a pixel graphics game with such attention thus far.Free DLC! - So far there were two mini episodes released which you can download and play for free! Also, the OST, which is paid, apart from being beautiful, offers 50% of the profits to charity. This is DLC done right.The Cons:Resolution - This isn't about graphics, and you won't even notice, as the game really sucks you in like a good book, but I was having problems opening up the game, and instead of upscaling to full HD, the game resorts to a very tiny resolution that might cause issues to some. Also, it's 4:3, and you'll see black bars. This is most likely because of the game engine they used.It ends. - At some points i couldn't wait for the story to go on so I can see what happens, and at the end I wish it didn't because I was just sobbing at the ending. Amazing.ConclusionThis game is an excellent visual narration, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read a great story in a great manner. The Overwhelmingly Positive reviews are truly deserved. Also gift this to people who play tough, and see if they cry at the end. I was surprised I did.If you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

""I never told anyone but... I've always thought they were lighthouses.""There are odd, mismatching anecdotes in everybody’s life that would not absolutely mean a thing for anyone else beside a handful of people. Like an old, tattered soccer ball, an origami rabbit figure or an ugly platypus plushy... Here in this heartwarming narrative story, we are given the chance to acknowledge the sentiment hidden behind the oddity: a story of love, loss and a promise that would make a grown man shed a tear or two.It was the middle of a storm shaken night when esteemed doctors Eva Rosalene and Neill Watts arrived on the address given to them. They argued a bit among each other - about whose fault it would be the company car getting crashed on a tree - and took off, hurrying towards the house on the cliff. They heard the lingering song resounding from a piano as they get in. Lily, the caretaker of the old man welcomed them in and asked them nervously as she was leading them towards their client: ""If you wouldn't take my question the wrong way, what would be your business exactly?” Neill answered the question with a wide grin on his face before Eva had the time to say anything: ""We grant wishes!” The caretaker was a bit startled by the unexpected answer, but didn't push for any more explanation. This time Eva directed the anticipated question: ""What was his last wish?” Lily took a pause just long enough to catch her breath while opening the door to the master bedroom where a doctor was in attending to observe the patient's vitals, then answered: ""He wanted to go to the moon...""To the Moon is a wondrous little story about an old man and his enigmatic dying wish. Thousands of anecdotes, daily items, far forgotten dialogues and faces that belonged to a life past brought together paints a picture that you wouldn't soon forget. Ever watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Well, it's that kind of experience, plus some sense of humor inclined to be either absurd or noir, and minus Jim Carrey. It is cheesy, it is sensual, and it is heart wreckingly realistic and... It is a modern fairytale.I mostly agree that beauty lies in simplicity. To the Moon seems to be proof enough with 16 bit RPGMaker graphics, a handful of beautiful piano songs and cartoonish figures moving around with near comical animations, yet still with powerful enough narrative and screenplay that would result in making a grown woman like me cry. I've seen Hollywood sob stories with lesser creative spark and elegance in narration compared to this one. It is weaved with odes, references and commemorations that would bring faint smiles to your face; sometimes with bitterness, sometimes with warmth.There is arguably no gameplay aside walking around and collecting some items - and solving a folding puzzle now and then - thus, the game can either be categorized as a minimalistic adventure or a visual novel with puzzle elements altogether. For the fair warning, it certainly is not an RPG. Knowing whatever you are getting yourselves into, To the Moon is a welcome experience of 4-5 hours.For me, it was worth every single second I spared. There are the kind of games that you'd wish you forget about, just so you can experience them for the first time all over again. This is one of them.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												To The Moon is definitely an interactive story more than a game, but please don't let that turn you away and cause you to miss out on an amazing experience. This is a story that will hit you, possibly directly, in The Feels™. It takes around four hours total depending on how quickly you move through, but please do yourself a favor and don't rush through. Freebird Games did an excellent job in presenting an emotional story which will keep you glued to your screen. Pick an evening, sit back, and take the time to enjoy the tale as it unfolds.			"

												I'm meant to be doing IT work right now but I'm bored, so I thought ""why don't I review a game?""Well, I say a game, but To The Moon is more than a game. It's a story, and a damn good one at that. To The Moon sits on a prestigious list of ""Games that made me cry"". This list features games such as:Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue TeamPokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of TimeMetal Gear Solid 4LA Noire Unboxing 40 crates on TF2 On a more serious note, I thoroughly recommend this game to everyone. It has a beautifuly written story that makes me want to replay it again and again, a beautiful soundtrack that deserves the purchase and has beatiful artwork, especially considering this was made in RPG Maker. Even if you aren't a fan of story driven games I'd pick this up, I wasn't and this is probaby in my top 5 games I've played this year.10/10 - Would cry again			"

												This is one of the greatest games I've ever played. If it were a movie To the Moon would be on par with Titanic if not better. Coming from someone who doesn't get emotionally affected easily, believe me when I say if you want a heartfelt and sentimental experience worth every penny, you will want to buy this game. It's on the Humble Indie Bundle X now but you should definitely pay the $10 to buy it on steam. There is a huge amount of detail put into this RPG style game so you can explore every nook and cranny of his life and how it is like. With an amazing storyline and touching soundtrack you will feel like you are the one getting his wish fulfilled. Seriously stop reading this and buy it right now and it'll be the best 10 bucks you ever spent. The question I hope you will be left with at the end is, what does it really mean to be living the dream?			"

												When your life comes to an end, what else is your life than the accumulation of your memories? To the Moon introduces the idea of having the possibility to rewrite your life in order to be content with it during you last concious moments on this planet, but  also presents you with the costs of doing so.Besides having a filosofically interesting plot, this game features tonnes of little jokes and references that will keep the enjoyment up to scratch right from the start, all the way through the game, always knowing when it's appropriate to be funny. This story is nicely accompanied by a lovely soundtrack that deserves to be picked up and having a listen to. Unless, of course, you have an intrinsic hate of piano music. The tracks are composed in such a way that they fit the individual scenes perfectly and add a genuine extra layer to the storytelling.Playing this game for anything than its, frankly magnificent, storytelling capabilities would be a mistake though. Walking around feels like being in an outdated JRPG and further gameplay consists of non-imaginative puzzles that serve little purpose other than helping the player to not feel like they're watching a single cutscene.Despite its flaws and being just a couple hours worth of an experience, I can do nothing else than recommend this wonderfully emotional piece of storytelling masterpiece, manly tears were shed. A must-play.			"

												Well this game has been rattling around my library for quite some time now, I finally clicked ""play"". Then I didn't get out of my chair for the next 3 hours. To the Moon is a great story, the whole game plays out like a nice movie. A few 4th wall breaking references here or there, some comic relief, and of course TONS of sappiness. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but with so many positive reviews and such a neat pricetag I remained fairly optimistic, and honestly any expectations I might've had were blown out of the water by what this game really delivered. I didn't think such a story could be told in this format, I didn't know that so few pixels could make me experience so many feels.. I can't make a pros/cons list for this game really. It wouldn't really make sense. If you want to sit back and casually navigate your way through a captivating story then this game might be for you! If you're looking for a more interactive experience - or maybe want to blow some ♥♥♥♥ up - I wouldn't recommend this for you. Honestly even if this isn't the type of game you think you'd enjoy I would still recommend waiting for a sale and giving it a shot, I spent 2$ and then one day I was in the mood for something different, and now here I am adding another thumbs up to the mountain of positive reviews this game has :)			"

""I'VE ALWAYS THOUGH THEY WERE LIGHTHOUSES. BILLIONS OF LIGHTHOUSES…STUCK AT THE FAR END OF THE SKY.""One of the best buys from Humble Bundle ever. Approx. 1 dollar for this little gaming gem. Debut of the Canadian developer Freebird Game. But they wasn't really out of touch. Previously they created 3 games already and Kan Gao as the head of Freebird did another projects too. But as their debut, this is the best they could wish for. To the Moon is the game that define or used to define indie games 5 years ago. Small puzzles, little interaction with enviroment, vintage visuals, great audio and what is most important thing - dialogues. Creative approach indie games have is just whole another level. Imagine AAA game with indie game dialogues. Oh boy.Game will last you around 2-3 hours depends how you play it. I've finished that in 2011 under 2 hours, now I did it second time, but game itself isn't that much replayable to be honest. Second time you won't enjoy it that much. Game contains free DLCs, so make sure you get them and play them aswell. Soundtrack is awesome too! But you already know that.About the price, it's really questionable. Me personally, I wouldn't pay 8 dollars for it. During sale it might be reasonable to get it for 4 dollars, but if you are hard on sensitive games, and really enjoy that way of gaming experience, then do it anyway.Finding Paraside is the new game similar to To the Moon, and it's realasing this summer, so we'll see how creative Freebird will be with that one. That being said, we've reached the end.Bonus Point: Definition of GenreRating: 10/10 "

												To the moon tells a wonderful story, of life, love and loss.  It's more a piece of art than a video game.  Anyone who enjoys a good story will enjoy this game.  If you're looking for cutting edge graphics, or state of the art gameplay this won't be for you.  In fact this game is pretty devoid of gameplay outside of moving from one scene to the next.  The game has some very simplistic puzzles which can typically be solved in under 10 moves.  Although game isn't about defeating enemies, gaining experience or collecting loot. You play as a pair of... well they are called Doctors but I think they are more or less Scientist.  Their job is to go into someone memories, unlock the meories and use them to rebuild the memories in such a way as to fulfil their dying patients wish.. This story centers around a dying man named Johnny who wished to visit the moon.. hence the games title.. To the Moon.  Along the way of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes..  This game is very good, it tells an amazing story, which if you enjoy stories, you'll love, if you are the pew pew pew, kill enemies, collect loot, gain levels type of guy, you should stay far away from this.   The game will last about 2 hours give or take a few minutes for solving the puzzles.  The ending will bring out the feelings in even the most hardened gamer.  Although as good as the story is, it can be pretty predicatable, although that isn't really a bad thing..I'd recommend this game highly, great story, great music, and generally enjoyable enough..

												The storyline was beautiful and funny. It made me feel as if true love no matter the obstacles or hardships you may face, it is worth tackling them together. Sometimes one may make sacrifices that others may not understand, not even the one they might of been intended for but its always for a dream. Love is such a big word and can be expressed in many forms. The story really felt almost like a novella (soap opera)One moment they are jerking your tears, the next you are smiling and that is what made it more interesting to continue playing. The twist in this game were on point and with some patience it really pays off to follow the game through the ending. Brace yourself though, ninja onions will pop out of nowhere towards the end!Happiness is best shared amongst those you love the most.. family, friends, and that special someone.“A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” ― John Lennon			"

It's not one of those other games you play and then just forget about them. You might think back to this game and relate to it everyday.

												To the Moon gets a lot of praise for it's story, and I'm happy to say it lived up to my expectations. There is very little gameplay to be had, the 'game' is about the journey you go on, slowly going back through John's life piecing things together.I was warned that I would be in tears playing this, and there was a little part early on that got me blubbering, perhaps because it hit a little too close to home in that circumstance. As I approached the end of the story, I was ready and waiting for the part that would hit my emotions, as I had been told the ending was quite a tear-jerker. Just as I thought the game was coming to a close and I had missed it, it hit me. I was a blubbering wreck as the story tied everything up and came to a close.To the Moon will not thrill you with revolutionary gameplay and mechanics. However, it will take you on a journey that will captivate you and leave you feeling such strong emotions for the little pixelated people.'Play' To the Moon, it's quite the journey.			"

I've been playing this until the very end. This game is a masterpiece.Kan Gao is a genius. The story is not only amazing, the music and art(if you're into pixel art) are aswell.Reviews said that this game makes the player very emotional, I was not expecting this to happen since I don't get emotional easily. But this game did make me emotional. I love it. I would recommend this game to everyone even if the gameplay is not your style. It has a lot of cutscene's, but that is what makes this game.			"

To the Moon is a game that's hard to review, because it's hard to tell you in detail why it's great without spoiling anything. At the same time, if you just tell people a game is great and you can't tell them why, they're bound to avoid it because it raises expectations and they can only be disappointed from there. So let me tell you instead what it isn't and work from there. To the Moon isn't your standard pixelated RPG with 20 hours of grinding and half a dozen colorfully troubled individuals who have to band together to save the world from an unspeakable evil. The only RPG it reminded me of is Chrono Trigger, and that only because, like Chrono Trigger, it has a soundtrack for the ages. The game elements in it are very shallow and you will never be required to make a meaningful choice anywhere. It's got just about enough interactivity that you can still call it a game rather than just a story, but at the same time it's clearly all about the story. And the story, when you get down to it, isn't even all that clever. It's got nothing in it that you haven't seen somewhere before, especially if you're a fan of unconventional drama or sci-fi crossing over with the mental landscape (think Memento, Inception, and especially Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). The story isn't a ripoff of anything, mind you, but if it was told in a straightforward manner it probably wouldn't impress you.But the story isn't told in a straightforward manner, and this is where To the Moon really takes off (pardon the pun). This is the kind of material where it's so easy to become pretentious and melodramatic that the game goes into the territory of Art with a capital A just in the way it manages to avoid that. The framing story of two doctors who've done this all before and to who this is just another job (to the point of them making irreverent and occasionally downright crass comments about what's going on) keeps it firmly grounded. When there's a big emotional moment, the game no more than touches on it through the dialogue, never making the mistake of hitting you over the head with how you're supposed to feel. It leaves it all up to you whether you just want to say ""good stuff"" when you're finally at the end, or instead cry for five minutes straight, like I did. (The way I could empathize with one of the protagonists probably helped.)How much do I like this? Let me put it this way: I got this for practically nothing as part of a bundle and left it lying on the shelf for a long time before giving it the old 30 minute tryout. Four hours and one handkerchief later I bought the game at full price on Steam just so I could put up this review. That's $2 per hour of memorable gameplay, and that's a better deal than you'll get from most summer blockbuster AAA titles.			"

 Concise and beautiful. It's a short game, but I would definitely say it's worth the purchase. The soundtrack is superb, it evokes a lot of emotion. I personally find it important to have a good soundtrack let alone a great story. I loved the way they progressed through the story backwards and still successfully made the game play out smoothly. I wouldn't suggest buying this game if you're purchasing games for gameplay or graphics. To the Moon is basically a story but you have to push buttons to read it. When I first began the game, I had a mindset where I believed the story was going to be linear, predictable. But I was wrong! I found myself wanting to know more, because a lot is left out and told to you later. I didn't think the game was ""too short,"" I thought it was perfect. Just like watching a movie.Granting a bed ridden elderly person's wish through altering his memory. Interesting. Throughout the game you will realize that you will be encountering powerful symbolism and significant events that led to the present day John. I cried.  "

												I just finished this game and I'm still stunned. It's been a long time since I sat in front of the screen, watching the epilogue and the credits of a game with tears in the eyes (Thank you, Freebird games!)Going back the life of ""Johnny"", reliving all his beautiful and sad memories really touched my heart and let me reflect my own life. The choices I made, the chances I missed and the experience I gained. There aren't many games out there causing this! 'To the moon' kind of showed me what's important in life. Maybe this sounds strange, but it's the truth.I have only one complaint: I really couldn't the stand the playable characters (Dr. Watts/Dr. Rosalene). In some situations, their script almost ruined nearly every beautiful moment of this game. Their childish behaviour in an overall serious experience was too much for me. But that's just my opinion.In the end, this game is a special gem for me though. While playing I often had the line of a song by 'Paramore' in mind: 'I could follow you to the beginningJust to relive the startAnd maybe then we'll remember to slow downAt all of our favorite parts'(Song: 'All I wanted')Isn't life beautiful and bittersweet?

												While some games are easily memorable for their gameplay, others will stood out by their Story. To the Moon is a game where the story is clearly the winner and it’s the reason why everyone should spend their time playing it. I’ll start by saying that it may not be a game that will please most of the players but consider starting the game with an open heart and the experience will be a remarkable one. The two main characters are doctors who go by the name of Watts and Rosalene and their jobs can be many things, but common isn’t one of them. They can provide an alternative, a different path to the ones whose life is approaching the end. During the story, your role is to help your patient to fulfil his wish: going to the moon. While it may seem an odd thing to wish for, there may be a reason for it, but that, is up to you to find out. You start by going from the most recent memories to the older ones, until you reach the point where you may find key-points in the Johnny’s past. But as you advance in the game you start to create a bond to his memories which can be odd, considering it’s just a job and Johnny is a stranger for you, but remember, if you let yourself immerse into the story you will end playing a much better game this way. There’s not much to be said about the Story itself without spoiling most of it to be honest. The game is very straight to the point, hence its short length but this can be a good thing because there won’t be any unnecessary time spent doing pointless quests or wandering off for long. You have a goal, this is your job and emotions should be left aside, but play this game as intended and emotions will surely make part of this experience. As they should.The music/soundtrack is as much important as the story because during certain events you will be listening to a nice piano tune that will provide warm feelings or a sense of loss, sadness and curiosity. I don’t believe the game to be any sort of depressing, as humor also plays an important role in To the Moon. Small conversations with some jokes and jests will arise from time to time to create a lighter mood since, after all, this is your goal and you shouldn’t let your personal feelings obstruct your intents. While I’m sure many will leave satisfied with the story (weather you end up liking the very end or not) and the music as well, do not come expecting some heavy gameplay mechanics or a rather lengthy game. I believe its short size can be a strong point this time because it takes you right where you need to be so I would advise to not measure your time and money invested with the length of the game but rather in its storytelling. If you are able to past the simple visuals with almost no gameplay mechanics, and if you let yourself engage in the Story while listening to the wonderful soundtrack then To the Moon will be a perfect fit to play in the between of any other lengthier games you are currently playing. It’s a respectable violence-free game, short but sweet experience filled with some humor, remarkable music and probably some tears as well. Play the game as intended, do not haste, do not do anything else while playing it and I’m sure your money will be a good investment. Enjoy the story. PS: As you may have noticed, English is not my first language so I apologize for the lack of a better grammar and steady writing.			"

												I'm writing this game as my first ever review because To the Moon deserves it.What many games fail to recognize today is this: They don't need all the bells and whistles to become something remarkable.What I mean is, I'm able to fully recommend this game to you in 2016 even though everything about this game is outdated. And I can do that because of what this game makes you feel as a player.I'm telling you now, if this game doesn't make you almost (or actually) cry, then you either didn't pay much attention to the story, or you're just not an emotional person in the slightest. This game is a masterpiece. I know modern games love to draw you in with action, constant stimulation, and maybe some emotion or some sort of 'rush' or competition, but the truth is you need to play this game. I'm a person who recognizes different tastes and opinions, but I can honestly say that when I walk into my computer science club, we can all talk about how much we loved this game.In short, buy this game. Do it to spark the feelings inside you, and allow yourself to be taken into a work of art that doesn't need to be fancy or anywhere close to triple A. Because it can make you feel so much more, even without all the 'new'. Passion drove everyone who worked on this game. I can say that because I'm a writer and I've had to discover what that looks like. Music, art, story, even the coding is bursting with passion.Besides, play this game as a refresher to remind you what games are supposed to do: Make you feel something. And you know... What good is every precious year of your life if at the end you can't remember what moved you?			"

The medication worked fine and calmed me down, but there's something in this game that made me feel something I haven't felt in a long time, I'm not really sure what that feeling was but it feels amazing.

What will you receive after making other people's wishes come true since they will be already dead after that?This game is all about the story of a dying old man and his one last wish. You will absorb its heart-felt story through your playing. The soundtracks keep your mood on a good pace throughout all the scenes. Great characters you would grow to love. Every character has its own important role that will effect your feeling in a quite good impact.Its story simply, quietly, gently, made me shed tears.

												Thanks to my hunt for achievements at the time and a few friends who recommened it, I ended up trying out the game.I didn't expect to much from a cheap indie game, but I was really pleasantly suprised.Not only was it as good as some of my friends suggested, it was plain awesome. I loved the storyline and the soundtrack and while the game mechanics aren't that great, in the end those didn't really matter compared to the experience of the rest.It was an remarkable story to follow and the soundtrack fitted that great. So even though a lot of the game seems dated, I fully recommend people should give it at least a chance and maybe they will experience the same great feelings I have gotten from it.As an additional note:This is the game I nominated 23-11-2016 for the “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award.

Short Version: 7.8/10Even if you're like me and don't really like Visual Novel, Walking Simulators, or games where you actually have little to do aside from move the story along, I HIGHLY recommend this game. The story is interesting and compelling. The characters are well developed and believable. The soundtrack is great most of the time, and aside from some weird control issues, it's a very great experience. Sadly, this game has been bundled many times, so grab it at a discount or you might feel cheated. 7.8 out of 10.Story: 10Honestly one of the better stories I've played in an indie title lately. To The Moon does something that while not traumatizing like Memento reminds me of it. We discover more and more about the main characters (not just Johnny, but all of them) the further back in time we go. While this isn't exactly a new story telling device, it is masterfully executed. I particularly like the way the author allows you to connect some of the dots, without having to connect all of them for you. Gameplay: 5Eh, there really isn't much to say here, this is probably weakest part of the game. While the momento puzzles at first are a bit entertaining, they soon lose their novelty and it's a matter of getting through them as quickly as possible to advance the story. One other irritating aspect is when you're left to search everything to find what you're looking for to advance the story. Often times these areas are small, but sometimes they aren't. That's when you want to take a sledgehammer to the level. Advice, if you're using the gamepad, hover with the mouse. Another small issue, half the things you couldn't walk over, there seemed to be no logical reason why you couldn't walk over them, when in other areas you could. Soundtrack: 10Personally, I found the soundtrack to be quite appealing. I'm not sure if the music is all original or not, but I absolutely loved it and felt it was appropriate and well composed. Controls: 6Most of the time, everything is fine. However, a few weak moments in the game, and I'm not sure if they are from RPG maker as the engine, or something the developers did. If the mouse is in the wrong spot, when you're trying to solve puzzles, even if it has disappeared, it can screw with your ability to solve the flip puzzles. At one point, the cursor kept moving away from where I was trying to go and I couldn't figure out why. Eventually, I realized it was because the mouse 'cursor' which at the time was invisible because I was using the controller, was near the center of the screen resetting the position of the cursor I was moving, even though I hadn't touched the mouse in five minutes. Second issue, while the gamepad works for nearly everything just fine, toward the end there is a situation that I was struggling to get through, because I was using the gamepad, and keyboard at the same time because I couldn't figure out how to 'shoot' with the gamepad. Major design flaw.Other Notes: N/ALet me first express my surprise. My previous experience with this developer was A Bird Story which I absolutely hated. To The Moon was actually GOOD. Some of the same irritating elements showed up in To The Moon, which leads me to believe they were started here, and then the developer decided they were good ideas and overused them in A Bird Story. But To The Moon while having a few moments of irritation blew away my expectations. I'm truly thankful for my stubborn nature and willingness to try new games, because, I had filed this game away to never be played. Thankfully I dragged it out and was rewarded for that experience.There is one achievement for finishing the game which you can do in a few hours.  "

												No need to tell about the story - you already read about that in the description, so I just want to tell about what it is to be played. It is the most emotional and heart touching game for me.Because of the graphic style it doesn't look like a classic p&c adventure game at first sight, but it really is! Nothing for those that need hard puzzles to enjoy a game though. Some people might prefer to classify it as a kind of interactive story because of the easy puzzeles but that's not the point here. It touches your heart deeply and I read a lot of times about adults commenting that were stirred to tears or cried during the play while the story enfolds more and more (also males!).Several games managed to catch me at some scenes or with the story (sometimes sad and sometimes funny) but I never finished a game crying before this one. Also Laura singing that song is really awesome.This game will leave you with lots of thoughts about life and death, dreams and much more ...  so be prepared.			"

												On occasion in life you come across a moment, or in this case game that you simply feel fortunate enough to witness or again in this case play, and To the Moon is definately one of those games. To the Moon is set in a world where scientists can fullfil and create memories and thus giving John who is the centre charector a chance to complete his final wish to travel  To the Moon . You play as two of these scientists and it becomes clear early on that visiting people's memories to fullfil these wishes is just part of their job,  and that they hold no emotional ettachment with their clients. As the story unfolds you are forced to visit John's unpleasent memories which are tied together with completing this wish, as the two scientists witness these remininescences of the past they begin to connect with John, you slowly begin to see that in this special case they no longer consider it their duty nor their obligation to fullfill this task but too do it out of good will - they begin to care for him. As the story progresses it takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, like the two scientists the theme transferred i started to care for John. This game moved me like few others out there can and I would like to thank the main developers and in addition the main writer of the music  Laura Shigihara.If i was to describe this game in one word it would simply be Beautiful. 10 / 10			"

												And The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award goes to:To the Moon!The plot is bittersweet. The music is solemn, yet edifying.It's a game about life choices and how the decisions we make in life might not always result in what was originally intended. We all live and learn. We all are filled with some kind of regret. We all strive for more. Hindsight is 20/20.My review is meant to be vague. I refuse to attempt to teach a life lesson or spoil this gem for anyone.			"

												This is one of those games that stick right to your heart. It's a simple point and click game that gives you the experience of a lifetime, literally. The music, needless to say, is a major part of the game and will leave you with all the feels in this world. The game unravels slowly, through various timelines. With each passing memory back in time, you understand a little more about the protagonist and his life through his eyes, and it's too beautiful to be put into words. The game has a gorgeous setting, even without any actual graphics. There's that certain warmth about the story (and the game in general), that leaves you overwhelmed. I've seen a few people complaining about how ""amateurish"" the dialogue writing is. Well, I see that as more of a strength than a weakness. That's where the heart of the game lies, and it's that of a child. For someone who cherishes ""The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" as one of the greatest films ever to be made, this game radiates some strong reminiscenses of the film. All in all, this game is nothing short of a masterpiece and has every reason to be in your library right now.			"

												""To The Moon"" is a sci-fi JRPG story game which has you follow two Doctors throughout an incredible night.I don't want to summarise too much, because the game is so great. It took me 4.1 hours to complete (which is standard for everybody really). The gameplay is similar to an old Link or Pokemon game, top down sort of thing, really excellent stuff.I installed it, played a little, and then completed the entire game in one sitting, being unable to turn it off with how engaging and interesting the game was. Keep in mind though this is more ""story"" than it is ""game"", but man, what a story. Absolutely awesome, cannot wait from more from Freebird Games. If this is anything to go by, the next production will be amazing.I hugely recommend this game to all.Nilesy			"

												NOTE: AS I'M NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS REVIEW, IT WILL BE COMPLETELY REWRITTEN IN THE (NEAR) FUTURE---Get the tissues ready, just in case ...To The Moon (mini) ReviewI swear to god, there's this one song on the album that makes me cry (or teary-eyed) EVERY TIME I listen to it. After a few marvelous tear drops tonight I reminded myself that I still needed to write a review for this game, even though I completed it months ago. But hey, better late than never!My goodness, where do I even start?! I'd like to say so many things about this game, but at the same time I could sum it up in one sentence: It's an amazing game that everyone needs to play, period! Even if you're not a fan of RPG-maker games, this game is well worth the try. The story alone makes this an incredible experience for sure. So let's just get this over with:About""This particular story follows Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts’ attempt to fulfill the dream of the dying elderly man, Johnny. In their mission to do so, they traverse backwards through the man’s memories, unfolding his curious life story before their eyes. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny’s past is revealed. And as the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is.""What's good+ Cute style + Atmospheric+ Beautiful soundtrack+ Amazing story+ Sweet price tag+ 2 Free (extra) chapters+ (perfect length to play through in one sitting, as to not lose the immersion)What's bad- Not a whole lot of gameplay, but the story makes up for itRecommended to: Everyone. I could go on forever about how amazing the game is, but you'll just have to experience it yourself. Lastly, again, don't neglect this game for its RPG-maker style graphics. It actually sat in my library for months at first, solely because I didn't like how it looked. Oh, how stupid I was. With that being said now, just get to it!			"

												To the Moon is a story-heavy, well executed lovestory by FreeBirdGames. It's about two doctors that travel to fulfill a dying mans last wish. The story is told in a very different way. You controll these two doctors through a bunch of memories. The memories are about Johnny life and his love for River. It's about how he lived his life and what happend during it. Time- travelling, puzzle solving game with much dialogue. The music in this game, mostly piano music, is freaking amazing. It's right on time, very fitting. The conversation between the doctors is really fun. It's good, because the rest of the story is very sad and emotional. The doctors argue about anything really, from olives to driving skills. It made me smile several times. If I had to say something bad about the game? The controls. Sometimes you click and the characters dont really move as you want them to. It can be a bit awkward, but its not that much of a problem since it's mostly just dialogue and not that much moving around. The puzzles are simple, yet fun. To be honest I really like when they're simple because I think hard puzzles are just off-putting and frustrating in a story-heavy game like this. If you happend to like pixelgames or just want a game focused more on story then gameplay, then this is the game for you.			"

												To start off: HOLY MOLY GUACAMOLE, IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS GAME AND LIKE STORY EXCLUSIVE GAMES, PLAY IT, NOW! Stop reading and play it!OK, with that out of the way, we can finally get to business.The game To the Moon is a story driven game where the player takes control of two scientists who are sent to an old mans' home to work in his memories to send him to the moon. It has many moments to make you smile, and many moments to make you cry, as well as some to bring about both reactions at one time.The gameplay is relatively nonexistent, however, it fits the game and how it was intended to be played. It consists of walking around a memory finding key memory orbs, as well as a memory link (if you're struggling, try the platypus.) Once you unlock the link, you solve a tile puzzle, then repeat the process. (If you're still struggling, move your cursor slowly over people or walk somewhere you didnt think you had to go.) There was one area where the gameplay got a bit different, which some may like, while it just broke my immersion.The simple mechanics made this game easy to play, but also easy to get bored while playing for some.The graphics were beautiful. They flowed smoothly for a pixelated game, and everything blended together well. Some may say that ""You need to be able to see what to interact with and what not to!"" But that simply isn't the case in this game. The fun is in the hunt for what you need. Of course, some things you will find will be a given whenever present, but for the beginning and a few things in each memory, the graphics play beautifully into it.Last and certainly not least, the soundtrack. Pardon me as I fanboy. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I think, nope, not done. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! OK definitely done now. In short terms, buy it, I did, and I have no regrets. In long terms, this games soundtrack is gorgeous. It makes use of the piano as the base for all songs, adding strings in some, not much else for others. It captures the mood of the story so well, and almost carries meaning in and of itself. My favorite is every single one. It reuses songs a lot, but they are so beautiful I still listen to them in my day to day life. If you buy this game for NOTHING else, buy it for the music. It is superb.While this game may seem boring, it can get emotionally attaching, especially for those in a relationship or very close with another person. I repeatedly kept looking at my own life and thinking, ""Yeah, that sounds familiar!"" While other times I looked at my own life going ""OH NO, WHY IS THIS SO FAMILIAR!"" And proceeded to cry for the next couple minutes, trying to play the game still. This is definitely a game to make you feel happy, sad, and even maybe a bit mad, but not a game for mindless joy. WARNING, THIS PART IS EXPLICITLY HOW I PLAYED AND CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I played this game completely open to myself, my life, and people around me. I tried to find parallels, or think to the future in order to connect to what was happening. I am certainly no old man, so it helped to think about how it would be to be taking my final breaths. I could do this safely, I have what I would classify as a strong mind. However, I know some people very close to me that tried that and got highly anxious, some even breaking down completely. If this may be you, please, do not feel pressured to play this way, and don't try to. Besides that, try to play the game by putting yourself inthese situations. Try to put yourself in the shoes of an old man wanting to go to the moon, try to put yourself in the feet of a young man marrying a woman with a mental disorder.Finally, be prepared to cry. This story is so tragic, it isnt even the love story. In one scene, the big twist, a mother accidentally hits her son with her car, killing him. It turns out to not be the old man (obviously), but instead his twin brother. After that, it's revealed he was given beta blockers, a drug to essentially delete traumatic memories. His mother is actually so distraught, she starts acting like the living twin is the dead twin, calling him the dead ones name, Joey, and almost forcing him to live the life his twin brother wanted to live.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Anyway, this game is so touching and amazing, with some funny moments, sad moments, and joyful moments.I rate it 9.7/10 PLATYPUSES "

												9/10To enjoy this game, you must meet two criteria:First, you must focus on the story.Second, you must have a soul.Then, you will find this short tale captivating, emotional, and stunning.Like I said, the story is the focus. The gameplay revolves around exploring until you find enough secrets to unlock the next level. This can get repetitive, but is really the only downside.A huge upside is the soundtrack. It's beautifully done piano that adds to the emotion and nostalgia that ties in the present with your exploration of the past.This game is short and cheap, so you don't have much to lose.

												To The Moon is one of the most touching and sad games in my life, no doubt.This game is a life-long story, a story that will be remembered for a long time and story that is able to touch your heart.Music in this game always fits the situation and sets you in the right mood. Piano tracks are amazing and my favorite one is ""Everything's Alright"" along with ""For River"".The story itself is great. Story of a man who is going to die very soon and he wishes to fly to the Moon, and how it ends... ending made me happy and sad at the same time.Thanks to the developer for this small and beautiful miracle.Thank you, Kan Gao.:'(			"

												Woah! Rarely do I encounter so emotional and touching games. The art style, music and the storyline are just so beautiful. It fully invoked me emotionally and had a lot of humoristic moments too. Only thing I found clunky were the controls every now and then. I strongly recommend giving this game a try.			"

												10/10 - as a must have, for me, personally.  YMMV.What to say, that hasn't already been said? This is a game, that is more of an experience, with game elements. The entire game made me think back, over as many of the 50 years of my life as I could remember. Thinking about what I could have, should have, wanted to do do differently. Wonderingg what my life would be like if I had done things differently, and if it would have even mattered. Wondering if I would be the same person that I am now, if I had done things differently. And wondering if I changed the course of my life. would I have beomce a better person. or a worse one.If you are looking just for quick, easy achievements, and Trading cards, looking for pew pew pew combat, looking for difficult puzzles... this isn;t the game for you. Sire, you can idle for TC's. The single ahievement for a ""perfect"" game will come. But, to really get the most out of this game, you need (IMHP) to go into it with a willingness, and perhaps an ability, to look at things from a very different perspective, be open to feelinmg joy, pain, happpiness, sadness, understanding, confusion, success, frustation... one after the other, seperately, and all at once. It is an experience. With game elements. If you aren;t open to the experience, you probably won;t enjoy this game at all. I enjoyed it, and I cried. At the same time.If you do nothing else, play the Minisode 2. And don't Alt>Tab out before you see and read the entire message at the end. I am still sitting here, and likely will be for some time, wondering how he is, if he made it through or not, and how many lives he touched, without knowing he did so. As a survivor myself, I hope he made it. And if not, I hope he made it to the Moon.			"

												""A story-driven experience about two doctors traversing backwards through a dying man's memories, in order to artificially fulfill his last wish.""♥ I have finished this game ♥ This is a beautiful and well thought out game. It's no easy feat to create a story that progresses backwards in time so that you can fully appreciate the present. The game is short, which may be a perk for some and not others. I feel the length of this game was perfect. There are many references in this game, and it's fun to find them! The sound track is beautiful and really helps influence your emotions. This game is emotion and story driven. As for gameplay mechanics, you basically walk around (using your mouse), collecting memories so that you can progress to the next period in time. You watch this dying man's life unfold from the present until he was a young child. This is a heavy dialog game, and you have to click to go through the dialog. So walking, collecting, and dialog. Each time you progress to the next point in time, you have to solve a little puzzle. The puzzles aren't that difficult, and I found it kind of fun. You grow to really care about the characters. You sympathise with them. If you do not shed even one little tear at the end, you might want to have yourself tested. You may in fact not be human.			"

												I'll be frank: When I first started playing this, I thought it was just some soulless 2D game, quickly slapped together, throwing text in where it pleased and passing itself off as art. Shallow. Boring. Pretentious. But I wasn't very far in. I knew it wasn't fair to judge a game without giving it a proper chance.So I kept playing, in the beginning forcing myself, assuming it was just another overrated artsy game with no real meat to it. Well I was wrong; without noticing, I began to feel myself compelled to keep going, the feeling growing stronger the longer I played. Soon enough, I almost literally had to see the next part. I actually played it all in sitting, unable to pull myself away despite it having kept me up past 5 in the morning at that point.It drove me on relentlessly, leaving me constantly wanting to know what was next, and why such-and-such a thing happened... why characters were who they were. I kept thinking I came to a conclusion, when once again it would twist my thoughts. I came to the brink of tears repeatedly towards the latter part of the game. I winced when I saw something bad happen. I smiled for the characters when they were happy. It ripped my heart out to see them suffer. And then I realized – I’m feeling so strongly for a bunch of pixelated sprites, not even realistic looking things… this game is THAT powerful.I told myself again and again, “Don’t cry. Don’t cry. It’s just a game.” But when the ending came, there was nothing I could do. The waterworks were coming whether I liked it or not.That’s not to say the game is depressing. Far from it: It’s sad, it’s happy, it sprinkles in humor when it knows it needs to… and it ends in such a way that your tears most certainly won’t be of sadness. It pulls at your heart and mind simultaneously; it makes your emotions come out full force and provokes your thoughts with the many questions, both story and real life related, it poses to the player.Quite simply, it was -the- most moving, beautiful game I’ve ever played, and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.Buy it, play it, and don’t stop until the end.

												One of those ""games"" with terrible gameplay but awesome storyline. The basic gist of it is that you work for a company that help dying people fulfill their wishes. In the case of the main patient in the storyline, this wish is to go to the moon. Saying any more than that would be spoiling the storyline, which is by far the main reason why you'd want to play this game in the first place. The gameplay itself is quite mundane. It looks and plays somewhat like a 16-bit era RPG, but without combat. It's rare that you'll find yourself lost for any significant amount of time. The game is also very (written) dialogue-heavy, so if you're not a fan of reading, this probably isn't the game for you. The soundtrack is quite superb.The game will generally take you around 3-4 hours to complete. Given the nature of the game, I would recommend completing the game in one sitting.Overall, I personally loved this game, although I have to admit that it's not for everyone. I personally bought this for $2.50 AUD, and I thought it was worth every penny. With that said, the game has practically zero replay value and is relatively short. I would overall recommend people try the game out if they're willing to sit down and appreciate a good, touching storyline.			"

I got lost in the story, which made it hard for me to stop playing even though it's only 3-4 hours long. I could compare this game to similar movies or other games, but not without spoiling what makes this game so special. The main theme song fits so perfectly within this game, it's just so dreamy.

It's a very emotional game with a fantastic narrative, exceptional music and a very touching and sentimental at the same time history. Regarding the gameplay is quite simple. It reminds me of the games of the year’s 90. Establishes such a deep connection between the game and the player who will make you feel many sensations and emotions, and perhaps even eyes moisten. At the same time it has some touches of humor. Well, I will not give more details, simply if you want to experience a different feeling and above all very human need to play. Pure love story.

												Have you ever picked up a book and do not fully understand the story until you have read from cover to cover? Entranced by the story and pieces soon to be discovered, you had mindlessly flipped through the pages until you arrived at the very last word followed by the final ""."". You skim through the pages, frenetically looking for more content. You think to yourself, surely there must be more pages, something more that I can grasp, something to keep me in this wonderful story. But you sigh as you realize the magic is over and the author intended on ending the story on that final page. Soon after, you begin to make connections you never made before, piecing together the story like a jig-saw puzzle one would complete and stow away for a lifetime of memories. Enter To the Moon.To the Moon takes you on a backwards adventure through time. During this process, To the Moon has the unique ability to triple as a mystery, puzzle, RPG, story-driven experience. This 5-hour journey into the conscious mind of John(ny) Wyles, an old and venerable man and widower, manages to engage people with a series of moving discoveries. While absorbed in To the Moon, you will experience every emotion possible. It's unavoidable. You will somehow manage to have tears in your eyes within the first hour of the anecdote and be laughing a minute later, as I did. From sadness and confusion, to awe and excitement, to anger and disbelief, and finally happiness, To the Moon leaves you with a feeling of warmth and a unique remembrance of the narrative of John(ny) Wyles. The man who wanted to venture to the moon, but could not remember why.Final RatingsGameplay: 8.5/10 - Being made from an RPG maker, there are some points where I was unsure how to advance in the story and had to do a bit of ""random clicking"".Storyline: 10/10 - One of the best story-driven games I have played. Second to Thomas Was Alone (see review)Soundtrack: 10/10+ - Creates the prefect ambience for every situation found within the story.Combat: N/AScary? Nope.Pop-Ups: None.Graphics: 5/10 - Do not let the graphics dissuade you from purchasing To the Moon. This is a game to experience because of the story within.100% Achievements: Easy. Complete the game and you earn the one achievement in the game.Singleplayer: 10/10Replayability: High replayability, but definitely not necessary to remember this beautiful story.Multiplayer: N/A			"

												It's one of those games you inevitably hear about, want to try, and then start playing it and realize that it's not that great technically, that characters need a lot of time to exit a car and get to the house, that you'll have to stop for a dialogue every now and then... Not something you can just play anytime, you have to leave it for the right moment. Luckily, I had a new reason to get back to it, and last night decided to download it again and give it a second chance. I could write about the game, I could write about me playing it and feeling this or that, but I think it should be enough to say that, after a short time, I realized it's past 5 am and I had to be at work soon. Yes, the game is slow to grab you, but once it does... omg! After just a few 'jumps' you get this horrible feeling of something being really wrong, and the need to find out what it is surpases the simple wish to play the game and finish it. It is what holds you glued to the screen to the very end, what forces you to learn how to solve those short puzzles faster so the story can continue as soon as possible, what will keep you playing even during the otherwise stupid horse riding scene, which is totally wrong for a game like this in a technical sense and could have destroyed it completely by forcing people to quit... if not for the gripping storytelling that simply does not let you move away. It's a game that I will think about a lot, and that, more than anything else, makes it a work of art. It's a well written animated book, with characters full of life, well motivated and engaging. It's something that will stop the world for you, and make you sad knowing that not everyone will have the will to give it a chance. But they should. And you should, even if it does has some annoying features. What game does not have them?			"

It opens like your typical RPG. Overhead 2D gameplay. Your main objective is to really just follow along the story...and there are a few panel based puzzles. but not too many. This is a game that's absolutely impossible to put down once you get into it just a little bit, as the music is outstanding...and the story is very well made!! Unfortunately, The only big surprise I got out of this game was the suprise that I wasn't going to be surprised...in otherwords...with how amazing the game has let me on...I expected the wrong ending. Either way. It was great. and worth a great deal of money, and then some. It makes me wish I had a machine to re-visit my memories...oh golly.			"

												To the Moon starts off slow, but as soon as the story unravels itself piece by piece, you slowly get pulled in into this emotional roller coaster where you'll feel all kinds of emotions. The soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece and is a major contributor to the game's heartfelt moments. It is a game where I was hesitant of playing, but as soon as I finished I realised what I've been missing out on. Sure it has its shortcomings, but in the end To the Moon is a must have and definitely a worthwhile experience where you'll learn that life is as beautiful as you make it out to be. Be grateful for what you have today and cherish every moment like there's no tomorrow. < 8.5 / 10 >			"

To The Moon is probably the most difficult game I’ve had to recommend so far: mainly because I have mixed opinions on various aspects of the game. For the most part, I enjoyed the it, and can agree with what a majority of steam users have to say about this splendid game. But while I found it enjoyable, it's not without its problems.The main premise of To The Moon is that two doctors-Eva and Neil (which you'll be playing as)-work for a company that ""reconstructs"" dying people's memories so that they can pretty much live their life again without any regrets. The patient in question that Eva and Neil must help is a man named Johnny, a dying old man who dreams of going to the moon. Without trying to spoil much, Eva and Neil will travel throughout Johnny's memories so that they can alter his life so that he eventually becomes an astronaut that reaches the moon (It’s a cool and simple premise that is easy to understand, and becomes even more interesting when you look at it through a symbolic point of view). They’ll also learn about his relationship with a girl named River and exactly why Johnny wants to go to the moon. The gameplay consists of you wondering around Johnny's memories looking for important moments/objects in his life so that you can go back further into Johnny's past (ex:  a toy that he's treasured all his life, or a life changing event). There really is no action in the game (the screenshot[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com] on the store page depicting a turn based battle is incredibly misleading, since it's only used on one part as a joke), although this is not a bad thing. Looking for the hidden mementos (and solving the puzzles at the end of each section) is actually kind of fun, and in narrative games like this, sometimes it’s best if there is less action. So if you’re the type of person that only plays games that involve action/fighting, stop reading this review right now. I'd also like to add that the graphics are nice (though keep in mind that the game was made on an RPG Maker engine) and so is the soundtrack (although it can be quite annoying to hear the same songs repeated, although this is a minor problem).So why exactly did I not find it fully enjoyable? I think the answer would be with the two main characters: Eva and Neil.Throughout To The Moon, there are many moments where the game will just make you want to tear up, whether it be tears of sadness or joy. With that being said, having one of the protagonists [Neil] say things such as “HADOUKEN!” and “You never cockblock someone in the middle of a kamehameha!” (yes, that is an actual quote from the game) shortly after these emotional scenes completely ruins the mood. A majority of the dialogue between the two is usually Neil making a lame joke, and then Eva responding sarcastically (or just “…”). I’m probably the only person that thinks this, but I feel that most of the time these jokes ruin the flow of the game, shifting it from a sad love story to a lame comedy. Even a majority the jokes that don’t coincide with dramatic moments come out as a bit lame: mainly because they are usually modern day reference jokes (though this is not to say they can be funny every now and then-the scene where they travel to important parts of Johnny’s life just to convince him to be an astronaut made me chuckle a bit). Aside from their sense of humor, some elements regarding what Eva and Neil do seem a bit odd. Why are Neil and Eva so hostile towards Johnny, the person they’re supposed to be helping? If they’re always this hostile to their patients and don’t feel like going through all of this, why are they working for a company that’s main goal is to help dying people? *SPOILER* Why do Eva and Neil have to run back quickly to witness the death of Johnny’s brother, even though they can reset the simulation and watch it over again (which Eva does later in the game)? These are just a few of my questions regarding the game.You’re probably thinking that I hate this game after reading the previous paragraph. Well I don’t. The rest of the game still manages to deliver a sweet, sad story about a man wanting to become an astronaut and be with the girl that he loves. Even after a while, Eva and Neil-who I spent an entire paragraph bashing-start to grow on you. It all culminates to one of the most heart-touching endings (and games) that I’ve seen in a while.Pick it up when you have the chance: you [most likely] won’t regret it.			"

												An all-round great game, I would say.I heard that this game was emotional and tragic, but had a great story. So I kind of went into this expecting to be incredibly depressed by the end. Fortunately it’s not all that bad. It has a very emotional story to it but all in all it’s a wonderfully imaginative game with a satisfying ending.Character wise, there is a nice contrast between what I guess you would call two sets of main characters. You have the couple who are followed throughout the game, and the work colleagues, that are doing the following. I say ‘contrast’ because they are pretty much opposites of each other. The couple are in love and are going through their struggles together in a very emotional way, whilst the two work colleagues are that typical brother/sister relationship. Messing around, insulting each other and generally just being a very comedic pair.The music in this game is absolutely amazing. It is integrated into the game wonderfully and it really does get those emotions going at the right times. Now, as a girl I cried a fair few times. My brother rolling his eyes as if to say ‘typical woman’ after asking if I had finished it, me swinging round with that ‘I wasn’t crying, I had something in my eye’ look. But even with that taken into account, I still think this is something that guys can enjoy as well. Maybe they won’t ‘cry’ like I did, but it still tugs on those heart strings.Story wise, I have to admit it’s not anything like I imagined it would be. I knew there was going to be a couple, a struggle and a few heartbreaking moments, but I never thought the story would be set how it is. It’s really a very surreal kind of game that I guess can be compared partially to Inception. These work colleagues are hired to do a job inside the head of their client. Which opens up a lot of possibilities for the story. It isn’t as predictable as you might think and it brings a lot of neat game mechanics with it.Finally, the graphics. I love this style of graphics and whenever I’m recommended a game with this kind of style it is always going to be something I will try. I don’t even know what you call it but I just refer to it as the Pokémon-game-ish-style. It makes the game even more unique then it already is, and strangely enough, at one point while I was playing it, I actually got the feeling that if the graphics were any different it wouldn’t be as easy to get so attached to the characters and generally get into the game. The simplistic graphics actually make it what it is, in my own opinion. All in all, it’s a wonderful game and I think it is definitely worth a try for those who like a good story. TL;DR : Great characters, beautiful music, good story and pleasing graphics. Emotional but well worth the time put into it. Buy it! "

												About the game itselfPros- One of the best story telling game I've ever play- Pretty good graphic- Beautiful musicsNote : You may need some tissues while you're playing this gameCons- Not much things to do ( Move to where the game tell you to go there, some easy puzzles )- Reading the converstion the whole game ( Pass this game if you don't like reading )- Short story ( You can finish it within 2-4 hrs depending on your reading skill xD )10/10 For me, since I don't mind reading, I love the musics ( it force me to buy the soundtracks after I've finish the game ) My personal opinions / experiences- Got this game for half a year and never try it, until one of my friend told me that I must try it. Not sure where I got this game, but it was a part of MOST bundle games in my library, which mean I got this game in real cheap price, but it was an only bundle games I've ever play and feel like "" Can't believe a bundle game was so good, it's almost made me cry ~"". It's just more awesome than bundle games. . .- I'm not usually write a reviews for games, This was my second reviews of all. but I just can't stop thinking why don't just put reviews on this games it tooo awesome ~- As I meantions above, If you willing to get the game, believe me, just get it with the soundtracks, because you're going to get it after you've finish it anyway.

												The gameplay is dull, linear and you won't ever have to make any decision tougher than in which order you want to click specific items. There is (or was) no controller support, the game has a few bugs, it's not always clearly visible where you can walk and where there's an invisible blockwall, and i dont know if there was even an option to change the resolution.The interesting thing about that is though, that it doesnt matter one bit. Play the game. Don't read any more about it, avoid any information about it as well as possible, and for goudas sake, do yourself the favor and dont watch a let's play. You would regret it forever.This game is about its story and the feelings it conveys, made possible as well by the charming artstyle and the perfect soundtrack, which now is finally available as FLAC, which is actually the reason I'm writing a review now, the soundtrack alone is worth way more than anyone ever paid for it.And one has to experience it by oneself, it would be a terrible waste to know that much about it, that there's nothing to experience anymore. Or to say it like this: If i had the chance to forget all of it, so i can replay and experience it all over again, i'd do it.Of course, it won't be everyones kind of game, I know some Idio-... people who think: ""If i want to read a story, i can read a book, i don't have to play a game for that"", but at least to me, games are way more personal. Even if you don't really have many choices, you still get more involved, by moving around in the world which the game is presenting to you, and experiencing it at your own pace, in your own way.In my admittedly kinda dull NEET-life, where every day is basically like the last, the next, or any other for that matter, I always forget what i did at some point, as there is just nothing special about it. But i can remember one of those days clearly. I remember sitting in my room (well, as always), tucked in a blanket, drinking rooibos tea. It was evening outside, later even night, and it was snowing with the snow lying around 6-8centimeters high. I still had some peels lying next to my screen, from the clementines i ate earlier that day, and they and the rooibos distributed a comfortable fragrance throughout the room.And i remember all this for one reason only. It was the day that i played To the Moon.			"

												I knew To the Moon received a lot of praise, I had it in my library for a long time but never tried it. I finally decided to see what is was about. It started slowly, it didn't catch my interest right away. But I kept playing past the first hour and could not put it away until it was over. I played the whole game in one sitting (4.5 hours), it was truly amazing.The graphics are not what make this game great, the gameplay is minimalist, very linear as you cannot decide how the story will change, you just walk around and do whatever is required to keep the story unfolding in front of you. But the story is amazing, touching, sad and beautiful, sometimes funny, simply brilliant. It would make an awesome movie, I hope they do it someday. It would without any doubt become the best movie based on a video game ever made.If you have a heart, you must play this game.			"

												To the Moon is a game that wants to be played; no.  It DEMANDS to be played.I'll be the first to say that the 16-bit gameplay isn't earth-shattering.  I'll also say that the minigame that is a part of the forward gameplay isn't particularly masterminded...just being a sliding puzzle.  Yet here I am still writing a review on To the Moon because it has still left a footprint on me.  What does set this game apart however  is the impeccable writing and story.  There are moments you find yourself smiling at the humor, and there are moments you find yourself saddened with the emotional connections you are making with the characters.  I finally broke down to purchase this game during the Autumn Steam Sale because of all the rave things I had heard on reddit.com from users about this game.The game will take only about 4 HRs of your time, and most certainly will leave you yearning for more storytelling like this.  This musical composition is near genius with original pieces, and the fact that they were able to make such a moving game on this kind of medium says more than anything my review ever could.  THIS is why we support Indie games.  I can still tangibly feel the heart and soul that were placed with love into this game.			"

												I was late to a party. However It's all thanks to one of my friend who recommended and gave this story driven masterpiece to me.To the Moon is a short role-playing adventure video game developed by Freebird Games. The game focuses nothing more than driving you into story with high speed train. With little gameplay no more than interaction and solving small puzzle. A story is about two doctor. Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts who have a machine that can grant anyone wish by diving into patient's memories then reconstructing them into what patients want and what needed to fulfill their wish. A machine is capable of uncovering any patient's memory at any life time, even the ones that patients don't remember.To the Moon, this is one of Johnny's wish, and his wish sounds exactly like that, he wants to go to the moon. The entire story will be involved around fulfill said wish but things seems to not be as easy as it sounds, as the two doctors uncover more and more secrets regarding Johnny himself during his whole life time and the whole things about go to the moon itself.This is really a game for expressing story and story alone. In order to express story effectively of course, is to use suitable musics. This game have the best set of musics that can narrow every single inches of story they want to present, it's emotion, it's happy and it's sad, they have everything. An astounding of depth in both story and music synced, they enough to touch anyone heart, they simply show how memories could be such things that influence the life of one person and what caused him or her to behave that way.For a small price like this game, it surprisingly gives me more than I could ask for. I didn't expect this small game to teach me something about life and drive me cry like this. I recommend anyone who want some short story worth of 4 hours that put you in a train and then simply hook your feelings to a heart of this whole story right away.Another note; Right after you've finished to the moon story, you should also play both DLC mini story. They explain more about two main characters, Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts. Even it's just last 1 hour each it packs with some interesting facts for these two and probably rise more questions. You shouldn't miss it if you have a chance. Those DLCs are free so make sure you play them as well.			"

*Non Spoiler Review*Even though at the very beginning I was put off by the old styled, low-resolution graphics and without any previous knowledge about this game, it very quickly grew on me soon after I started it. The dialogues, sadly all just in written form, are both funny and extremely touching.And... I... have... never... before... cried... this... much... in my life, because of a video game!!! Seriously, how can such a ""simple"" point & click puzzle adventure move me to tears? Answer: The story! The characters! Even though they're just plain pixels, you feel a deep connection to these characters, from the two buddy scientists to the tragic couple with a very complex backstory which unfolds chapter after chapter, memory after memory. Gameplaywise you won't be overwhelmed, though sometimes still a bit challenged, especially when you can't find all the necessary clues at first or have to figure out the minigames. But with some time you'll get the groove of it. Also there's always some good humour interjected into the experience. Nevertheless, when you finally have reached the ending, and you've both laughed and used enough tissues to wipe away your tears (stop being so dirty minded, people!), there's just one thing to say: WOW! A big bravo to the people who wrote this story and developed the characters. This would actually make an excellent mini series (for a feature film it might be a bit too long)!			"

												Personally I liked this game , but to be honest not for everyone. Read an equal mixture of positive/negative reviews and decide. PROS~The story*~Characters (although most info on the protagonists will be found in the minisodes)~The art (*) The story is good , but not great. Fans of the game may say it is ""GENIUS"" but in my opinion there was no genius plot element or twist, it was a a good and nice story and that`s all.CONS~The controls*~The humor**(*) The characters` movements feel ""slidey"" . I think the maps are made on a grid pattern so if you use a keyboard you might stop pressing the key but the character will keep moving to the end block , it creates a ""slidey"" feeling and puts me kinda off. You can of couse you can use a mouse so it`s up to you , I prefer keyboard and the keyboard didn`t feel right.(**) The humor feels forced and cringey. Dr.Watts for example constantly makes jokes and puns, I think they are intentionally written bad and cringey but I think it was unnecessary. I personally suggest you try it, you will probably like it.7/10			"

This game tells a story in a beautiful way, and keeps you glued to the screen throughout. Mixing sentiment and humor well. The game is about 3-4 hours long , but worth every penny. I got this game as a gift and feel like it is just one of those games you need to share with someone you care about, and I will. Buy the soundtrack too. It fits the game like a glove, but as a standalone playlist of music it can be enjoyed anywhere. Not to mention that they donate 50% of the soundtrack price you pay to charity. Even if you are not a point and click adventure fan you may find that this game will make you one. It might be my favorite adventure game I have played to date. Highly recommend this game.			"

												I played this game long ago and I keep forgetting to review it. It is a good game, but a little bit overrated, don't expect something big out of it, first of all it is not an RPG game as how it looks like, it is more like an adventure visual novel with a little bit of interaction. You can control your characters and move them, but there is no fight or random monsters popping up to you ever two minutes, the game is a story telling, a beautiful story although I wished for a different ending. I liked the two main characters, I actually liked all the characters and suspected many things as the story going, but something different happened by the end of the game.Pro:+Amazing music, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard while playing a game, it fit every scene and blend well.+Interesting story.+Mystery.+Easy achievements, only one and you will get it once you finish the game.+Steam achievements.Cons:-Limited interaction in the game.-Ending kind of.. unsatisfying but not bad. You will still like your experience of the game.I recommend this game to everyone, the experience alone is nice and you'll enjoy the music, plus there is a second part of the game 'Finding Paradise' which will be out in summer of 2017!

												To the Moon is so far, my favourite game experience. Why ? you might ask. Answer is simple: STORY. This game is superbly written, it beats most movies that i saw recently , also every single game i played recently . It has charming humour, sad/dramatic moments and what is important, these two aspects have great correlation. Also game is well paced, what cause I went through it in one session (that is not ussual for me). AND! Silly me i forgot the second greatest thing about this game. MUSIC. Music component is very importatnt for me in every single thing, and music here is AMAZING! I will listen to from now till eternity. To the Moon was emotional rollercoaster and in future i will gladly take one more ride.Grade: A+ "

Truly, To the Moon is more of a interactive story-telling experience than it is a video game. And it's a story you're gonna love.			"

												I just finished ""To the Moon"". Though I doubt I'm the expected or intended audience (57-year old male) I DID enjoy the game, but as to loving it? Not so sure.The writing wasn't realistic, being more on the level of teenage dialog. That, combined with some very mature themes (meaning concepts, not parentally objectionable items) created an odd blending. The mixing in of mini-games further contributed to a sense of (almost) absurdity, especially the (in my opinion) completely unnecessary zombie game. At about the halfway point I found myself intending to finish, but wishing it wouldn't take too much longer. Then things changed. Around the middle of Act 2 the story became deeper, more real, more emotional. I did NOT cry, but I will admit to tearing up at the absolute purity of the young love that EVEN old men dream of. And the music was VERY nice.My opinion isn't important, other than to me. Yes, I AM glad I played this game. Perhaps due to the nature of it, it needed the filling-out that I found slightly tedious and unnecessary, without which the game would have been still shorter. While I might not recommend this to other 57-year old men, I would CERTAINLY suggest it for almost anyone else. (I would have been nice to get the achievement, but apparently that doesn't happen on a Mac. The brief gametime is result of offline play.)			"

												I try to review games as I finish them, so I can look back on them later. Weeks, months, years down the road - they help me remember the way a game made me feel, or even the person I was when I was at that particular time.To the Moon, for some reason, I never reviewed.Was it because upon completion, I was crying? Reflecting? Contemplating the meaning of life? Experiencing the dreaded feels?Yeah, probably.In To The Moon you take control of two doctors/scientists who have been hired by a dying man to grant his last wish - to go the moon. Though it is an odd request, the doctors do not question it. But to get him there, they must piece together his blurred memories, of loss, of love, of his complicated relationship with the love of his life.It feels almost intrusive to walk through a stranger's most delicate memories, and they invite you to examine your own relationships with the ones you love, flawed and complex as they may be.Play when you're contemplative, you won't regret it.

												I just.. I sat down and did this game start to end and simply couldn't put it down. It's incredibly powerful and sad. There have been a very small handful of stories that I'd say have made a really deep impression on me, something I end up remembering for the rest of my life, those tales and characters that are so touching and poignant that they sort of become part of me, making me want to dedicate and live my life for them and succeed where they could not, and become a better person that way.This is one of those stories. And I absolutely will not tell you the plot of the story. I could never do it justice. The game presents all these weird puzzling plot items and ideas at the start of the game, but then ties them together in Act 3. My gosh. It hit me so hard.The game flirts with existential philosophy, and that is referenced a couple times by the characters but is more an undertone of the game rather than the main focus and story. There is also a fair amount of banter and humour between the two playable characters, that had me laughing out loud on occasion.It has a very linear plotline and map and is written in the RPG Maker XP engine. Slightly clunky UI, the windowed mode is incredibly small and unable to be resized, so the game is meant to be played full screen. Nothing too egrerious however, I found a couple small annoyances like movement obstacles and not knowing where to go during the horse part, but they were easily ignored. The soundtrack is simple and haunting and even plays a minor role within the story.			"

[SPOILER FREE]I simply can not state how this game made me feel during it's last hours and especially in the end. This is one true masterpiece, a game to be forever remembered for it's unique storytelling, dialogue and characters. The game gets really emotional in a way I've never seen since Mass Effect 2 (Yes, it is THAT good), but it also features great sense of humor, really nice pixelart and an incredible - to say the least - soundtrack. The only flaw I see in this game is the lack of an options menu, since the game apparently doesn't run at the native resolution of your desktop.Overall, I believe that any story driven gamer should play this.Strongly recommended.9.3/10 "

												This game is beauty and art in their purest forms. I've read a lot of books, I've watched a lot of movies, and I've played a lot of games, but never have I come across something that has caused me so much emotional turmoil and heartwrenching bittersweet feelings than this simple visual novel. The visuals are beautiful, the music consistently compliments the mood so well while being some of the best songs I've ever heard, and the characters are so well developed I could reach out and touch them. Whether you love games or have never played one before, whether you cannot stop reading novels or have only picked up books required by your classes,  this game will stun and astound you.			"

												This game, if you want to call it that, was possibly one of the most well written and heart felt stories I have had the pleasure of being a part of.  It's a prime example of what great Indie artists can accomplish.  From start to finish, the story had me involved, wanting more, and at many a times, emotionally invested to the point of tears.  I cannot recommend this enough for the truly captivating tale of love and loss that this game brings to life.  Also, don't be afraid of the tears that are bound to come, you'll feel better in the morning about life, love, hope and what tomorrow may bring.  So tear up, it's good for you.			"

To the Moon is a beautifully written game that brings tears to my eyes one minute, creeps me out the next and after it's done all that it makes me laugh like an idiot, a big factor of this is the music. The mainly acoustic piano soundtrack is amazingly written to fit each situation, so well in fact it made me actually look up the sheet music, print it out and start learning the pieces. To the Moon is full of story and tons of humour that can make you laugh out loud, it deserves every single good recommendation it gets.

												I payed a mere $1.99 whilst it was on sale, what a steal.I would be very happy to pay full price for this masterpiece, everything about it was sublime. The not so subtle TV show references when breaking a memento, the world design, the game mechanics...  I'm not going to comment on the story that was told as I don't wish to potentially spoil anything, suffice it to say it will make you cry MANLY tears. The soundtrack is one of the few soundtracks I have even thought of purchasing in my lifetime; it was beautiful.I've played this through once, and I certainly will be again. Not to mention the DLC is free! This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most well executed games I have played and will every play. Hats off to Freebird Games for giving us this piece of art. I'll be giving A Bird Story a go and if it's even half as good as this was I'll be over the moon *unintentional pun I swear*I cannot recommend this enough, buy it and steam share your library to your friends if they do not wish to purchase it; it's a must play.10/10 "

												9.5/10So... You're here to take me to the moon?OverviewTo The Moon doesn't offer much in the gameplay department. It doesn't present stunning visuals nor is it particularly exciting... But it doesn't pretend to offer any of those things. It's short, honest, beautiful and emotionally consuming. A solid piece of masterful storytelling.StoryThe story follows the whimsical Dr. Neil Watts and level-headed Dr. Eva Rosalene, high-ranking employees of the Sigmund Agency of Life corporation, a service that specializes in altering a terminal person's memory before time of death in order to make their dreams come true. Basically, they're selling deathbed happiness.To The Moon isn't a comedy, though it's hilarious. It isn't a tragedy though it's heart-rending. What it is is brilliant. The dialogue is as powerful and relatable as the thematic is harrowing. I don't want to go into too much detail about the story; I want you to experience the twisty narrative of it by yourselves.GameplayAt first glance, the game plays like you'd expect an RPG to play, minus any form of combat or statistical management. The gameplay mechanics are bare-bones: You walk around, talk with people and interact with objects to progress in a linear fashion. The walk-and-interact gameplay is briefly diversified every now and then with a series of flip-tile puzzles. These are never too difficult and are not detrimental to the experience in the least. Other unexpected gameplay elements are also introduced for brief segments, all of which are an appreciated change of pace.Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene enter the mind of John (their patient) and start off in a late memory. They need to understand the patient's history in order to progress farther back into his past and construct variables to influence the patient's future. The goal is simple: Work your way through John's memories and spark the changes that will alter his future forever.AudioThe original soundtrack may be the strongest aspect of the game. It's strongly in-tune with the emotions that the game attempts to pull out of you and often feels like it leads the resulting impressions. I can't lie, I had to hold back tears to Laura Shigihara's ""Everything's Alright"" when it ripped the limelight from the scene during which it's presented.TechnicalThough the game isn't a technical marvel in itself, the user interface is pretty bland and appears ""cheap"". The lack of options or settings is odd and the game does not support the Steam overlay. These are all very minor shortcomings and I could only bring myself to shave off a fraction of a point for these. The game otherwise runs well, saves automatically to prevent progress loss and it all just works.The TL;DRAn engaging fable of love, waning time and the human condition it encompasses. A tale of fabrication and untruth. This is a story you likely won't soon forget. It lingers with you. A tragic comedy.To The Moon is a success. A brilliant, sense-shattering success.			"

												This game made me realize that being bigger and having beautiful graphics is not always better.  More than anything else, game developers should strive to give us games that are both memorable and satisfying.  A game that makes you feel and experience something extraordinary.     To the Moon is not gorgeous in terms of graphics.  What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for its interactive story telling.  It lets you take part in a tale that is both hearthwarming and incredibly tragic.     The story immerses you and engages you to fulfill a dying man's (Johnny) last wish to go the moon, by altering his memory and replacing them with alternates ones.     What really made the journey interactive is how you put together bits and pieces of his memory and various highlights of his life and love story with wife (River) in order to progress forward in the story.        You will also be carried away by the games soundtrack, specially its main theme also entitled - To The Moon.  It really enhances your game experience and sets the mood in every game sequence.  The game, however, is relatively short, but the game content is what all that matters to me.  The game's message about life and death and the joys and difficulties we might or have already experienced did struck a chord.  In the end all we have our just cherished memories of our loved ones. The moral of the game is' if we had the chance and the ability to change our past, Will you do it?  Maybe some for me.       I really recommend this to a mature audience or even someone who needs a break from the run and gun games we have in our games library.  Kudos to the game developers for giving us such a wonderful game.  Can't wait for the next installment.			"

												I felt that this game was held back entirely by it's two main leads who felt the need to share their ""hilarious"" commentary throughout the entire story. Their banter felt so forced and awkward that I'm amazed at all the positive reviews on steam. The controls were also very clunky and the mouse clicks didn't give proper feedback when using it to control the characters movement. The music was good though and I thought that the story had some pretty interesting twists and turns. It's just too bad that games writing felt very immature and even inappropriate at times given the topic.I honestly think you'd just be better off just listening to the games soundtrack since the game is only 3-4 hours long and you wouldn't be missing much by not playing it.

												One of the very best games out there. It has a very strong storyline. This game has everything; mystery and suspense which keeps you on the edge of your seat, emotional moments that'll move you in a way that very few games would ever have. The game has great dialogues consisting of wit and humour. The soundtrack is simply amazing and it changes according to the situations in the game. This is a game that will get you deeply attached to the characters, it will simultaneously break your heart and warm it.I actually completed the game at a stretch of a few hours. The story had me compelled to play it. It literally made me cry at some points and made me really happy at times. I felt strongly for the characters and it hurt me when something bad happened to them. It would be unbelievable if someone told me he/she didn't shed a  single drop of tear in this.

												I remember when this game came out in my junior year of high school. Great time. I was an awkward, nerdy little ♥♥♥♥ with more time than I'd care to admit and I guess I was looking for something that'd make me *feel* stuff. One night, a couple of buddies were over and we all decided we wanted to play something with a story. Something that'd eat up a couple of hours and keep us all focused.Enter: To The MoonAs one of my buddies narrated the dialogue, we were absolutely enthralled. We couldn't tear ourselves away. How did we get so wrapped up in what was essentially a move-and-click sprite game with cliche tropes and easy puzzles? By the end of that session, we'd finished the game and, for reasons you'll understand if you decide to play through, all of us sat in the dark and cried for a while while we talked about what we'd just experienced.I cared about the characters, I loved the soundtrack, and every moment of the game made me feel warm and fuzzy. I've sat down to show it to a few people over the years since then, and even though the magic and surprise is gone, I still can't help but smile like an idiot or get a little teary-eyed while I play this game.Ladies and gentlemen, regardless of your age, if you buy one story-driven walking simulator this year, don't let it be Dear Esther or one of the seventeen ripoffs of that game; let it be To The Moon.

												To the Moon, despite its soft name, has a rather compelling and uniquely colorful story that often lends to unsettling themes in regards to life/fate. Although being, arguably, a downer type of story, there are witty dashes of wry humor to liven the mood. Has remarkable usage of sprite art and music as well.Would recommend for squirrel roadkill.

												That's the most wonderful, the saddest/happiest and the most emotional game I have ever played.Honestly, its developers are geniuses/saddists here for making such a game using easy to get gamemaking tools.If you want to take a part in a story that breaks your heart this is a game for you. And you will never look at paper bunnies the same way.The only glitch is the achievement to gain: for now you have to play on WINDOWS and in ENGLISH to make it happen. At first I played in Polish so it didn't count. I had to change the language in settings to English and replay the last auto-save.But above that... 4 hours of heart-melting gameplay. It's worth it.

												To The Moon is a story-driven point and click adventure game that also incorporates puzzle elements. The gameplay mechanics are simple and incredibly easy to pick up. You won't ever find yourself stumped or frustrated at this game, since the gameplay is used to pace the plot perfectly. Without revealing too many spoilers, at its heart To The Moon is a love story. It's also much more than that, it delves right into topics such as life and death, regrets and even fate. If you're a pessimist, this is a story that will restore your faith in humanity and make you believe in love again. It had just the right amount of humor thrown in, you just can't help but smile at how silly one of the characters can be at times. It plucked on your heartstrings plenty as well, and I'm comfortable enough with my manliness to admit that there were a few moments when I was on the verge of tears, both out of sadness and out of happiness.The pixel art is beautiful and charming. A lot of care and thought was placed into the art style and I never imagined that 8 bit graphics could be so expressive. The only minor flaw I found with the game, and it's incredibly minor, is that the game runs in a set resolution and there is no option to run the game windowed. It's probably for the best, since running the game windowed can easily break the immersion. It isn't a terribly long game, it took me just under 4 hours to complete. You will want to set aside a healthy chunk of time to dedicate to this game though. I highly recommend playing this through all in one sitting, though if you're anything like me, that won't even be an option. I was so immersed into this game, I don't even think I glanced at my second monitor the last 3 hours of play, let alone get up from my chair. The soundtrack is beautiful, filled with piano arrangements that accompany the story so well. Every aspect of this game has a simple elegance to it that adheres to you at such a fundamental level. This is a game that will stay on your mind long after you've finished playing it.To The Moon is damn near perfect. It's not often that I play a game where I struggle to point out flaws or things I wished the developers changed. It's not often that I am so entranced by a game, I am glued to my computer chair until the end credits scroll past my screen. Even now, as I'm writing this review, listening to the game's soundtrack, I still feel goosebumps. This game has affected me on a level deeper than any other game ever has. The story in this game easily stands as one of the most beautiful and touching tales I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in ANY form of media. This game is absolutely amazing, and it's one that everybody should try, even non-gamers.			"

												Wonderfully written gem of a game. Fans of Visual Novels will especially appreciate this one. It contains an interesting mix of scifi, mystery and drama; all delightfully wrapped up in an little indie title. When it all comes together, you'll have that 'I just realized...' moment that will tug at your heart strings. It's beautiful and really leaves a lasting impression. That is to say, it is short, but sweet.Also, I can pretty much garuantee you'll have the piano music stuck in your head for a LONG time if you play this.			"

												'To the Moon' is intelligent, well written and extremely creative. Two scientists dive into a dying man's mind to alter his memories in order to fulfil his final wish. And yes, the game is just as awesome as it sounds. It has some really cool moments and even though the idea is pretty surreal, it is presented to you in a way that it just sucks you in and the game MAKES you believe it is all actually possible. Not only that, you will feel for these characters. Rarely have there been games that tug on my heart strings the way this game did. Some people seem to finish it in one sitting, take 2 or 3 hours to complete it but it took me 5.2 hours for 1 playthrough from beginning to end. I like to be thorough in my games, especially the story heavy ones that rely on exploration. You will want to take it all in with this game because it is just that good.It is a very basic point and click game, nothing overly complicated and it doesn't require too much work, there are some minor riddles to solve but in the end, it relies for the most part on its emotion heavy story. The game is story driven and the visuals and soundtrack are both there to intensify the experience. Some songs might come over as repetitive (something actually made fun of within the game itself) but you will hardly notice this because the music is just that good. The graphics are reminiscent of the Super Nintendo era and it works for this game. Finally 'To the Moon' is jam packed with useless nerdy trivia for gamers and people who watch all the good tv shows.'To the Moon' is dark, atmospheric and you won't leave the game unmarked.			"

												To the Moon tells one of the most heartwarming stories in gaming. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy it - it's truly a game for all ages. To say too much about the plot would ruin the magic, but just imagine if you had the power to give a dying person any wish they could desire. How would you do that?True, the graphics are basic, but the beautiful music and characters more than make up for that.My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that the gameplay is very minimal. Little beyond fetching items. So you won't lose much by watching a playthrough on YouTube.But regardless of how you chose to experience this game, trust me, make sure you do.

												To The Moon is an emotional journey, one that I haven't really ever experienced in games. It's a game with RPG Maker graphics so it looks simple, but its strength lies in its storytelling.The way the story is told is done in a way that will keep you (mostly) interested during the entire experience. While it lasts only 4 hours or so, there's very little gameplay involved (there's even a somewhat frustrating part near the end).Even though the game lacks in the graphics department, it makes up for it by its amazing soundtrack. I enjoyed it so much that I even bought it seperately afterwards.Keep an open mind, ignore the graphics and just enjoy the ride.A must own !(It should earn the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" award)[Rating: 83/100]			"

												To The Moon is everything I want in a game,  Sure, it has little gameplay and is more interactive story than really a game, but this it handles perfectly. It is one of the rare games that made me laugh, cry and feel with the characters on screen, which not many games manage to do nowadays. The story within is very human, touching, and well handled in its build up till its very tear-inducing conclusion. It is a story about people, about love and loss, and every fine nuance in between. Honestly, I can't hardly recall any game --or media in general -- which moved me to this extent like it did. Yes, it is limited in its graphics, being an RPG-Maker game, though it does use it in a very charming and heartwarming way, accompanied by beautiful music extra composed for the game. To say more would mean to spoil it, so let me conclude in saying that playing To The Moon was a very unique and great experience, and I'm thankful for having made it.			"

												To The Moon has the most moving story I've ever experienced, not just in games, but anywhere.  The game only takes a couple hours to complete, but it is definitely worth it just to experience the story.  The music is beautiful as well and fits perfectly with the story.The gameplay, however, is at the level where some people may not even call it a game.  While it looks like a classic JRPG, the level of interaction offered is very low.  It mostly consists of walking around to discover what triggers the next cutscene.  At some points the level of interaction offered is almost insulting, with the game giving you control just for a couple seconds to do something easily accomplished during the cutscene.  It's almost as if it's trying to remind you that you're playing a game, not watching the story.  Later in the game, it turns into more of a hidden object game where you solve simple puzzles between chapters which is much more pleasing.To The Moon is a game that needs to be experienced.  It's too difficult to put it into words, especially without giving any spoilers.			"

												'한 편의 아름다운 소설과 감미로운 음악을 동시에 체감하며 즐길 수 있는 작품' 게임이란 넓은 범주에서 보면 인간이 즐길 수 있는 모든 것을 포함할 것이다. 투 더 문은 이런 넓은 범주에서의 게임에 속한다. 투 더 문을 하면서 느낀 게임의 '장르'적인 방식은 마치 '디어 에스더'와 비슷하다. 유저가 게임을 직접하면서 개입할 수 있는 것은 거의 없으며, 게임적인 요소도 거의 없는 점이 비슷하다. 유저가 할 수 있는 행동은 이동과 단서 모으기 및 퍼즐 맞추기 뿐. 하지만, 이러한 요소 중 단서 모으기 및 퍼즐 맞추기는 절묘하게 스토리적인 '시스템'에 부합해서 어색함이 없다. 다만 이런 게임적 요소도 챕터 1에서 끝나버린다. 이 게임을 하게되면 유저는 4시간 가량되는 플탐동안 감미로운 OST와 감동을 이끌어내는 스토리를 별다른 개입 없이 체험만 하게된다. 게임의 스토리 요소와 OST는 매우 높은 평가와 점수를 줄만하다. 하지만, 어찌보면 그냥 비주얼 노블 마냥 진행되는 게임의 방식에 질리는 유저도 분명 존재할 것이다. 게임인가 소설인가. 그것은 직접 유저들이 판단할 문제지만 어떻게든 이 게임을 구매한 유저들에게 만족감을 준다면 그건 그거대로 좋은 작품이라는 뜻이되지 않을까? 투 더 문 시리즈의 미래를 봤을 때, 앞으로도 후속작들이 이런 방식으로 나올 것이 거의 확실한 듯 해보인다. 여러 떡밥을 해결하기 위해 작가가 스토리를 어떻게 풀어갈지 후속작도 기대가 되는 작품이다.

												Don't let the store page screenshots fool you, this game is not an RPG despite being made with RPG Maker (The squirrel battle is an ingame joke), It's a linear 16bits-ish adventure game.Talk to people, look for some items, do a few puzzles, and follow the story. The sad, touching, tear-jerking story. Seriously, if you don't cry you're not human. It's hard to talk about why the game is so great without spoiling the story. The characters have a profound personality rarely seen in a videogame, and they share a deep pure love. The beautiful music just make the experience even more enjoyable.There's two control schemes, arrow keys or mouse (No WASD for you). Mouse control can be a bit clunky sometimes, with your characters not going at first click where they're supposed to go; playing with a keyboard is faster and more efficient but then you won't have a clue about what things you can interact with.You can choose from 10 different languages. The game lasts around 4 hours and doesn't really have replay value, but it's worthy.			"

												You know, day by day, year by year, games will be dated except To The Moon. 5 years later, 10 years later, world can change, technology can evolve but this is still a glorious masterpiece. It takes you few hours to finish the game (about 4-6 hours) but you will spend several days or months thinking about it, about your goals, your life, your fate. This game taught me that I cannot change it, cannot change my fate, the only thing I (and you) can do is choose the way to live and die without regretting.			"

												'Ladies and gentleman, welcome aboard the feels train. Todays destination will be: the Moon!'Okay let's be honest: the gameplay of 'To the Moon' is quite boring, it's repetitive and often more annoying than entertaining. It's not the typical 'Fighting & Fantasy'-RPG-Maker game but a strictly linear adventure whichsets its focus on the story about an old man and his dying wish. Sure, there are minigames and some 'better' levels, but after the fifth time collecting some memory links to go on to the next level I just thought 'C'mon just skip this, I don't want to do this agai-... great another memory link level'. But I still recommend this game - without any doubts - to everyone who enjoys a good story.You ask why? It'S true, for me 'To the Moon' is an 'average' game at best, but at the same time it's a fantastic 'movie' with an interesting story backed up by an amazing soundtrack, well-written dialogues, interesting characters and an atmosphere that makes up for many flaws. I really enjoyed the plot and the great dialogues between the characters and you can definitly see how much time the developers used to make every scene create the right emotional situation. And - at least in my case - they succeeded.			"

												Note: I received a copy of To The Moon for my birthday!First off I would like to start by stating that you don't actually have to use your mouse (some people get annoyed), you can use your arrow keys and your space bar (interaction key) and just use your mouse as a guide. Also, this game's graphics isn't the best (pixel art) but I promise it actually grows on you and you will start to like it. Especially because there are some sick illustrations later on.Positives:+ Deep storyline (very well thought out, kudos to the Developer's efforts) - you don't actually know what to expect when you first start playing this game; it's much more than you think it is+ Relatively nice graphics (Pixel Art)+ Beautiful and fitting music (Situational)+ Extra minisodes (DLCS)+ Character development is simply wonderful, and very well done+ Good excuse to go grab some ice cream as soon as you get to 'Act 3' (I cried a little)+ Maps aren't too large, but large enough to explore thoroughly and enjoyably especially with the little dialogues or things you pick up+ Relatively easy puzzles, but not too easy - it also displays the lowest amount of moves needed to complete the puzzle which makes you visualise the outcomes and how to complete it with the least amount of moves. Tip: As soon as it tells you about the diagonal flipping, use it because almost every puzzle afterwards requires it (to achieve least amount of moves)+ Saving options are very well thought out - automatic saves for important actions and you can also use manual saving+ There are nice little extras in the game menu where it shows you the items you have and specific 'notes' or interesting things you have found out - this is updated quite frequently and worth your time to check outNegatives:- Although I loved the character development and thought it was very well done, I definitely would have liked it more if there was more background information about Johnny's mother. We only know a little about her but I feel like she plays a bigger role than that.- Puzzles that can get repetitive (it's not too bad)- Walking speed is quite slow and can get annoying waiting for them to hurry up- Some larger maps can get tedious - walking around and finding thingsOverall:The main focus of the actual game (storyline) is very beautiful, relatable and enjoyable. It made me cry after 'Act 3' at various scenes (those who have played know what I mean). The way the story is set out seems a bit odd at first, but as you continue on it makes a lot of sense and I feel is the perfect way to lay it out. The ending was simply beautiful and you don't really see it coming - in fact, you don't see many events (plot twists people) happening until it does. There is a little bit of humour, especially with the protagonists and it's a very deep, heartfelt story. Despite the negatives, I would like to say that the postitives definitely outweigh the negatives.I love stories like these because you don't have to make any serious choices, yet the choices the protagonists make, makes you think about your morals and what you would do in such a situation. I've spent some time considering the many options and the options the protagonists made plus the repurcussions and their situations, and I finally came to the conclusion of what was morally correct. I'm fully content with the ending. I think this game is a lot about the morality of how these people help the man, as well as others. The DLCs do explore the concept of morality and how some people think what they do is immoral.Score: 9/10It's not perfect but it's close enough. Definitely worth the full price (and if you like the music, get the soundtracks too) and you get free minisodes (DLCS).I could go on and on and on... But let me say this: Just play the game, you won't regret it.			"

												Great, great game. I must say that I was rather surprised by how the developer managed to make a very good story fit within the short length that the game is. The story, in my opinion, is the biggest highlight of the game, followed by the sweet soundtrack. It manages to be both really clever and moving, and the textual dialogue within the game contains that quality to it that I absolutely love, which is the one that brings emotion and personality into the written words. The one that makes the characters sound more human, and that familiarity with them renders them very emotionally potent; a kind of emotional truth that we experience at a biochemical level quite the same as we would with strangers whom we get to know with time.I suppose that the only one I genuinely have with the game is the fact that it only runs on 640x480 in Windows. While the art is still very good, it's a shame that it's not possible to experience the game in bigger resolutions. The lack of an options menu for that is an issue, and it's bad that the Steam overlay doesn't work with the game as well. Albeit, as usual with other RPG Maker games, the game's properties and settings can be easily accessed by pressing F1. Those can be used to alter the game's controls, in case the player isn't satisfied with them. They're smooth and easy to learn, however.Any gamer that loves games that are story driven must have this in their library. To The Moon contains a heartwarming narrative, good characters, fine art, and a wondrous soundtrack. This is something to be paid attention to.  It's simple, yet powerful. It's short, but gripping. It's part of why it's as impressive as it is. Very recommended, thank you for this stunning journey, Freebird Games. 9.1/10.0 "

												When I first heard about this game I heard it was very sad and I thought to myself how sad could a game be? So I bought it and firgured I would only play it for about an hour while I had something downloading. I after playing for about 10 minutes I was really liking the story so I kept playing and the thing I had downloading was done after about an hour but I just couldn't stop playing the game, the story was getting really good. I beat in the average time for everyone which is about 4-5 hours and the game left me speechless it has one of the best stories I have ever experienced probably the only game that has ever made me cry the only game that has ever came close to doing that was Red Dead Redemption. The games soundtrack was fantastic and totally worth buying. It has very likable characters and a emotional and amazing story. I recommend playing this game in one sitting if you have about 5 hours to kill. You should buy this game trust me you won't regret it. 10/10			"

												Its barely a game, its a piece of art. It starts slow, but it gets progressively better having a peak at the very end. Level of emotional involvement is just incredible that almost no AAA titles have and guarantee you great experience, just with a bit simple and lacking gameplay, but amazing story to put you through.Couple doctors arrive to grant dying man last wish - ""To the Moon"". How hard can it be to go through old man's memories and alternate his past, his dreams for young qualified doctors, to ensure his adjusted dream-life brings him to the moon before he dies? Apparently dying man doesn't know why he wants go to the moon at the first place, he just does. Doctors are going to discover that its not about him, its about people he loves and cares; its about his only dream he worked for his whole life; its about connection between all those things. Would one dream destroy another one and all he lived for? Would it make him miserable, make him find something new, both or something else? Is there time to make it work? This game is so alive and tense it almost made me cry. I witnessed beautiful dreams, lives, endings, losses, achievements and success altogether, leading man to his dream, To the Moon and everything beyond it.			"

Never read any reviews, had absolutely zero fμcking clue what it was about. I honestly thought it was some kind of space exploration game.Clunky controls, pixel art, cheesy dialogue...thought this was gonna be your typical indie game.Let me just say, ""Wow."" I wasn't ready for this. What a rollercoaster. This game helped me discover emotions I never knew I had. It's incredibly depressing, just flashing through a person's lifetime of memories like that...I'm glad that the cheesy dialogue was in there. Great balance of cheerful and poignant moments.

												At first glance, To the Moon may simply look like another of those retro-coated adventures or RPGs that go dime a dozen these days. Granted, it is technically a text-driven, point-n-click adventure with a few minigames here and there. Yet when experienced in its entirety, it becomes clear that it is much more than that.Fresh from credits rolling, I can say that it's one of the best stories I've ever been told through the medium of video games. It's a unique, humane piece, unlike any I've come to experience; so elaborately woven together, so well-written and touching with flawless pacing all-around that I could have easily enjoyed it as a book if the author, Kan Gao, had chosen to tell it so. Better yet, this superb script is accompanied by an exquisite audio-visual package that enriches the adventure greatly. The result of the amalgamation of these expertly crafted elements was an experience so rich that I couldn't help myself going through it in a single session, caring about every single one of its small cast of characters and wondering what would I uncover about them next all the way. Needless to say, I found myself being amazed from scene to scene, as the 'game' was delivering everything to be expected from a true work of art in spades.The fact that this kind of an experience is not coming from of a first-tier developer but born from the minds and crafted in the hands of a small group of individuals with a small budget is only a nod to their talent. I must admit that I wasn't expecting such a fine-tuned creation with this much of an impact when I first booted the game. But here I am, after a five-hour rollercoaster of emotions, feeling all the more human thanks to this excellent work of art disguised as a game.My advice, don't lose any more time reading about To the Moon. Get it, live through it and see if it doesn't take a place among your most precious gaming memories, 'cause it surely got itself one of the best for me.			"

												Absolutely sensational storytelling. Very few games out there succeed in excellent story and character development that attracts and scars players. To The Moon is one of the few that does an outstanding job in not only nailing this, but also leaving a long-lasting impact.Without revealing too much to those that have yet to play - You assume control of two Doctors – Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene – whom work for an agency whose job is to reconstruct certain aspects of dying people's memories and fulfil their deepest wishes before their lights are out; in this case, taking Johnny to the Moon. The reason to which I will not explain in this review, otherwise there would be no point in going through all the emotions this game sets out to deliver. Though you can expect a story filled with excellent dialogue and character development with plenty of unpredictable momentsGameplay is fairly straight forward and pretty much the same as TWD or any point-and-click game for that matter. There are a few mini-games and puzzles to add that little challenge factor but nothing overly complicated or mind numbing. Everything is straight forward and easy to pick up.The soundtrack is composed to perfection and aids the storytelling in a very unique way. A great mixture of tracks which change depending on the scenario at hand.The only aspect that may throw some people off is the fact that there is almost zero replayability, with the average completion time appearing to be anywhere around the 4.5 hour mark. Unless of course certain aspects of the game did not sink in properly the first time and you attempt a second rerun, though this does not bother me at all as it aimed to convey a purpose right from the beginning and was delivered to great satisfaction. Overall a wonderful game I would very strongly recommend. Do not let the simple graphics fool you! Deep down tears will be shed playing this little blockbuster.			"

Its about two scientists/doctors trying to fulfill a dying mans last wish to be an astronaut by traveling back in time and convincing his younger self to become an astronaut. They run into complications that I won't spoil for you, and you learn about the woman he was married to and why things are the way they were for him. Its a feely game full of feels.

You start from the present dive deeper into the past until his childhood and things will slowly start to make sense along the way. I tend not to give off any kind of hints to my reviews, you should play this game and know the story yourself and why it's called ""To the Moon"".[+] Surprising depth in writing.[+] Outstanding story that has both emotional and funny moments.[+] A casual mini-game that doesn't ruin your momentum on a story-driven game.[+] Soundtrack that you will listen over and over again.[+] Likeable characters.[+] Humor were added perfectly to where they should be.[+] I get to play whack-a-mole and ride horses and totally forgot about what I should really be doing.[-] No window.

I was not expecting such a heavily involved story, but it had all the elements.  You have humor, sadness, anger, confusion, love, pickled olives, platypus dolls, paper bunnies, and a piano.

So what are you waiting for??....Go get yourself a copy today! :))  ~~*NOTE* I have intentionally left out many details of the game as possible, so as to not spoil the wonderful experience of the game for others.  (The game description and trailer of it explain more anyway. lol)			"

												Rarely does a game tug at the heartstrings in such a brilliant, personal way as in 'To the Moon'.This hilarious and deeply moving work of art shows what games have the potential to be, and the piano track 'For River' is so perfect in every way that I just stood and listened as the little characters played it on their grand piano...Perfect.

												Gifted by a friend, I had no idea what this game was. A wonder! I recommend it without a single doubt.Basically it is rather something to watch than something to play as it is all about the story. Few actions are required from the player, which most of the time are easy. Make sure to read as it is the core of the game, and give it more than an hour to get into its story.Pros:- Excellent storyline. Captivating and pushes the player to have some kind of reflexion about it. Despite the player being quite passive the story will push you to continue if you pay attention to it.- Soundtrack is superb- the 16-bit style does it justice - yes I know this sounds weird.- Text. Suits the game perfectly and - to me - was very pleasant as it gives some room for imagination.- Those entertaining flipping puzzlesCons:- At times I found the controls/mouse precision to be a little bit annoying but it was no big deal tbh.

												To the Moon is an absolutely fantastic, narrative game that is a challenge to review without spoiling what makes the game so impressive.  It lacks a lot of what people expect when they play a game, and is rather short - a little over three hours in my experience, but it more than makes up for it with the incredible atmosphere and storytelling.  The developer is a legitimate, accomplished musician and the musical score of the game alone can guide both the story and your emotions with ease.This game is truly a work of art and I recommend to anyone who thinks that they might even remotely enjoy a masterpiece of storytelling that few other games can even compete with.  I am far more often than not bored of these types of game but this one pulled me in and I've replayed it several times over now to share the experience with others.			"

												This game. It seems to be one of those typical pretentious indie games at first glance, but by god, this is so much more. Let me get this out of the way first: To the Moon is the game that I cried the most at throughout my whole life.Now, it doesn't really consist of a lot more than text and accompanying music, but that's way more than enough for immersion into such an amazing story—the plot was absolutely new to me, with no clichés in its integral parts at all. The setting is very similar to, or I'd even dare say borrowed from the movie 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', but it goes way deeper beyond that, to, as far as I know, previously uncharted territories of storytelling. Naturally, because of this, the story was for the most part unpredictable for me; this is what happens when none of your actions really matter and yet the life of someone is depending on them... maybe. I'm really not even sure what to make of this all, I still am in shock after having played through the game and I will need quite some time to completely process what I've seen.Above all this, the game has an unbelievably great soundtrack that meshes with the story so well that you'll cry even more just because of the musical score. There's even some really humorous moments in the game, that include but are not limited to: poking fun at those pretentious indie games I mentioned above, breaking the fourth wall, making hilarious puns, having absolutely unexpected moments, and so on. There's clearly tons of attention paid to every detail of the game, having a masterfully crafted experience.The negatives: not much, really. The author clearly doesn't have the best technical background, so you'll be stuck playing at a weird resolution no matter what, but it doesn't take a lot to get used to.I'm still real close to crying. ♥♥♥♥.

												OK, I had previously recommended this game, but I reread it and I thought, ""thats all I could say about it?"" This is one of my personal favorites. Everyone needs to play this. I don't care if you don't play games like this. Play it anyway. The first time I played it, I enjoyed it and found the story beautiful and sad at the same time. I played it again and, since I knew what was coming, just enjoyed the ride. If I had to give a one word review it would be this: beautiful. The creators made good use of RPG Maker. The look is retro but charming. As great and touching as the story is, the soundtrack is the star. It never misses a beat. It covers every emotion that runs through the story and pulls at your heart. Have Kleenex nearby because the music brings a level of reality that isn't found in a lot of games. To the Moon is more than a computer game. It is something special. Its pulls you in and touches your heart. It will stay with you.			"

												There's a great story in here but it needs a professional writer to edit and redraft it. As it is, the dialogue is very clumsy, very painful, very awkward, very unnatural - the inappropriately shoehorned jokes range from unfunny to baffling. Half the story deals with people middle-aged to elderly but the characters all speak consistently like teenagers or young adults. I hate to be that kind of snob but - maybe the overwhelmingly positive rating comes from a mostly younger audience who don't notice the bad dialogue as much? Like how Stephanie Meyer's books are so successful?It's a shame, the core ideas - mostly Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with chunks of Elfen Lied - are solid and at times I came tantalisingly close to feeling something.Art and animation and music were all polished, can't fault them. Found the controls to be clunky, seemed a bit haphazard as to whether I could click on a thing or not, and invisible walls everywhere. There's no real gameplay, there's objects or places in the map that when clicked on will help progress the story, same as a lot of walking simulators, which I don't mind if the story's worth it.This is a completely un-cynical game written with passion and some talent, about a quasi sci-fi future where a dying man's memories of his sometimes troubled marriage to his childhood sweetheart, who lived with asperger's, are relived in a bid to grant his deathbed wish of going to the moon. That's such an awesome setup, and how many video games are we going to get with that kind of thoughtful and creative elevator pitch? And I hate, hate, hate this game for wasting it on what's basically a particularly surreal and lengthy Big Bang Theory episode. Bazoonga! or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that guy says.			"

												If I had to describe To the Moon in one word, it probably would be ""epic"" or ""awesome"", probably I just would say ""pure-epic-awesomeness"", but I don't know if it's possible to describe the game fairly even with many words and I surely won't try it... Thankfully you can focus in a review on other aspects aswell:Story: I don't want to talk too much about the story, because I guess you better have to explore it for yourself and the game is based... well about 50% on the story. Just one hint: ""I am round. Sometimes I'm light, sometimes I'm dark, sometimes I'm both. Many people want to walk on me but few ever will. What am I?"" ;) Reach it or die trying and you probably finished one of the most awesome games about life, death, love and the inherent struggles mixed with some small puzzles. If I had to rate it, I would give the story 5/5 weaselpoints.^^ Graphic: It's an indiegame, and for an indiegame the graphic is wonderful, because the 16bit style! fits perfect (better then a poorly executed try of ""modern"" graphic) 5/5 weaselpoints.Sound: It's hard to say, how much the game is based on the story, or on the soundtrack... I decided to split it 50/50... I really enjoyed the story and even as a ""grown-up"" I caught myself wiping a tear away. But the soundtrack alone is just a masterpiece. Well fitting in the story, without harsh breaks, and still escorts me even without playing the game 5/5 weaselpoints.Length: I needed about 5h to complete my journey. Even I wish it would have last longer, it's fair for an 8€ indiegame full of awesomeness and emotions compared to some 50€ fullprice highend-graphic junk without a real story but with the same length. 5/5 weaselpoints.Difficulty: There are no seperate settings for the difficulty but it doesn't matter. The puzzles within the story I would rate as fair and doable for everyone.Summary: 5/5 I highly recommend this game. A real gem within the flood of indiegames! And even this all wouldn't be enough, the game includes 1 achievement and it's really simple to get!			"

The writing is high quality, and the music is even better. Actual gameplay is severely limited. There are a few puzzles, but nothing major. Ultimately, this is a game more about telling a story in a unique way, and it does this beautifully.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good yarn and has a few hours free to play it all the way through.

The game follows Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, employees of Sigmund Corporation, whose job it is to fulfill the final wishes of elderly people who are about to die.They do this by using a machine that allows them to go back through their patient's memories and influence them to fulfill their wishes, creating the memories of their wishes being fulfilled for the patient. In the game, the patient is an elderly man named Johnny, whose dream is to go to the moon. However, he does not know why he wants to go to the moon, so the doctors must find out why he wants to go in order to influence him to go.

												Wonderful game! It consists of so many great dialogues and reminiscences of anything that got published in the past. My favourite is How I met your mother. Just awesome.On top of that you have an incredible heart breaking story. The only cons for me are the visuals (I prefer (more) beautiful hand drawn 2D pictures) and the missing voice acting. But in several ways the visuals are perfect - in all scenes where it reminds me of The Matrix.Btw: For me it is more sort of an adventure game than a RPG.			"

												Graphics are bad, gameplay is annoying, sometimes gets boring, but you have to, because when you finish it, it will be one of your most loved games. Not one of the best games, not one of favorite games, but one of those that make you sit down, turn your head and close your eyes everytime you recall the experience. And you will never forget. And you will try to learn how to play piano or at least think about it.			"

AUDIOHeart-feltVISUALStockDIFFICULTYSimpleVIBETheatricalCRAVINGCinematicON SALEOccasionallyPROS: Story is exceptional, and told creatively. OST is wonderful, worth a download if you can appreciate solo piano. The world is very interesting; it would be great to see more episodes following different people. The game is easy to control and understand. CONS: Doctor Watts is a major atmosphere-ruiner. I'm assuming his more obnoxious lines were shoehorned in when it appeared the game was a bit too dramatic, but his meme-rife ""comedic"" relief is very unwelcomed. Much of the graphics are RPGMXP stock.WORTH: The short total playtime and stock graphics may not make it worth its full asking price.OVERALL:  To The Moon is a touching endeavor and worth 2-3 hours of your time. Freebird Games can make a hell of a story that's proof that the video game medium can tell tear-jerkers.SCORE:8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												If I had to describe To the Moon in one word, it probably would be ""epic"" or ""awesome"", probably I just would say ""pure-epic-awesomeness"", but I don't know if it's possible to describe the game fairly even with many words and I surely won't try it... Thankfully you can focus in a review on other aspects aswell:Story: I don't want to talk too much about the story, because I guess you better have to explore it for yourself and the game is based... well about 50% on the story. Just one hint: ""I am round. Sometimes I'm light, sometimes I'm dark, sometimes I'm both. Many people want to walk on me but few ever will. What am I?"" ;) Reach it or die trying and you probably finished one of the most awesome games about life, death, love and the inherent struggles mixed with some small puzzles. If I had to rate it, I would give the story 5/5 weaselpoints.^^ Graphic: It's an indiegame, and for an indiegame the graphic is wonderful, because the 16bit style! fits perfect (better then a poorly executed try of ""modern"" graphic) 5/5 weaselpoints.Sound: It's hard to say, how much the game is based on the story, or on the soundtrack... I decided to split it 50/50... I really enjoyed the story and even as a ""grown-up"" I caught myself wiping a tear away. But the soundtrack alone is just a masterpiece. Well fitting in the story, without harsh breaks, and still escorts me even without playing the game 5/5 weaselpoints.Length: I needed about 5h to complete my journey. Even I wish it would have last longer, it's fair for an 8€ indiegame full of awesomeness and emotions compared to some 50€ fullprice highend-graphic junk without a real story but with the same length. 5/5 weaselpoints.Difficulty: There are no seperate settings for the difficulty but it doesn't matter. The puzzles within the story I would rate as fair and doable for everyone.Summary: 5/5 I highly recommend this game. A real gem within the flood of indiegames! And even this all wouldn't be enough, the game includes 1 achievement and it's really simple to get!			"

Game Information :Modes : Single PlayerGenre : Indie, RPG, AdventureEngine : RPG MakerDeveloper : Freebird GamesPublisher : Freebird Games	Platforms : Windows, Mac & LinuxRelease Date : 1 Nov, 2011How Long to Beat : 4 hoursTo The Moon is an Indie RPG created by Freebird Games. The game follows Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, employees of Sigmund Corporation, whose job it is to fulfill the final wishes of elderly people who are about to die.They do this by using a machine that allows them to go back through their patient's memories and influence them to fulfill their wishes, creating the memories of their wishes being fulfilled for the patient. In the game, the patient is an elderly man named Johnny, whose dream is to go to the moon. However, he does not know why he wants to go to the moon, so the doctors must find out why he wants to go in order to influence him to go.

Some parts of it can be a little confusing which can lead to a little frustration, but the ending makes it incredibly worth it- especially if you don't know anything about the game before hand.

												While probably closer to an interactive story than a game in the traditional sense, To the Moon is a wonderful journey from start to finish. The writing is high quality, and the music is even better. Actual gameplay is severely limited. There are a few puzzles, but nothing major. Ultimately, this is a game more about telling a story in a unique way, and it does this beautifully.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good yarn and has a few hours free to play it all the way through.

No.But after playing video games for years, growing up with them and owning more than 2000 games on Steam I can say:This was the best video game experience I've ever had.Kan ""Reives"" Gao, developer of To the Moon, wrote a fantastic and touching story.I would love to see the script turned into a movie and I can absolutely recommend this game to everyone who prefers a very well-made and emotional story over gameplay.When someone asks me about the most memorable game I've ever played the answer is simple:To the Moon			"

												Human wishes are the meaning of our life. They set our path, affect our decisions… They make us what we are. To The Moon tells us a story of an old dying man that wants his final wish to be fulfilled. Wish that he cared through his life. That made him who he is. As Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts you will travel back in old man’s memory to let him live through his wish. Even if only in dreams. The story you will see in this trip is full of emotional moments. Moments that can’t leave you indifferent. Main and credit melodies are unbelievable. And gameplay is easy but interesting. All who loves quest novels with heartful story should play this masterwork of Canadian designer/composer Kan ""Reives"" Gao.			"

												I don't really know how to describe this game, other than to say it's an interactive story with some light gameplay in it. However, I don't mean that in a bad way, as it's a very good format to tell a story.The story follows two doctors working in a company that grants its clients (who are all people on their deathbeds) a last wish of sorts before they die: they rewrite their memories so they can accomplish whatever they dreamed of; in the case of the game, the client is a man who always dreamed of going to the Moon, hence the title of the game. The story is very good, and emotional; and I'd say the game it's worth it for the story alone. Still, I'd make a disservice to the devs, as they managed to craft a very good game not only storywise, but in aesthethics and overall tone. The traditional RPG style fits the game pretty well, and the soundtrack is very good as well.As far as gameplay goes, as I said, it has light gameplay; there won't be a lot of fighting or anything like that; only going around interacting with certain objects, and having dialogue with different NPCs. Even then, it's entertaining enough, and the gameplay works to enhance the story.After the main story, there's two extra DLC chapters (which can be downloaded for free), which show a bit more of the company the doctors work for; and it's set during Christmas, after the events of the main game. The tone remains somewhat similar to that of the main game, although there's a few interesting twists (particularly in the second chapter).Well, I don't think I can say much more about this game, other than I recommend it.

												Easily worth the purchase while it is on sale (I actually got this in a Humble Bundle quite sometime ago and only just got around to playing it), but even at full price; I wouldn't regret buying it for a second. I decided to start playing this last night, big mistake on my part, as I could not stop! Even after I finished the game, I just HAD to play the free DLC episodes, set in the protagonists’ workplace. Which were short even compared to the main game, but were enjoyable all the same, and slightly creepy~but enough about those.To The Moon is a great game, it made me tear up a bit with how emotional it gets, it also made me laugh at times. There's a decent amount of humour, mostly in the form of Dr Neil Watt's shenanigans and dialogue, and it takes the edge off the largely sad narrative. That said, the story is not all doom and gloom, it may even surprise you--it did me.I now eagerly await this game's true sequel, while I ponder the strange goings on of the mini episodes, hmm~			"

												To the Moon is a beautiful story driven game, with gameplay taking a backseat. This game is all about story as the gameplay consists pretty much of moving on a 2D plain and solving puzzles. If you are not one for games with little actual gameplay, then I do not recommend this game, but if you enjoy stories, then I highly, highly recommend To the Moon. My only issue with the game were the controls. Using the mouse to move was often a pain, because it either wouldn't register or the character just wouldn't move there. If you can, I suggest using the keypad to move. During the ""Puzzles"" the game also registered me as double clicking quite a lot, which made me miss some of the ideal move numbers.The story is, in my opinion, absolutely brilliant and I will not hide the fact that I did cry towards the end. Its sad, but really sweet is all I can say without spoiling it.The music is also fantastic. I'm a sucker for piano pieces and the main theme and ""Everything's Alright"" are absolutely amazing...I gotta give the vocalist credit as she did a beautiful job. If you can, purchase the soundtrack. You won't regret it.Again, I highly, highly recommend this if you're looking for a good story, because it's fantasticly well done, with a brilliant concept.

												A beautiful story with a perfectly paired musical accompaniment. Despite the text bubble clicking method of delivery being an absolutely brutal and uninvolving way to deliver a story, this game was amazing and was well delivered.However; between the method of delivery and the incredibly slow movement speed of the characters the game becomes a grind towards 'Act III'.

												It would be hard for me to describe how, Wonderful this game really is. Never played too many indie games before, but this one is the best of all of them. The story is no doubt the strongest point in the game, which is beautifully directed and covers emotion, love, humour and sadness of human life, in a very nice way, The characters in the game are very memorable . And the soundtrack is so wonderful and memorable, the music still plays inside my head and its very pleasant to hear it, again and again. Even the art is great, nothing to complain, even there were a few things like key customization which would been nice, but it didnt bother me, and can easily be ignored and This game is filled with so much emotion that I almost cried towards the end!  Overall this game is recommended for everyone, you just can't avoid this masterpiece, it would be a shame to do so.. ! 10/10.			"

												""To the Moon"" is incredibly beautiful.It's a story being told rather than an actual game: you just have to complete a few puzzles and follow the dialogues. The characters are special and the music is awesome (although a bit repetitive if you ask me ;). Somehow the sentimental and funny moments in ""To the Moon"" are really heart-warming even though it's ""just"" pixels. Well done!  10/10  (Yes I cried. A lot. What a great game.)			"

												This game is simply good. It has a story that makes you want to see it through. To The Moon isn't really a game tho. There are interactive bits, but they won't provide anything resembling a challenge. The music is beautiful and the plot makes you think of the people and things closest to you. I'm a bit late to this game, but I'm happy that i played it. I recommend it, if you like games with good stories rather than good graphics.			"

Short version: 96%To the Moon is an RPGMaker interactive movie that is… is…Just… just play it. Just buy it and play it. There should be nothing else said about. Just… play it.Long version:Don’t let the appearance fool you: To the Moon may have been created with RPG Maker XP, but it is an interactive movie through and through. Player input is minimal and it is restricted to walking around, examining things, and two minigames.The main theme of the story is memories. Memories of a lifetime, to be exact: you play as two scientists, whose job is to create an artificial set of memories for a dying old man, so he can reach happiness in his final moments.The memory exploration is twofold: on one hand, we are witnesses to key moments of the man’s life going backwards in time, slowly learning what choices and events led to his final decision.But the journey is also quite symbolic, even allegoric. All memories are tied to small mementos, and as the journey progresses, we learn how much importance a seemingly insignificant object can hold for someone… Something I’m sure all of us are familiar in our own lives.There are two minor problem with the game. Two smudges on this perfect gem. One is the overabundance of slapstick; its purpose is to have small emotional pauses in this story, but sometimes it is misused. The other is the obstacle-passing minigame towards the end that just feels completely out of place and nonsensical.Still, even with these, To the Moon is still probably the best indie game available on Steam. So… just buy it and play it.			"

												Background: dislike ""Nintendo RPG"" art, love point n clicks. Heard good things about the game.The Good:* Great sound and atmosphere for a game with such limited animation* Outstanding story with humour, sadness and joy* Fun but not difficult mini game puzzles* First rate dialogue with very natural characters and reactions* Superb use of memories in the latter parts* Characters have depth and there's surprising subtly included* Leaves you wanting more and lots of hints at unexplored concepts The Bad:* Bland but well crafted '8bit' art* Very clunky mouse movement and hit n miss hotspots* Clunky speech skipping that stopped working in chapter 3 for me* Short and little to no immediate replay value* Horse riding section is confusingly under explainedImpressions: Much like 'Gone Home' this is a story being unfolded as you move and click. It tugs the heartstrings and plays with your emotions but not in a cynical way that left me tearful and sorely impressed at how well delivered the story was. The high concept plot and natural dialogue raise the game well above it's underwhelming artwork and poor hotspot/movement detection and pathing.Recommended for: People with a heart and a soul for a well told story. Requires pixel hunting and plenty of reading.Conclusion: 8/10. Story of the year that will stay with you for a long time.			"

To the Moon is a game that truly has a heart to it. The music is fantastic and syncs very well with every moment of the story. The graphic style reminds me of the Super Nintendo era of jRPGs, the likes of Final Fantasy and Secret of Mana.But the game plays very differently from a RPG. It's sort of an interactive story, with some adventure and puzzle elements to it. It's not very long, which is not a criticism, given that the flow of the history is very good and it respects your time (not many ""fillers"" or wasted time on silly things).The history feels very personal and immersive. It can be very touching at times, going through the whole set of emotions (happy, sad, depressive, euphoric, funny). There are a few easter-egg-references to other games and pop/nerd culture in general. Even though they’re, for the most part, hit-or-miss, i think it’s a nice touch nonetheless.Definitely gets my recommendation.			"

												To The Moon was quite an experience of a game for me.In To The Moon, you play as scientists that are part of a corporation called the Sigmund Corp. They are developing a technology that can create artificial memories, and they offer this as a ""wish fulfillment"" service to people who are about to pass away, so that they may pass on more peacefully. However, these artificial memories conflict with the patient's real memories, the procedure is only legal to do on people without much time left to live.Sigmund Corp. employees Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts are requested to provide a fulfillment to the lifelong dream of the dying Johnny Wyles, Although he never could explain why, Johnny's lifelong dream was always to go to the moon.  The doctors use special headgear and devices that allows them to interact and put themselves into an interactive compilation of his memories, and traverse backwards through his life, from his elder years to his childhood.The more time goes on through the memories, the more Eva and Neil learn about Johnny and his life. They find mementos, and learn about him, what brought him to his career, and his marriage. I will not spoil anything else, as the game is an absolutely incredible experience to enjoy blind to the story and going into hearing and seeing it for the first time. However, I will say that To The Moon has so many emotionally impactful moments, some of hope, some of despair, some of fear and some of pain. You will see the memories through Johnny's mind, and start to develop knowledge about his life, as well as possibly think about your own.The game's story and emotional impact is amazing and incredible, and To The Moon still remains to be one of the most emotional and touching games that I've ever played. The soundtrack is also absolutely beautiful, and adds to the atmosphere in the game. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a story-rich game with plenty of emotion, and lots of real-life stuff to think about, too. It was an incredible experience of a game, and I cannot recommend it enough. ^.^			"

English Version: Given that I was not convinced about this game's quality, I wanted to try It, and I have to say that I understimated It because of its low price.Is a 2D adventure game with apparently very simple dynamics, but It has a lot to offer to the players. The protagonist, a man with the only wish of reaching the moon, seemingly inexplicable, is dying; so he asks over Doctoress Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, who belong to the sigmund Agency of Life Generation, in the attempt of reaching his very last wish through artificially implanted memories. However, as the game progresses, the plot thickens and the introspection and the past of the poor elderly protagonist, Johnny Wyles, begins to excite the minds even colder.The graphics do not excell but they offer simple and different scenarios. The plot, at least to me, is very reminiscent of Inception (for those who saw it), even if we are talking about memories and not dreams. Johnny and his poor wife are deeply characterized, so much that the gamers are made aware about the wife's health condition, which is not so rare in today's reality. The soundtracks are very impressive, and in any case always suited to the circumstances in which they find themselves. The gameplay is very simple, but the depth of the story manages to entertain the gamer to everyone for the duration (albeit brief) of the game. Yes, the game, unfortunately, is short-lived, but nevertheless It's an experience recommended to all.Do not be fooled by the low price, as It previously happened to me: It's a MUST HAVE in your Steam LibraryItalian Version: Sono venuta in possesso di questo gioco grazie al consiglio di un amico, che già lo possedeva. Non convinta dell'eccellenza di tale titolo, ho voluto provarlo, e devo dire di averlo sottovalutato per via del prezzo basso. To the moon è un'avventura grafica in 2d che si presenta come un gioco dalle dinamiche molto semplici che tuttavia ha molto da offrire ai giocatori.  Il protagonista, un uomo con il solo scopo di raggiungere la luna, apparentemente inspiegabile, è in fin di vita; così convoca nella sua abitazione sopra una scogliera i dottor Eva Rosalene e Neil Watts, appartenenti alla Sigmund Agency Of Life Generation, intento a raggiungere il suo ultimo desiderio attraverso l'impianto di ricordi artificiali. Tuttavia, man mano che il gioco avanza, la trama si infittisce e l'introspezione ed il passato del povero anziano protagonista, Johnny Wyles, inizia ad emozionare anche le menti più fredde. La grafica, pur non eccellendo, offre scenari diversificati e semplici. La trama, almeno a me, ricorda molto Inception (per chi l'ha visto), anche se qui si parla di ricordi e non di sogni. La caratterizzazione di Jhonny e della sua povera moglie è ben approfondita, tanto da sensibilizzare la gente sulla condizione di quest'ultima, che non è così tanto rara nella realtà d'oggi. Le colonne sonore sono molto suggestive, ed in ogni caso sempre adatte al contesto nelle quali si trovano. Il gameplay è molto semplice, tuttavia la profondità della storia riesce ad intrattenere il videogiocatore allo schermo per tutta la durata (seppur breve) del gioco. Ebbene sì, il gioco, purtroppo, è poco longevo, ma tuttavia è un'esperienza consigliabile a tutti. Non fatevi ingannare dal prezzo basso, com'è successo a me, è un MUST HAVE in libreria.			"

The big point of this game is this, so play it and discover what's hidden in this apparently simple game visual novel with rpgmaker graphics.-Resolution I didn't played this game before because of this. Play with that crappy resolution and that black borders it's very annoying and horrible.-ControlArrows to move? Seriously?... I can not do anything more except recommend you again to play this...

												To the Moon is a sincere story told through 16-bit-style graphics and simplistic gameplay. You control the characters Dr. Wyatt and Dr. Rosaleane, scientists within a wolrd in which it is possible to recover an alter memories of their dying patients for a chance to live their final requests and dreams - even if it was not reality and only in their minds.  ""Occasionally I'm fortunate enough to play a game that reminds me what's important. Not only what's important in making a great piece of interactive media, but also what's important in life."" - Anthony GallegosThis story centers around a dying man named Johnny who wished to visit the moon, hence the games title, To the Moon. Along the journey of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes. As you progress through layers of memories Johnny will slowly go from being an unconscious old man you don't really care about, to a complex human being whose life you are certain to empathize with. By the end of the game I came to care about Johnny, despite never meeting his ""real"" self in the overworld. The gameplay consists of simple puzzles in order to break through layers of memories and then comes to exploring the memory and watching the story unfold. In other words if you are someone who's interested in fancy graphics and gameplay this isn't for you.My weak puzzle solving skills and exploration are not why I have 4 hours in this game, I rather rushed through these parts in order to reach the next scene or dialogue sequence allowing me sight into the minds and hearts of the characters presented. Some games are mindless and are carried through the repetitive actions, gameplay and graphics. To the Moon is reliant on the excellent plot of which will leave you broken.			"

												To The Moon genuinely hits a high mark; It's truly got one of the most interesting stories that I've ever sat through in video games ever.You play as two doctors Eva and Watts who are traversing through the memories of a dying patient who's final wish is to go to the moon. I won't reveal any more to the plot because it's much better you sit through the events of the story yourself. It's tearjerking; everyone's review that says this truly means it. I didn't understand the story fully the first time mostly out of the fact that I didn't exactly understand the side-effects of some medical conditions mentioned throughout the game, Google anything you're unfamiliar with; it'll help you out, but after the 2nd time it finally made sense, and when you DO understand every piece of the story, it just hurts in a satisfying, remorseful way. There's no easy way to put it; if you don't feel ANYTHING at the end of the gorgeous ride the game takes you through, you're unbelievably heartless.If stories that certainly make you appreciate life and not take it for granted, and a hint of science fiction is your cup of tea, To The Moon does anything but disappoint. The piano-arranged soundtrack is stunning; I still find myself humming the themes 3-years later, the 16-bit graphics are nice, and the mini-puzzles inbetween are a lovely touch to keep you going. I'm super excited for Kan Gao's next installment to the series 'Finding Paradise' later this year, but for now I will continue to love this game to no end.Thanks, Kan.			"

												If you are a fan of the visual novel genre, or enjoy a game with a focus on narrative-driven storytelling, give 'To the Moon' a shot. It is a short game where you travel from flashbulb memory to flashbulb memory of a man who wants to go to the moon before his death - but to grant his wish, you must first unravel the mysteries of his past.

												Beautiful, emotional storytelling. It's a story first, and a point and click game second. The game is simply the medium. It's funny, serious, dark and hopeful all at once. A simple concept experienced masterfully, games don't normally affect me but this one struck a chord. The soundtrack is only a couple of very basic tracks, but it is hauntingly beautiful, and deserving of the pickup. In many ways, this game is like a movie experience with the added benefit of your own input and interaction. Visually, it's retro look gives it charm, and it's impressive how much emotion can be conveyed with pixelated animation. You take the role of a pair of specialists who enter peoples memories, specifically dying people, to generate an experience from them that they express as a dying wish. In a style reminiscent of Inception they dive into the life of John, to fulfill his wish to go To The Moon. They have great chemistry, with fantastic pop culture references and lots of one liners. The story they discover is touched with meaning and emotion. I can't say what makes this game so great without revealing anything that happens, but it brought me to bittersweet tears.I bought this on a whim, a whim I now very greatful for. It's a truly enriching game, and it will make you cry.			"

												First of all, you should stop reading this review, add this gem to your cart and immediatly buy it.Secondly, for the price of a cinema seat, this game offers you to experience the most moving story-driven game you'll ever find on Steam. While this game has not a lot to ""play"" with, it delivers a stunning story in a way few games ever did. The soundtrack succeeds in compensating the basic yet wonderfully detailed graphics in order to deliver the emotions you usually expect from this kind of games. To me, this game is the proof video games are a self standing media, able to deliver proper emotions and to get into serious topics by itself.Seriously, buy it.10/10			"

												This game deserves nothing below a 9, that's the lowest that you can go for a game like this. This game is so well formed, the plot, the characters, how they develop and connect. Given the aesthetic setting, you might assume it's a silly indie game or something that might touch upon deeper emotions and matters without actually going the whole way, deeper and exploring the story completely. However the writers for this game clearly worked very hard on this, with so many connections that it's only up the the player's intellect to actually connect them and evaluate them on a personal level. This game does not force you to do anything, it plays smoothly without anything for the player to worry about missing. Just playthrough and enjoy the game. And if you've paid enough attention, then deeper meaning will be revealed and the greater your appreciation will be for the writing. The game has a few interesting and entertaining moments of comic relief (and believe me, you will need them) and fun cultural references. The timing, presentation and music really manage to hit the right chords.This is a genuinely good game, suitable for everyone to enjoy. Each person will have a slightly different experience but even if you've understood the absolute minimum, it's still a grand game worth remembering when comparing to other future contenders who dare set foot in this very challenging genre.

												Don't judge a game by it's cover. Or in this case, it's engine. You might think that a game made in RPG Maker isn't worth your time. Well, in this case you're wrong. Or at least that depends what you're looking for.'To the Moon' does a lot of things right, but most important and memorable it its writing and atmosphere. Long story short, the game is about exploring a dying man's memories to grant him a final wish. What you get is an emotional ride with both ups and downs, mostly the latter. But the game is all about its story and it's perfectly executed.But if you're looking for an RPG, you're looking in the wrong place. The game has no sort of choice-and-consequence system, no fighting (except for one battle, but I won't spoil that!) or nothing that would make this rank as an RPG. The game will always be the same, so there's not much replay value to it.So if you're looking for a game with a great story to invest a few hours into, look no further. Freebird Games will prove to you that you don't need to be a AAA-studio to make an enjoyable and memorable gaming experience.			"

												Regret. Indecision. Joy. Sorrow. Indignation. Anger. Helplessness. To The Moon can and will unrelentingly tug at your heartstrings. It will bring you to the fullest extent of each and every single emotion listed, woven together by the most hauntingly beautiful piano music in the background.The graphics, though simple, will form images that will stay in your mind - and heart - for a very long time. The story seems simple but goes to so many complex details as the game unfolds them delicately, just at the right moments. I enjoyed every bit of it, from the tear-inducing plot (so much onions) to the little bits of comic banter, whether in exploring Johnny's world or playing the occasional mini-game.I must concede that the *only* flaw is that there's little replayability value; after all, it is a story-game. But what you get in the 4-5 hours of completing is a wonderful and emotional experience that forces you to look deep inside you. What do you want most in life? What would you pay for it? From thoughts on society and legal obligations, to forced self-reflection on your own goals and dreams, this game has it all.In summary, do I recommend it? I cannot assent more wholeheartedly - it's the first game that affected me so much that I actually just *had* to write this review. I had received this as part of a bundle; but on hindsight, I would have been willing to pay full price. You have to get it on sale, or grab whichever bundle it appears in. Because it's just that good. Add to cart, process, install and grab a good pair of headphones for an amazingly immersive experience.			"

												To the Moon is one of the most touching games I've played in years. With such a wonderfully written storyline riddled with humerous and nostalgic references alike, TtM really shines with it's interpretation of memories. When I played the first few moments I expected an interesting Sci-Fi interpretation of how the mind works, which was delivered promptly, but I hadn't expected how utterly mind-blowing of a level it would reveal itself to land on. Flawlessly implementing emotional story-telling, point-and-click gameplay, and an ocean of character progression, TtM leaves you on the edge of your seat, yearning for the next act of the three installments. I haven't felt the pressure of tears behind my eyes as a result from a game since Kingdom Hearts and Shadow of the Colossus were released in 2002 and 2005 respectively. Had this game been released during my preadolescence, it would've been just as impacting on my development as those two games were. In all honesty, even at this stage of my life, I found this game to be rather impacting, as well as eye opening on many levels.To the Moon is a game I'd recommend for all ages, as a casual point-and-click story driven adventure RPG, it has so much to offer to every generation. Undoubtedly worth the extra 'dough' for the heart-string-pulling soundtrack as well, especially considering that 50% of the bandcamp proceeds go towards charities.10/10, will play again.			"

Towards the middle of the game I completely stopped caring about that, and I hate games that are mainly story, I just started falling in love.

												I had a very emotional reaction. It seems like I wasn't alone. I learned something about myself. And in some ways it helped me deal with some trauma from my past. Would I, laying on my deathbed wish to erase trauma from my past? Knowing that before these thoughts pass through my head I would forget everything that really did happen? I have no idea. I used to think, of course I would. If I could think that I went to the moon. Even if I didn't. Sure I would. But, after beating the game. Although I helped Johnny fulfill his wish. I feel a bit empty. I'd love to go into why I feel empty. But I think I'd be treading upon spoilers. This is a game about a story. Not a game about gameplay. Not a game about competition. This is a game about a story. An experience. Even though I bought this game for only $1.99 I would, and probably will buy it for $9.99 for a friend. I feel like everyone should have the option of experiencing a story as moving as this. This is games as art.			"

												The sticking point for To The Moon is whether or not you would pay thirteen dollars for a movie and its soundtrack.I say this because To the Moon's gameplay has nothing to recommend itself by. There are some puzzles and one segment featuring particularly game-like mechanics, which is much more than something like Dear Esther could say for itself, but it's not far removed from walking simulators. And, ultimately, you can't fail directly. It is also short. I blasted through the game in roughly four hours, though Steam reports less than that compared to my clock estimate.If on consideration you feel these are not issues that dissuade you, you'll certainly get your money's worth from the story, which had me engaged fully about ten minutes in and halfway through had me suddenly mentally revisiting everything I'd seen up to that point, looking at details I had no reason to appreciate before. I will keep maximally mum about anything more. I can't even speak for some of the topics it handles deflty since they would constitute spoilers in and of themselves.Additional sticking points:- There are no options. Not even for resolution, which resulted in harsh letterboxing for me. - It's a sentimental tale, and if you've no stomach for that you'll probably have buyer's remorse.- You'll want the soundtrack. It will not be negotiable.At sale price I've seen To The Moon go for -70%, so $2.99 U.S., without any special daily discount further driving down the price. With soundtrack it was $3.74, and for that price I think it's definitely worth it for anyone.			"

												To the Moon is a indie adventure game designed and built in RPG Maker, though it is not actually an RPG in the traditional  sense it looks as if it is, though there is no combat (Except as a joke in one spot) and very little actual gameplay outside of the usual adventure game mechanics of talking to everyone and finding things in the environment.In To the Moon you play as two doctors who are employed by the Sigmund Corporation under a new wish fulfillment service that people may use as they are dying, it lets the doctors alter memories to help someone believe they fulfilled their life long dream, and as such they are called to the house of Johnny Wyles who's dying wish is to go to the moon, but he does not know why, so as the two doctors you must go through Johnny's memories and figure out why while also building things up for Johnny to become an astronaut.Now... I am leaving out key parts to the story here because I do not wish to spoil it but suffice it to say To the Moon may have one of the best stories I have ever come into contact with in a video game, it is beautifully written to the point that I was in tears multiple times while playing it, despite how it looks graphically the writing shines through and delivers powerful emotions that tug at your heartstrings.Although it may seem a bit short, clocking in at about four to five hours long, less if you know exactly what to do, it is well worth it, an amazing experience from top to bottom, polished with very little flaws outside of repeating the same sliding puzzle every time you jump memories.And on a side note the soundtrack is totally worth it, the musical score is memorable to the point that after you finish the game, even just the music will bring back memories of the story, all in all a must play for anyone who cares about an amazing story in a video game.

												Simply put, this game is the most beautiful indie game experience I've ever had.  Words cannot describe the powerful feelings this game evoked within me. The story is from the perspective of two doctors. These doctors possess a device that allow them to traverse the very memories of a person. They can manipulate those memories to make the patients dying wish come true. It is a five hour journey, but one many should take. It allows you insight on a condition certain people have to live with throughout their lives, as well as the bonds between two souls and how tragedy and circumstance cannot make them falter.   I cried so hard. I was crying because of the beauty of the message and the happiness of the finale, but also the emanating sadness of the whole story. When you go to the moon you will feel joy, sorrow,  and compassion.			"

												To the Moon always conjures up rather superficial and in my mind nonsensical debate about what constitutes a game and how story-telling should be done within a medium or whether story-telling should even exist in the medium at all. What I've always found odd about this debate is that it's the people who side with the ""storytelling in gaming should be done through gameplay, because gaming is its own unique art form and shouldn't just be copying cinema"" argument, who are the ones who are being restrictive and limiting the potential of the medium themselves by setting up boundaries and defining what gaming should be.In many ways I hate the term ""game"". It's a loaded term which tries to specifically narrow down a certain path in which an interactive piece of art/entertainment must go. It also seems to make people's minds up on something before they've even given it a chance and it comes simply from tradition and nothing else. The tradition that video games evolved from more traditional games such as board games and card games, yet has evolved way beyond that. How often have we seen the phrase ""it's a good story told in the wrong medium"" or ""it's not a good game, but a good experience"" followed by a mediocre score from he reviewer? I can never understand this - you happily admit the story or the experience affected you emotionally n a positive fashion but because it was in a medium which traditionally, in its formative years 40 or 50 years ago stemmed from traditional games you rate it poorly? Perhaps if To the Moon had been one of the early games which popularised the medium instead of Pong and Space Invaders we wouldn't have this problem.Anyway, I digress. Regardless of history, I find it hard to get my head round why people would want to reduce their own enjoyment of something by creating a narrow definition of something and what can fall into that through nothing but absolute snobbery to even try and prove the medium is an art form (which is another debate in itself) or to argue why certain games are inherently better than others (note: how people who side on this side of the debate re nearly all staunch Valve fans). It certainly does have an impact as well - if people tell themselves cutscenes are inherently bad or interactive fiction is inherently bad they will automatically dislike something in those styles, subconsciously, without ever giving it a chance and therefore reducing their own enjoyment of the medium (which is what I find most perplexing - why would anyone want to do this?) There are even people who claim they would hate their favourite film if it were and minimum level interactive film/FMV game.Perhaps more than a rant about how a game's story should be told though is whether one should be told at all. People accept stories in literature and film because they are tradition, but not al films or literature are about their plots. People don’t enjoy Inland Empire for its plot, they enjoy it for its atmosphere. People don't enjoy Dante's Inferno for its plot, they enjoy it for its atmosphere. There's absolutely nothing which says film or literature or theatre have to be plot based anymore than there is which says gaming can't be, simply because it didn't come from such tradition.Games can be great for an all manner of reasons - some games are great for their great gameplay (Bayonetta), some games are great for their great atmosphere (Silent Hill 2), some games are great for their level design (Deus Ex), some games are great for their rich, intriguing world full of lively characters (Deadly Premonition), some games are great for their pure bizarrity and unpredictability (killer7) and some games ar great or their story (To the Moon). I don't think it takes much or is unreasonable to enjoy all these different things which different games try to achieve. To me decrying To the Moon for its lack of traditional gameplay is no less ridiculous than decrying Tetris for its lack of story or decrying Mario Kart for its lack of atmosphere. You should judge a game on what it tries to achieve. Not because it's some kind of unwritten rule by elitist academia but because it's how you get the most enjoyment out of something and why would anyone want to deny their own enjoyment of something to create some kind of academia superiority? It's irrational. The fact that gaming is so esoteric and has such variety in the things it wants to achieve  from game to game and genre to genre is one of the major reasons I love it so much.And that's assuming that gaming is some kind of inferior medium or storytelling anyway, to which I strongly disagree. It's the interactiveness which make it so suited for storytelling. I think most people will agree that horror games can be genuinely scary even for an experienced horror gamer, whereas after you've reached a certain age and seen a few and become desensitised horror games are not because of their passive nature there is nothing to fear. Whereas in gaming you're controlling the character - It's not just watching passively as someone walks down the hall and seeing h they react when a ghost pops out, it's you controlling that person and you reacting to that ghost popping out. The interactive medium has clear advantages for building atmosphere over the passive medium and it's the same with character bonding. I can’t say I’ve ever cared about a character in a film or television show or play as much as I have plying something like Fire Emblem. That’s because you’ve put the effort it into grow these characters yourself and christ, seeing a character I’ve built up on Fire Emblem die breaks my heart. As hammy as I’m sure that sounds  do think there’s a lot of truth to it and gaming has such advantages that mediums like cinema simply don’t have when it comes to storytelling whereas cinema can do very few things gamin can’t in that respect. In fact, I’d even argue it’s easier for a game to put across emotionally-gripping storytelling simply by the interaction of moving round as it increases your focus and creates the bond and interest in the story through interaction – which no matter how superficial this sounds, is undoubtedly there. And that’s exactly what To the Moon does.	Not to mention people against this kind of interactive fiction - or who claim it should be in a different medium they’re denying thousands of people incredible emotional enjoyment. To the Moon is a game which was made on RPG maker by one person in his bedroom. It cost virtually nothing. There’s absolutely no way this game could ever have been made and had the success it did for virtually nothing if it were a film or a tv show or a play and obviously not have the visual/audio impact it had as a novel. I’d make a tongue-in-cheek reference here about gaming being the “people’s medium” but certainly think indie gaming and things like RPG-maker have allowed people to put forward their ideas for nothing and get success from them, which most other visual mediums cannot.This game made me cry and I don’t just mean my tearducts getting a bit damp and one tear dropping down my face. I mean properly bawl my eyes out til I felt empty in my stomach, cry. Moreso than any piece of art/entertainment in any other medium has as far as I can remember. You can write it off a manipulative or cheesy for attempting this, but the fact it’s been so successful for many people is exactly the point. It’s through its interactievness and your pure focus on the characters and the memories that you wade through throughout the game that the whole thing becomes inescapable and overwhelming. If you go into it with an open-mind rather than trying to meaninglessly  define what gaming should be and instead judge it on what it tries to achieve then it’s an absolutely unreal game and one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences I’ve had in absolutely any artistic medium.

												This game has a beautiful story, a wonderful soundtrack, and the gameplay was simple, fun, and unique. Not to mention all the nerdy and anime references within the game! It was enough to make me cry and reflect this upon my life in a different perspective. 10/10 would play again!			"

												Regret. Indecision. Joy. Sorrow. Indignation. Anger. Helplessness. To The Moon can and will unrelentingly tug at your heartstrings. It will bring you to the fullest extent of each and every single emotion listed, woven together by the most hauntingly beautiful piano music in the background.The graphics, though simple, will form images that will stay in your mind - and heart - for a very long time. The story seems simple but goes to so many complex details as the game unfolds them delicately, just at the right moments. I enjoyed every bit of it, from the tear-inducing plot (so much onions) to the little bits of comic banter, whether in exploring Johnny's world or playing the occasional mini-game.I must concede that the *only* flaw is that there's little replayability value; after all, it is a story-game. But what you get in the 4-5 hours of completing is a wonderful and emotional experience that forces you to look deep inside you. What do you want most in life? What would you pay for it? From thoughts on society and legal obligations, to forced self-reflection on your own goals and dreams, this game has it all.In summary, do I recommend it? I cannot assent more wholeheartedly - it's the first game that affected me so much that I actually just *had* to write this review. I had received this as part of a bundle; but on hindsight, I would have been willing to pay full price. You have to get it on sale, or grab whichever bundle it appears in. Because it's just that good. Add to cart, process, install and grab a good pair of headphones for an amazingly immersive experience.			"

												Don't judge a game by it's cover. Or in this case, it's engine. You might think that a game made in RPG Maker isn't worth your time. Well, in this case you're wrong. Or at least that depends what you're looking for.'To the Moon' does a lot of things right, but most important and memorable it its writing and atmosphere. Long story short, the game is about exploring a dying man's memories to grant him a final wish. What you get is an emotional ride with both ups and downs, mostly the latter. But the game is all about its story and it's perfectly executed.But if you're looking for an RPG, you're looking in the wrong place. The game has no sort of choice-and-consequence system, no fighting (except for one battle, but I won't spoil that!) or nothing that would make this rank as an RPG. The game will always be the same, so there's not much replay value to it.So if you're looking for a game with a great story to invest a few hours into, look no further. Freebird Games will prove to you that you don't need to be a AAA-studio to make an enjoyable and memorable gaming experience.			"

												Simply put, this game is the most beautiful indie game experience I've ever had.  Words cannot describe the powerful feelings this game evoked within me. The story is from the perspective of two doctors. These doctors possess a device that allow them to traverse the very memories of a person. They can manipulate those memories to make the patients dying wish come true. It is a five hour journey, but one many should take. It allows you insight on a condition certain people have to live with throughout their lives, as well as the bonds between two souls and how tragedy and circumstance cannot make them falter.   I cried so hard. I was crying because of the beauty of the message and the happiness of the finale, but also the emanating sadness of the whole story. When you go to the moon you will feel joy, sorrow,  and compassion.			"

The thoughtful story complimented beautifully with an emotional soundtrack kept me going in a non-stop session as I just fell in love with this game. It only took as long as it did for me because I was taking pause to dance around the room to the theme. More than once I cried.

												Beautiful story. I like the gameplay - how it is constructed, how the story unfolds and the travel between older and newer memories. To follow a character through his memories and finding out more and more about him was interesting. Maybe it does not sound all that interesting but I don't want to tell more about the story because then I might spoil your experience of it. The game is pretty small but I don't mind, it works for this story. Play this if you like stories about people, the situations, experience and circumstances that made them into who they are.			"

I can barely remember a videogame that touched me in a way like ""To the moon"" did. It really gives you a lot of stuff to think about. I can recommend this to EVERYONE.

												Full disclosure: this isn't as much of a ""game"" as it is an interactive story; think Ace Attorney or Analogue: A Hate Story. Or Final Fantasy IV. (ZING) So while there are a few mini-games, To The Moon doesn't require your senses of strategy or customization like the 90's-era JRPG's it's designed in the style of. What is DOES require is simply four continuous hours and a box of tissues.To The Moon has a beautifully crafted story. Look no further if you're looking from something that can switch to heartfelt to depressing to shocking to laugh-out-loud hilarious at the drop of a hat. Or several hats, rather.And the story is greatly helped by the fact that the writing is excellent. From John & River's love story told in reverse, to the banter between Doctors Watts & Rosalene, everything simply feels natural. The subtle references to Doctor Who and How I Met Your Mother are the icing on the cake.I was going to put something else - largely to wrap this up - but whatever. Just go play it. (I was serious about the ""four continuous hours"" thing, though. This is the type of game that's meant to be played in one sitting.)Oh, and the music is great too.			"

To the Moon is a heart-rending tale of dreams, memories, and knowing that love is malleable, capable of taking forms of true beauty, when worked by the right soul. It is my firm belief that you would enjoy To the Moon, so let me sell you further.Part 1: The StoryThe story starts off with two scientist-type fellows known as Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, employees of a mysterious corporation known as Sigmund Corp. They are specifically tasked with providing the elderly and sick with fulfilling lives before they die, by using the means of a certain memory-altering dream machine that allows them to rewrite their client's memory to fit their ordered specifications. Their client, an old, withering man known only by the name Johnny, has enlisted the help of these two scientists. His request, to become an astronaut and fly high into the sky, to reach the outer edge of the world and engage in a long-awaited rendezvous with the moon. Things go routine for a good while, until it appears that something is very wrong with Johnny's memory. Segmented and heavily disjointed, the mind of the elderly man seems to only connect via a single thread, memories of his deceased wife, River. You'll find along the way that she holds major significance to Johnny, much more than could be originally thought, but I'll leave the satisfaction to you.Part 2: GameplaySurely no game is great without some equally complementing gameplay. Whilst travelling through this cavalcade of emotions and memories, you'll have to deal with searching the man's memories and finding items that can link each piece together, like a grand cranium jigsaw puzzle. Mementos will be scattered about for you to interact and find, and engaging in absorbing the story from each memory is a must if you are to succeed. You'll have to go through some light puzzle elements in order to gain access to the linking power of the mementos, but it's nothing a little brain power can't fix. And even with all this brainiac gameplay, there are indeed moments of action. Remember that squirrel you narrowly dodged on the road? Well, I won't say much, but I can say that you surely haven't seen the last of him. You'll need to have a fighter's spirit, but keeping a shoe handy is about the same.Part 3: The LessonThe game holds with it not only what you can gather from surface value, but it also carries underneath it a plethora of teachings and meanings. Now nothing I say here is set in stone, as you take what you will from the experience, but what I've collected from the game is as follows: One of the hardest things to do is to do nothing at all, that sometimes love will find us no matter where we are, and that strangers we meet can be the most interesting people we will ever get to know. These certainly aren't the only lessons to be drawn from this wonderful game, interpretation is a most beautiful thing. I leave the gorgeously complex teachings of this game to you to find, as making your own connections is supremely satisfying, and I'd be nobody to deny you the pleasure.OverviewThis game is definitely worth the priced listed. A fine game with charming graphics, a beautiful story, and a heart-rending conclusion that will leave you fully satisfied with your purchase. With the characters very fleshed out and unique, alongside the ""worlds"" you'd be visiting, not to mention the beautiful OST that'll be accompanying you, I'd give it a most well-deserved 9/10. Buy this game, love this game, remember this game.			"

												To The Moon is simply one of the best story based games ive played in my entire life.A game that went under the radar for many people, developed by a small studio called Freebird Games, To The Moon is an incredible and heart breaking experience, as it will bring the manliest of men to there knees in tears.In short, its about 2 Doctors traveling through the memories of a dying man to fulfill his final wish, there isnt too much I can give away without ruining some part of the story, so hear this, play this game, buy it and play it, this game is simply incredible.This game was an emotional rollercoaster for me and many others who played this game, as you tie bits and pieces of the story together as you progress, you feel youself becoming weaker and more emotional as realisation sets in and you learn how sad the life of this old man really is.The game consists only of clicking around with your mouse, as there is no action, no fighting and no enemies to face, this may seem as a turn off for many, but in reality it is just a better way to immerse yourself in the game and its story, it simply couldnt be represented in a better way.From the outstanding soundtrack, spectacular story and the brilliant dialogue that this game delivers, its simply a masterpiece, and all that in around 3-4 hours of gameplay.9/10I can see why many people will and have enjoyed this game, but can also see why others may not.

 To The Moon  is a truly beautiful game. It's very essence screams with emotion and you find yourself screaming with it. This game is the kind of game you sit down expecting to try for half an hour at 11:00 at night and find yourself still playing sometime the next morning. It's story proves engaging and litterally enthralls you as you become the game's minion. Entrusting you with simple tasks,  To The Moon  requires one to search in reverse chronological order small memories of a dying man in an attempt to convince a younger reflection of himself to follow a certain path in life, motivating him to fulfill his own death wish. As should be plain as daylight, untrained professionals such as us are provided with every opprotunity by Freebird Games to come in conact, learn about, and fall in love with the characters as we travel backwards through a man's most intimate and poignant moments of living. You spend hours caught up in this man's life, almost understanding him as well as he does himself, and that's where you find you've actually spent hours getting caught up in a magnificent and chancy trap: You slowly realize it as the story progresses, I will not reaveal it here, but you do inwardly question this dying man as you roam his thoughts. It even talks about a topic that is not quite well addressed in media and especially in games, and that is commendable in and of itself. Mental illnesses require the attention of close loved ones. This game explores the ""whens"" and ""wheres"" of unconditional love and just how significant it is in the lives of others. The entire time you are investing in a one-way friendship with this man, you are accompanied by a moving, extremely well crafted soundtrack he soundtrack is so fantastic it makes one wish they could either play, pick up again, or practice these songs on the piano. A mix between simplicity and complexity that complements the story line and the artstyle; everything comes together so thoroughly. If one were looking only for music, this game shines as brightly as any lighthouse. Now, in a sea of drama, the pair of scientists one guides through the memories provide comedic relief and this is where I could see where we lost a portion of the (at the time of writing) 440 out of 16010 people who did not recomend this game and that number could have been cut if there had been the following warning: the characters you play will bicker like siblings and they are present to cut tension. If they were not there, the story would be too heavy to handle. I enjoyed their presence and I laughed out loud a number of times as they allowed the developers over at Freebird to show their humor in a creative way. Actually, I find them reminiscent of certain characters Shakespeare would include in his works (i.e. the Porter in Macbeth) in order to plant some kind of restraint in an otherwise constant flow of deep and taxing storytelling. Please do not let yourself be unwilling to play this game because of them. My only personal complaint are the controls. I will say that this game is a point and click interactive story that one should use the arrow keys and enter/space bar for. I found the point and click clunky and not always accurate. I lost nothing in using the arrow keys, though, so it does work. Also, I found there to be too much delay in the memento puzzles for the amount of computing it should take. That did not detract much either as I was too busy figuring out moves anyway. That's it. The end of my complaints. ""Use the arrow keys and I thought they could have cleaned up the programming for the puzzles. Otherwise, job well done. Fantastic story. Fantatstic sound track. Interesting art. 15571/16011 would play again."" Thank you for your time.			"

A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY TALEShort Review:Do not be fooled by the mundane name of the game, i wouldnt call it a game, rather a surreal expeience that kept me awake,thinking and i finished the game in 1 go.  The Story is has a very tight and neatly conceptualized plot(executed very well,may i add) that guides the game to a smooth victorious and beautiful finish. The attention to the small things in the plot is what makes it even more convincing. The main characters Eva and Neil have great chem together,loved the emotional rollercoaster that pans out through the game, the gameplay is fairly linear, but then again it was'nt meant to tense you out.The music is fairly repeatitive but its worth listening to.In the End,all i have to say is,while some of us rarely get time to play games,and hence we become really picky about the ones we spend time on, Let me tell you, THIS IS WELL WORTH YOUR TIME.Free DLCs tooo....yay. 12/10Here's to hoping this becomes the script for Inception 2.0 :)			"

												I had been putting off playing this game for the longest time now, even with all the recommendations I had gotten from known people, needless to say, I understand why they wanted me to play it so bad now. The characters feel real and you can actually relate to them; even though the story itself starts of very scrambled and might confuse you, don't fret, keep going, it will all make sense, reminded me a bit of the move ""Memento"". As a last word so I don't spoil anything, this game is an emotional roller coaster, taking you through it all, nothing had made me feel so much since I finished my favorite book of all time, and that was 4 years ago. Definitely worth a abuy and most definitely worth your time, you will NOT be dissapaointed at all.			"

												To the Moon is one of the most touching games I've played in years. With such a wonderfully written storyline riddled with humerous and nostalgic references alike, TtM really shines with it's interpretation of memories. When I played the first few moments I expected an interesting Sci-Fi interpretation of how the mind works, which was delivered promptly, but I hadn't expected how utterly mind-blowing of a level it would reveal itself to land on. Flawlessly implementing emotional story-telling, point-and-click gameplay, and an ocean of character progression, TtM leaves you on the edge of your seat, yearning for the next act of the three installments. I haven't felt the pressure of tears behind my eyes as a result from a game since Kingdom Hearts and Shadow of the Colossus were released in 2002 and 2005 respectively. Had this game been released during my preadolescence, it would've been just as impacting on my development as those two games were. In all honesty, even at this stage of my life, I found this game to be rather impacting, as well as eye opening on many levels.To the Moon is a game I'd recommend for all ages, as a casual point-and-click story driven adventure RPG, it has so much to offer to every generation. Undoubtedly worth the extra 'dough' for the heart-string-pulling soundtrack as well, especially considering that 50% of the bandcamp proceeds go towards charities.10/10, will play again.			"

												This game is just brilliant. It is inspiring, humorous, suspensful, and just full of heart...I finished To The Moon in one sitting. I tried to pull away, but I just couldn't help myself. I cried, I laughed, and felt so much emotion while playing this simply beautiful game... Dr. Neil Watts was my favorite character. He was seriously funny, sarcastic, but not all he appears to be- for a while, he looks to be quite disinterested and just looking for the next joke, but near the end of the game he shocks you with how much he cares about people's happiness. He really was a fantastic character that I can't wait to see more of in the next installment.Johnny... Oh boy. The way the game played through his life backwards just made it more painful. All that he went through... just wow. When you see all of his hopes and dreams when he was young, but seeing that it didn't turn out.. it's really hard. And you just grow unspeakably attached to him, forgetting that these are only memories and he's really fading away on a death bead. This game was just unbelieveable. I adored everything, from the plot to characters , the gameplay to the entertaining puzzles, and of course- the soundtrack. I suggest you buy the collecter edition with the Soundtrack. It's quite worth the 2 dollars extra.I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a beautiful game that will make you question what, and who, you spend your life with, and make you appreciate the simplest things that you have.

												""I'm too manly for this."" -Dr. Neil WattsI usually don't write reviews, but for this game I feel like I must. (Sorry for my English, not my main language)My story is that I was searching for games with easy 100% achievements (Yeah, I'm sort of an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥) and I found this game... Boy, what a game. It had almost everything: The visuals were appealing, the characters were pretty nice, and I got really interested in their stories, the story progression is fantastic, I literally didn't see some of the stuff coming, regarding the events that lead up to the ending which was a little bit predictable and the soundtrack is spot on. A little something that not everyone is a fan of has to be the lack of action; this is a ""Point and Click"" game, so it may not have the best gameplay in the world, heck, even I found it a little bit grindy or boring in the first half hour, but I'm getting used to that since I've been playing more games like that lately. But in my opinion, the things mentioned before makes up for it. The game is a little bit short, but the feels stay...In conclusion, I'd say this game is completely worth your money, and it's even better on a sale, it gets pretty well discounted. I rate it 5 jars of olives out of 5 jars of olives			"

												This is not a game. It's an interactive story where clicking is required to progress from scene to scene and from dialog to dialog.  The fact that from times to times some ridiculously easy puzzles have to be solved in order to progress doesn't exactly make it a game. There's nothing challenging about it.Anyway, its best part is the story. It's a complex story that treats matters of life and death in such way that it gets to be felt quite close and personal. I completely don't recommend this to depressive people. I was on the verge of busting into tears several times throughout its duration. The story is great, very touching and impactful. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling it, but I guess I could say it somehow reminds of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the movie, but only in just a few aspects.Other than the story (but damn, what a story!...), there was nothing I liked about how ""To the moon"" presented itself to me. The soundtrack supports the story pretty well, it enhances the feelings that the story transmits, but it gets cheesy at points, near the end. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome soundtrack that clearly shows the loads of work it required, but it's just not my type, I'm more into the Bastion-like soundtracks.Many people seem to have found the strength to tolerate the awful graphics, but I still can't ignore them. It's an ""RPG Maker""-like, uber low budget kind of graphics that ruined for me the immersiveness of the ""to the moon"" experience at points. Since the clicking and controlling was also quite imprecise, I think I would've even prefered a slideshow of still images instead of some of the scenes where just moving around was pretty annoying and tedious. It also lacks basic settings like sound volume controls, full screen / window mode toggling, screen resolution settings, all the basic stuff. At least it comes with steam cloud support and a pretty neat, single ""Steam achievement"".Anyway, I don't regret the money spent on it and the 3 hours and a half that it took me to finish it. It's a great experience. It's also, indeed, worthy of still being considered the saddest game of all. I submit to this general opinion as well.			"

												Beautiful, emotional storytelling. It's a story first, and a point and click game second. The game is simply the medium. It's funny, serious, dark and hopeful all at once. A simple concept experienced masterfully, games don't normally affect me but this one struck a chord. The soundtrack is only a couple of very basic tracks, but it is hauntingly beautiful, and deserving of the pickup. In many ways, this game is like a movie experience with the added benefit of your own input and interaction. Visually, it's retro look gives it charm, and it's impressive how much emotion can be conveyed with pixelated animation. You take the role of a pair of specialists who enter peoples memories, specifically dying people, to generate an experience from them that they express as a dying wish. In a style reminiscent of Inception they dive into the life of John, to fulfill his wish to go To The Moon. They have great chemistry, with fantastic pop culture references and lots of one liners. The story they discover is touched with meaning and emotion. I can't say what makes this game so great without revealing anything that happens, but it brought me to bittersweet tears.I bought this on a whim, a whim I now very greatful for. It's a truly enriching game, and it will make you cry.			"

												It's hard to describe how much I love To the Moon. I say love, and not ""loved"" because it's one of those games that will stick with me forever. I've never experienced a game that made me feel so sentimental. While it doesn't have much as far as gameplay is concerned, To the Moon more than makes up for it in its intriguing and heartfelt narrative. It intertwines humor and heartfelt drama under a veil of mystery--keeping the player hooked from start to finish. I'm amazed at what this game achieves. If you're looking for in-depth gameplay and top-notch graphics then this probably isn't what you're looking for. However, if you enjoy great storytelling, character development and a soundtrack worth buying and listening to hours after the game ends, then you've come to the right place. Though it's rather short, I loved every second of it and still do not regret spending the money on it. This is the only game I've played on Steam I would urge buying at full price. This is because the creator needs money to support his art of game-making, and seriously, the guy is good.			"

It is a short game where you travel from flashbulb memory to flashbulb memory of a man who wants to go to the moon before his death - but to grant his wish, you must first unravel the mysteries of his past.

												To the Moon is a indie adventure game designed and built in RPG Maker, though it is not actually an RPG in the traditional  sense it looks as if it is, though there is no combat (Except as a joke in one spot) and very little actual gameplay outside of the usual adventure game mechanics of talking to everyone and finding things in the environment.In To the Moon you play as two doctors who are employed by the Sigmund Corporation under a new wish fulfillment service that people may use as they are dying, it lets the doctors alter memories to help someone believe they fulfilled their life long dream, and as such they are called to the house of Johnny Wyles who's dying wish is to go to the moon, but he does not know why, so as the two doctors you must go through Johnny's memories and figure out why while also building things up for Johnny to become an astronaut.Now... I am leaving out key parts to the story here because I do not wish to spoil it but suffice it to say To the Moon may have one of the best stories I have ever come into contact with in a video game, it is beautifully written to the point that I was in tears multiple times while playing it, despite how it looks graphically the writing shines through and delivers powerful emotions that tug at your heartstrings.Although it may seem a bit short, clocking in at about four to five hours long, less if you know exactly what to do, it is well worth it, an amazing experience from top to bottom, polished with very little flaws outside of repeating the same sliding puzzle every time you jump memories.And on a side note the soundtrack is totally worth it, the musical score is memorable to the point that after you finish the game, even just the music will bring back memories of the story, all in all a must play for anyone who cares about an amazing story in a video game.

												This game deserves nothing below a 9, that's the lowest that you can go for a game like this. This game is so well formed, the plot, the characters, how they develop and connect. Given the aesthetic setting, you might assume it's a silly indie game or something that might touch upon deeper emotions and matters without actually going the whole way, deeper and exploring the story completely. However the writers for this game clearly worked very hard on this, with so many connections that it's only up the the player's intellect to actually connect them and evaluate them on a personal level. This game does not force you to do anything, it plays smoothly without anything for the player to worry about missing. Just playthrough and enjoy the game. And if you've paid enough attention, then deeper meaning will be revealed and the greater your appreciation will be for the writing. The game has a few interesting and entertaining moments of comic relief (and believe me, you will need them) and fun cultural references. The timing, presentation and music really manage to hit the right chords.This is a genuinely good game, suitable for everyone to enjoy. Each person will have a slightly different experience but even if you've understood the absolute minimum, it's still a grand game worth remembering when comparing to other future contenders who dare set foot in this very challenging genre.

A Paladin’s Steam Review: To The Moon. A Lot of Feels Story, not a Lot of Gameplay.Genre: Sci-Fi Adventure Comedy/Tragedy Story Driven Experience. Developed & Published by: Freebird GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay MechanicsThe story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover. The gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome. PC SettingsSettings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well. The graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game. Side note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie. Final ThoughtsTo the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...Read the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

The game's plot is all about people who can go into the minds of a dying person and change their memories to make them think that they achieved their dream to help them die happy. The rest of the story you should experience for yourself. The game has a spectacular soundtrack suiting the mood the entire time and I sat down and played this game all in one sitting because the story was just that good. The gameplay is simple point and click to find things and the game will last you from 3-6 hours depending on how much you explore and how fast you are at reading. I recommend this experience strongly to anyone looking for something new, amazing, interesting, and touching (many people have been known to cry during this game). 99/100			"

												To the Moon is not really a game, but more like... interactive fiction. The two Docs are helping this old man who said he wanted to go to the moon, but he can't remember why. By going back in his memory and hopefully by stitching it back together in a certain way, they can reweave the memory to allow the mind to fill in the details, thus allowing the patient to die with a sense of fulfillment rather than regret. Except the Doctors have met their match... as there are some secrets that this man is hiding... and they must search through the catacombs of his memories to locate the clues... Don't let the cute 2D graphics that resemble Japanese console RPG turn you off. This game is MUCH deeper than that. They simply chose to spend the developement time on the story rather than hiring artists to do bazillion illustrations. At its heart, its a love story, about broken promises, unfilfilled wishes and potentials, and about taking chances, and how one encounter can change a life. It is a short game, and you should have no problem finishing it in a few hours. And you may be shedding a few tears at the end.			"

												This game is gold. Not just any kind of gold, shiny and sparkly kind of gold. It's definitely a one-of-a-kind RPG game that would just hit you hard in the feels. It's simply amazing and I'd highly recommend everybody that come across this game to buy it. It definitely worth the money. No actually, the game itself worth more than how much it cost. Why? Because it's a shining, sparkling golden game. If I have to come up with one word for this game, it'll be ""Beautiful"". That very one word describe the game to its smallest detail. From scenery to gameplay, each part will consumes you into wanting to play more. Definitely a 10/10. But in my definition, it's 100/10, so seriously. Go buy it you dingus, you're missing out :-)			"

												Do not mistake this for a game. It isn't. The elements that have pretensions to being gameplay are linear in the extreme, and very simple to ""solve"".Do not mistake the lack of gameplay for a lack of merit. To The Moon is an excellent work, which I wholeheartedly recommend. The particulars might not fall into everyone's tastes, but the concept and execution are sufficiently good that it at least deserves a try.Still. There are a few notable flaws. Firstly, the pretensions to gameplay can be mildly distracting, more so the less adept one is at solving the minor puzzles. Secondly, certain parts of the dialogue are highly - and needlessly - intertextually referential, despite this intertextuality having almost no real merit for the larger narrative. Thirdly, the basic point-and-click system used for most of the game is clunky, and may disrupt the pacing of the narrative.A sincere recommendation of an excellent - but not masterful - work.			"

												To be clear, this game has a pretty small amount of classic gameplay. You explore and experience a story. It's not walking-simulator tier, but it's entirely focused on the story it wishes to tell, rather than the gameplay aspect.However, the story itself is awesome. Such a great way to spend around four hours. Few places can you get such a concise and well delivered story, with a strong soundtrack to back its heart. You will find yourself able to recall songs in the soundtrack even after only playing for around four hours, that's a very good thing. Memorable and enjoyable soundtracks are something I love in games.Extremely well worth the money. This gives you so much more than watching a great movie, while costing a fraction of the price. Characters are well developed and each have their own personality that are enjoyable to watch. I'm pre-emptively trying to find the sequel that has just been announced so I can wishlist it. There's an overarching storyline that connects the two main scientists to the next game, as they work on multiple ""patients"", this game covers a single patient's story. So in future sequels, we'll get to see a continuation of the development of these characters. I just love that! You don't see direct connections like that often.Only gripes are that the sprite grid is a bit too large, like your position is very here-or-there, you can't always position yourself exactly where you want to be easily. Also, in a couple of places I have to switch from using a controller to a mouse because the controller wasn't able to do what I was required to do. Should support all control schemes (especially in simple setups.)Definitely recommended. A character-focused adventure that just about anyone can relate to and enjoy.			"

The graphics are okay, the piano music is nice but I specially liked the main characters - the 2 agents - and their dialogues. The game lasted 6 hours and has a bonus episode that you launch from the games folders. The bonus features a return of the main characters and a very realistic insight of what would happen if what is depicted in this game is possible one day...			"

 Beautiful. Before going in-depth with my review for the game, I want to sum it up with that one word alone:  Beautiful.Upon purchasing the game, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. Sure, I've heard praises about it some time ago and it was on sale recently for a very reasonable price. So, I bought the game along with its soundtrack bundled in without any idea what to truly expect. And after just finishing the game recently, I can safely say that what I got was an experience worth every penny. Keyword: ""experience"".I'll start off by discussing what I think is the main problem that people seem to have for the game (based on the negative Steam reviews).This game is labeled as an ""Indie Adventure Role Playing Game"". It was also designed through the RPG Maker XP engine. So it is of no surprise that people expect at least a bit of RPG Maker gameplay elements that are typically found elsewhere. But this game doesn't have that. In fact, aside from very simple puzzles, this game doesn't have much else in terms of 'gameplay'. And therein lies the problem. It's hard to call it a 'game' when it barely has any gameplay elements to it. Heck, as long as you keep playing there's no way to lose the game. It's more like a movie with a few interactions added here and there. I personally expected a bit of a challenge too but the game was too easy and too linear. But is that necessarily a bad thing?No. In my opinion, it's not.In fact, because of how straightforward the gameplay is, I was able to progress through the story very quickly in anticipation for what's going to happen next. All I had to do was overcome a bit of a hurdle in order to progress through the story and it didn't bother me at all.That is why I prefer calling it an 'experience' as opposed to calling it a 'game'. It is a  story-driven experience. The lack of any complicated gameplay made all the other aspects of the game shine.The graphics may be your typical RPG Maker stuff, but it's better-looking than most of the games made through the RPG Maker engine. The story...well, without spoiling much let's just say that there are a lot of feels found in this game. One minute I'm laughing at the interactions between the two main characters, and the next minute I'm trying my best to hold back my tears from too much feels (and most of the time failing to hold back said tears; no shame in that). And the music? Oh man, the music...the music in this game is arguably its greatest asset. The music found in the game is very beautiful. Each soundtrack served its purpose in making every scene of the game much more enjoyable and memorable. If you buy the game, I implore you to buy the soundtrack as well. It's worth it.It's a short game; only took me around 4 hours to finish. But every second of that 4 hours was worth it. It was a short but sweet ride.I highly recommend this game.			"

												To The Moon, with no doubt one of the best SP experience on PC Gamer life, and we need to congratulate Freebird Games for making a good game on RPG Maker. Contains simple animations but good, good lighting and awesome OST. However this game lacks in one thing for me - but inst very important though - the gameplay, it has some bugs like, get stuck on tree, start flying in mid game its not very important but a bit annoying. Also don't expect lot of action in To The Moon. Talking about To The Moon, on this game we control 2 characters, Drº Neil and Drª Eva that both work on company called  ""Sigmund Agency of Life Generation"", and the goal of that company is to grant people with low prospect of living. Now through a machine, Drº Neil and Drª Eva, step into people memory and change them and help they fulfill their wishes. By the game name, To The Moon, we can see what would be the wish they would make. John - main character - wants to go the moon and they will help him. Now when we are traveling through  John memories we need to pick up some objects to link some memories.In perfect game we need a perfect OST, and guess what? We have a extremely good one! Sometimes i would left the game ruining on backgroud just to hear the awesome OST. Now you want a game with good story? Excellent OST? Great story lines? Pick this up! ~ 9/10			"

												Guaranteed tears; tears of saddness and tears of joy. Tears because you don't want this beautiful game to end. To the moon is incredible if you're into heavily story-based games with minimal gameplay. It's more of a point and click game with the occasional puzzle which gets harder as the game progresses, but it's nothing too mind numbing. What I love about this game is also the comedic relief from the male doctor you play, so it's a good balance of sadness and humour. Whoever wrote the script for this game needs a medal.			"

Presentation is a bit meh (would've love to move in a three-dimensional plane to make it easier), but writing is top notch. For some reason, F12 in this game pauses it instead of taking a screenshot?Pros- Pony rides; Disembodied floating heads, at one point, Zombies at another (I'm serious), Compelling story that made me want to keep going.Cons- Abrupt abandonment of flip puzzles, Story is likely hard to follow on first playthrough; I wish environments were a little bigger as there were some crammed areas.So basically, I said the story was a pro and the story was a con.

												What can I say? When I first booted up To the Moon I was expecting an RPG in the likes of final fantasy (based on the graphics). Instead what I got was a gripping and emotional rollercoaster ride filled with joy, love and loss. The characters have realistic personalities and funny at times which makes it easier to connect to them. The soundtrack is superb and does a marvelous job of setting the mood during gameplay. Story is the main attraction here, taking elements from Pixar's 'UP' as inspiration for the mature themes presented. The only fault is the gameplay, which involves moving around and doing simple puzzles. However since the focus of this game isn't the gameplay, it's not a major  issue (it's more like an interactive visual novel).I highly recommend everyone to play this game or at least have a go. It's a story you won't forget.			"

												Ahem-em... Hrmmm! What? No I didn't cry, I didn't...Okay... maybe just a little ૮´︵ ` აI've... been straying astray from what got me into video games in the first place as a child...Back in the good old days when game developers created master-piece games most of which were in 2D it was all about the original unique trial and error story-telling and new attempts to try out new styles of how to go about making a game since it was something new, cheesy lovable characters, cool/cute characters, character development, albeit this game was short, we learned so much from just experiencing ones past. That goes far beyond deep character development in a new perspective.Now if you will excuse me... I have a very large list of 199x-early 2000 video games to pull out of their dusty retirement.I must reconcile with my already breaking heart and remember what a true game feels like.**Sure, let's go play a game about todays decapitating other players, shooting them, yelling at each other, putting people down. Graphics this, Graphics that! 3Dvs2D This! 3Dvs2D That! Cheesy Dialog this, Cheesy Dialog that.People need to get off their high horses, but then again most of these people with negative reviews more than likely never played any classic JRPGs of the SNES/PS1 eras so it's understandable if they don't get such a moving story.That being said very few developers still create amazing games that FOCUS primarily on character developments and very touching moving storylines, mostly done indie developers.

												There are too many reviews about this game, and they all praise the story. But then again there a lot of reviews about many games, and I've played games long enough not to trust them with what I'll enjoy. So this is the only thing I have to say here:Ignore the reviews, don't read about the story. Just give this game a chance. The least I can say about it is that this is a unique, rewarding experience and well worth the journey. So if you have a quiet evening to spare, don't watch a movie, don't read a book, play this instead. For me personally To The Moon is a memory I'm glad I'll be carrying with me.			"

												SPOILER-FREE REVIEW!In over four decades of playing video games, only a handful have ever elicited strong emotional responses with me. ""Final Fantasy VII,"" ""Ico,"" ""Shadow of the Colossus,"" and ""Journey"" are among the very few that have had such a powerful effect. ""To The Moon"" can now take its rightful place alongside those titles. From beginning to end, I never once turned it off or took a break. It had me hooked in from the very moment I turned it on, and it is still haunts me even after its overwhelming finale. This will be a game that I shall remember many, many years from now. There are so many moments that brought me to tears, probably more than any other game, and I loved it. If you are not touched by the game's beautiful story, you have no heart. By the game's conclusion, you will wonder to yourself if your life would have been better had you taken different paths at different times in your past. If given the opportunity to change it, would you?Graphics: 10/10 - The character design, rich colors, backgrounds, and little details made me feel like I was in this world.Sound: 7/10 - There's not much, but what's there is perfectly suited for this game. The heart beats and distorted laughs are memorable.Music: 10/10 - Every track is flawless.Gameplay: 7/10 - Mostly walking around and touching objects. The puzzles are not challenging, but the product's more of an interactive story than a game. Some people could be put off by its simplicity.Story: 10/10 - You WILL cry.Overall: 10/10 - One of the best games I've played in years. Freebird Games proves that you don't need huge budgets, realistic graphics, buckets of blood, or name brand recognition to produce a great game -- and this truly is a GREAT game.There is no excuse; you must play this game before you die. You won't regret it.			"

												I really liked this game. I hadn't read that much about it before I played it, because a friend gave it to me as a gift. As such, it was a pleasant surprise through the game when River started seeming a bit like, well... me, and I realised why. It's a very nice comment on women like River and her sister. The story is very sweet. At times I felt quite tearful! There is no voice acting, which is a shame, but the music adds atmosphere, and there is something quaint about the simplicity of it, and the ability to tell such a good story through this medium. I'd recommend this game, especially to women who know who Tony Attwood or Rudy Simone are.			"

The characters have realistic personalities and funny at times which makes it easier to connect to them. The soundtrack is superb and does a marvelous job of setting the mood during gameplay. Story is the main attraction here, taking elements from Pixar's 'UP' as inspiration for the mature themes presented. The only fault is the gameplay, which involves moving around and doing simple puzzles. However since the focus of this game isn't the gameplay, it's not a major  issue (it's more like an interactive visual novel).I highly recommend everyone to play this game or at least have a go. It's a story you won't forget.			"

												Wow. What an incredible little game. You can see that the deveoper really put their heart and soul into creating a truly magical game. The story-telling is absolutely superb. Its like reading a brilliant novel that you can't put down. From the moment I started the game, I knew this was something special. The soundtrack is just magnificent. Seriously. The first time you boot up the menu, you will know what I'm talking about. Each piece is brilliantly composed and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the current scene. The characters are so interesting that you immediately being to love them. This has certainly shot up to one of my favourite games.			"

To the moon is a point and click RPG which has a fantastic story and great music. There is no battle system in the game and your entire playthrough (6 hrs average) will be story driven. The following are my views and feelings about the game after a single playthrough. I will not be discussing the story to avoid giving spoilers but will say that the story, nay, entire playing experience was absolutely wonderful. Positives:- The story gets really interesting early on and the experience goes only uphill from there.- The characters and their dialouges are very well written and unique.- The game has great flow and pacing.- The ""Time travelling"" mechanic, especially solving memento puzzles was fun and added to the story.- The Music is the strongest point of the game imo. 10/10 if I would rate it.- The humor is great and jokes are plenty. I mostly had a grin on my face. - I like how the game was not very difficult which at least made my playthrough enjoyable.- The game also makes one feel a mix of emotions including feeling weird at times, which was good.- There were several neat refrences like animorphs books etc.- The graphics are standard RPG style and the controls are simple/easy.Negatives:- I could not play the game on my gaming laptop as it would not run even after following instructions by the developers. I do know that many players have had the same problems which started during the steam summer sale (2016). I played the game on my brother's laptop and it ran most of the time.- I changed the DEP settings on my laptop but I kept getting ""Script is hanging"" error and critical errors afterwards.  Final thoughts: To the Moon is an excellent RPG with a great story and an even greater soundtrack. I had a blast playing the game. I would recommend this game just for the soundtrack alone but luckily it has a touching story and well written characters which makes it a must have if you like RPGs.  9.5/10Extra: best joke from the game imo :DJohnny: What are you reading?

												I first watched Markiplier do a run through of the game so I was familiar with it and had already cried watching him play it. I still chose to experience the game for myself because it was just such a wonderful game. Being able to experience the story and being able to explore the environment yourself is such an enriching experience. The game punched my heart organ several times as I re-lived all of my emotions again.Pros:+ Heartwarming story+ Cute art style+ Tiny puzzles+ Lovely soundtrack+ Relatable characters+ Short and sweetCons:- You will crytl;dr just get it, you'll love it.

												The Bad:-The graphics are pretty terrible.-There is no real gameplay apart from a few very easy puzzles and your basic explore-and-interact. The Good:+The soundtrack is beautiful and used very well throughout the story.+The story is very well written and extremely emotional. Every detail throughout the game is well planned, every mystery has a great payoff, it all connects brilliantly and the dialogue (Text only, no voice acting) is really good.Overall, you play as 2 scientists who alter dying people's memories to fulfill a wish for them (or, at least, make them believe it came true). In this case, they're out to help an old man called John H. Wyles, who's dying wish is to go (you guessed it) to the moon. What makes this case a bit different to their normal ones is that Johnny hasn't the faintest idea as to why he even wants that. He just knows he does. The game's divided into 3 acts. The first one is mostly about establishing the backstory and leanring about Johnny's life. It's pretty slow paced, and mostly sets up questions to be answered later. The 2nd act picks up the pace, and from there till the end I found the game hard to stop playing.It takes a bit over 3 hours to finish, so I recommend finishing it in 1 sitting for maximum impact.

												I purchased To the Moon on a whim because it had strong reviews and was on sale. Plus, the game description intrigued me, and I thought if nothing else, it might be a decent way to spend the evening.Four hours later, and I am crying harder than I have in months. I honestly don't know how to describe this game without spoiling the magic of it. This is one of the titles I will point to when people contend that video games cannot be art. They absolutely can be, and this indie might well be considered a masterpiece. The story of To the Moon is tragic, beautiful, and sad. It is often funny and sometimes hilarious. It is the first video game that ever stirred my emotions to the point of tears. And it gave me a newfound appreciation for life. Seriously.Some details would probably be helpful. You play as Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, two specialists who are hired to modify clients' memories so that the last thing they remember on their deathbeds is the fulfillment of a grand and final wish. This is achieved by working backwards through the patient's remembered life, planting the seed of an idea in their early childhood so that their new, artificial life will play out the way it needs to in order for the wish to take hold. Their latest job is an old man named Johnny, a widower who wants to go to the moon. Only thing is, he doesn't remember why he wants to go, only that he must. So our heroes set up their equipment, enter his most recent memory, and start seeing the man's life in reverse.What begins as a standard point-and-click title quickly weaves into a heartbreaking and simultaneously joyous exploration of life, death, love and its flaws, dreams and the crushing feeling of losing them, promises kept and broken, the future, the past, and the importance of making the present count. It portrayed the shattering realities of illness, financial woes, selfishness, and failure. It captured the grief of not understanding someone you love and the tragedies that befall all of us. It illustrates how love is powerful but also incredibly painful and complex. It makes you think about how each one of us is the hero of our own story, and how much it hurts when we don't live up to the title. It makes you think about how we take so many things and people for granted, and the peculiarities of what does and doesn't stick in our memory. It shows us the importance and the absurdity of chasing after nostalgia, of knowing that something in your possession matters but not remembering why. It shows how easy it is to see other people's mistakes in life while ignoring our own. It pointed out how we would rather act than listen. To the Moon made me think about my own real-life relationships and how I could (should) put more effort into them. It made me think about dozens of chance encounters I've had, the dreaded ""What if?"" It made me smile with its true-to-life depictions of talking to girls, arguing with co-workers, and gently mocking one's friends. And it emotionally wrecked me with its dramatic twists, gorgeous soundtrack, and perfect ending. It's like someone took the first 10 minutes of the Pixar film UP, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and several classic RPGs and threw them in a blender.Some of the dialogue and the mental images that followed it made me think of other, bigger titles, such as Bioshock Infinite. Oh, how we love our lighthouses... But the story here is much more intimate and private, like reading a journal that someone's kept since they were 5. The visuals are charming, going for an old-school RPG look like Link to the Past or the original Harvest Moon. Cinema was obviously a huge influence on some of the particulars, notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Inception. Still, this is a truly original work, one that will stick in your brain long after it ends. The story's ability to make you cry, laugh (sometimes at once), and reflect is something few video games can do. It's something few movies or books can do. Get To the Moon, and let yourself be affected.Edit: I've nominated To the Moon for the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" Award. There is no other possible contender. Play this already.			"

												Wow. I played this all in one sitting. Start to finish. Absolutely brilliant. Could not put it down. It's like if someone took Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and combined it with Inception to a create a story about doctors who dive into the memories of the dying to artificially fulfill their dying wish by creatively revising their memories (emphasis on Eternal Sunshine). I was initially (and perhaps unfairly) skeptical of what a story could do with pixel art, but am happy to say I was quite wrong. This was much, much better than I expected. I appreciated all the subtle but extremely significant connections that go completely unmentioned, providing deep rewards for the more perceptive and analytical story-focused players. The story also does beautiful things with an autism spectrum character that left me very impressed. A++ more please.			"

Johnny's dying wish is to go to the moon, though he doesn't know why. To make this wish a reality, he enlists Dr. Eva Rosaline and Dr. Neil Watts of Sigmund Corp. who are determined to send Johnny to the moon one way or another.To the Moon has an incredible story, fantastic artwork, and an absolutely beautiful soundtrack. It evokes a variety of emotions, and contains plenty of comic relief. I would absolutely recommend To the Moon for any casual gamers, particularly those who love visual novels.			"

												While this game is certainly not bad, it's not exactly good either. But since most reviews are positive anyway, I might aswell tell you why it just didn't work for me.-The storyIn it's core I thought the overall concept was actually pretty original. You pay as two scientist who travel back through a dying man's memories in order to grant him his last wish artificially: taking him to the moon (roll credits). Though during the story, your original objective is often questioned, as you begin to understand that this wish is not what would make your patient truly happy.So, it's really not the story that set me off, it's rather...-The dialogueYou'd think that in a story that's supposed to make you sad and teary, you wouldn't need a character for comic relief. But damnit, the second main character suplied you with a steady ammount of jokes in all the wrong places. I just couldn't take the game serious anymore. At the first half of the story, whenever there was an emotional moment, that same guy, messed it up over an over again. And by the time the game was starting to get deep, it was just too late for me. You see, the sad moments of the game largely depend on how you attached you grow to the characters over time. And maybe it's just me, but I hated both of them.-GameplayWell, interesting gameplay is virtually nonexistent. But that's really not an issue in a story driven game. As I mentioned before, it has a great outline, but it just feels so unrefined at some places that it just wasn't enjoyable for me.-The lengthYou'll probably finish the game in 3-4 hours. And while I don't want to badmouth the content, you may think that it's been a short ride if you don't even have all the trading cards by the time you are done.All in all, I'd say it's okay if you can pick it up during a sale. But I really don't think it's worth the full price if you take a look at what it offers. Just about 4 hours of gameplay which aren't even amazing. But I assume that most people have a far better time, given that they don't dislike the main characters as much as I do.			"

												At the end, I had a tear in my eye. That's all you really need to know. Yes, it looks like bog-standard RPG maker output, but  play it for a little while and you'll be living through each moment with the characters and aching to find out where it's going next.The only real issue I had was in the horse-riding scene, the controls went a bit screwy. But re-loading solved the problem.I also recommend the two mini-episodes that come with it, which concentrate on the scientists. I don't think there's any way to load the game from Steam, but google it and you can find where they're saved on your PC.			"

It connects with the player and shares a bond with the playerBeautiful, lack of gameplay but the most immersive heart warming stories I have ever seen in a video game. You might complain there is a lack of depth and gameplay itself, so if you are one who expects all that then please this is not a game for you. All I can say is that this has made me appreciate the values of memories and love to a whole new scale, please, just give it a go, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												The reason mainly why I recommend this game is because of the truly amazing and original storyline it has along with the character development regarding the introduced characters. This game (story) just never bores you. It has something that wants you to keep playing, something that wants you to explore more of the things that lay ahead of you. Humor, romance, adventure, puzzles and fantasy it has it all. Really worth the pocket money exchanged for the game. Not to mention the soundtracks. They are BEAUTIFUL. The soundtracks are just so overwhelming and so well placed in every scene, that you can't help to live with the characters. To have feels so deep that somehow your heart will bump against your chest painfully along with the pixelated tears that drop down your cheeks. It is unimaginable how much work was put into everything to create this splendid game of artwork, but what I can say is that this was truly one of the best games I've played on the Steam Community. To the RPG and Adventure lovers like me: surely try this out, especially if you're in for tearjerkers.			"

												*sigh* To The Moon is one one of the few games that has actually brought me literally to tears.  The gameplay may not be super incredible, but the story and the characters are wonderful and touching. There is no other game that has made me care about the characters as much as To The Moon. That is why I'm nominating it for The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award.Anyone who wants a touching character driven story needs to play this. It's one of the best.I almost forgot.

												The music, which has been received very well as far as I've heard (pun!) since its release, alongside the storyline going along themes that people can relate to worldwide no matter the culture and age especially with the underlying themes of the game brings, for this reviewer, a connection or at least the prominent idea of the importance of many things everyone has in common in life--and the simplicity of experiencing existence, and memory.Personally, before playing this game amongst many other things, I felt cloistered and numb to most feelings (primarily due to depression), and coincidentally amongst many other things playing this (or at least listening to the music) helped quite a lot, and felt like breaking this 'shell' of being able to feel less, maybe because of the simplicity of its presentation or the humor [which may be different from person to person, as Dr. Watts can sometimes be a bit too silly], but all these add to the wholeness of detail in the game; lighthearted comic relief, and witty insight in turn. This game would be 'personal' too, on many levels with many people, as far as many reviews can note. Personally, I loved being able to feel--and personally, reflecting on the memory from all exposure within this game brought me to tears.Happy tears.Alongside touching experiences that are coming to society's eyes in recent note (Asperger's/Autism, etc), the game is also presents and showing its stuff rather than telling it all (given the dialogue and such) by letting you experience everything through the eyes of characters themselves, or at least those nearest to them to get their story.The Developers and their team are also very spirited and communicative folks! That's a major plus--including how they treat people, fan and otherwise alike.Would recommend this game fully--alongside recommending it for generations to come. The DLC (including the comic) are also worth the experience! (Wordless--picture only comic)E: My English may not be that good in writing this review! Apologies ahead!			"

												I went into this game not expecting much out of it. It was cheap and I was bored. A lot of my friends had played it and said good things about it, and there's not much I can say in detail without spoiling, however, here are some criticisms and praises of the game.Criticism:The control scheme takes some getting used to, and you'll find yourself getting stuck on objects you didn't know you could. You can move by either clicking an area, or using the arrow keys on your computer (I didn't try playing with a controller or game pad). The game also tends to be a bit repetitive in gameplay, where you are continuously, until the end, doing the same thing over and over again to get more and more of the story. It's also a pixel art game, so if you're looking for amazing graphics, look elsewhere.Praise:The score for this game is absolutely amazing. I love all of the music from the game, and it is used to fit ambiance of the scenes very well. The game is very immersive in its story, where, if you take the time to care, you'll develop a bond with the characters as you traverse time. The overall story is absolutely amazing, and where the game lacks in overall gameplay, it makes up for in this story. If you're looking for an emotional, story oriented game to spend a couple hours on, this is definitely not a bad purchase. I'd most certainly recommend this game to anyone who wants a heavily story oriented game.			"

 This will hit you right in the feels....and you'll be glad it did. Don't be put off by the way this game starts, I was, and I beg you to learn from my mistake.After playing through the first 10 minutes or so i quickly declared the game to be ""boring as hell"" and ""A magnificent waste of my time"", but when I stumbled upon it in my library again late yesterday evening I gave it another shot....and played straight through the night just so I would get to finish it, hell I even played the minisodes while I was at it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, it might not give you that adrenaline rush some people crave but it will sure as hell kick you right in the feels, and you'll thank it for doing so. During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.This game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.

												Great story with terrible graphics (game runs on a stupidly small resolution with no options to change that). The gameplay mostly consists of walking around, clicking on things and reading the dialogue. But the writing is excellent. The story is about a dying man whose last wish is to go to the moon. You play as the employees of a corporation that is capable of altering people's memories to give them the illusion of having a different life thus fulfilling their last wish before they die. The narrative unfolds in a reverse chronological order as you go back in time through the old man's memories, learning about his life and finding a way to make his wish come true. It's an interesting way to tell a story and it's executed quite well here.			"

												This game was truely a great experience, and I very much enjoyed playing it. So I would definietly recommend you to buy it, even for its full price, because this is the kind of developer we should be supporting.The game was a pleasent surprise, as it offered much more than what I had expected from a 2D RPG. The story caught my attention right from the very beginning and it never really went dull. The characters were interesting, and I found the music to be very nice and suiting to the rest of the game. The game mechanics wasn't anything out of the ordinary, and honestly it didn't really need to be either. I found the game to be very well polished, and of very high quality, and I would definietly say its one of the best 2D RPG games that I have ever played on PC.Pros:+ Great storyline, with a very nice paced progression.+ The length of the game is just perfect, and it never feels too slow or too fast.+ Well developed characters.+ Great sense of humor, without being too over the top.+ Nice and suiting music.+ Easy to get 100% steam achievement ( if you care about that )Cons:- I can't really think of anything bad to say.

												I've been meaning to get this game for a long time. Now I finally had a chance to actually play it, and I must say I regretted not getting it sooner. There was not a single thing I did not like about To The Moon. The story is well-written, the soundtrack is simply amazing, and the art is fitting. The mechanics could have been better but nothing that's stopping me from thoroughly enjoying the game.John's dying wish is to go to the moon, and the doctors, Eva and Niel, are contracted to fulfill it. To do it, they need to dive into John's memory to find out the cause of that desire. The story uncovers as you gradually dig deeper into John's past one stage at a time. This is a nice reminder that story progression doesn't necessarily means going forward.The puzzle pieces start to fit together as you go, and you get to know more about the characters, all of which are likeable in their own ways. Although, I find it funny that while the story is supposed to revolve around John, I feel like River is the most developed character throughout the story. I slowly started to understand why she acted the way she did, what she really wanted, how her mind worked, and I felt more sympathetic towards her than any other character. But while it's all dramatic and emotional, it is balanced by the constant comic relief mostly by the dialogue exchanges between Eva and Niel.The art isn't at all remarkable but it complements the atmosphere of the story very well and I probably won't have it any other way. Despite the rather low quality, they make up for it by using appropriate visual effects and color schemes. Even the subtle sprite movements, such as the eyes and arms, can show you what the characters are thinking or feeling during certain events. The soundtrack is, like I mentioned earlier, simply amazing. Even the simple piano piece that John wrote for River was very soothing and fun to listen to.Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game with good story.

But diving into the memories of 'Johnny', experiencing some of the most memorable moments in his life... Wow. That's pretty much all I've got. Just wow.

												This game has such a phoneomenal story. The gameplay is fairly linear and simple but it acts as the perfect vehicle for something like this. It definitely could go a lot further with some of its elements but that may be what they intend to do with the sequel that is in the works.When I played this I literally could not stop until it was all over. It was so emotionally charged and engaging that I stayed up all night to finish it and I really love sleep. There were so many moments in this game that made me cry (in both the sad and the extremely happy ways). It has the feel of many SNES RPGs so if you played a number of those growing up it will manage to pull at those nostalgic heart strings as well. Play this game. It's cheap and doesn't take long to complete. It's such an amazing experience that I could not imagine I would willingly pass it up.			"

												This game came highly recommended to me, so I purchased it during the Steam 2013 Winter Sale. This little short story game is really touching. This game has all the feels. I recommend playing through the entire game in one go. It has only a few hours of game play altogether.Don't read any spoilers for this game. It WILL ruin the game for you.The gameplay itself wasn't great and rather repetitive. You are basically just walking around collecting items and checkpoints while solving some easy puzzles. But if you can get past that, it is well worth your time to go through it so you can see how this story unfolds.I highly recommend this game.At the very least, you should check out the soundtrack to this game. The soundtrack is amazing.

												Although the gameplay is not the best around, I can safely say it accomplishes what it wants to. To tell a story.The music is as great as it gets and the language - the characters' dialog, even their body language - offer a unique story-telling experience, backed up by the simplest game mechanics a game can have. I'd primarily tag it as a novel, always leading only to one possible outcome-ending, thus no choices are made by the player.Great game. Can't express enough how much I loved it. I recommend it for all the people to experience it, though I believe the story itself targets the more grown-up, or, might I say, mature gamers.			"

												'To the Moon' is a reminder that first impressions can be misleading. When I began playing, I found myself wondering whether I had picked up an amateur title. The dialogue and interface are a bit sloppy, and it takes some trial and error to figure out the controls. However, overlook these aspects and a well-paced, suspenseful story begins to unfold over instalments. To my surprise, I concluded this interactive story with personal reflections, deep thoughts and a sense of appreciation.Additional notes:- With a Logitech controller, there were some issues. At one point in the game, the player is required to walk across logs in order to proceed with the story. I got stuck behind a log, which rendered the entire 'level' unplayable. I ended up walking up the side of a lighthouse, off cliffs and then eventually entered the sky. I was forced to reload my save several times. Eventually I discovered that for this particular section of the game, it is better to resort to the keyboard controls instead.- Nice music, but somewhat repetitive in nature.			"

												It's a short but an amazing story driven experience. Only a handful of things were predictable, but not the most important things. The way everything seemed to connect was excellent and I cannot go into too much detail without giving spoilers, so I wont. I will say that the story is quite the tear jerker to some sensitive people, my masculinity barely protected me from drowning my eye sockets.... barely. ProsSoundtrack is great, graphics are good for what it was trying to do, story is excellent. Game has a lot of good funny moments to make up for the depressing moments. This game is one of few evidences that video games can be art.ConsAs any story driven game, replay value is nearly non existent. This will be something you will not play again most likely.Gameplay is non existent. It is like a topdown rpg meets point and click. You are just playing an interactive movie (not necessarly a bad thing imo)It's pretty short, but considering I wasn't going to stop playing until I finished it the moment I launched it the first time, maybe that was a good thing for me because I gotta go to bed.

												I honesty didn't know what this game was about. From one of the screen shots in the store page I somehow expected a RPG. It is not.Gameplay-wise this ""game"" does not have a lot to offer. You collect items through some restricted areas, resolve a puzzle and jump to the next area. It's not the game's strong suit. This is not about gaming, not in the most literal sense anyway. This ""game"" is all about its story. It plays like an interactive movie.Like many have said before me, it would spoil the whole thing to go into details on why the story is so poignant. And it's also hard to put into words. Think “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”.It is true that this game is all about experience, because, well, it’s about navigating through one person’s history, memories, emotions. The more you dig into that life, the more you uncover some truths. Some feel very wrong, other absolutely great, but the whole process never ceases to feel incredibly intrusive.This is one of those story where you’re not sure where it’s headed before being close to the end. You don’t really know why that specific objective has been set (having a dying old man go to the moon), you just know you have to get there.If I were to explain what happens during the big reveal, I would probably make it sound cheesy. But not this game. The execution is great and unravels the missing pieces at the perfect moment. (I’m thinking about the star-gazing scene, for those who are wondering, not the... hum... reverse-engine one)Once you have reached that point, the rest of the story was pretty much predictable in my opinion, but I still enjoyed it very much. I put on my cry baby suit and didn't stop until the end, or rather 10 minutes after I closed the game.The conclusion both feels utterly wrong and completely right, and is endearingly beautiful.You know these movies/books/games/songs that leave you bewildered, happy and sad at the same time? And the feeling lingers on for the rest of day? This is one of them: it has one of the most heartfelt stories I have experienced, up there with the movie I mentioned earlier, Shadow of the Colossus and the likes.♥♥♥♥ing play this game.			"

												This isn't my typical game. Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the ""interactive story"" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.With that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!The graphics look old and ""nostalgic"" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual ""gameplay"" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion. Every part of the game strengthens the story in a big way.9/10Wear a helmet			"

This connection had less to do with the game’s story, and more to do with the design: to provide a heart-rich story that reminds people of what’s important – life, family, and sacrifices for the ones you love.""River’s story fascinates me because the story of people with Asperger’s Syndrome rarely gets told.

Score: 95/100To call this ""a game"" would be (with the current state of gaming industry) an insult towards this piece of art.Most people who played the game loved it (and so did I). Some complain about the writing and I'd say there were some ""weaker"" parts where the dialogues could seem a lil' bit shallow, but the story itself compensates for any mistakes the developers might have done.There's nothing much more I can say without spoiling the story. If you haven't played the game yet, then go ahead! What are you waiting for??And the best part? Since our memory isn't perfect and the story is rather complicated, you will forget some parts sooner or later. So after a while, you can replay the game and fully enjoy it over and over again ;)Also, this is episode one. There are more games to come, so keep track of http://freebirdgames.com/ and their facebook/twitter. They also have some other games/series on their site, free to download.Finished twice so far.

												An absolutely beautiful story, delivered in a pace slow enough to let you contemplate every moment, but still making you play a second time to fully comprehend all the little details. Clearly, this game has been crafted with plenty of passion and experience.The very introduction reflects the entire game's mood perfectly. The protagonists are having delightful interactions, eventhough they drove over an animal and had a car accident.  Throughout the entire game, you will experience this contrast of cheerful colours, bright music and lighthearted dialogue against cruel reality, shocking revelations and gruesome secrets.As for the story itself, the characters are all congenial in some aspect. There are no uninteresting interactions and no unexplained plot conveniences. Besides some joke content not relevant to the story (instead to brighten the mood), there are no plot holes or unnecessary story elements. Everything of the actual story makes sense in the end, but a few questions about the frame story remain unanswered, probably to be expanded on in the next ""episodes"".If you like story-driven games and don't mind the pixelated graphics, you should definitely consider playing this game!

												To The Moon by Freebird games. This is such a great game. One of my favourites for sure. Don't watch the videos on YouTube, just play it. It might look basic/boring, but play it to the end and you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already. [Overall rating 8.5/10]Gameplay is pretty average. There isn't much exciting about the gameplay. You click to move, search for objects, click objects, talk to NPCs and that is about it. Don't expect a lot from the gameplay but what it lacks here, it excels in storyline and audio. I believe the gameplay is meant to be quite simple so that more people can experience the story. Even though gameplay is a big deal in video games, this game was amazing still. [Gameplay rating 6/10]Storyline was something else. Beautiful. When you finish the game and reach the credits, you want to applaud... after you've wiped away the tears of course. If' you're just starting this game, I can't stress how important it is to play this game to the end just for that experience alone. The story alone makes up for the simple gameplay and graphics. [Story rating 10/10]Graphics are retro style, like something from a SNES time RPG. Don't expect something cutting-edge from the graphics, but they are detailed enough for you to see facial expressions and catch the emotions needed. [Graphics rating 8/10]Audio is amazing. I find that I'm listening to the full soundtrack regularly. The song, ""Everythings Alright"" by Laura Shigihara still gives me the feels when I hear it. Amazing voice, and amazing soundtrack. Audio often helps a great deal with infusing emotions into a story, this is definitely the case with To The Moon. [Audio rating 10/10]Instead of showing gameplay or epic moments in the game. I will leave you with a YouTube link for the full soundtrack. Enjoy.

												To the Moon is an amazing story more than a game. You follow a dying man's life memories backwards to implant an artificial memory of him fullfilling his lifelong wish to go to the moon, thereby letting him have a happy memory before he passes. It's not until you reach his childhood memories do you understand the missing pieces and why he wants to go the moon in the first place. It's extremely sentimental, heartfelt, and touching. The soundtrack is so good and beautiful. The game is worth every penny.			"

												To The Moon is one of those games you instantly fall in love with. With it's simple, but elegant design, incredible writing, and thrilling, heartfelt tale. Beauty is a perfect word to describe it. The storytelling is masterful, and complex, and charming. The characters are lovable. You play as the two scientists who assist the man in the pursuit of his dream, and often act as the comic relief for emotionally tense situations. Much of the gameplay is a variation between puzzles and ""point and click"", however, I advise you buy the game on sale, as its only a good solid 3-4 hours when playing normally without guides.To sum eveything up, To the moon is a game I highly reccommend for people who love a detailed and great storyline, while also having a complex and incredible experience of emotions.

												A game that has to be experienced, it has more humanity and is more affecting than most movies, music, or literature today - a true diamond amongst rubbish if  you can get past its shortcomings.The gameplay is very tedious and boring, looking objectively, and it was at times frustrating, but for me it was still worth the thousand clicks and badly programmed movement.The writing was a little amatuerish, I can't help but feel like it was on purpose though. I don't think the writing and dialogue was supposed to be adult and mature. I pretty much ignored the, at times, childish dialogue and focused on the main part. I still believe it is worth the tiny investment of time and money. Thumbs up!I think there is a 2 mini episode game Sig corp that has been added to the game, I haven't checked it out yet and I don't know what it is about.			"

												I never knew a game could bring out such raw emotion and have such beautiful storytelling. It tugs on the right heart strings every step of the way and I could not close out of it once I started. Finishing it in one sitting is how it is meant to be enjoyed. If you haven't played this game yet please please please buy it right this instant, I cannot stress enough how no one in their right mind can possibly live without experiencing this surreal story. Never before has a game gotten me so immersed that I was forced to play half of it through tears. Simply beautiful, I'm still teary-eyed. I'll never look at a lighthouse the same way again, so thank you Freebird Games and everyone who helped make this game. This was an experience I'll cherish.			"

												As an individual with Asperger's syndrome, I found this to be a very touching story that made it very difficult to retain my bodily fluids. Where this game lacks in gameplay (There is hardly any) it makes up with its deep plot line, pleasent soundtrack, and references to pop culture.    If you were to choose to purchase this title, I would recommend getting some bags of chips (or just pick your nose the entire time, I don't care) and taking in the entire game in a single sitting.    I shall not give this a number rating because everybody will understand and percieve it differently, but for anybody who can appreciate a work of art that tells a touching tale, I would reccomend this from the bottom of my heart.

												*sigh*What can I say about this game. Well, I expected more, I feel empty.The story is good, it keeps you interested enough to keep on playing. It has some really interesting and totally unexpected plot twists. The characters are likeable, you can get attached to them. It also has some awesome references that I'm pretty sure everyone loves. Music is also great.Now, there are some small mistakes like I wanted options in the game. On fullscreen the game was slightly to the left, resulting in a black area on the right, wanted to switch resolution to solve the problem. The game also a bit loud, being able to control the volume would be nice. Controls are a bit clunky.Other things I didn't like. There are some holes in the story, I feel there are parts that requires explanation, things that the game doesn't tell you, where I feel it's necessary. I also don't get emotionally attached to River and John, at least not much. I honestly do not believe that they loved eachother. River was cold all game not even caring about Johns feelings, and I think she is selfish, while I don't think John really loved River, looking at the not looking up the illness of River, the girl was just a person who is not like everyone else for John. Since I felt no real love between them, I couldn't really grew to them. The story itself is emotional, but mainly because of the two doctors.I built up emotions, I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I'm not attached to John and River, so I'm not really touched by their death, despite the fact that I'm insanely emotional and it's easy to get me crying.Anyhow, all in all, the story is not bad, if you can buy that the two of them loved eachother, you are going to enjoy it a lot more than I did. It's not a Professor Layton: Unwound Future(the story that touched me the most), but it worths that 4 hours it requires to play it through.			"

												I'm not gonna lie, I got a little choked up, but because I'm a real G, I sucked those tears back in. It's a story worth experiencing, and has a soundtrack worth buying.

It's all in perspective. But I digress. Get this game. It's a no-brainer. This story is what I can only describe as: one of the few horses that you can't not ride. This, along with TellTales The Walking Dead, and a few others that I can't remember at this late hour, all fall into this stable of must-ride stallions (This joke will make sense once you buy the game).

Simply Amazing!TL;DR? Get this game! You will not regret its purchase especially at its price. For the five hours you will invest in the game, it will leave a mark on you forever!Pros:★ The story is one of the best I've ever experienced.★ Has a seamless feel to the game keeping you engaged.★ Cheap but definitely not nasty.★ The soundtrack is amazing and adds to the story.★ Left me crying like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.Cons:✖ Lack of any real 'gaming' may discourage some.✖ Left me crying like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.'To the Moon' would appear to start off like any other indie video game and may take a good five or ten minutes to understand on how it has been set out. But once you fall into the world of mystery that surrounds this game, you quickly become involved in a story that will leave an impressionable memory and have you wanting to reach for the story once again. Now if you are after action or involvement with a whole heap of WASD key bashing then this game does not suit that purpose. But if you are after a quiet evening and are ready to be involved in an amazing story then 'To the Moon' will be exactly what you are after.The only hiccup I have with this game is the puzzle sequence and found that it is Freebird's way of calling this a game. Whilst I do enjoy walking around talking to people and exploring the environment I found that the puzzle part wasn't exactly needed in the end development. Personally I love the piano and this game hits all of the perfect tones for the emotions it's trying to set. The music to this game plays a big part to each area you walk into and sets the mood very nicely. I don't want to give too much away as the mystery of the game is the gem in itself, but I promise you will find a connection to every single character that you find in the game.This is a game I know I will come back to in years time to come, just so I can listen to its story once again like any great book.

												This game has been in my library for quite some time, only when a friend recommended this that I started playing it one bored afternoon. I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from. The game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.This is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.

												This game has the BEST story of any game I've ever played. I read a lot of reviews about this game and all of them said that it had the saddest ending of any game ever. At first I was like pfffft yeah right and I was very hesitant to buy it. I randomly bought it yesterday and played through it in one sitting. It's about 4 hours long. Let me tell you this, this game has the saddest, most amazingly written story of any game I've played, any book I've read, or any movie I've seen. If you don't shed a tear by the time you've finished playing this game I refuse to believe you are a human being. The way that everything plays out and the soundtrack the accompany the setting go perfectly together. I know that 10 bucks seems like a little much for a 4 hour game but this is not just a game, it's an amazing piece of art that I think everyone can enjoy.			"

												I played To The Moon after some heavy insistence of a friend of mine. At the first sights I felt attracted to its detailed scenarios although the cartoonish style of the characters were something of a drawback. However, the more I got into the story, and felt puzzled by it, the more that world seemed believable and the more its characters grew on my mind.Have you read a compelling book and felt the desperate urge to turn pages and pages because you HAD to know what was going to happen?  Playing To The Moon is like reading one of those books, there is a point in the story where you CAN'T turn back and you have to fulfill the quest.This is a game of mild exploration, mild puzzles and increasingly beauty in its storyline. I felt compelled to finish it just like first the time I play Max Payne, and although the story has nothing to do with revenge and bloody murder, the kind of urgency, of NEED to see what will happens, is the very same.Also, the game has some funny moments where you can't help but laughing hard (I did it and it was 2 A.M.!). Last but not least, To The Moon is graced with an a awesome soundtrack, it might be a bit repetitive, but all the songs fit perfectly in the right moments, not just being a background noise, but their piece of the stroy with their beauty.If you like playing games for their stories, then this is for you!

												This is a very beautiful game, all though it is in pixels - but it doesn't matter, the game is still georgeous. And the music is amazing. I had a very good experience playing ""To the Moon."" But if you're considering to buy, don't do it if you prefer a lot of gameplay, because in this game, there is a very small amount of game play. VERY SMALL. If you want to buy it, you buy it for the story. A story so fantastic, well-written, cute, funny, unpredictable, sad... oh so sad... but so good! And with lots of plot twists! And also VERY awesome with lots of modern internet references from the one and only: dr. Neil Watts. I can recommend this game 100 %, it's so fantastic - still shaking because of the this-game-was-extraordinarylylyly-good.			"

												""In GameSpot's 2011 Game of the Year awards, To the Moon was given the ""Best Story"" award, which was won against Catherine, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Portal 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles."" Also, this game has Metascore rating of 81 which is pretty unusual for some indie pixel art.I've accidentally found this game in my collection, it was purchased in some bundle and became long forgotten. I decided to start it at least once to see what is it about and reduce number of unplayed games on my steam account.And it definitely wasn't a mistake. The game is a great story, presented in a clever way that keeps you interested for straight four hours. I won't lie - there isn't a lot of choice or freedom in this game, it is more of an interactive fiction that tells you about the entire lifetime of one person, so you could grant him a wish he couldn't get in his real life. You just sometimes press buttons to move to the next story point, but it is nicely told, gives you something to think about and with a plot twist. Everything we love about stories.And one more thing: there is no city, but there is a man. And there is a lighthouse.			"

I don't want to spoil anything, but it is amazing.  It is such a delicate and touching story, with so many seemingly random, strange things, that all come together in an absolutely amazing way (by the end of it...mind blown).  A story about life, death, love, sacrifice, it is stunning.  Buy this game, play it all the way through.  It is a masterpiece that far exceeded all of my expectations.  This by far is the most powerful game I have played.  Never experienced anything like it.  Best story in a video game that I have ever seen.

It probably has one of the best stories I have ever seen in a game and the experience is very emotional.

												*sigh*What can I say about this game. Well, I expected more, I feel empty.The story is good, it keeps you interested enough to keep on playing. It has some really interesting and totally unexpected plot twists. The characters are likeable, you can get attached to them. It also has some awesome references that I'm pretty sure everyone loves. Music is also great.Now, there are some small mistakes like I wanted options in the game. On fullscreen the game was slightly to the left, resulting in a black area on the right, wanted to switch resolution to solve the problem. The game also a bit loud, being able to control the volume would be nice. Controls are a bit clunky.Other things I didn't like. There are some holes in the story, I feel there are parts that requires explanation, things that the game doesn't tell you, where I feel it's necessary. I also don't get emotionally attached to River and John, at least not much. I honestly do not believe that they loved eachother. River was cold all game not even caring about Johns feelings, and I think she is selfish, while I don't think John really loved River, looking at the not looking up the illness of River, the girl was just a person who is not like everyone else for John. Since I felt no real love between them, I couldn't really grew to them. The story itself is emotional, but mainly because of the two doctors.I built up emotions, I wanted to cry but I couldn't. I'm not attached to John and River, so I'm not really touched by their death, despite the fact that I'm insanely emotional and it's easy to get me crying.Anyhow, all in all, the story is not bad, if you can buy that the two of them loved eachother, you are going to enjoy it a lot more than I did. It's not a Professor Layton: Unwound Future(the story that touched me the most), but it worths that 4 hours it requires to play it through.			"

												Breathtakingly beautiful.I have just finished playing through To The Moon and I'm still shaken from the experience. I was in tears for a good 30 minutes. It's hard to describe why it affected me the way it did, just as it's hard to write a review/recommendation for this game.At it's core To The Moon is a very simplistic game. You walk around clicking the spacebar to find out about certain objects or to go through hours of dialogue that this game has to offer. That's it.However, this is some of the finest, best, most emotionally touching dialogue I've ever seen in any game, ever. The themes of death, love, loss, disease and inner battle are all addressed so well, it's actually quite surprising. It proves that video games stand on their own as a wonderful method of storytelling, because this story couldn't be told through another medium.As you can read on the Steam page it tells the story of two doctors trying to fulfill a dying man's wish. The pair travel backwards through his memories to see how they alter the future to make his dream come true... And that's all that can be said without spoilers.Unfortunately this means I'm going to have to leave this ""recommendation"" on a simple ""trust me"" basis.So, trust me, this is a game you want to experience.These are three hours of your time that will impact an touch you emotionally in a way you probably haven't experienced in a game before.And lastly, this game will really make you think about your life and your choices.There is no one I wouldn't recommend this game to. Even if I don't know you personally, I still want you to buy this game and let it affect you the way it affected me. Hope this convinced you to purchase and play through this brilliant story telling masterpiece.			"

Score: 95/100To call this ""a game"" would be (with the current state of gaming industry) an insult towards this piece of art.Most people who played the game loved it (and so did I). Some complain about the writing and I'd say there were some ""weaker"" parts where the dialogues could seem a lil' bit shallow, but the story itself compensates for any mistakes the developers might have done.There's nothing much more I can say without spoiling the story. If you haven't played the game yet, then go ahead! What are you waiting for??And the best part? Since our memory isn't perfect and the story is rather complicated, you will forget some parts sooner or later. So after a while, you can replay the game and fully enjoy it over and over again ;)Also, this is episode one. There are more games to come, so keep track of http://freebirdgames.com/ and their facebook/twitter. They also have some other games/series on their site, free to download.Finished twice so far.

												To The Moon by Freebird games. This is such a great game. One of my favourites for sure. Don't watch the videos on YouTube, just play it. It might look basic/boring, but play it to the end and you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already. [Overall rating 8.5/10]Gameplay is pretty average. There isn't much exciting about the gameplay. You click to move, search for objects, click objects, talk to NPCs and that is about it. Don't expect a lot from the gameplay but what it lacks here, it excels in storyline and audio. I believe the gameplay is meant to be quite simple so that more people can experience the story. Even though gameplay is a big deal in video games, this game was amazing still. [Gameplay rating 6/10]Storyline was something else. Beautiful. When you finish the game and reach the credits, you want to applaud... after you've wiped away the tears of course. If' you're just starting this game, I can't stress how important it is to play this game to the end just for that experience alone. The story alone makes up for the simple gameplay and graphics. [Story rating 10/10]Graphics are retro style, like something from a SNES time RPG. Don't expect something cutting-edge from the graphics, but they are detailed enough for you to see facial expressions and catch the emotions needed. [Graphics rating 8/10]Audio is amazing. I find that I'm listening to the full soundtrack regularly. The song, ""Everythings Alright"" by Laura Shigihara still gives me the feels when I hear it. Amazing voice, and amazing soundtrack. Audio often helps a great deal with infusing emotions into a story, this is definitely the case with To The Moon. [Audio rating 10/10]Instead of showing gameplay or epic moments in the game. I will leave you with a YouTube link for the full soundtrack. Enjoy.

												The story of a man named ""John Wyles"" and a woman named ""River"" and a dream...a dream to go to the moon. There are three story acts in 'To The Moon': Act 1 will leave an empty feeling in your heart, Act 2 will answer questions left unanswered and Act 3 will drown your hearts in feelings and emotions that you otherwise were containing as you played. I can't spoil anything besides what is told from presentation here. There has only been a few ""games"" (well, this is an 'interactive story') out there which could, despite its graphics (it was made on an RPGMaker - it wasn't meant to be innovative; it was meant to be story-rich) which could touch the hearts of people, including me. Although I was not able to sit through this particular gem in one sitting (I can't feel for a game if noises are around me all the time, and thus only play this when it's quiet enough in the middle of the night...it is 5:22 AM as we are writing this and I've finished it.). I have to say that everyone, and I mean everyone, should see this work of fiction for themselves at least once as a gamer (or even just a bystander).9.5/10My overall feelings towards 'To The Moon'...my words do not justify this work enough and encourage anyone reading this to take the trip as I have. If I could, I would have cried sentimental tears.			"

												For the better part of two years now I've frequently been exposed to opinions that go something like this:""oh em gee, To The Moon is the saddest thing evurrrrr :(""Being a naturally trusting person I assumed these people knew what they're talking about. I was somewhat worried going in and expected some sort of shattering experience. By the second half of Act1 I already found myself waiting for a plot twist of sufficient calibre to come by and salvage my expectations of tearjerkiness, but it never did. I am kinda disappointed. Yes, it's an interesting premise and a touching, excellent story but that's it. Although I'm confident it would make one hell of a Hollywood blockbuster if adapted, I found the whole thing barely more emotional than, say... Dear Esther. It's still a great, worthwhile experience, just... don't have particular expectations. Hype is bad mkay.			"

												A short but heartwarming story.You play as two scientists who are tasked with fulfilling a dying man's wish by implanting him with artificial memories before he dies. He wishes to go to the moon, but he doesn't know why. You go back in time through his memories, from old man to young child, to find out why and to implant the new memory. Admittedly, the reason he wants to go to the moon is a bit ham-fisted, but the story surrounding his life is still quite touching and there are a few other interesting twists.The gameplay mostly consists of just walking around and interacting with people and objects, with a few easy puzzles in between (and an optional game of whack-a-mole for some reason). The gameplay is so minor that I'd honestly be fine if there were no interactivity at all, but it never gets in the way of the storytelling.If you like story-focused games (or even just these kinds of heart-tugging stories in general), l recommend To The Moon			"

												I really enjoyed this one. It's more of an interactive story than a game, but it's kind of brilliant how that perfectly fits the story. It's about memories that have already happened and you're meant to observe with minor input. It's charming all around and when everything ties together you'll ♥♥♥♥ bricks... or maybe cry if that's a thing you do.Now to the complaints! The concept is bold and it's a great accomplishment that it mostly works as a video game. But while the dialog itself has personality, there are parts of it I really dislike. All of the characters (children and elderly) speak at an 18 year old age level. It's supposed to take place in the future, but they use lots of contemporary nerdy video game and anime references. I like how they try to mix jokes in with the sadness, but the out of character meta jokes feel lame and take me out of it.So I'd recommend it to people who already like games and are looking for something story oriented, heartfelt, and different. I'd like to recommend it to people who are less in to games (because they'd easily be able to cope with the limited gameplay), but I think the in-jokes would be too off-putting for them to take the rest of it seriously.TL;DR - Memento + Inception + The Notebook. There's a 1 hour demo, so give it a try!			"

												I stopped playing Mass Effect 3 for almost three months before I could finish it when I lost one of my favorite characters towards the end due to my own shortcomings. I leveled Cloud and friends for hours on end to try and keep her from dying (name held for spoiler protection) in FFVII. I replayed the same misison in Wing Commander II over and over to try and save Spirit. However sad I felt, it always was a game to me and never shed a tear. Not even close.Played To the Moon, and cried enough to rival that of my lifetime. Many may have missed the many many nuances of the story, and after completion I suggest reading up on it. This story takes reality by the feet and drags into the realm of Science Fiction. Every element, color choice, and dialogue is carefully placed to further the central focus of this game, the story. This emotional story/journey is the central focus (not gameplay, graphics, or gimmics) and is something so memorable. For me, I felt the tear jerking moment coming... but still caught me completely off guard. Excellent sound track. Bravo. Well done.Will play again when I actually man up and buy tissues.10/10			"

 This will hit you right in the feels....and you'll be glad it did. Don't be put off by the way this game starts, I was, and I beg you to learn from my mistake.After playing through the first 10 minutes or so i quickly declared the game to be ""boring as hell"" and ""A magnificent waste of my time"", but when I stumbled upon it in my library again late yesterday evening I gave it another shot....and played straight through the night just so I would get to finish it, hell I even played the minisodes while I was at it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, it might not give you that adrenaline rush some people crave but it will sure as hell kick you right in the feels, and you'll thank it for doing so. During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.This game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.

												Yes, this is a sad but thoughtful game. After playing it, I don't even know whether I should be happy or not. Perhaps makers of this game want this reaction. When I entered the house and hear the song 'For River', I can feel the sad inside it. When I finished the first time leap in the old man's memory and meet the old man behind the house, I can even feel his loneliness. He just stand there watching the light tower and maybe he was thinking the old time he spent with his wife. Then every time I leap the memory, I come closer to the truth why the old man wants to go to the moon, and in the last memory, when the old man was a child and went to the festival with his mom and brother, when he went to that cliff far from the noisy party, saw the stars and moon and finally met River, my tears went out, just an accident changed the old man's life. Because that accident his mom lost her mind, he also lost his brother, and the most important thing, he forget the first time he met River and the promise he made with her. River had mental illness but she tried her best to let Johnny remember her. The rabbit, the moon, the light tower, even that toy and bag, every thing was shown to Johnny but he still didn't remember anything. Though at last two doctors finally achieve the old man's dream, but we all know this is just a fake. The past cannot be changed, the story of Johnny and River is still there and two doc can still remember that sad story. And of course as the player I can also still remember their hard and sad life. Two poor patients finally leave this world, but their story won't leave this world. Ehh, I seldom write a article but this game deserve a long article. I strongly recommend everyone play this game and listen to the song 'For River', which full of Johnny's love to River. And at last, just like River said, 'I'm happy now, that's enough.' I hope everyone can find their own happiness through their lives, no matter how hard life is, just don't give up, do what you most want to do, just like River and Johnny.			"

												The story of a man named ""John Wyles"" and a woman named ""River"" and a dream...a dream to go to the moon. There are three story acts in 'To The Moon': Act 1 will leave an empty feeling in your heart, Act 2 will answer questions left unanswered and Act 3 will drown your hearts in feelings and emotions that you otherwise were containing as you played. I can't spoil anything besides what is told from presentation here. There has only been a few ""games"" (well, this is an 'interactive story') out there which could, despite its graphics (it was made on an RPGMaker - it wasn't meant to be innovative; it was meant to be story-rich) which could touch the hearts of people, including me. Although I was not able to sit through this particular gem in one sitting (I can't feel for a game if noises are around me all the time, and thus only play this when it's quiet enough in the middle of the night...it is 5:22 AM as we are writing this and I've finished it.). I have to say that everyone, and I mean everyone, should see this work of fiction for themselves at least once as a gamer (or even just a bystander).9.5/10My overall feelings towards 'To The Moon'...my words do not justify this work enough and encourage anyone reading this to take the trip as I have. If I could, I would have cried sentimental tears.			"

												For the better part of two years now I've frequently been exposed to opinions that go something like this:""oh em gee, To The Moon is the saddest thing evurrrrr :(""Being a naturally trusting person I assumed these people knew what they're talking about. I was somewhat worried going in and expected some sort of shattering experience. By the second half of Act1 I already found myself waiting for a plot twist of sufficient calibre to come by and salvage my expectations of tearjerkiness, but it never did. I am kinda disappointed. Yes, it's an interesting premise and a touching, excellent story but that's it. Although I'm confident it would make one hell of a Hollywood blockbuster if adapted, I found the whole thing barely more emotional than, say... Dear Esther. It's still a great, worthwhile experience, just... don't have particular expectations. Hype is bad mkay.			"

												There are certain games that leaves a horrific scar, be it for bad or for worse; and there are games which leaves an emotional scar, making the experience sweeter and satisfying. Do not let the RPG Maker tag deceive you -- To The Moon isn't an RPG: if anything, it's on the far-end of the spectrum, simply because the game has no combat mechanics of that sort. Instead, it relies on something triple-A games sorely lack and aspire to achieve: a player-invested story built upon multiple layers. And the game wears it like a proud dogtag. What should be the focal point is always the story. About two ""doctors"" that help a man relieve his dreams again, eventually finding out the entire cause of it, and granting his wish of making it To The Moon. The game straddles the line between hope and despairity; loss and gain; tragedy and happiness -- all in under five hours (counting the 2 minisodes which are absolutely must-plays). To The Moon is an all-round experience that leaves you wanting more, and hopes that after you've gone through all the sobbing tissues right by your side, that you still have a bottle of scotch waiting for you once the game ends. Because trust me: you'll need it. Brilliant story, brilliant soundtrack -- To The Moon is one of the best gaming experiences of all-time.			"

												I decided to pull an all nighter on a night off and play through a game. And To the Moon took me on the wildest feels trip I've had in a while. I feel the way the story is unfolded serves to greatly enhance the plot developments; To the Moon is one powerful story I don't think I'll ever forget.The one thing I'd like to note about the game is that it's primarily controlled with the mouse (although there are some sections that use the keyboard). Using the mouse for movement is unfamiliar and may feel weird at first, but after a few scenes you'll more than likely get used to it and thus it becomes a non-issue. One last thing I'd like to say is that if you do choose to delve into the fantastic story that is To the Moon, be sure you have something ready to wipe your eyes with nearby. When I saw how it ended I only cried for 20 minutes.			"

												Breathtakingly beautiful.I have just finished playing through To The Moon and I'm still shaken from the experience. I was in tears for a good 30 minutes. It's hard to describe why it affected me the way it did, just as it's hard to write a review/recommendation for this game.At it's core To The Moon is a very simplistic game. You walk around clicking the spacebar to find out about certain objects or to go through hours of dialogue that this game has to offer. That's it.However, this is some of the finest, best, most emotionally touching dialogue I've ever seen in any game, ever. The themes of death, love, loss, disease and inner battle are all addressed so well, it's actually quite surprising. It proves that video games stand on their own as a wonderful method of storytelling, because this story couldn't be told through another medium.As you can read on the Steam page it tells the story of two doctors trying to fulfill a dying man's wish. The pair travel backwards through his memories to see how they alter the future to make his dream come true... And that's all that can be said without spoilers.Unfortunately this means I'm going to have to leave this ""recommendation"" on a simple ""trust me"" basis.So, trust me, this is a game you want to experience.These are three hours of your time that will impact an touch you emotionally in a way you probably haven't experienced in a game before.And lastly, this game will really make you think about your life and your choices.There is no one I wouldn't recommend this game to. Even if I don't know you personally, I still want you to buy this game and let it affect you the way it affected me. Hope this convinced you to purchase and play through this brilliant story telling masterpiece.			"

												This is by far the most beautiful game I have ever played, and I am not talking graphics here (though they are very charming, they are more gameboy-like).  I don't want to spoil anything, but it is amazing.  It is such a delicate and touching story, with so many seemingly random, strange things, that all come together in an absolutely amazing way (by the end of it...mind blown).  A story about life, death, love, sacrifice, it is stunning.  Buy this game, play it all the way through.  It is a masterpiece that far exceeded all of my expectations.  This by far is the most powerful game I have played.  Never experienced anything like it.  Best story in a video game that I have ever seen.  Pure genius and such an inspired story, Free Bird Gaming...<3 River Wyles.			"

												'To the Moon' is a reminder that first impressions can be misleading. When I began playing, I found myself wondering whether I had picked up an amateur title. The dialogue and interface are a bit sloppy, and it takes some trial and error to figure out the controls. However, overlook these aspects and a well-paced, suspenseful story begins to unfold over instalments. To my surprise, I concluded this interactive story with personal reflections, deep thoughts and a sense of appreciation.Additional notes:- With a Logitech controller, there were some issues. At one point in the game, the player is required to walk across logs in order to proceed with the story. I got stuck behind a log, which rendered the entire 'level' unplayable. I ended up walking up the side of a lighthouse, off cliffs and then eventually entered the sky. I was forced to reload my save several times. Eventually I discovered that for this particular section of the game, it is better to resort to the keyboard controls instead.- Nice music, but somewhat repetitive in nature.			"

												To The Moon...It was short; it only took me around 4 hours to complete. Despite being an RPGMaker game, there's no combat anywhere; it's almost entirely story driven, with a handful of puzzles here and there. Said puzzles were simple, yet rather entertaining. The story is very unsual, though not entirely unique; these sorts of ideas appear from time to time.But above everything else...the feels!I got quite emotional at times, which is rare nowaday.I'm very much glad I decided to play this; it's lovable and memorable.

I feel the way the story is unfolded serves to greatly enhance the plot developments; To the Moon is one powerful story I don't think I'll ever forget.The one thing I'd like to note about the game is that it's primarily controlled with the mouse (although there are some sections that use the keyboard). Using the mouse for movement is unfamiliar and may feel weird at first, but after a few scenes you'll more than likely get used to it and thus it becomes a non-issue. One last thing I'd like to say is that if you do choose to delve into the fantastic story that is To the Moon, be sure you have something ready to wipe your eyes with nearby.

												To be completely fair...I wouldn't call this a game as much as it is an engine for telling a story. That being said the story itself is pretty fair, though it lags a bit in the second act it makes up for it with a few well placed heart wrenching twists in the 3rd. Though the tale is sweet, there is no replay value in this unless you want to relive the few hours of story over and over again while wandering aimlessly from room to room occasionally looking for anything you can click on. The writing isn't the best, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do and the overall feel is charming if not overly memorable. I can't recommend it to everyone, but if what you want is a romantic story then feel free to pick it up.			"

Another positive aspect is the soundtrack. Oh, and there is the fact that there are Doctor Who references in the game. <3I have had just one problem with the game: a bug in it has made me lose more than an hour of gameplay and I had to replay it, which was a bit frustrating.

												I've been meaning to get this game for a long time. Now I finally had a chance to actually play it, and I must say I regretted not getting it sooner. There was not a single thing I did not like about To The Moon. The story is well-written, the soundtrack is simply amazing, and the art is fitting. The mechanics could have been better but nothing that's stopping me from thoroughly enjoying the game.John's dying wish is to go to the moon, and the doctors, Eva and Niel, are contracted to fulfill it. To do it, they need to dive into John's memory to find out the cause of that desire. The story uncovers as you gradually dig deeper into John's past one stage at a time. This is a nice reminder that story progression doesn't necessarily means going forward.The puzzle pieces start to fit together as you go, and you get to know more about the characters, all of which are likeable in their own ways. Although, I find it funny that while the story is supposed to revolve around John, I feel like River is the most developed character throughout the story. I slowly started to understand why she acted the way she did, what she really wanted, how her mind worked, and I felt more sympathetic towards her than any other character. But while it's all dramatic and emotional, it is balanced by the constant comic relief mostly by the dialogue exchanges between Eva and Niel.The art isn't at all remarkable but it complements the atmosphere of the story very well and I probably won't have it any other way. Despite the rather low quality, they make up for it by using appropriate visual effects and color schemes. Even the subtle sprite movements, such as the eyes and arms, can show you what the characters are thinking or feeling during certain events. The soundtrack is, like I mentioned earlier, simply amazing. Even the simple piano piece that John wrote for River was very soothing and fun to listen to.Overall, I really enjoyed playing this game and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a game with good story.

												""In GameSpot's 2011 Game of the Year awards, To the Moon was given the ""Best Story"" award, which was won against Catherine, Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, Portal 2, and Xenoblade Chronicles."" Also, this game has Metascore rating of 81 which is pretty unusual for some indie pixel art.I've accidentally found this game in my collection, it was purchased in some bundle and became long forgotten. I decided to start it at least once to see what is it about and reduce number of unplayed games on my steam account.And it definitely wasn't a mistake. The game is a great story, presented in a clever way that keeps you interested for straight four hours. I won't lie - there isn't a lot of choice or freedom in this game, it is more of an interactive fiction that tells you about the entire lifetime of one person, so you could grant him a wish he couldn't get in his real life. You just sometimes press buttons to move to the next story point, but it is nicely told, gives you something to think about and with a plot twist. Everything we love about stories.And one more thing: there is no city, but there is a man. And there is a lighthouse.			"

												A heartwarming interactive storytelling game and an exceptional written story. It might just be one of the best game I've ever played. The soundtracks are phenomenal and really brings out the right emotions at the right time. One might think that the length of this game is a bit short (~4h), but it's actually just right and works out really well. I would suggest playing this game in one go.I truly believe that people who are not into the RPG pixel art style will be able to enjoy this game, as the main focus is not on the gameplay, but rather the story. I'm going to end this review without further explaining the details of the game. The reason being that explaining too much might ruin the experience and one's expectations distorted by others can itself be a spoiler.			"

												This was probably my favorite game ive played this year. It was brutally beautiful, like watching the first thirty minutes of Up backwards repeatedly - in a good way. Also, do not buy this without the soundtrack, which is equally gorgeous. Graphics and art style were very reminiscent of Chrono Trigger, though the controlls were a little clunky, like some of the other less well designed SNES titles, and the few puzzles were far too easy. But the story, art, and music's amazingness completely eclipsed anything that could be found wrong elsewhere. I was completely blown away.

												I can't even begin to describe how brilliant this game is. I didn't really know what to expect going in, except that the game had gotten really good reviews, and that it was about going through a guy's memories. Turns out it's one of the best games I've ever played, and probably one of the most well-conceived and well-written indie games ever made. The way everything ties together as you work your way backwards through the memories is put together pretty much flawlessly. I couldn't find any discontinuity anywhere.The feels hit me harder than any form of media has since the show Chuck, and it's also genuinely hilarious at all the right moments. One of the characters in particular made me laugh out loud at his clever references and dialogue in pretty much every scene. I love how it's not so over-the-top funny that it comes off as trying too hard. It's just the perfect amount of humour.One piece of advice, I would recommend setting aside a good 5-6 hours and just playing the game straight through. The characters you play as are ""pulling an all-nighter"", and I feel that the game is best experienced in the same way - all at once. I took a break for a couple weeks part-way through, and when I came back, it took me a little while to remember what had happened.TL;DR: BUY. ABSOLUTELY WORTH $11.			"

												I stopped playing Mass Effect 3 for almost three months before I could finish it when I lost one of my favorite characters towards the end due to my own shortcomings. I leveled Cloud and friends for hours on end to try and keep her from dying (name held for spoiler protection) in FFVII. I replayed the same misison in Wing Commander II over and over to try and save Spirit. However sad I felt, it always was a game to me and never shed a tear. Not even close.Played To the Moon, and cried enough to rival that of my lifetime. Many may have missed the many many nuances of the story, and after completion I suggest reading up on it. This story takes reality by the feet and drags into the realm of Science Fiction. Every element, color choice, and dialogue is carefully placed to further the central focus of this game, the story. This emotional story/journey is the central focus (not gameplay, graphics, or gimmics) and is something so memorable. For me, I felt the tear jerking moment coming... but still caught me completely off guard. Excellent sound track. Bravo. Well done.Will play again when I actually man up and buy tissues.10/10			"

 This will hit you right in the feels....and you'll be glad it did. Don't be put off by the way this game starts, I was, and I beg you to learn from my mistake.After playing through the first 10 minutes or so i quickly declared the game to be ""boring as hell"" and ""A magnificent waste of my time"", but when I stumbled upon it in my library again late yesterday evening I gave it another shot....and played straight through the night just so I would get to finish it, hell I even played the minisodes while I was at it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, it might not give you that adrenaline rush some people crave but it will sure as hell kick you right in the feels, and you'll thank it for doing so. During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.This game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.

												A short, sweet (albeit a tad bit bitter) story of remaking a dying man's memories to give him peace before he dies. It's very funny (although Watt can be a ♥♥♥♥), and geniunely charming with some absolutely beautiful musical pieces. Controls are horribly counter intuitive though. You'll get stopped by terrain like flowers and such all the time. I'd only suggest this if you are someone who can get swept into the emotion of a story. If not, this ""game that's not really a game"" will probably wear on you very quickly.			"
