The game is quite tame and all battles take place between robots.  The strategy element is quite advanced though, so little Jimmy might not get the most enjoyment out of the game playing by himself.Did I make time to complete it?:I played for 15 hours and found it very enjoyable throughout.  The game has so many layers that I never found myself bored.  Highly recommended to the rogue-like and XCOM-like crowd!Recommended Purchase Price:$9.99or100% of current retail value of $9.99Reviewer:MisterS42http://www.gamersglance.com "

												While the basic formula for a rougelike strategy game is here, Bionic Dues ultimately falls short due to balancing issues, bad information management, and generally poor presentation.Walls of text and disorganized information are repeated issues in Bionic Dues — a problem that begins as soon as you begin your campaign. With no introduction, you're shown a screen with the portraits of four exos (your remote-controlled mechs) and a pilot, and are asked to select your team for the rest of the game. You can only take four of six exos with you; and can only select one pilot of, again, six. Each exo is armed differently, though you're only given a small description of their capabilities on a hovering text box. The same goes for the pilots: each their own brief backstory, and a special ability that affects the performance of the team. ""+50% to all propulsion stats—"" ""A Mark-4 part will have stats like a Mark-6—"" ""He was able to sneak into the Bahamut Device installations—"" But you've been given no story and have no idea what the gameplay is like yet. What's a Mark-6? What does the propulsion stat do? What's a Bahamut Device? None of this has any context, so you're just guessing at what might make an effective team and hoping for the best. If you later don't like your choices — well, tough; you're stuck with it.Upon selecting your team, you're dumped into a map screen and given a one-page briefing of the situation and your mission. It's then explained that the city is under attack by a robot rebellion, and as the sole remaining pilot, it's up to you to prevent annihilation. That's the extent of your story. No characters are introduced, your pilot is never addressed by name, and the voiceover guy doesn't even explain who he is. As no real world-building is done, and your choice of pilot has no effect on the extremely-minimal story, it makes the whole process of choosing a pilot superfluous. Who cares what their names are, what they look like, or what very brief backstory they each have when it doesn't change anything in the campaign and is never addressed again? ""Choose your pilot"" could have easily been ""choose your buff,"" then addressed the player, themselves, as the pilot of the exos.Pressing OK clears the introductory text, and then several more bulletpoints of information are thrown on screen at once, explaining several basic gameplay mechanics before they're necessary. You can go straight to a mission, but the screen is flanked by icons of your exos and enemy bots, with a big green arrow reading ""Customize"" pointing to your team. Clicking on that gives you another text box of info, and behind it, way more info as you're shown the stats of each exo and every item in your inventory. This was the biggest and most repeated problem encountered: just way too much disorganized information at once, often without context. Each exo has 14 base stats to keep track of, and then as many as five weapons with up to 23 more stats, determined by equipping items to a potential 30 inventory slots.Get used to the customization screen; with up to 50 missions in the campaign, you'll be spending a lot of time here between fights. This does allow you to specialize each exo with careful delegation of items and theory-crafting, but eventually I got tired of sinking so much time into figuring out exactly which item would be best-equipped where and on which exo, with so many possibilities and little nuances, that I skipped it unless I picked up something that was an obviously big upgrade. This may have been easier with better information management, but everything in this game comes as a wall of text in the same typeface. There's very little colour differentiation, and absolutely no graphics or icons used for quick identification. I started skipping the customization, because it wasn't fun; it felt like homework. However, you can only neglect dedicating yourself to this process so much, as the enemy forces get stronger with every mission. Do it, or eventually you will be outclassed.See how much information is written here so far? We haven't even gotten to the first mission yet. Each mission is represented on the map by a different icon branching outwards from your headquarters. You have to complete them in succession to explore the city, until the final battle on the fiftieth day. Bionic Dues outright tells you that the final battle is on day 50, which is unsuspenseful. Your basic objective is to grind through the missions, upgrading your exos with loot and potentially weakening the enemy forces in preparation for one final and massive battle of attrition. If you mess up enough along the way, you can reach that final day, fail the battle, and lose the whole campaign.The battles are turn-based. Your team has to explore a randomly-generated, grid-based battlefield, eliminating enemy robots and potentially destroying certain objectives along the way. All four exos move together on the same grid point, like an old RPG party. Only one of them is active at a time, and that will be the one who can fight and take damage. Moving, firing, using a special ability, or switching between exos takes one turn. Most of the enemies will remain inactive until you aggro them, and then they'll each take their turn after you make your move. They're not particularly challenging; most bots can be dispatched easily by being outranged or lead into traps. However, if you're not tactical, there are times where you can find yourself flanked, cornered, and overwhelmed. You can lose one of your exos in an instant with a poor choice of moves. So what happens then? Can you repair the exo, or is there some sort of penalty? Do you need to replace it, or go through the rest of the campaign with only three on your team? The game never explains, beyond that you'll receive one less piece of loot at the end of the mission.The way each battle plays out varies depending on the type of mission, represented by the icon on the map screen. For example, some turn all destructable objects into powerful explosives, some have hostages that must be protected, and some power up every exo and bot to perform one-hit kills. This adds a little gameplay variety. However, the battlefields, themselves, are visually very bland and repetitive. They all take place indoors, and the scenery doesn't change from one part of the city to the other. Their dark grey floor colouring offers low contrast from the black, unnavigable negative space, sometimes making it hard to distinguish where you can and can't move your exos.Once you complete your objective, you have to navigate to the exit of the level. While this does give a chance to explore and pick up any missed loot, this is often dull, as the main objective and the exit aren't necessarily going to be placed nearby each other. Often you'll find yourself navigating empty corridors as you search for the way out, which may not be easy to find. The exit isn't an actual physical exit from the battlespace, but a circle on one of the tiles, which may be hard to spot at times when it's in the fog-of-war shadow. Poor contrast plays an issue here again. Making it to the exit, in itself, is anticlimactic. You'll be immediately dumped back to the map screen, with no victory fanfare or continuation of a story. Once you've done that, go spend a while calculating how to best upgrade your exos, then repeat the process 48 more times to make it to the final battle. There's no build-up to this moment — it's treated the same as every other mission. The final battle is an endurance run, pitting your four exos against the remanants of the enemy bot army, or as many as can fit in the map at once. It's not harder, just longer. And once you win, your reward? A ""congratulations"" text box. Then you just sit on the map screen. That's it.While the basics are here, Bionic Dues falls short, still having massive room for improvement in its gameplay and presentation. Not recommended.			"

												I thought I'd put up a review for this really underappreciated little game. Developer Arcen Games makes wildly creative, deep, and eccentric genre-benders, the most celebrated of which is their asymmetrical space RTS/4x/tower defense, ""AI Wars."" AI Wars is clearly a great game, but somehow it's this one that I keep coming back to.Bionic Dues is Arcen's take on a ""roguelike,"" but of course in proper Arcen style it is totally unique. Basically, it has a lot in common with a proper roguelike: you guide your characters through a series of procedurally generated dungeons. But there are a *lot* of interesting twists:- You have 4 characters, (which are actually some sort of mecha exoskeleton?) in any combination of ""classes,"" but can only use one at a time, and it takes a turn to swap them out.- Loot and inventory customizaton is of primary importance. Each bot has *tons* of inventory slots, in several categories, and each class is different. Carefully poring over the hundreds of components you find, and optimizing their arrangement on each robot chassis, balancing your overall strategy, is the part of the game that I find utterly addictive. (It feels a lot like ship design in Gratuitous Space Battles, another of my favorites.)- There is a sort of top-level strategy layer linking the dungeons. In between runs, you re-arrange robot parts, and choose your next raid target based on likely risk/rewards and your overall position in the map, with a global counter ticking down to a final level full of particularly nasty enemies. - Understanding enemy AI and abilties is really important. There are a lot of enemy bot types, with simply-defined behaviors that are nevertheless complex in their interactions, and they appear in randomized combinations that can really change the way you approch a given dungeon.- The game can be played with a number of different difficulty options, and core gameplay modifiers like the addition of permadeath, ironman mode, and time-limits on turns. This really allows you to tweak the game to your liking; you can choose to allow save-scumming, seeking the perfect run, or you can make it a much more tense and chaotic affair.One thing that needs mentioning: a lot of the art assets are just awful-looking, especially on the strategy and inventory-management screens. To enjoy the game, you will have to be able to get over this, and see the item illustrations as purely functional conveyors of data. This works fine for me, but I'm sure it turns a lot of people off. Thankfully, I think the dungeon art is pretty nice-looking.Frankly, I also found the music and voices to be awful (though a lot of the sound design itself is pretty nice,) and I tend just turn it off and listen to my own music.Despite all the ugly warts, I keep coming back to this one. If you like procedural turn-based dungeon crawling, and find yourself spending a lot of enjoyable time comparing stuff on inventory screens, this might be a good one for you. I also like that it lends itself well to short play sessions; you can pop in for a quick dungeon or a bit of stat-crunching without feeling too committed. It's also a good game to have running in the background while you're doing something else, taking a turn now and then. All in all, this is a deep little game that's well worth its price tag - at the time of this writing, it's available at the ridiculous sale price of $1.99, and no roguelike fan should miss it.			"

												Basically, Bionic Dues is a rogue-like mix of rpg/strategy dungeon crawler with hi-tech setting, where you fighting ever growing hordes of killing droids with your own droid. War of the machines, basic ""save the humanity from annihilation"" stuff - that's all you'll ever catch about story. You can think of it as of another small thing for touchpads, but no, it's not that simple. Actually, it is like an iceberg, where major part of the game is hiding beneath the surface. And yeah, if you're looking for light walk with painless achievements - that's a very wrong game for you! While its quite easy to catch an opening pattern, farther you go - more skill and luck you need. On Every Turn.Now, the real game is where its mechanics. You have dozens of basic options like which droid class do you prefer, what strategy will be the best with grading that given droid, and how do you planning to save the world? Destroying every enemy bot in the reach from the start, when they are still weak? Or just cutting their numbers by destroying their factories and supplies while building up your muscles for the final battle? Dozens of basic strategic options - and thousands choices on tactics. Will you prefer to raise power of single shot or ammo capacity? Range of sight or splash effect for your rockets? Stealth and traps or brute force and assault?Closer to the end of each match you'll get enough mods for your droid to make him an ultimate death machine of choice. And still you'll be vulnerable, remarkably outnumbered and outgunned in every mission. So you have to consider many steps forward. Always. And that's why I'm satisfied with that ""small looking, gross bearing"" tactical game.There are minuses, of course:- very basic visual part. No, it is not XCom or Jagged Alliance with destroyable 3d environment, that's top-down view rogue-like indie project. Surely not for DOTA kids who are filling about half of Steam auditory.- while it's quite easy to get along with, if you are in any way familiar with rogue-like games... finishing Bionic Dues even once can be very challenging and sometimes boring.- if you're an achievement hunter, that game is a disaster, for to make complete of this game, you'll need to invest Hundredz of Hourz. Not dozens, but hundreds hours of your precious time. And there will be no detailed video guides, like for the Civilization, ""how to prosper on Deity"". To get all 220 achievements, you'll need to master all combinations of battle classes, beating the game about 20-30 times in average. And except diversity of tactics related to these classes, the rest will be repeated again. And again. And again...- inventory, the part of the Bionic Dues, which makes it RPG-like, by selecting a combination of two dozens of attributes installed on your war machine... that's exactly the most boring part in the whole game. In the start, where you have about 5 spare parts, it's ok. But after 10-15 missions you'll be buried with dozens and even hundreds of items, from which you need to choose from. So many players get stacked and bored at this point! But after 20-30 hours of play you'll overcome it, hopefully. Managing one droid is much easier than all 4, and real challenge is where you making through with just one robot, not a squad of them.Pluses are less:- never ending challenge and need to think much forward- many different strategies, which always should be adapted to every mission- fantastic music! to the point where I can start a game not for playing, but just to hear that ambient again. Starting song is gorgeous! I can listen to it over and over again, for hoursOverall, I would recommend Bionic Dues to all fans of turn-based tactical games and I would NOT recommend it for achievement hunters and casual players. This game may looks nice and cosy, easy like the most of the games for touch screens... But in fact it is a very engaging time-killer.7.5/10 saved cities			"

												This is a Simple Rogue like Turn based Robot Shooting game. There are 220 achievements but don't be scared by that since all achievements are available in 5 different difficulty. So that's actually only 220 / 5 = 44 achievements that you have to play to get. My end game record is 229 games with 10 wins and 3 loses to get 100% achievement.The Game graphic is not great but it's rogue like and indie and they did as detail job as they could.The music is repetitive and there is only about 3-4 different tones. IF you stay on the menu page and that song I actually really liked.It's a math game and once you learn the ropes start playing expect difficulty and you will enjoy the game the most under that. Do iron man + extra options last.I really enjoyed 2 weeks of playing this game for nearly 120 hours and if you like rogue like + turn base + robot shooting game. You will enjoy this one.8.0/10.0			"

												Another gem from Arcen, highly recommended if this genre is up your alley! Bionic Dues is a turn-based strategic roguelike where you control four exos (remotely piloted mechs, basically), only one at a time but hot swappable, through a variety of missions towards a final showdown with the enemy robot force. It shines in all the right areas: intelligent randomization, loot, equipment options, a variety of different mission types, lots of different weapon types, exo specializations and commander perks, plus a bunch of achievements. Individual missions are typically pretty short (5-10 minutes tops), so it can be played in short bursts if desired. I've already sunk a ton of time into this, with much more on the horizon. It can be challenging, but good strategy will usually bring you out on top. A demo is also available at Arcen's site. http://arcengames.com/ "

												At first this seemed like the perfect game for me: A roguelike with a tactics and strategic aspect on top of it.Unfortunately all the missions play very much alike and the game gets repetitive fast. Also, the loot is quite boring, since it's just an unending stream of similiar equipment with slightly different numbers. This also means that way too much time is spent between the missions comparing all these slight differences. Maybe some people like this aspect, but i don't. The loot should have been less frequent but more significant.I also question the aesthetic consistency of the game. It's very very ugly and the music is incredibly cheesy. The menu music seem straight out of some cheap anime movie.			"

												On first impressions when I started playing this game, I wasn't too impressed. The difficulty seemed all over the place, there were a lot of numbers and stats everywhere, and things were confusing. But, if you stay on and keep playing, you eventually start to get a hang of it. There is a bit of a learning curve here, but the game has a very nice tactical depth to it and can be loads of fun.Upon starting a new game, you get to select your preferred pilot and 4 mechs/exosuits. Each pilot has a bonus perk of some sort, and each mech has its own strengths and weaknesses, some being more offensively based, others more to do with support stuff, like hacking and stealth. So it's up to you to pick your preferred team.The campaign itself has a simple concept - a robot army is going to attack your HQ in 50 days. Do whatever you can to prepare yourself for this attack. Each mission you do in the city counts as a day. You can go for missions where you find shiny new gear for your mechs to make them stronger, or you can go for missions which weaken the enemy and slow their expansion. The best thing is, you can see on a side of a screen the details of what units currently comprise the enemy army, so you can see how it is affected after every mission you do.The missions themselves take a form of a randomly-generated dungeon with tile-based movement. You can swap between your mechs at will, but doing so counts as a turn, so you have to be very careful in your advance. It is very easy to make a wrong move and to have several enemies on you at once. Both, your units and enemy units, might feel like glass cannons. You could kill an enemy in 1-2 shots, but so can they! So you have to utilise tactics to outsmart them - use range or perhaps area of effect weapons, or even just pull back and surprise them around the corner. You can even deploy sentry turrets to help you in firefights if you've got any available.And in between missions you can customize your mechs with the loot found. The customization is very rich and detailed. Each mech has several slots where gear can fit in, ranging from weapons, to shields, to propulsion systems. It can feel overwhelming at first because there are a lot of things on the screen, but you do get used to it, and everything in the game has a description if you're unsure what something is.Speaking of descriptions, they're fantastic. Everything has an edge of humour in it. When you hover over an enemy, an object, or anything else in-game, you see a bit of funny flavour text about it.The music is also amazing. I first got interested in the game when I've heard its main theme, which is very beautiful with great vocals, but even the tracks that play during missions are also great.I've been enjoying the game so far and started a new campaign already. I would highly suggest to play the first game on an Easy or Casual difficulty level to get familiar with the game. After that, the higher difficulty levels don't seem as bad anymore.Great game. Highly recommended for fans of tactics-based games.			"

												Bionic dues is a roguelike, and plays pretty similar to standard rogue games. You take an action, then everything else does, repeat untill enemies are dead or an objective is complete. You get four party members that you can switch between at any point (costs an action) but only one of them can be on the field at a time, so you're really always controlling a single hero, not a squad.First it should be said that, like most arcen games, Bionic Dues has amazingly good music. Although they are merely adequate as a game developer, they have the amazing Pablo Vega on staff doing all their music. This is especially noticeable in the hauntingly beautiful title track, The Home That We Once Knew.  A song so brilliant i'd recommend buying this game JUST to hear it, despite its other flaws. It really sets the scene and is a truly amazing first impression, sadly it's mostly downhill from there.This game has an unfortunate problem shared by other Arcen titles, in that the game bombards you with information right from the beginning, telling you in pointlessly explicit detail about the final battle you'll eventually have and how to win it. Aside from being overwhelming and working very poorly as a tutorial, this also instantly takes away any sense of novelty or mystery from the game, and you're never really in doubt about what will eventually happen.  The final battle is hyped and foreshadowed repeatedly, and warnings about it are shoved in your face constantly.At the beginning you choose four of the six classes, and one of the six available leaders. this is probably intended to encourage replayability, but i didn't really feel any desire to play it again.After every mission your'e rewarded with a tide of loot with witty descriptions that modify lots of stats, and you can equip your party between missions using these parts. Each squad member has 20-30 equipment slots, so you'll spend a lot of time in there tweaking with equipment loadouts, which is kind of fun at first. However after a while of playing, the system starts to feel shallow, as there's a pretty small range of values that can actually be adjusted, and thusly not much room for ""builds"" or any real modding strategy. You basicalyl want everyone to be reasonably tanky, and all their weapons to be strong enough to 1-shot enemies, with reasonable amounts of range and ammo. this isn't hard to accomplish.Eventually you'll stop caring about most of the loot you get, and just briefly scan the inventory for unusually high values, there's too much of it, and once you've seen one +50% damage mod, you've seen them all. There's no unusual combinations or interesting unique equipment, just ever-increasing generic values, the novelty fades quickly.Each squad member has a small (preset, non-changeable) selection of weapons, and with certain missions they can get a permanant upgrade which gives them additional weapons and equipment slots (again, preset). These upgrades are nice and add an interesting power spike to things, but there's exactly one for each squad member, and they're no-brainers you'll want to grab asap.***** SPOILERS AHEAD ********** SPOILERS AHEAD ********** SPOILERS AHEAD *****Despite the constant warnings and foreshadowing, and especially the warning that i'd have to hold off a massive assault from hundreds of enemies, the final mission was a colossal letdown. It threw a grand total of 80-ish enemies at me (there's a counter) in a single, boring mazelike interior environment, much like any other mission. There was no colossal assault, it was literally a hunt-and-destroy mission like hundreds of others. I had to go and find THEM hiding in tiny pockets of resistance, and just nuke them with aoe weapons. I spent a long time building up a perfectly engineered sniper and engineer-scientist combo, and created a huge fort of sentry guns expecting to have to fight off thousands of bots, and maybe some colossal monster. What i got was a pathetic skirmish with only slightly more enemies than an average mission. it was a dismal and hollow end to the game. There's no real reward or sense of closure either, after the battle you jsut get a ""congratulations you won, now go and relax"" textbox, and the game just stops on the main map screen with nothing being clickable. No ending cutscene, no conclusion to the story, just nothing. I spent £1.74 on this game, and my initial thoughts after buying it were that i'd gotten an amazing deal. But as the novelty wore off, that seemed like a pretty reasonable price. It's great fun for an hour or two, and mildly entertaining for a few more after that, but there's no real reason to replay it.You should probably quit before you finish the game, and just imagine that it had a good ending.

												Arcen Games may well be tiny but they certainly can come up with some pleasantly curious ideas. These are the guys, after all, who brought us the bizarre concept of a strategy game where you fight against yourself – Skyward Collapse – and the highly-acclaimed RTS/4X/tower defence hybrid – AI War: Fleet Command . Thankfully, in addition to being quite oddly named, Bionic Dues does not at all threaten to disappoint our expectations. Instead it continues the trend of stylish and interesting roguelikes peppering the indie-scene, and it does it with all the imaginative design we would come to expect from developers like these. You play the role of a rookie mech pilot tasked with protecting a futuristic mega-city from a sudden robot rebellion. Having four specialised mechs at your disposable, you have 50 days to perform missions which either strengthen your crew or weaken the enemy, before facing off a final massive attack wave in your HQ to end the game. A failed mission means a wasted day and the enemy grows in number and strength whilst you gain nothing. As time goes on, missions increase in difficulty due to the enemy level-ups; thus mimicking the ongoing arms race between your mechs and the belligerent AI mobs. The game embraces RPG-like mechanics and allows several levels of customisation. Firstly, you may choose from a selection of mech pilots who have varying gameplay bonuses; for example, higher quality loot or economic discounts from the item store you can access in-between missions. Secondly, you may select the four mech classes which will make up your team. These range from heavily armoured high-damage short-range tank-like units, to long-range weakly-shielded snipers, to specialised science mechs. Each mech has a different selection of weapons available of the kind you would expect to see. Your mechs are primarily improved over time by equipping them with the items you loot, earn or buy. In traditional dungeon-crawl form, items are named according to their level and bonuses, and colour-coded according to their degree of rareness. Additionally, they come in various types which fit in the corresponding specialised slots on your mech’s load-out. These include various types of weapon-slots, shield-slots, computer-slots, etc. The system more or less mimics a Diablo-style paper-doll with some items being similar to various types of armour or weapons and other types operating more like rings or amulets. However in Bionic Dues this system is further complicated by the fact that each item has a power requirement which limits the number of high-level items a mech can utilise. This upper-limit can only be increased by equipping a certain type of reactor item which, rather than consuming power, produces it. Your mechs don’t actually level-up, and this system replaces that standard RPG mechanic. The overall effect of all these complications in total, coupled with the abundance of loot which improves upon the items you already have, has the effect that it becomes a little hard to care about absolute min-maxing of your mechs’ load-outs. The majority of gameplay happens within the missions. These very much take traditional roguelike form; a basic-sidebar accompanies a top-down futuristic tiled-floor dungeon map. Each mission has a simple objective such as blow up all the control-station-things, reach the exit-point, or kill all the enemies. Your limited sensor range, which varies from mech to mech and can be augmented with certain items, only allows you to see a small section of the map. This leaves much of the map unexplored at first. The apparently randomly-generated maps are filled with item-crates, traps, obstacles, enemies, and, of course, your objective. In addition, loot is hidden behind locked doors which can only be hacked open with a special mech-skill normally best-performed by the science mech. In this busy environment line-of-sight becomes crucial, allowing for either tactical destruction of, or hiding behind, obstacles.Although the game functions in turn-based form, it generally plays quite rapidly as most situations allow and even encourages the player to make moves hastily. This kind of attitude can later prove fatal when a deadly BombBot is accidentally allowed to get far too close for comfort. The gameplay is such that it consistently creates the beautifully ironic why-the-hell-did-I-do-that and oh-my-god-I-am-so-dead moments that roguelike players have come to know and love/hate. In general, Bionic Dues is incredibly well put-together. Every gameplay mechanic is so openly explained in tooltips that absolutely everything can be calculated if so desired. The game’s tutorial popups are slick, well-written and comprehensive. On top of that, the game comes heavily-equipped with a fantastic sense of humour. Everything from the enemy descriptions to the mission briefings are written with the attitude of a winking-smiley and I frequently laughed-out-loud as I read through them. This only backfires in the form of the comedic enemy death-cries, which although entertaining at first soon become rather repetitive and thus somewhat irritating. The 2D graphics are little-more than functional, nevertheless the techno-futuristic style does have a certain charm. The benefit of having this kind of setup, of course, is that Bionic Dues will run smoothly on just about every PC which is actually able to start up. The audio, on the other hand, is a definite cut above the norm. The in-mission music reminds of early-90s midi classics, and the menu music, despite being a bit amateurish, has a certain indie-band charm. The voiceover quality matches that of the music, after each mission a very cool deep-throated narrator gives a mini-rundown on how things are going.The game offers a good selection of 6 difficulty settings which range from casual to an aptly named misery; a popup tooltip describes the exact effect of each setting in as much clinical detail anyone would ever want. As if that wasn’t enough, an additional hardcore mode checkbox sits enticingly below the difficulty slider; taunting the player by promising to overwrite your only permitted save-slot any time something really embarrassing happens.On the negative side, I must admit that the complete lack of both endgame statistics and a decent story-line closure was pretty disappointing. I did also once manage to get the top-down camera lost deep within the fog-of-war and had some difficulty finding my way back to my mechs; providing mild frustration. Finally, it’s worth mentioning that although there is a storyline of sorts accompanying the game, it’s far too weak to be the player’s primary motivation to play on. Putting these minor gripes aside; if you can’t tell already, I really like this game. Indie devs don’t always come up with the goods, but Arcen are doing a damn fine job of it. Bionic Due is not only a necessary purchase for all true rogue-clone fans, but it’d easily be a pride-worthy addition to the game collection of anyone with even a remote interest in this sort of thing.

												The big issue with Arcen Games is how all of them are missing that last level of essential polish, the pass that adds transition effects between menus or visual feedback when you click a button. The result is that all of their games feel fundamentally unfinished, like you're playing the final alpha candidate. That being the case, it's entirely up to the gameplay to redeem the title. With Starward Rogue, it's worth the hassle to experience. With Shattered Haven, it isn't. And with Bionic Dues, it really, very, aggressively is not worth struggling through.Bionic Dues places you as the commander of a futuristic city's defenses. The robots have risen just like the Wachowskis said they would, and you're the last hope of keeping the city from being overrun. When you start a new game you choose four classes of bots to command and your commander persona, and then get dumped to the city overview. The terribly verbose popups explain the setup and your basic approach: Complete missions on the map to grow your forces and weaken theirs in preparation for the final assault on the city.The map is a network of nodes spreading out from your HQ. Completing the mission at a node allows you access to the nodes connected to it. You have 50 days before the robots try to make jaunty hats out of your human♥♥♥♥♥ and each mission takes one day to complete. As you might expect, missions come in many different flavors, providing different challenges, objectives, and rewards. This makes it important to not only choose useful missions in terms of what resources you need, but also for what subsequent missions they unlock.Once you click on a mission, you get launched straight into the wall that Bionic Dues shatters against. The actual gameplay is roguelike, with you moving your bot around dark, narrow hallways one grid space at a time. Enemies don't activate until they get line of sight on you, and you'll have a variety of bots and weapons on each to switch between and fight back with. It looks pretty complicated at first, but you'll soon get the hang of scooting around and picking off enemies from afar.At that point, one of three things is going to happen. The first and most likely is that an enemy bot will end up in your face, either from being strangely well-armored or just hiding behind a door, and systematically one-shots your entire team. Mistakes in Bionic Dues are punished harshly, to the point that stepping one square too far can mean the difference between a flawless victory and total defeat. Your foes are wildly different in the threats they present, but even after memorizing which ones will end you in an instant you're still going to have moments where they pop up from behind cover or a door to ruin your run.If the unforgiving enemies don't get you right away, you might find yourself clicking on them with empty guns. Your bots have two or three weapons each, and they're all on extremely limited ammo counts. This makes it even harder to recover from mistakes, because losing even one bot usually means losing out on ammo essential for reaching the end of the mission. You have stealth and hacking options but of course these too are under strict point limitations. The takeaway after a mere thirty minutes with Bionic Dues is that you need to be on point with your strategy and your resource management right from the gate. And yet even that won't always save you, because of the third issue with the game, heavily randomized factors like traps and consoles. Deadly traps are to be expected in any roguelike but the consoles are just awful, offering random effects in exchange for hacking points but can very easily steal all your ammo or break your weapons. Even the layout of the level works against you, because there's never any logic to guide you to the goal and the foes in your way can number in the single-digits or the high dozens.Presumably you can mitigate some of this pain by upgrading your bots, but there's yet another wall of stats and slots and abilities to sort through for each of your mechs. As with the rest of the cobbled-together interface the upgrade screen is a mashup of overly-detailed item slots and tiny eye-straining text that tries as hard as it can to be funny in far too many words. This is a persistent problem across the entire game, the absolutely atrocious writing that turns simple status messages into a dialog between you and the world's least witty unseen adjutant. You'll find a ton of randomized gear to slot into your mechs on each mission, but sussing out what is actually going to be useful on which mech takes a lot of study and experience that Bionic Dues simply doesn't earn.For as much as I love Starward Rogue, I hate Bionic Dues. Arcen's cluttered, garish graphics are at their worst here with indistinct mechanical shapes dropped onto grids of dark, ugly squares evocative of nothing. The sound design is inconsistent in its impact or even presence, with virtually no audio cues for important happenings like being spotted or stealth running out. These issues could be overlooked if the core gameplay is compelling, but there's far too much frustration and wasted effort to dig through to get to the actual strategy. I'm having trouble thinking of a roguelike I've had less fun with than Bionic Dues, and its only saving grace is that it was eventually succeeded by Starward Rogue.			"

												Wonderful unique turn based and creative game, fun and addictive. If you like turn based strategy games you will love this. The game is finish able even on the first try. The ability to save whenever you wish is a big plus. The interface is easy and straightforward as long as the option for mouse movement is NOT selected (If it is, then placing mines and turrets in a specific location will be a nightmare). The mission variation is fantastic and constant trying to choose which mission to do next and trying to decide when to fight the final battle adds tension to the already tense and fun dungeon crawls. There are several types of missions, and which one you choose can have a significant impact on how the game progresses. A new game starts on the city map where you choose from a web of different mission types. As you complete or fail missions, more are revealed. You win the game by either surviving the inevitable final bot onslaught, or lose when your headquarters are destroyed. There is a lot of replay ability value as your strategy will need to change depending on the lead character you select and the mech team you select. During the missions, you only control one mech (called ""exos"" in game) at a time, but you have four in your stable. There is a ton of generated loot you can use to improve your exos with, which you get from completing missions, find in chests, or buy from the shop. You can swap your exo for another at any time, though it will cost you an action. You lose the mission if all four exos are destroyed. There are six different exo classes, with an epic variation of each. There are also six different pilots to choose from, each with a unique ability. A solid game, that gives you a deep tactical experience.			"

												Not my thing. I expected a team strategy game, I got a turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler where you control one mech at a time and swap them out like they are stances or armor sets as opposed to actual units.After getting over my confused expectations, I still found the game lacking. It's closer to a puzzle game wherein the goal is to maximize use of your resources (ammo, health, etc) to clear the boards in hopes of collecting loot you can use in upcoming missions.I can see the appeal, but it's just not for me.

												Saving a the city from a robot invasion gotta be fun, right? Well it is! Especially if the robots are riddled with bugs for you to exploit at your own leisure.The result is a very fun rogue-lite with a unique twist that got even better after the recent (and free!) 1.1 update, which radically improved balance, upped the challenge level significantly and threw in a bunch of optional conducts to make your experience even more !!fun!! by emphasizing the rogue-like aspect of the game (Permadeath anybody?).Feeling superior 'cause you are able to find a solution to any hairy situation given the time even on Expert or the aptly named Misery difficulty?Enabling ""On Your Toes"" will turn your game upside down. Who said the bots will always be waiting for you to do something ; )?The only gripe I have with the game at this point is the customization of your mechs (called Exos), which can consume significant time especially in the late-game. Lovely if you are into min-maxing your stats for growing periods of time, a little too much work if you just want to be off on your next mission.Definitely worth a shot!			"

												Bionic Dues is a turn-based game about your robot (though technically you have a squad of four units at your disposal, you are effectively controling a single one at a time) kicking the crap ouf of tons other robots.In a sense, it is reminiscent of classical Game Workshops boardgames like Space Crusade, but Arcen Games being Arcen Games, they put a lot of extra layers beyond the simple gunning : hacking, trappings, a simple yet interesting strategic layer...The game atmosphere might be hit or miss depending on the person : the soundtrack is weirdly addictive and pumping, like some Karaoke Korean game might be. I personally found the robotic chatter of the enemies, somewhat excusing their stupid or reckless behaviours, quite funny. Simply put : I love this game. I found the combination of fitting your dear robots (though it gets number intensive pretty quickly) and seeing them in action laying mayhem - with the mission sometimes going not at all as planned of course - to be incredibly entertaining.A demo is linked into the forums. I personally instantly bought the game after playing it, so if you are curious about it, I strongly suggest you give it a spin.The game seems very fit for iterating on the subject matter and extending its mechanics. Here is only hoping it sees the same fate as AI War and gets improved and improved upon, to the point it reaches genius.			"

												Randomized top-down turn based ""dungeon"" crawler (1 turn = 1 move, like one step in cardinal direction or taking a shot, for you and your enemies). Your ""party"" can consist up to 4 different ""members"" of various ""classes"", but you only get to control one of your ""party"" members at a time, and swapping them in and out is a move on its own.And there's also Mark XXVII Looted Epic Loot of Looting system thrown in for a good measure.Except instead of going deeper into a fantasy dungeon, you go deeper into a sci-fi city in order to fight off crapshoot AI menace or your corporation will nuke the city, just to be sure, which means millions of lives lost as evac is, apparently, not an option (due to hand-wa... I mean, overcrowding).The city exploration facet adds whole new dimension to the game - instead of one direction, down, you get a choice where to go next and the web of accessible missions grows as you go. Do you want to focus on particular type of loot? Make yourself stronger or enemy weaker? Or perhaps the next mission is not too great, but is located strategically and you need it to unlock path to some juicier mission in sight?In default settings you get 50 missions/days to prepare for the ultimate showdown, each passing day meaning enemy robots grow in strength and number for assault on your base, and you are hoping to keep up, occasionally bringing them down a notch or two.This is quite a roguelike experience, although permadeath and iron man mode, iron man mode, aren't turned on by default and who knows, maybe you want to keep it that way, at least at first, because the game is rather not easy as it is.And it is actually a thinking man's game, if you just want to go guns-a-blazing, you're in for a bad time. It's not a top-down twitch shooter; you need to be very deliberate in your actions.This is an interesting mix of ideas, as one should expect from Arcen Games. Has the potential to suck you in good, but also I see potential for it not hitting right notes with everybody. I, for one, certainly dig it.			"

												This game plays somewhat like a roguelike dungeon crawler. You spend a turn to either move or take an action, then all the enemies do the same.Each mission takes place in an enviroment of connected corridors and rooms where you get aggro from nearby robots and use your abilities to either avoid them or kill them. The goal of each mission is to achieve objectives, leave the map, and get diablo style prefix-item-postfix style loot, complete with color coding for rarity.You have a team of 4 different characters (exos, human sized robots) but they all occupy the same map tile, and you can only have one active at a time. That's the twist in the particular dungeon crawling game. It takes a turn to switch between your exos, which you'll want to do because the different exos have different abilities and limited resources like ammo and hitpoints.After each mission you can customize your exos with all that neat loot you've been finding. The various parts you find tend to be multipurpose, so there are always choices to make, both about what exo gets what part, and where on the exo to put the part. I found the exo equiping part of the game very satisfying and had several super tricked out exos specializing in incredible shield tanking, firepower, stealth/virus attacks, and stealth/virus attacks near the end of my first game with the default character and exo setup. Overall, I'd say this made the medium difficulty campaign fairly easy. The final mission(s) were mostly a chore to hunt down all of the bots. I've yet to replay the game, but replayability seems high since you can pick different character bonuses and exo team composisions each game. Not to mention all the random stuff.Having played AI War, The Last Federation and Skyward Collapse, I would say Bionic Dues is my favorite Arcen game.			"

												It was fun for awhile however there just wasnt enough variation in the game to TRULY hold my attention. Most of the missions have different goals and objectives in an attempt to add spice and varation to this game but end up falling short unfortanatly; most of the time boiling down to destroy everything and get the loot. Now normally I'd be okay with that however this time around the loot just didnt make me care.Enemies are challenging but without a decent incentive to fight them I cant help but think why should I bother. If your willing to shell out $10 for a few hours of fun get this game by all means. Also I DO have to admit, if they gave me a betterr reason to be exited about the loot, such as new weapons or let us gain new ""exos"". I'd have more of a reason to keep playing and in fact WOULD. But give me a little thing that fills a slot that makes the same weapons 2% better, and I'm just not going to care.			"

												This game feels imperfect. But in that, it has replayability. The gameplay is such that, your Exo (bot) can be 1-hit fairly easy, especially when you are just learning. Not to mention AOE damage can also take you out. So, losing a bot is easy. You can usually still succeed with your other 3, and you don't permanently lose the bot unless you are playing with ""Dead is dead"" enabled... which I think isn't available until you've beaten it once. I found the upgrade system alluring. If the art was more aesthetic I probably would have given it much more of my time.gameplay: 7/10art: 6/10theme: 8/10sound: 8/10			"

												A very positive surprise. In this game you control robots, ""Exos"", destroying enemy robots and collecting loot from the battlefields. The turn-by-turn mechanics are familiar from roguelikes such as NetHack, but the scifi setting reminds me of FTL. Cannot go wrong with that recipe!Between each mission you are returned to the City Screen where you can also go and customize the Exos. This part, too, reminds me of customizing the spaceship in FTL: you need to select the most appropriate weapons and tools to all slots of the Exos and keep in mind the power constraint. In the game you only control one Exo at a time, so no squad-based combat here. You can always swap the current Exo to another one, but that costs one turn, like everything else. The challenge is, of course, how to kill the enemies without getting killed yourself. Going in with your laser blazing usually ends in you getting killed, so you need to be more clever than that. One strategy is to use Stealth, get close to a powerful enemy, infect it with a virus and watch it kill the other enemies.Once your Exo gets killed, it's out for the rest of the mission, so when you've got four Exos in total, you in a sense have four lives in each mission. The Exos have different strengths and weaknesses (just like the ships in FTL are different from each other), so, for example, getting your hacker Exo killed might make it impossible to hack impassable doors behind which loot usually lies.The achievements seem to be something that actually need to be pursued, compared to some games that reward you with five as long as you just complete the tutorial. Finally, I'm also enjoying the game's soundtrack, which also has songs with vocals.			"

												Bionic Dues is one of Arcen's many cross-genere forays into the gaming market, this time coming up with a rather compelling turn based roguelike hybrid. Bionic Dues is what you'd get if you crossed a traditional Roguelike with FTL and then baked in the theme of Mechwarrior. What comes out is a mixture of RPG-like progression and turnbased tactics layered ontop of a strategy meta-game that provides a high level of replayability between campaigns.In Bionic Dues you command a 'team' of four Exos (mechs), each with their own weaponry systems and specializations that can be further customized by acquiring loot from winning missions or finding/hacking chests. The caveat to this 'team' is that you can only pilot one of your Exos at a time, but can switch between them at any time during the missions.Before the game starts you choose up to 4 Exos from a pool of 6 types, and then pick your commander who will provide a unique tactical advantage which will drastically change how you play the game. All of this is wrapped up into an FTL style mission selector which will give you some choice as to how your path through the game progresses, and ultimately help you stave off defeat. Losing a mission or a unit does not necessarily mean the end of the game either as traditional roguelike permadeath is optional, which is what really allows the campaign metagame to shine.Each mission you embark on has its own objectives and unique attributes, your goals range from kill all the enemies to destroy certain targets, to simply just evade and escape in time. In one mission type, all of the cover is rigged to explode when destroyed, knowing this and using it to your advantage to take down enemies you couldnt easily kill otherwise is just one useful strategy to employ against an overwhelming force. There are roughly 20+ different mission varieties as well, and choosing which ones to embark on between re-fitting your Exos is critical to your success.If you try going head to head with the enemy in this game without realizing their weaknesses, or your own strengths, you're almost certain to be in for a rough time. Understanding the quirks of each of the 45+ different enemies, how they move, shoot, and affect other enemy units; all of that is necessary for survival. Once you understand a few of the game's less well-explained quirks, you begin to realize just how much depth there is to the combat. The sheer amount of unique enemies can be a little daunting at first and some combinations can lead to complicated and outright unfair or impossible situations.One example of this is that early on in the game there are enemy bots which will one-shot you with their explosive missile weapons. After a few missions into the game they will probably begin to out-range you too and can kill you in a single shot. Ontop of that they have shields that would deplete a sizeable chunk of your ammo supply to destroy, if you could survive that many turns to kill them. Thankfully they have very little ammunition (unless an ammo bot is nearby) but are not always the best shot. This type of enemy can be dealt with in multiple ways: a long range Exo, a stealth unit thats immune to splash damage (but not direct hits such as the Ninja), one capable of shooting around corners with splash damage, even detonating obstacles or certain enemy bots nearby. Thats not to mention mines, sentries, or simply just stealthing past it.Pros:- Procedurally generated map and mission layouts.- Huge variety of enemies (Changes with each new game)- Wide variety tactics to use, if you're creative enough.- 6 different Exos, 6 commanders, and 6 difficulty levels.- Loot system allows you to customize aspects of your units.- Large number of mission types with different rewards.Cons:- Too many enemies can make missions drag on a little sometimes.- Inconsistent difficulty based on starting choice and random factors.- Randomized enemy deployment can lead to unfair combinations.- Can easily spend too much time on the Exo customization screen.- Level design and aesthetic feels a bit bland and samey after awhile.Conclusion: Arcen has done a good job with Bionic Dues, but its not without a few pitfalls; the sheer variety of enemies, interactions, and range of difficulty levels can lead to inconsistent experiences between games. New players have a lot to learn and will need to pay attention to enemy sensor and weapon ranges as well as learn to use the environment, mission types, and ground-targeting to their advantage. Using sensors to provoke enemies and lure them to you in the right order, and employing the Science Exo's EMP pistol (which does not use up a turn) to disable enemy movement and block hallways can be the difference between success and failure.

There is a save option (which can be turned off), so it is possible to load after a really bad run. Pretty fun for a while, but end game gets repetative.Pros:- Very clear tutorial and tooltips making it easy to learn- Save option- Sci-fi settingCons:- graphics are a bit dull, different units all look too similar- soundtrack can get repetative- Lack of veriety- EndgameFun for a few hours, but don't expect to spend 100s on this one. Recommended.			"

												Didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It's a turnbased strategy game with mechs where you have 50 days to prepare against unevitable doom by completeling randomly generated missions. The concept is awesome which is to be expected from Arcen Games.The main problem I had was that the missions felt kindof like a slog and a bit samey. The combat was also pretty cutthroat. You'll usually kill the enemy in one hit and they can do the same thing to you which sounds interesting but I didn't happen to like it afterwards. In most cases you'll blow through the levels killing everything in your path and if you make one misstep, you can die. This is probably done to make the levels seem challenging but it didn't really end up that way.I'm not sure how I'd change it to make the game more enjoyable for me. I was thinking about making the combat less binary by buffing the health of you and your enemies. Maybe instead of having one mech on the field that you can switch out, you could have a group of mechs on the field. Maybe I would've like a more ""classic"" strategy RPG leveling up system where you unlock skills by leveling up. It's a bit strange really. Arcen Games removed the slow grindy bits of an S-RPG but in hindsight I actually liked those slow grindy bits.			"

												It's a ""Rogue-Lite"" game, in that you can save and reload unless you're playing IronMan, but still comes with randomly generated dungeons and loot. I haven't made it through my first play-through yet, but when I do I imagine this would be a great game to play on IronMan (turning it into a proper roguelike).The game has a *great* soundtrack, and feels like a 1980s anime space opera. There's a *little* bit of a learning curve to begin with (you only control one Exo at a tme, and swapping it takes a turn), but otherwise the tactical combat is engaging and fun.Also a huge A+ to Arcen Games for showing diversity of race, gender, and socio-economic status in their pilots. It's subtle, but disabled characters are the heroes of this game, and that's *really* refreshing to see.			"

												Great little game - had my first final assault today and my tactics worked ( I nearly had no opponents as I could destroy them in some earlier mission ). It might be that the endgame is too easy but I'll have to play again until the end to see that.I really like random equipment and the epic advancement made me grin a lot!I sometimes had more fun equipping my exos than fighting with them.I don't know how good the replayability will be, and if the map changes with each game, but i'll give it a try.

												Was expecting a squad-based tactical mech game (i.e. XCOM with mechs), but this turned out to be more like a turn-based Diablo. Not actually squad-based:  Yes, you go into battle with 4 mechs, but you only control one at a time, and they all move around in the same tile. It's more like having 1 character that you can change the class of on the fly. Uninteresting tactics :  The lack of squad-level coordination limits your ability to really delve into the tactics. I would love to set up ambushes where I get to use multiple units at their optimal range of engagement, or coordinate a simultaneous attack to enter and clear a room, but you just can't do that. The combat started to feel repetitive pretty soon.  Nice variety in enemies and missions, though:  There is a really nice variety in the enemies you face, and their various AI quirks is a cool gameplay element. But because of the limited range of tactics, for the most part it boiled down to triaging who to shoot first and whether they are worth expending your more limited ammo on. Maybe I'm just being uncreative.There is also a variety of missions you can do, and there's a nice nonlinear (yet intuitive) system where each mission will unlock others. It's really very well done, and adds a nice level of strategy to the game. Disappointing mech customization:  The ""customization"" system is just collecting loot with randomly-generated buffs (think magical/rare items in Diablo). You can't change weapons, which I found pretty disappointing. You do gain a few special abilities, though the items mostly just give you bonuses to existing stats.			"

												Don't even kid yourself, Arcen Games are a bunch of weirdos. They try to make conventional games but their weirdness is bolted into everything they do, from the design to the UI to the music and all the other aesthetic items in game development. I'll also say that while I've respected everything they've released (that I've had a chance to play), I'm not always in the mood for dealing with their weirdness. If I'm in the mood for anything besides An Arcen Game, the willpower on my end just isn't even there.It's why I took so long to dig into Bionic Dues after the first impression of thumbing through the first few menu screens and world map. I didn't think ""HEY THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE WANTED, A MYSTERY DUNGEON-HEWED ROGUELIKE ON PC"". Because well that's exactly the situation with Bionic Dues, it takes design cues from Shiren the Wanderer more than anything else in the modern RL trends. Of course, Arcen's quirks break through, with the fixation on cyber-dystopia, an almost-suffocating amount of customization, and lots of ways to get completely lost and off the track of your primary objectives with not a lot to help you get back. I know there was a certain expectation with other reviews/press painting it in relation to an XCOM game, but it's not really that at all. Clear your mind, look at it like the maddest thing Chunsoft could ever hope to put a Mystery Dungeon name on, and it'll be all good.			"

												BIONIC DUES tried too many things at once and that's what ruins the game for me. First of all every information you'll get you need to play the game is in the form of text. I really don't know why game developers don't learn from other games or in this case from thier own games. Arcen(the guys who made the game) really need to learn that if they make a game that is fairly complex, they should make an interactive tutorial not a wall of text.  The mechanic with the map where you are able to select your missions is a great idea but wasn't implemented very well. Sometimes the only missions you are given are the ones you aren't capable of completing because your Mechs are to weak. This gets frustrating really easily. The customization screen is the most disorganized  screen I have ever seen In a video game. There are way to many stats to keep track of and way to many slots the equipment can be put. It is not fun to customize your Mech because the proccess feels like working at an office. And how is the roguelike gameplay? It's actually kinda fun but what ruins it is that the game doesn't really tell you what to do in a mission. Your objective is told you through a text-wall and sometimes you have no idea what they want from you? For example: ""This is a mission where you'll aquire more weapons at the end"". Ok? So what do I have to do? Kill all enemy-robots? Or collect a certain Item? I don't know. Oh and the presentation is horrible ;DBIONIC DUES is not a bad game but it's not a good one either.			"

												Favorite game from Arcen yet. Great indie devs with a positive development philosophy - DRM free, plenty of updates, expansions that don't price-gouge you.Bionic Dues (mostly on harder levels of difficulty) demands that you make good decisions on all strategic/tactical levels from the lowest level of how you are going to clear a room of bots, to the next level of how you are going to conserve ammo in order to complete the mission, to the next level of mission selection balancing short-term and long-term goals. And finally, deciding on how to outfit your Exos to tie all of the above together. Plenty of decisions to make before you can even start the game - make a party of 4 mechs out of a selection of 6 (including duplicates), choose 1 of 6 pilots with very unique traits, and finally a wide range of difficulty settings make for an absurd amount of replayability value.My biggest nitpicks are really those that are fairly intrinsic to the rogue-like genre.1) After the nth play through, some levels can just feel tedious and long and present little original challenge to the player.2) The documenation is slightly lacking. The ingame help and tooltips are great for the basics,  and even the intermediates, but a few advanced topics get unmentioned. The lack of a well developed wiki doesn't help, either. As rogue-like players should already be plenty used to, trial and erroring some things out is to be expected.			"

												Great game for casual and hardcore gamers alike. You can play with the options to make it MUCH MUCH easier or harder. You can abuse the save/load feature before hacking or opening the chest until you get what you want. Or if you want it to be 100% rogue-like, you can disable save/load and turn on permanent death at the same time in the options. By default, this game is turn-based but again there is an option to turn it into RTS in which you have 5 seconds to act per turn, else your opponents get to act with you doing nothing. It is not so bad losing a turn or 2 because you'll be using that time to think (of course it also depends on the situation). Lastly, unlocking all the achievements will take a long while. Great game overall.			"

												What's this?This is Hardcore(well,that depends on difficulty settings)Roguelike about mechs.Tactical gameplay-not much of a random factor in battles here,so you can see an outcome before it even started.But,of course,it wouldn't be a roguelike if there'd be no occasional surprises from time to time.Mostly,utilizing special abilities like stealth,immunity to splash damage,doing splash-damage shoots around the corners,luring the enemies into traps,using narrow spaces to get baddies in line before an ultra kill-shot and many more-is a key to winning here.-there's a little intermission part,where you can choose,which mission to take next-depending on a type(around 10 of them)you have different objective and rewards.-The main objective of the game is to fight off a large robot invasion with only four mechs of yours.You control one at a time,but can transform into any of your squad,using one turn.There are Assault,Siege,Ninja,Scientist,Sniper and Brawler.You can compose your team as you wish,but you can't change your mech types after starting the game.Then you'll have 50 days(50 missions)to power-up your mechs and hinder your enemies' forces(for ex. killing one of the bosses prior to final stage,or decreasing an overall number of enemies in the final battle)-Customisation-before starting the game you can choose a pilot.Each of them has an unique ability-be it discounts in the shop(between missions),using upgrade modules for your mechs more effectively,having an upgraded sensors and so on.mechs itself have a few types of weaponry,reactor,computer,and shield.You can install modules into those to upgrade mechs.Depending on the type,they have different starting specs and number of module-slots in each part.Visuals&sound-simple,but not bad.At least you won't be hurting your eyes looking at the screen.Explosions are quite flashy(and loud!-louder than other sounds,so I advise against turning sound effects too loud especially if you use headphones).Music-well,I liked it,doesn't distract you from the game and blends in well with it.Oh,and the Song playing in the main menu Rocks^^CONCLUSIONHumble game,yet good at what it does.If you like mechs,roguelikes and tactical strategies-you'll enjoy this one a lot.For only two dollars(as it is now)-well worth it,especially if content updates will be released in the future(and if to believe the developers-they will).

tl;dr -> A true rogue-like game - even when you think your robots' loadouts are great, you will soon get facerolled by the enemy. 11/10 if these robots were in I Robot/Terminator we would be screwed.I was excited to try this game out because I love the rogue-like genre. I was not disappointed, and ended up with a very satisfying - but still brutal - experience. If you enjoy the rogue-like genre, robot theme, turn-based combat, and lots of death and loot, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are decent - the robot models and animations are nothing too fancy. The music and sounds are good, but I personally found the opening (menu) song annoying after a few repetitions. The random dialogue that the enemy robots shout out is comical - ex: ""why was I programmed to feel pain?"" Eventually, I just muted all the sounds and played my own music. The controls are simple and quick to learn. There are pop-up tutorials and the feedback when you hover over things is very helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with the rogue-like genre and grid/turn-based games. The difficulty can be adjusted, and you will most likely not be playing misery for a long time - unless you are a glutton for punishment.Gameplay is fast-paced and unforgiving - your goal is to prepare for an inevitable final battle against the robot horde (similar to the end-game boss fight in Faster than Light). You are presented with a randomly-generated map layout with branching missions. Doing a mission (regardless of failing/passing) will unlock the rest of the missions that are connected to that particular branch. Depending on the difficulty you are playing on, you will get x loot pieces per surviving robot member (aka Exo) after the mission is completed. You will also get different loot types depending on the mission you select - for example, laboratory missions will give you more computer modules. Whenever you fail, your HQ will lose a hit point, and if you reach 0, you will lose the game. Completing salvage missions will repair some damage to your HQ.After every mission, more enemy robots are manufactured - you can hinder this by attacking robot command centers, which reduce the number of days before the final battle. You can also hunt down boss robots, making the end-game battle a bit easier. Be warned, these missions are extremely challenging, and should not be attempted until you have acquired mid- to high-tier gear. Your Exos do not level up - instead, you upgrade them with acquired loot. You can select 4 different Exos to make up your party, and you can even select 4 of the same type if you wish (this is not recommended). Examples include a sniper, ninja (stealth-based), and science (hacker/support) Exo. The character you select at the start of the game will give you different bonuses - I strongly suggest you select Tuck for your first few playthroughs because his sensor ability (allows you to see the objective and any loot containers) will increase your situational awareness greatly.During mission gameplay, you move with the WASD keys and use the mouse to select weapons/skills. You travel as a single entity, so switching Exos will use one turn. This is critical to understand because you will automatically switch to the next Exo if your current one is destroyed - and I would die unnecessarily because I would waste a turn switching my science Exo to a different one, giving the enemy a free shot (and usually a free kill) at the Exo I switched to. You can blow up some doors, but others will have to be hacked in order to get to the loot containers within. Terminals also require hacking points, which is why a science Exo is essential to anyone wanting to maximize loot gained per mission. Many missions just require you to reach an endpoint mission marker, which is usually deep in the far end of the map. Each Exo can stealth past enemies for a short amount of movement spaces, but only the ninja Exo is able to attack while still staying in stealth mode. Some loot containers/terminals may restore your ammo, shields, hack points, or stealth points, however, some terminals may disable a random weapon or deplete all hacking points - such is the way of RNG-based games. Overall, the game is a lot of fun if you like challenging grid/turn-based combat, and any rogue-like enthusiasts should give Bionic Dues a try.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												First off the title song to this game is amazing and deserves it's own mention but it's not the only good thing about this game. The creative roguelike atomosphere has just the right ammount of comedy to difficulty. Overall the challenge feels good except for a few combonations of bots that are straight up impossivle to kill together never really felt that a good strategy wouldn't win the day. Definately lots of painful learning in store as you work your way up to the interesting challenges, the scaling could use some tweeking but overal it works well. ~9/10~ And Remember Shopping isn't a optional activity.

												An excellent rogue-like. You may choose your squad of four mechs (called exos) from six specialized models, with specific weapons and capabilities. Then choose your pilot from a roster of several, each with his/her own unique ability. The turn-based gameplay is satisfying, challenging, and the exploratory element can be addictive. Finding new equipment for your exos is always fun, and seeing the difference they make brings great joy as you mercilessly pound those annoying bots. Did I mention the in-game humor is amazing? Some of the comments the enemy bots make are downright gut-busting. Get this game, you'll enjoy it.			"

It is however a little limited in scope and while there's a lot of challenge to be found in grinding for the achievements, once through will probably show you all it has to offer.

												A fun game, but very long - I wish I had known beforehand that ""normal"" meant ""ridiculously easy"", and that Ironman mode etc. were even options (since I played it *as if* in Ironman mode, but missed out on the achievement for it).As it is I'm not likely to play a second time because it's so time-consuming. Also, a bit disappointing that among the many achievements, there wasn't one for ""what final battle?"" - I finished off the bosses at the end of the penultimate day, and the rest of the robots at the end of the final day, so I didn't even have a final battle. (Nice that the game did just recognize it and didn't make me play an empty map or something though.)I like the premise of a turn based strategy where you have 4 units but use them only exchangably rather than in parallel - it makes a level go by much faster than XCom style, without becoming too unfun. It's just that clearing 50 mostly-alike levels (or 30 actually since I accelerated time four times) is only fun *once*.			"

												I'm awful at it, but it is quite fun if you know what you are doing.Bionic dues is a mech roguelike. You pick an operator (With abilities explained by the story!), and go to town on all these robots with a team of 4 of your own. Different terrain has different rules, such as generators, supercharged powerplants, and blockades all using different win, loss, and gimmick conditions. It has plenty of difficulties and modifiers to make every run different. Your goal is to deplete the enemy forces until the final battle which you must win.That's about all i can say, as i suck and cant getpast more than 2 stages ;_;PROS:Chaotic turnbased actionmany different charactersdecent plotplenty of varietyCONS:Not a good explanation on how to play goodI suck so much i can barely win on easy.IGN would probably give this game a 8.5 for ""Unchanging Story"" (seriously, they did that to a similar game!), but from what i've managed to play i'll give this a 9.5.

												A good roguelike for people that like the whole Diablo loot thing, but a bit overwhelming in the numbers and mechanics department compared to most of the genre. It's a game I wish I could get into more, but the presentation and complication are a bit much. I'd definitely recommend it for fans of RLs and number crunching. Also, You get a party, but it's more like 4 modes than 4 members. Also I don't think it ever explains if there's 4 people, or only one dude and 4 remote controlled things, which seems to be the case...or how You get them back after a failure.

												Don't be fooled. This game is incomplete. Plenty of bugs and unfair situations. For example, enemies capable of shooting you through walls, 'cover', and completely random drops. As well, the game does a sort of lazy attempt to explain things to you, or fails to tell you additional helpful things. For example, when completing an armory mission, you MIGHT find loot boxes on the map which will give you mission specific parts. The tutorial neglects to tell you at the end of those types of missions any exo that survived will reward you an editional part. As well, despite pictures and the such that shows having more than one party member (I use the term loosely), you can only have one of those 'mechs' out at a time. You can freely switch from one to another (something I don't think is ever explained at all), but it uses a turn.How things play out when switching isn't exactly clear. What if you are cloaked, turn orders, being within range of an enemy when switching, etc.. it's all a bit unclear, and there is no help function in the game either. At least none that I found. In regards to enemies shooting through walls, I encountered an enemy, a boss enemy to be more specific, that states that it doesn't attack, but will shoot at whoever fires within it's range. Apparently, this goes for players who are undected, several rooms over, cloaked, etc. A modest pool of health, long range, decent attack power, and the ability to shoot you whenever you are within its range, regardless of position.. leads you to being caught in an unfair, uphill battle. Then there are some bugs that I found. Your mouse cursor and buttons sometimes don't line up, glitches that turn all your stats to zero, the ability to use in game saves to your advantage (getting a better item from a loot chest). All in all, the game has potential, but numerous issues leave me quitting the game in frustration or disappointment more than anything else. I would recommend buying this game for no more than $2 if you're still interested.The issues I have had with this game can be fixed with some updating, I'm sure. But right now, I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I'm finding it hard to express why this game is so good. On the one hand it's a fairly shallow story(not that it needs more) and the gameplay doesn't  have a lot of variety to the mechanics. But on the other hand what it does, it does extremely well.First of all: this is a rogue-like, make no mistake about it. Hate roguelike? This won't convert you.Your city has been taken over, no ones coming to help, it's just you, 4 exo suits, and some guy in a van down by the river (he sells you scrap that he salvages).You have 50 days before the robot army finishes off your base. Each day you have time to complete 1 mission, visit the salvage van and upgrade your exo suits. While out on a mission you can teleport (swap between) exo suits, each exo is designed with different weapon layouts and is further tweaked by your customizations each day.Where the game shines is the sheer customizability. Before you even start you choose which 4 exo suits you will use, what pilot you will control (different bonus skills) and a full range of difficulty settings. If you get frustrated failing while learning, I suggest dropping the difficulty below normal (even normal is challenging until you've fully understood all the customization and gameplay choices); and than ramping up with each new play through.There is a lot of ways to challenge yourself and tons of replay value if you want to figure out how to get through the highest difficulty levels. One of the best roguelikes I've played in years, and one of very few that make me want to keep trying again even after winning just to see if I can do better and score even higher.Also of note: the song on the main menu is almost worth the price of the game by itself, just wish there was more of it.

												Best Thing About It:Strategic game, equipment management, and missions all work very well together.  The choices you make in the strategic layer have a big impact on the way the game plays out.  Bionic Dues is a game that succeeeds on the sum of its parts.Worst Thing About It:The art direction.  It is an unattractive game.  The ""dungeon runs"" are hideous, and the remote controlled robots theme  doesn't do much for me.  I would have much rather seen this game themed as a Star Wars style, rebel strike team or even a G.I. Joe style special ops theme.  ************************************************************************************I recommend this game.  You should play in iron man mode and learn to roll with the tough decisions and consequences you face in the strategic portion of the game.  Every turn the enemy is growing stronger, but you have a lot of different ways to attack and weaken the enemy, and ways to strengthen your own forces.  The strategic part of the game is great because every choice and every event has a real and visible effect.The ""rogue like"" missions are also fun, because each game the enemy builds and deploys various robots that behave in very specific ways.  FIguring out how to exploit these robots' weaknesses while avoiding a variety of attacks is fun, and each play you face different mixes of robots--so its like a proceedurally generated combat and stealth puzzle.Each game counts down to a final confrentation, and what the enemy throws at you depends very much on what occured throughout the strategic layer of the campaign.  Enemy forces composition and ""bosses"" are randomly determined each game, so there is a lot of variety.My only complaint is appearance and theme.

I have a simple, more efficient way to stop the robot attacks.Basically, reverse engineer the tecnology used in the Robot Command thingmajigs to make all those pesky bots unoffensive. (Did I even spelled that right?). So then, the main characters would unite to create a mechanism inside the reactor and the main GPU's of the System controlling the bots, so then every single one would explode in the case they try to re-activate. Or, yeah, kill all those mothertruckers and save the damn city. That makes sense.I recommend it, it has some strategy to it. "

												In it's current state this game needs a lot of reworking.  Enemy types are extremely random to the point of having to hover over each one in every single engagement in order to make the correct move, there's really no learning curve to it.  The hacking part of the game which is essentially lockpicking is completely random when it comes to the terminals which are largely negative effects anyway.  It's possible to come across 40+ enemies in a single mission without enough ammo to deal with them and then lose all your hacking points that would unlock additional ammo and shields and you have no control over it.When things go well it's boring and when things go bad there's often nothing you can do about it.  This game lacks the essential quality all roguelikes need which is the right balance of luck and skill opportunities to create chaos yet allow the player to affect the outcome.			"

												Like most offerings from Arcen games, this one looks and sounds hideous but the gameplay is neat and unique. It's much more accessible than AI War or A Valley Without Wind, but retains similar mechanics and crazy random generation. This one is a turn-based puzzle-roguelike. You manage a team of four powersuits, go into varied dungeon-missions and gather upgrades against an approaching robotic army. You have so many different tactics to employ based on your team and equipment, the levels themselves become like puzzles where there is always a solution if you can figure out the best approach. Kind of like Desktop Dungeons. Do you want to set up a trap with mines and sentryguns and then just make noise to attract the enemies into them? Or should you just employ massive rocket launchers to purify full rooms with fire? Missions are quick and bite-sized and the world map has many of them offered at the same time, making this a game of difficult choices.There's a doomsday clock here like in most Arcen creations: You have a limited amount of missions to do before the end battle comes, you're supposed to either become more powerful by then or sabotage the enemy forces enough but the enemies grow in power too while you're on missions. If you just grind for upgrades, so does the enemy. You need to pick your desired missions from the map surgically instead of doing everything, just like in AI War.The graphics and sounds are awful and I mostly ignored the scifi theme and lore, but if you can stomach the ugliness this is quite an interesting twist on roguelikes and a good grab during sales.

												Amazing game. Strategy on the overmap includes original exosuit selection (pick four of six, plus one pilot of six with its own ability). You choose the loadout for each exosuit, and each day mission selection is up to you (to focus on different loot types, or to weaken the eventual enemy assault on your base). Missions vary objectives and have random maps. Enemies get more powerful over time and have their own personalities and attack types. And inside missions the turn-based combat and fragility of life forces you to be careful about everything you do.It's easy to pick up and play, but is not easy to win. Simple elements fit together really well, and it's a cheap game to boot.There's a demo on Arcen's website. Grab it, try some missions out, and then buy the game. It's fun!			"

												Imagine Dawn of War II and Space Hulk becoming a quite silly rogue-like that removes all randomness from the actual combat - yes, maps and enemy selection is random, loot is random, mission selection is random, but pretty much consequence of every action is not random, all shots are on target [unless enemy abilities say otherwise], so, like in rogue-likes, you need to finish every encounter using available resources, yet damage and all effects are constant - so no need to make any offerings to Nuffle or Xom the Unpredictable for success in combat. All results are the consequences of your choices, so you can take it slow and enjoy the ride, blaming only yourself for your failures and not randomness - it only sets the pace of the game, creates unique battlegrounds and situations, but how it all resolves depends only on the player, and not the rolls of the silicon dice.You don't need to imagine that. It's here. It's Bionic Dues. It Kills Time.			"

												Best Thing About It:Strategic game, equipment management, and missions all work very well together.  The choices you make in the strategic layer have a big impact on the way the game plays out.  Bionic Dues is a game that succeeeds on the sum of its parts.Worst Thing About It:The art direction.  It is an unattractive game.  The ""dungeon runs"" are hideous, and the remote controlled robots theme  doesn't do much for me.  I would have much rather seen this game themed as a Star Wars style, rebel strike team or even a G.I. Joe style special ops theme.  ************************************************************************************I recommend this game.  You should play in iron man mode and learn to roll with the tough decisions and consequences you face in the strategic portion of the game.  Every turn the enemy is growing stronger, but you have a lot of different ways to attack and weaken the enemy, and ways to strengthen your own forces.  The strategic part of the game is great because every choice and every event has a real and visible effect.The ""rogue like"" missions are also fun, because each game the enemy builds and deploys various robots that behave in very specific ways.  FIguring out how to exploit these robots' weaknesses while avoiding a variety of attacks is fun, and each play you face different mixes of robots--so its like a proceedurally generated combat and stealth puzzle.Each game counts down to a final confrentation, and what the enemy throws at you depends very much on what occured throughout the strategic layer of the campaign.

												There's a lot to like in this nifty little sci-fi roguelike. The enemies are amusing, the mechanics are solid. There are multiple ways to surmout the challenges the game poses to you, and as with any good Roguelite, they're all fun to explore. Trying to find the best ways to trick out your squad of 4 mechs is downright fascinating, and ranks as maybe the only game mechanic to ever turn me into a min-maxer. It won't be anyone's favorite roguelite, but if you're into the genre and looking for something new to pick up it might intrigue you.However, Bionic Dues is marred by a couple notable flaws. First, as others have noted, is the balance. My first run of Bionic Dues, I lost after getting maybe 1/5th of the way through. Perfectly par for the course on a roguelike, I thought. I have some idea what I'm doing, so I'll put some thought into my play next time and see how far I get.The second time, I wrecked the world. Once I became competent, there wasn't a single level that could challenge me--and I didn't have the patience to grind through 20 hours of easy gameplay. Honestly, the campaign could stand to be shorter than it is.Be warned; if you're experienced with Roguelikes, you'll want to turn it up to Hard mode pretty quickly.The other big gripe for me is the music. The music isn't bad, per se; some reviewers really like it. I thought it was pretty good too the first 50 times or so. But since there's only a few tracks, you'll be hearing these songs a *lot*.			"

												Hard. Very hard, needs prior thinking, rushing'll get you killed. It's a strategy game, not really a shooter, but man, it's fantastic. I hadn't heard of it before I got it free from Humble Bundle, but I would happily pay £7 for it, plenty of replayability. Graphics are done in a 2005 way, they're not fantastic but they're sweet and they compliment the game very well. The writing is funny in a dark, cynical way and whilst it's not laugh out loud it certainly makes you smile. Overall, it's really well done and I certainly recommend it.			"

												Bionic Dues is a phenomenal game worth whatever price you can get it for.Essentially, all of humanity except for you and your group of survivors have been killed by a robot army. In about a month, they will attack your home base and destroy you all. You are the last remaining pilot for the Exosuit, which is the only thing that can stand between you and the robot army, and your job is to run missions to find upgrades for your suit and to sabotage the robots themselves.The gameplay takes place on a grid and is semi-turn based. Every time you move, attack, etcetera, your turn is used up and the enemy may do something. But it runs so fluidly it almost feels real time. Your objective is different depending on what mission you choose, and that's the fun part.There is no possible way to do all missions presented in a single game, not to mention the fact that what is available is randomly generated when you start. The fun comes in choosing what missions to do; do you take on the assasination mission and kill one of the bosses early? Do you go to a weapons factory to get shiny new weapon parts for your suits? Maybe you lost a mission and your HQ is low on health, so you need to do a mission to repair it? You only have so much time so you have to choose wisely.On top of all this, there are several difficulty levels and several pilots who completely change the way the game played. With the pilot I used, it's sort of cheating because you start off with the enhanced suits (whereas normally you need to find them yourself). The other pilots have other passives that make sure no two playthroughs are similar. And of course, you have several different suits as well, but you can only choose four at the start of the game; I used the Science, Ninja, Assault, and Siege (I believe those are the names) but again, it's up to you. Actually there are achievements for completing the game with four of a single suit type, so you could try that. Honestly it's real endless the ways you could play the game. I only played through once, but it took me 10 hours. I can't wait until I have the time to go through it again. If you like how it sounds, then buy it without hesitation.			"

												This looked like a fairly old school style of  2D turn based mech combat game in a simple table top arcade style, but with some decent refinements.  I got this in a bundle deal, so yeah, it cost me about nothing.  I wasn't especially interested in this title, but gave it a try, and hey it has cards ;)The first time or two that I tried it out I didn't find it very engaging.  The menus could be better, and the learning curve is rough at first.  The graphics are not expected to be fancy in this sort of game and they aren't, but they aren't bad and in an arcade time killer like this it's the gameplay that counts, and it has excellent depth, challenge and  balance once you begin to get attuned to it.  The music isn't bad, and the theme is pretty catchy in a Japanese arcade kind of way.You choose missions from a map, and prep for each mission by choosing a pilot and 4 (out of 6) of your exo-suits, which you customize before each mission.  In missions you can switch between suits at any time at the cost of one turn, and the mission fails if you manage to wreck all of your suits.  Customizing the exo's is fun as you find loot and upgrades along the way, and can spend loot at the upgrade store which also gets in new items of course.You definitely can't just plow your way through this one.  There are plenty of firefights, but it's more like a chess game at times.  You might find health or ammo during a mission, but it's rare, so you're forced to choose which of your suits could best use it to get the particular mission done.Not gonna be anyone's main game, but like I said;  pretty fun, challenging, cheap, time killer, trading cards and shades of Jpop.

												Bionic Dues is a mixed but mostly positive experience. The tactical elements are enjoyable and combined with the great enemy variety, missions themselves are fun and challenging to pull off. Challenge seems fair, and relies mostly on your own capabilities. It is then such a shame virtually everything else is not nearly as well done with the game having an incredibly bad first impression with the bland visuals and painful sound assets. Bionic Dues sadly feels like a confused game, not knowing whether it wants to go for being incredibly cheesy and silly or rather dark and atmospheric. Bionic Dues is certainly a recommendation for those looking for an interesting tactical, turn based experience, but it does require you to accept the bland look of it all. If you are looking for a tough but fair, quick and tactical game then Bionic Dues may very well be one to look out for.Full review:

On the harder difficulties it is a constant struggle to balance destroying the robot army vs. missions that give you specific upgrades. All in all its a great game and at $10 its a great value.

												Nethack meets Xcom, but with added awesome music.  Seriously - one of the best game soundtracks of all time, from the anime-inspired theme tune to the ingame battle music.  Insane amounts of customisation available for your mechs - possibly to the point of too much, so that you can spend almost as much time maxing your stats as you power up than you do blasting evil robot bad guys.  On the other hand, if you like that sort of thing...Having said that, half the fun comes from balancing your damage / shields / power / stealth / etc etc etc to meet the ever increasing threat as you approach the rapidly looming end battle.Picked up via bundle, I almost feel guilty for not paying full price for the huge amount of entertainment already provided, and the multiple replays I can see in my future.If only I could get that soung out of my head.

												*WARNING*IF YOU USE AVAST ANTI-VIRUS BE PREPARED FOR A LOT OF FRUSTRATION STARTING THE GAME!This game runs off the Unity engine, which Avast doesn't like too much.There are a couple of work arounds, but until you figure them out the game will continually CTD upon start up with an error that says ""Fatal error in CG!"".That being said, this game is flipping awesome.Great little TB Dungeon crawler.The missions are laid out on the map randomly, and you have to beat the ones closest to your base to unlock the missions further out.After 50 missions your base gets zerg-rushed by an entire army of killer robots.Based on the missions you choose to complete before the impending robocalypse, you can upgrade the crap out of you own robots with a (seemingly) endless supply of randomly generated parts and mods (the combination of stats and bonuses are created at random fo each upgrade part/mod), WEAKEN the robot army that will eventually come knocking down your door, or even carry out assassination attempts on the army's leaders.Plus there's robots. Lots and lots of ROBOTS!And they KILL! and they go BOOM!Sometimes in large chain reactions of LOTS OF BOOMS!So yeah.Great game.Pros:+Good game for a decent price.+Lots of customization options.+Randomly generated maps, levels, and loot help lead to a high level of replayability.+Decent music and sfx. (The song played at the main menu sounds like it could've been used as the theme for one of those epic war based Mecha animes like the Macross Saga or Mobile Suit Gundam. lol)+Fairly decent graphics for the genre.+Easy enougfh to learn how everything works. (Pick up and play)+Missions are generally short and easily completeable, so it might be fun to goof around with during your break at work.Cons:-Difficult to run on machines with Avast Anti-virus due to Avast calling false positives with the Unity engine.-Multi-player can lead to fighting/frustration with your friends since everyone playing shares the same 1 single action per turn. (If you move this turn, your friends can't).-After a while you'll probably get bored with all the one-liners enemy robots spout when they are destroyed.-Over time it might possibly start to seem a little repetitive as it basically boils down to upgrade, pick mission, blow stuff up, rinse, & repeat, ad infinitum.

												I picked this game up a few days ago during the sale for $2. After playing roughly 18 hours or so I would say it would have been worth $20, in my opinion. It's a fantastic game with incredible amounts of customization (equipment mods for your Exos, pilot choices that influence your strategic playstyle and difficulty mods beyond just 'causal, normal, hard' etc.) and strategy. I really enjoy the music as well, which I find usually tends to be a little sub-par in cheaper games. If you like turn-based strategy games and enjoy rogue-like aspects like randomly generated maps, perma-death (an option under the difficulty mods) and no saving without quitting (also under difficulty mods) then I recommend giving this game a chance. There is a bit of a learning curve when you first start, but if you pay attention to enemy/weapon flavor text and things of that nature it isn't too hard to get things figured out.			"

Surprising strategic and tactical depth as far as how you manage your resources between and during missions.I wouldn't go quite so far as to call it a must-have for fans of turn-based strategy/tactics, roguelikes, etc., but it's definitely something that you should at least consider.

												Ok, while this was a rocky road to start, don't be fooled.  When I first picked this game up, it was confusing, and rather intimidating.  The tutorial, while helpful, was not as informative as it probably could have been.  Adjusting the difficulty of the game, you will find a wash of text information that not only doesn't make any sense, but really won't make sense till you actually get into the game, so I just recommend starting on normal so you can experience some challenge, and some life lessons that the easier difficulties will probably not provide.  Unfortunately, alot of the mechanics of the game are hidden, much the same as many Rogue-likes in the genre.Bionic Dues places humanity (in a city) on the brink of extinction.  You are the last suriving folks in a quarentined city.  You are also made fully aware in the first minute of the game, that the government is going to glass the city (bomb it to crap) to kill the out of control infected robot invasion menace (you included).  You are placed in an overworld map, and a variety of missions will spawn around you.  This layout changes with every game, so don't expect to plan your routes.You will find when you first start the game, that there are alot of mysteries as to why the game is so damn difficult.  But after you start to figure out the mechanics of the game you will make more and more progress.  The issue is, that with every mission you take on, fail or succeed, the monsters of the game level up and grow in number.  This can be frustrating, but stick with it, it gets ALOT better.Every monster in the game has a unique personality, that when properly exploited, will spell the only real way to succeed in the harder difficulties.  A mission can still be finished with lack luster gear, if the proper enemies are present, and properly manipulated.  Granted, equipment, the proper enemy spawns, and level layout, are random, so no gaurantee that the moons will align.  Be sure to save often, it is a total lifeline.Unfortunately for my gameplay experience, when I figured out how the game worked, the normal difficulty was a simple steam rolling session of success after success after success, minus a few situations that totally screwed me. The early portion of the game is most certainly difficult.  The slightest mistake can end with one if not two of your Exo's being destroyed instantly.  But later on, your Exo's can take so much damage, that it they are comparable to some of the boss monsters in the game.  Don't get me wrong, even when you get that powerful, things can still happen that can shaft you, at least that remains consistent.Bottom line though, this game will easily give you hours of entertainment.  The game is incredibly fun, surprisingly deep, and should give quite the lengthy playtime if you like challenging yourself with the levels of diffiuclty (misery being the real way to play the game)  I do recommend this.  Its got a little strategy, its got alot of random chance, and given the mechanics, it can either be easy, or challenging based on your preferences.  Definitely worth the investment of time and money.			"

												I've had a lot of experience with Roguelikes, and Bionic Dues is my latest foray into the genre, as well as in the genre-busting library of Arcen Games. And I have to be honest, this is probably the best game that Arcen has ever made.The gameplay alternates between moving around on a grid like a typical Roguelike, destroying whatever is necessary to complete the objective, and taking all the loot back to base to customise your squad of four mechas. In most games, I've rarely cared about the equipment and customization aspects of these kind of games, but the simple, bite-sized nature of this game's structure means I care about the equipment management aspect a lot more, and whenever I go into a mission with a new set of equipment, I really feel the change in power paying off. That's what an equipment system SHOULD feel like.On top of this, the game has an excellent sense of humour, not just in the item descriptions (Which is another reason why the micromanagement is so fun), but also in the defeat quotes of the enemy mechas. I won't spoil any of them here, but their brevity and variety means they never get old or stop being funny.Bionic Dues is a fantastic game. It provides an interesting shortened Roguelike approach towards its gameplay, and, as is the case with Arcen's usual mission statement, provides a presentation with a lot of personality and humour. Definitely worth picking up!			"

												Surprisingly good turn based strategy game with randomly generated missions and maps with randomized loot system. Difficulty  is pretty demanding aswell. If you are into TBS games and like mechs (who doesn't?) Bionic Dues is worth a try, especially when its on sale.			"

												Wow, this really took me by suprisre. I read the reviews of others, I mean, that's what I bought it but I did not expect such a well made and balanced roguelike. Usually they suffer from way too much randomnenss to allow for consistent use of stratey and tactics but not in this case. Really well made and quite challenging to boot. Highly recommended.			"

												In this turn based strategy game Robots are building an army to destroy the world and it's up to you to complete levels to reduce the number of enemy robots in the final battle. To help you do this you control up to 4 robots however, you only ever have 1 robot in play at any one time. You can pick from 6 robots which all have their own unique strengths and features. As you progress through the levels you find loot to upgrade your robots. The loot factor of this game is great, there are lots of different upgrades to customize your robots with.You start on a cobweb looking world map where only the closest levels to you are accessible. You need to play these levels to reach further levels. There are different types of levels to play which give different rewards and advantages. The game play within a level consists of moving around a map full of hostile robots which will start to attack you when you are within their range. You need to take them out first and achieve the objective of the level. Once you have completed 30 or so levels the final battle takes place. This is pretty much the same game play as the individual levels but on a larger map and depending on how well you have done so far will determine then number of robots you face and how powerful your robots are.I found no bugs while playing this game and all the achievements are working and obtainable. The achievements are actually well thought out and add a lot of replayability to the game. Thank you for reading and I hope this review was of some help.			"

												A fun turn-based game with an interesting soundtrack and subtle tongue-in-cheek humor. Command 4 ""Exos"", choosing from 6 different classes, and defend your city from the robot invasion. Clear levels on the map to weaken the robot forces while searching for loot to gear up your own before the final battle. Neither the graphics nor sound effects are particularly good, but who plays strategy games for those reasons? Patience and strategy are vital in this game, which offers various levels of difficulty. Bionic Dues has a tendency to draw you in like Civilization V, though it may take some time to get used to. This game is not for everyone; watch some footage of gameplay first before deciding whether or not to buy it.			"

												Bionic Dues, a turn-based mecha rogue-lite, should be an instant purchase for any person who may enjoy:- Min/maxing stats.- Lootfests!  Tons of parts to compare, with great interactions and specializations. - MECHS!  The mecha are interesting, and there are several types, all with their own specialties and uses.- Dynamic gameplay.  The missions you choose to do, and your failures or successes, have a limited impact on your final battle.  These choices become more and more important as game difficulty increases.Textures and music aren't the best, and are repetitive.  Minimal story, which is really more of an introduction to the gameplay than an actual tale to be told.  The enemy dialogue is interesting and a bit funny, but it repeats.  The creativity in this one comes from the combination of enemies and goals thrown at you, mixed with what mechs are available and what gear you can find to kit them out.  Overall, Bionic Dues is a very sound purchase for any person who likes to sit down and focus on creative ways to blow things up without arbitrary time limits and/or people shouting at you over a mic.  The kind of single-player game you load up when you are sick of all your gaming friends, and just want to focus on playing a game.			"

												The gameplay is tough. Simple, but tough. Lots of luck to rely on the random loots/hacking things and hopes all your ammo doesn't just randomly get depleted (caught me by surprise when I am hacking terminals, I thought it would be a rewarding action).Plays like a dungeon crawler with four hotswap mechs with different abilities that are all customizable/upgradable, etc (trying to not repeat other reviews too much).I didn't put much time into it YET, but I know this is going to be a fun and time consuming game. I already feel the impending pressure of the end game (as the hint menu pops up in the beginning to explain to you what you are up against). Prepare to die, a lot. Save feature may save you from too much frustration and allow ""trial and error"" gameplay. It reminds me a bit of FTL (which I love dearly). I'd say nab it on sale if you can. I may doing this too early, but if I could peg it my own metasore, it would be a bit closer to 80.			"

												A turn-based strategy game that goes straight to the point, but probably too much: you choose a mission, you fight, you loot, rince & repeat.There is no plot, no story, no character, nothing. And games end with some kind of ""you win"" message. Bionic Dues is a game mechanic, properly executed, but not much more.Despite these flaws, many players might still find this game attractive, except than:- loots are boring: they seem to follow the same rarity system than in well-known hack&slashes, except that there is little difference between a rare or an unique item. Uniques aren't uniques, and there is little to no variety in items- stats customization is dull- enemy bots are uninteresting- there is no variety in missions: same tilesets, same bots, only the goal slightly differ from mission to missionMy note: boring/10 "

												I don't know what to say about this game. I can't reccomend this highly, but I won't say I won't reccomend it.To simplify what it is, it's a rougelike turn based mech game. Permadeath is optional.And...I honestly expected more than that. The biggest highlight of the game is the main theme. It's VERY good.


YouTube™ Video: Bionic Dues - Title Theme Music 

			Views: 36,925		

			A masterpiece from the game Bionic Deus by Arcen Games. Composed by Pablo Vega. ""The night is drawing closely, the shadows dark and ghostly, As sunlight dies, you hear the city's howling cries.		

Take a listen while you read this, if you want.If you do/are listening to it, let it sink in for a moment.It's pretty cool, isn't it? It has a pretty serious tone while just being a generally badass way to open up the main menu to the game.I actually got overhyped when listening to this. Now, granted, I did get a free key from one of PC Gamer's key giveaways, but..I'll still judge the game as if I bought it.But...I think it's because my expectations sky rocketed, that I didn't find the game as AMAZING as I did find the theme.It's pretty fun, though. You have (Up to four) mecha suits that you start off with, and use their diverse abilities to destory robots. The robots are taking over the earth, and they've reached your part of the city. When you start the game, you'll be told you have 50 days until your hometown is NUKED.Yikes. Time to kick some♥♥♥♥♥You're able to pick four mech suits out of six available, and I only found one being...pretty damn useless. Every other mech suit is rather fun and has a decent difference from the others. One thing to note, is that when you find parts to upgrade yourself with, you'll find that the suits don't ever get to change weapons. The weapons are pretty much bolted and weld into the suit. You'll find modifications that'll allow you to make them stronger.Science: This suit isn't reliable for combat. It has 50% bonuses to ALL Computer stats. Perfect for hacking and inflicting viruses on foes. This one is the one that'll be in any group of four you will make, because of how damn useful the Hacks are.Brawler: This suit's a weird one. I thought it would consist of short range weaponry that'd pratically all one hit kill. But, no, it's armed with a X cross bomb, a shotgun, and a pistol. The pistol's a waste (3 turn cooldown, but it doesn't count against your turn. It's..unbeliveably weak. You actually need to focus on building it up to...one shotting the lowest leveled foes. It's pointless unless you JUST need to shave off a few remaining points of health, so you don't waste your other weapon's ammo.) It's still a blast to use, though. You can make some pretty neat trickshots with this one.Sniper: Style. Obliteration. A flippin' life saver. It holds one of the most powerful sniper weapons in the game FROM THE VERY START. Whenever this special sniper rifle's ammo count is an even number when you fire it, it's a free turn for you. Holy.♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's got the 2nd lowest ammo out of the Non Epic weapons, but it's just so damn satisfying to use. It also has an ungoddly amount of range. Safe to say, this suit is just so awesome. It's fragile as hell, but you would probably know how to use a sniper, don't you?Ninja: I'll be honest. This is the suit I have a problem with. But, to be honest, it's not BAD. It's got a bonus to all Propulsion stats (Which, by the way, includes the ability to dodge traps and your stealth turn counter) and it's stealth doesn't break when you fire your weapons. Pretty neat, but...Unless you have the Epic Ninja (I'll explain in a moment.) don't expect to do very much unless you focus on giving the Ninja as much stealth as possible. Stealth, in this game, is pretty nice. Every single suit has stealth, and can upgrade the amount it has. The Ninja's just perfect for this stat. If you activate Stealth, each turn you spend moving around will cause the counter to go down by one. The stealth break if you fire a weapon, drop a sentry, use mines..but not actions like hacking a door.Assault: A good all around suit. Even has 60% bonus to health. It comes with a grenade launcher, a machine gun, and a laser. Nothing else really special about this suit, except that it doesn't have the weak as ♥♥♥♥ pistol.Seige: Rocket. Launcher. Enuff said. But, alright. Seriously, THIS ROCKET LAUNCHER. It has the least amount of ammo for non Epic weapons, but, holy crap. This thing can wipe out an entire room and IT'S HUGE AOE. I can't stress enough that this thing is by far the STRONGEST ROCKET LAUNCHER in a game I've ever seen.On top of having six different Suits to use, with four to pick at any start of a new game, you also have six different suit commanders to pick from. Now, these people are VERY unique in having different ""powers"" (one of them quite litterally) and the one you pick can have a heavy impact on the game.Axis: The ""Scout"" of the commanders you can choose from. Here's a picture for the example of someone without Axis's ability.

Now, here's Axis's ability. 


Bionic Dues Review Axis Range screenshot

By: Odyessy




This is Axis's power. Allowing you to not only see farther on the map, but you can BYPASS a mission to get to another that's connected to it. If you're picky on missions, or want to open up the map without wasting your days, Axis can be worth it.Emma: Emma's power is all about the store. Not only will you get much more money for selling items to it, the store's contents are usually better than if you played someone else. This is someone's inventory, that isn't Emma.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535298959Now this is the inventory of Emma, with the price power she has.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535299195So, in a nutshell, a extreme shopper.Meg: All item you pick up are basically better than they should be. The game explains this pretty well. A ""mark four"" item would have the stats of a ""mark six"" item, and so on.Rey: Oh, boy. This guy's outta control. He has the power over time, but only in the way of being able to restore a suit's health all the way back to 100% twice each mission. And, no, this isn't a per exo thing. You have two lives that save you from your first two deaths. After that, the ability wont work until the next mission.Tuck: Eh. He's able to see loot everywhere on the map. Not really the best ability.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535300067Genji: Can I just say how badass this commander is? He's so ♥♥♥♥ing badass, that he starts off the game with ALL HIS SUITS BEING OF ""EPIC"" VERSIONS.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535291917 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=535291927 Epic suits have more guns than Duke Nukem up their robotic asses and have more spaces for modding capability. Holy ♥♥♥♥.These suits have some pretty OP weapons. Even using the ""Random Exo"" option, you can't get Epic suits at the start if you don't use Genji. To get them in the game without his badass help, is to find a rare Bahamahut Device mission on the map.I can only reccomend this game on the Casual setting. The higher (yes, even easy) take fun away from the game the higher the difficulty you pick.The game gets unbelievably harder for each difficulty you jump up. If you do pick any of those settings, the game changes to every mission being a chance of life or death, but the odds against you increase almost litterally tenfold for every difficulty you jump up on.On top of all of that, the game..feels a little incomplete. I'm not sure what's yanking my leg about this, but it feels half finished. Like I'm playing a demo.There's ""Score"" to this game, but it honestly does nothing other than for high scores.The game itself isn't as serious as it's main theme. It jokingly laughs at itself. It's a completely different tone than what I wished for.In short, the game isn't complex. If you want a mindless shooting time, pick this up.			"

												Full disclosure: I received this game for free.This is a turn based roguelike featuring giant mechas, it has a topdown perspective and you assemble a party of 4 from 6 different Mecha classes.Good: -Lots of tactical options.    You get a good selection of options for how you want to engage your enemies. Reprogram them to fight for you, stealth into melee range, AoE groups, deploy turrets and mines, or good ol fashion guns.-Different commanders for different playstyles  At the beginning of the game you get to choose from 6 different commanders effectively the you in this game. Each one has a special bonus that is different enough that it will change the way you approach the game. Rather than just being a bonus to say shields or damage.Bad:Impact: The game suffers a complete lack of feedback when damage is concerned. Often time the game will have your current mecha take too much damage and instead of giving you any sort of feedback it's been destroyed the next turn starts and your next mecha is swapped in automatically.Scaling:The game has a terrible sense of scale. Your basic weapons take several hits to destroy an enemy unless you're using your best weapon. Meanwhile enemies frequently destroy your exo in 2 hits easily. This pairs with the problems of impact I listed above.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI:The AI literally has defects in this game. Which makes each enemy type follow a specific behavior. This is a fine idea on itself because it gives the player something to exploit, however it's so terribly implemented by having the robots constantly shout things about ""Where'd you go?"" ""No no no, not that way"". When they do kill you (And they will) you feel like your death is at the hand of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also making an enemy that can shoot at any direction in it's large range with OHKO missles and no indication of where it may target is♥♥♥♥♥♥game design.So yeah long story short is the only way I've found to get through this game is by taking AoE and Snipers and just out ranging everything in this game. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it's tedious.The game has some interesting idead but they're put together so haphazardly and the game suffers from good feedback and poor balance.2/10.			"

												This is an FTL like game, where each node leads to a different kind of missing, which always includes a map full of enemy robots of growing power.If you are fond of rogue-like games, you'll be happy, as there is loot and some astute things to exploit the sometime weird behavior (intentionally, that is even ins the description) of your opponents.I'm not in rogue-like, I feel it repetitive, and the different attacks style of your robots does not make it a lot funnier. There is good ideas, and the fact I did not like it does not make it a bad game. I was looking for a tactical turn-based robot combat game, and this is a dungeon crawler. "

												Full disclosure: I received this game for free.This is a turn based roguelike featuring giant mechas, it has a topdown perspective and you assemble a party of 4 from 6 different Mecha classes.Good: -Lots of tactical options.    You get a good selection of options for how you want to engage your enemies. Reprogram them to fight for you, stealth into melee range, AoE groups, deploy turrets and mines, or good ol fashion guns.-Different commanders for different playstyles  At the beginning of the game you get to choose from 6 different commanders effectively the you in this game. Each one has a special bonus that is different enough that it will change the way you approach the game. Rather than just being a bonus to say shields or damage.Bad:Impact: The game suffers a complete lack of feedback when damage is concerned. Often time the game will have your current mecha take too much damage and instead of giving you any sort of feedback it's been destroyed the next turn starts and your next mecha is swapped in automatically.Scaling:The game has a terrible sense of scale. Your basic weapons take several hits to destroy an enemy unless you're using your best weapon. Meanwhile enemies frequently destroy your exo in 2 hits easily. This pairs with the problems of impact I listed above.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI:The AI literally has defects in this game. Which makes each enemy type follow a specific behavior. This is a fine idea on itself because it gives the player something to exploit, however it's so terribly implemented by having the robots constantly shout things about ""Where'd you go?"" ""No no no, not that way"". When they do kill you (And they will) you feel like your death is at the hand of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also making an enemy that can shoot at any direction in it's large range with OHKO missles and no indication of where it may target is♥♥♥♥♥♥game design.So yeah long story short is the only way I've found to get through this game is by taking AoE and Snipers and just out ranging everything in this game. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it's tedious.The game has some interesting idead but they're put together so haphazardly and the game suffers from good feedback and poor balance.2/10.			"

												If you take out all of the human precision and care that goes into crafting a well-balanced tactical game and replace it all with procedurally generated hocus-pocus, you have Bionic Dues, a shining example of how NOT to do a game like this.For the sake of this review, I'm going to pretend that there aren't people on Steam who will try to act tough and say that beating a game that generates everything completely at random is based on some sort of ""skill"" or ""good judgment"". There's the power of decision making, and then there's just plain ol' being outmatched by a robot that leveled up several times more than your randomly-generated loot chest equipment can possibly hope to combat.No, there's good decision making, and then there's numbers. Tactical games have always been about numbers. They have always been about well-crafted maps with careful enemy placement as much as they have been about intelligent team setup supported by guaranteed available items in shops (because the game knows you will need them). Bionic Dues does none of this. Bionic Dues generates all of the maps and the enemies that are placed into them with a computer algorithm. It generates which combinations of enemies will be in a map with a computer algorithm. It generates what level those enemies will be with a computer algorithm. Need to outfit your team in order to survive? Too bad. Bionic Dues also generates the items available in the shop with a computer algorithm. Basically, EVERYTHING is generated almost entirely at random. And as much as I'd like to believe that the computer procedures used in the generation of everything in this game are as intelligent and discerning as a human being... they're not.If you like to sit at a table and roll dice over and over again until you get a certain number, this game might be for you. Yeah, sure, delude yourself into thinking that there is some kind of decision you can make that will mystically cause your severely under-equipped robot to beat a hulking level 7 DoomBot - it seems to be what ""roguelike"" fans tend to do so they can convince themselves that everything they accomplished in a playthrough was totally the product of their skill. Is this game possible? Sure. I'm just so not afraid to say it straight: this game is absurdly random. It is a total crapshoot what items I will get, meaning it's a total crapshoot how powerful I will be, and it's a total crapshoot how the enemies will level up, meaning it's a total crapshoot whether or not I will beat them. The game is a total crapshoot. But like I said, some people like sitting at a table rolling dice over and over again until they get a certain number. Some people like crap(s).P.S. Please, really don't try to say that this review is because I can't handle the game. I've beaten the game 3 times on Expert and destroyed 100 enemies in a single shot. That is so not the issue. Only somebody extremely near-sighted bases their opinions on whether or not they can beat a game. This game is not good. It is an awful representation of tactical games. The tactical game genre should be ashamed of this game, it's giving the genre a bad name.			"

												Plot is rather silly, OMG our mech bays were bombed while your squad was out training, it's up to your squad to save the city from the bots!You can only take one action a turn, fire a weapon on selected exo, switch exo, move. You can have four exos, but they all move together and only the selected one fights. If I knew about this I wouldn't get the game.The gameplay is quite dull, your weapons deal fixed amounts of damage according to their attack power against enemy shields(hp), destroying enemy bots by reducing their shields to 0. So you are just gunning down enemies as they close on you.			"

												In it's current state this game needs a lot of reworking. Enemy types are extremely random to the point of having to hover over each one in every single engagement in order to make the correct move, there's really no learning curve to it. The hacking part of the game which is essentially lockpicking is completely random when it comes to the terminals which are largely negative effects anyway. It's possible to come across 40+ enemies in a single mission without enough ammo to deal with them and then lose all your hacking points that would unlock additional ammo and shields and you have no control over it.

												Hmm... where to begin.First up, this is an Arcen Games title. The guys who took a dump on KB/M users with AVWW 2, and insulted them after they finally gave in and provided ""real"" mouse support for it.Now that that PSA is out of the way:The game is a little bit like AI War in a single city. Interesting for a while, but it gets repetitive and grindy in all the wrong ways. You'll spend far more time hunting for the ""right"" upgrades and managing your inventory than engaging in missions. Short ranged units are at a horrendous disadvantage, given that many rooms are loaded to the brim with enemies with medium to high range weaponry, and the investment needed to make their weapons viable is extreme. A Sniper unit will outperform an Assassin unit 100% of the time. And the game likes to set an Assassin in the default party loadout, and the fact that it also sets two heavy AOE units in the default loadout should be a key warning sign.Of course, the RNG Gods play a key role in this game, and like the RNG Gods everywhere, they are fickle, arbitrary and hate you.The lack of real campaign customization is another drawback, but that is a common issue for Arcen games. Sometimes, it's good to have a real short burst game, and other times, a longer campaign would be more interesting. Sometimes you want to give yourself a moderate challenge in ways that the few selectable ""challenges"" do not provide. Let's move on to other parts:The audio tracks are taken from AVWW 1. This does not surprise me for some reason, although I must say I'm disappointed, especially since the audio doesn't add to the experience.Graphics: It's a tiled game. No surprises, no real expectations, although background (or environmental) images would be nice.All around, I'm just not able to recommend this game. It's just missing far too many little things, and Arcen has done better in the past.			"

												I read about the insane difficulty level, and the hard-to-see icons on the battlefield, and the lack of a tutorial, and the lack of informative tooltips, but I thought, ""That is all just QQ. Seriously, it can't be that bad. Besides, I LIKE roguelites! I will be okay, and if I can only get in 5 or 6 missions before I have to restart, that's okay. At least I will have had fun for 5 or 6 missions.No. Just no. First mission, I did okay on. I have yet to beat a second mission. The battlefield is cluttered and hard to read, the enemies' power ramps up so fast that you will get whiplash just watching them, and the junk you pick up, A.)is not worth equipping, and B.)even the store won't pay you for it so that you can get better junk.The tooltips are not nearly deep enough. For example, my assault mech is decent at anything shield-related. Cool! That means it is high health, has regen, and I forget what the third shield-related stat is. Problem: The assault mech DOES NOT HAVE REGEN. What's more, its health is so low that it can barely make it through a single mission, and it is the best mech for shooting wars! (Oh, and everything is a shooting war, so good luck.)I have heard much about the ""strategy"" in this game: don't believe it. Strategy consists of hiding around the corner and trying to snipe the enemy mechs before they one-shot you.As an example of the difficulty level in the game, I just quit a campaign in which I faced ninjas that reduced my line of sight, batbots which can one-shot me if they get close enough (which is still further than the range of my primary weapon, and tigerbots that have 2000 HEALTH! (My weapons do ~300 damage.) Believe it or not, I can actually handle everything I just mentioned, but then I run out of ammunition, and can do nothing but lay down and die.Don't bother with this game. The difficulty ramps up way too fast, the screen is cluttered, and you will have a hard time beating the second mission. Out of 50 missions.			"

												One of the better rogue likes, with the difficulty one should expect.The bots feel unique, and by changing your load out you can force yourself to change th way you think.The enemy bots are varied enough that it doesn't become simply a game of shooting and moving, but actual prioritizing and using the varios skills (viruses, stealth, turrets, etc) in order to properly defeat some of the tougher bots.Unforgiving of mistakes, but isn't that how a rogue like should be?For those looking for an easier but enjoyable experience, you can find that too, the game does allow for saving, and ironman is only an option, not a requirement.   There are several difficulty modes, so you can learn the game before ramping it up.All in all, one of my better purchases.			"

												i didn't think i would like this game as much as i do but after giving it 20 minutes to get a handle on how to play, i'm in love. it's scratching my roguelike itch when a lot of other games just fall short for me. can't reccomend it enough if you like perma death and thoughtful ""dungeon"" crawling.

												Quite a fun game. The only real issue I have is almost having too much loot, I feel like i spend just as much time setting up my mechs as playing the game. I suppose that's also part of the charm. A very nice game to play if you only have a little time too.			"

												If you're not scared off by tags like ""indy"" and ""old-school"", then this game may be for you.This game is not beautiful, it's not polished, it's not exquisite, but somehow, I just keep going back to it. The mechanics that arise from a superposition of silly robot behaviors just introduce enough predictability that each time you die, it's your fault.Bionic Dues is one of those cell-based turn-by-turn game, where you spend hours choosing the best equipment for your mechs, and counting tiles and damage points and ammo. The quest for Epic Exos and the countdown to a huge final battle just make it more enticing.This title is not for everyone. But if you're a roguelike fan, you're in for a treat.			"

												excellent value for the $1.00 I paid for it. my playthrough bug free and well optimized. You have to problem solve/puzzle your way through the tactical situations, not yolo/leroy jenkins it. I exploited save games until I got the hang of the game and a good start, this game belongs in the ""losing is fun"" school.			"

												Curator Review:Bionic Dues is a Roguelite Sci-Fi Dystopian game set in a future where robots have taken over the world and are coming for you. You must hold out against the robots and defeat them or they will destroy all of humanity (or get nuked in the process). This challenging game is great fun once you learn how to play but fails in its' overall explanation of game mechanics. With a little perserverance it becomes easier. Still, it receives a 7.5/10 for being a fun game, once you know how to play it, and having fantastic music.

												It was fun until it lasted. It worked well on Linux platform until it started to get huge response delays. Tried repairing, reinstalling with no luck. The next patches haven't fixed that, so needed to delete it. It is sad really, as the game was ok, nice strategy elements with ok graphic. "

												So, first, let me say that I have only played about a half an hour of this game, but I love it. The gameplay is awesome, and it feels great to upgrade your bots, and it is really nice to pass through levels. The graphics are a really cool artsy style, and it looks very modern. One giant thing that I love about the game is how easy it is to pick up for a beginner.  I have never played a game about this before, and it only took about 10 mins to get started and in the game. I am having a load of fun. Also, it runs on Linux, which is really nice. Also, I got to purchase the game directly from one of the devs at Denver Comicon, so that was cool.			"

												This game contains the hardest dilemma you'll ever face on a videogame: Which character will I pick?-The black girl with a tiny head-The blonde with a tumor on her face-The fugly nerdy girl-The scarred guy with a giraffe neck-The gaysian-The black guy with lipstickI don't know much about the gameplay, tried a couple of levels on ""normal"" mode, and got myself wrecked (mostly by Insta-kill bots, Allahu-Akhbots, halls filled with mines with no other way to go around them, and the list goes on). Maybe I lost some important info in one of the text walls that the game calls 'tutorials'.But what really annoys me is the art. I guess this was the best they could afford - a guy that has some crappy aesthetic sense, and can't make proportional human-like figures.By the way, I picked the black guy with lipstick.*Edit: ------FUN PART OF REVIEW ENDS HERE------ Wall of text below.Due to extensive criticism, I decided to be a bit more detailed on aspects regarding gameplay.1. Some screenshots can be pretty misleading. To clarify this, in this game you control a single unit, that alternates between what some people may call ""stances"". However, the game likes to say that these stances are actually, individual mechs. Moving on - there's the assault stance mech (the one that shoots), the siege mech (the one that deals area damage), the ninja mech (the one that hides), and the science mech (the one that opens doors and hacks stuff). Note, however, that the assault can still do some AoE like the siege, and hide like the ninja, but not quite as effective.2. The game is heavily based on RNG. Traps, enemies and drops are generated and spawned by a computer algorithm, meaning that your outcome on a mission can be pretty much decided by a roll of dice. You may find a bunch of chests, filled with nice loot the same way you can find a narrow hallway filled with mines. That leaves no space for skill-based (or, in this case, smarts-based?) gameplay, just frustration and unfair situations.3. As I already said, presentation is horrible (and yes, I'm still regarding gameplay here). Not just the art is badly drawn, but the menus are also dreadful. At some point, you'll have to deal with your inventory, that will be filled with items that you got during your missions (woah, a bunch of loot! cool! ... right?). Trying to sort your stash, and figure out which item will fit best to which mech rapidly becomes a tedious task, the more items you get.So... yeah, that's all, folks.			"

												Got it for $2. That's about what it's worth. Not bad, just not really my cup of tea. It's at least a legit roguelike - tile map with 1:1 move/turn, etc - not some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fracking wannabe from another genre. The A/V is decent quality, but it's simply failed to cast off the sort of ""made in mom's basement"" feeling that most real roguelikes have. For instance, the enemy robots shout out ""humorous"" phrases when shot, but there's obviously a limited number of them, and after the billionth time hearing them you want to tear your eyes out and use them to plug your ears. Anyway, if you actually know what Rogue is, and like real roguelikes, then you'll probably like this. Personally I don't care for it, but I've seen a lot of roguelikes in my time and this is a good one, so I'll upvote.			"

												Absolutely amazing strategy game.I recommend it for any fans of rogue-likes and turn based strategy games.This game isn't the most visually amazing game obviously, but I found it easy to get used to it, and I even ended up sort of liking it. Where this game really shines is the customization. So many different parts, all with different flavor-texts and different stats. Some are directly better than others, and sometimes you need to make a choice.Really good as a strategy game as well. So many different things on the field you can find, wether it be loot, one of the many enemies or cover.I think it's certainly worth 10 dollars. If you're a big fan of rogue-likes and turn-based strategy, this game is for you.9/10 for me.			"

												I want to start by saying that I only played about 15 minutes of it. I hope to play more when I get a chance. Bionic Dues is a rogue-like with a party of warriors. But your warriors are made out of machinery. Your goal is to take your team on missions to find loot, become stronger, and after 50 days are up, survive against the apocalypse. The game is very rough in places - there's lots of tutorial text floating around instead of teaching you how to play. But after 2 missions, I got the hang of it. It's very Dark Souls-esque in that it doesn't really explain to you what the stats means (+20 Virus, huh?), but I think that's part of the charm.			"

You use 4 different mechs to make your way through difficult levels to achive various goals, each mech having various abilities.Only downside is that while the enemies level up from area to area, you do not and have to rely on equipment to improve your stats, so if you dont find some good loot, your totaly boned.

												Comming from a primarily FPS and sandbox background,I  still found this game rather enjoyable. It was a nice mix a strategy and managment of your robots. I will say, that it does get a little repetative, so that might be a turn off for some people. You have to do 50 missions (30 if you play your cards right) which, despite being classified as different types, basically all boil down to destroy everything you see. It took me about 3.5 hours to do a full match over the span of a couple of days;  I had to take breaks every 40 minutes or so because it was a little too repetative. I played on the easiest difficulty, but I think I would have been a little more excited on a hard level. But overall, I would recomend it, especially if you are a fan of real time strategy type games.			"

												Was skeptical at first but I purchased the game on sale at $2.47. Was blown away by multiple things. The gameplay is super fun and tactical (x-com style) and the customization that you can do on your mechs is pretty extensive. It kind of creates this sort of rogue-like x-com experience that I tried to get from the new x-com with the second wave options. This game really scratched that itch and doesn't really get old because of the 50 or so different mission types. It also has a pretty nice soundtrack.			"

												I didn't expect much out of this game, but I was very wrong. The depth of strategy in this game is astounding!In combat, every single action you take can mean the difference between failure or victory.In between every mission, you can select gear for your Exos. The customizaion in this portion of the game reminds me of classic Armored Core (the vast number of parts and effects, while balancing your capacitor load!), and table top RPGs. The variation to parts you can use is countless, and can very easily change the entire play style for each Exo (which are already unique in their own ways).Finally there is a lot of macro strategy as well. Every mission will affect the final outcome of the game. Every single mission, is to prep you for the final battle. Whether you decide to complete missions that increase your part stock, hinder enemy progress, or even the final battle closer in time, each and every choice will make a difference.This game might not be a triple A title, but it is certainly worth the price.

												Interesting game, after only a few minutes I think I can tell you what I think.After doing my first mission I have a feel for what this game is all about. Strategy and logic.As you move enemies move as well, some will attempt to attack you while others may move on a predetermined route. Use the environment to your advantage, while some obstacles may hinder your vision it also hinders the enemies vision. I feel like the movement and combat was partially enspired by another game called Legend of Grimrock.The fact that this game has voiceovers was suprising, especially the voiceovers for the enemy bots (Which by the way is actually pretty funny). As you shoot the bots (and they miss their shots at you) they let off some pretty humerous lines like ""Why was I programmed to feel pain?!"" or ""Stupid GPS..."".Graphics aren't really the focus here as the game is entirely 2 dimensional however the art style is pleasant on the eyes.All in all here's the conclusion:8/10 Would definately recomend this to casual gamers.

												Well I am writing this pretty early, but I think this will be one that hooks me. It's a roguelite that is actually pretty close to the rogue formula all things considered. The art style is not entirely appealing sometimes, but overall I dig it. The strategy layer is engaging, though not super deep. The combat is super satisfying. I started on casual so that I could get the hang of things and avoid the burnout that seems to happen to lots of people. That worked out great, but casual got really easy really fast. It's better than when I started on normal and got absolutely murdered since I had no idea what I was doing.I do recommend. Maybe highly. I am enjoying it way way more than I thought I would.			"

I love RPG, Strategy and Rogue-Like games and Bionic Dues has it all. If you're looking for a quick paced, turn based game this probably isn't for you, takes some serious thinking and mapping out your moves and equipment to really have a good grip on this game, but it really fun. It is a pretty tough game if you don't know what you're doing, and even when you do it can still kick your♥♥♥♥♥ lol.

												Bionic ♥♥♥♥ing Dues!To me, this feels like what ""Sword of the Stars : The Pit"" should've played like. At times, the gameplay will feel a bit off since you're gonna be reacting to the enemies' movement and provoking them, rather than just diving in and killing everything like in most games. Still, that's just a tiny part of the actual playtime, and the music is simply amazing, so it fills up the little downtimes you may have. Talking about the music, it's so amazing that whenever I stop playing, I always feel like the current track is slightly out of context (especially menu song)... Yet, all of them are so melodious and non-intrusive that it only ends up as a positive experience overall (I've had the menu song loop for ~30 minutes right now...)So, let's see if you should buy this game or not... What this game offers : - Squad management : You control 1 character, but can swap between 4 exos. The first thing you do when you create a game is choose your ""avatar"" (aka 1 special game-changing skill), and 4 exos which have their own specialties. - Equipment management : Each mecha has a reactor, shield, propulsor, computer and 2-5 weapons. Each of those have 2-4(5?) slots for items. You have to mix multiple stats while managing power usage to create your indestructible monsters. - Tactical fight : Lay down mines and turrets, go stealthed to ""charm"" their leader and run away sneakily, Use your shotgun to explode the fuel tank and make everything i nthat room ashes... This game offers it all. I haven't tried the 2 hardest difficulties yet, but the tactical side may even make the game slightly too easy. - Amazing music : I said it already, saying it again, the OST is  at the very least charming. Not a single time did I thought ""Hmm... I should lower the sound!"". Screw you roomies, I'm playing Bionic Dues! - Randomness : Map layout where you pick missions is random, map layout of missions is random, item drops are random... There are a few other aspect that are random-ish, but all in all you have the Rogue-like randomness without it being too punishing. - Different difficulties : I just completed a game on normal hardcore, it felt easy for someone used to play roguelikes. There are 2 difficulties lower than that, which are aptly named easy and casual, and 2 higher, which should be interesting.All in all, the choice is easy... If you like Mechas, buy it! If you like roguelikes, buy it! If the game is on sale, buy it! (Honestly, even if you're not a big fan of such games, I'm 100% you'll get more than $5-7 worth of fun out of this game).			"

												A funny mix of ingredients making for a rather good game, overall. You take a group of four ""mechs"" into various battlegrounds and kill robots. It seems to be trying to create the kinds of ""tactical puzzles"" which are one of the draws of the difficult moments in roguelike games. The customization is pretty fiddly and unsatisfying, but the combat itself is engaging and provides lots of opportunities to experiment with a wide range of available strategies. The graphics are rather characterless and in some ways the theme feels a bit thin. Also, there's a comic voiceover, which seems like a rather weird fit. Still, if you like roguelikes, turn-based tactical combat, and mechs, this is a good time.			"

												I want to start by saying that I only played about 15 minutes of it. I hope to play more when I get a chance. Bionic Dues is a rogue-like with a party of warriors. But your warriors are made out of machinery. Your goal is to take your team on missions to find loot, become stronger, and after 50 days are up, survive against the apocalypse. The game is very rough in places - there's lots of tutorial text floating around instead of teaching you how to play. But after 2 missions, I got the hang of it. It's very Dark Souls-esque in that it doesn't really explain to you what the stats means (+20 Virus, huh?), but I think that's part of the charm.			"

												Bionic Dues is another game by Arcen Games, and it features many similar elements as their most popular series- AI War Fleet Command- AI Rebellion, weakened humanity, difficult/punishing gameplay, sharp difficulty curve, slow paced thoughtful gameplay, occasional oversights in the tutorials due to game mechanics.However, where AI War was a strategy game involving often absurd numbers of ships, in extreme cases numbering in the tens of thousands, Bionic Dues is a much smaller game. The city map is randomly generated, as are the actual maps from what I can tell. The abilities and variation between the various ""Exos"" the player can pilot are both interesting and well definied, with each having a 'niche' that is generally obvious (brawling, assault, sniper, hacking, etc), but with smaller 'modules' that allow you to customize each ""Exo"" to fit your own playstyle. The difficulty ramps up rather well, but I've found on lower difficulties its easy to become slightly overpowered. Individual variation between mission types helps keep the game from getting repetitive, as do various ""Pilots"" you can select from the beginning that give you a bonus that will significantly effect the nature of your play. (One gets bonuses for the shopkeepers, one starts out with epic units, one has the ability to pursue missions futher away, etc.)The game is not without flaws. It has the Mass Effect problem where every mission gives you loot for surviving units, and most missions have hackable doors and lootable cans, making keeping track of modules, especially late game, a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It also occasionally becomes too open, with a lack of really clearly defined goals besides ""upgrade your equipment and survive the invasion in 40 days"".The soundtrack is mostly rehashed from AI War, with a few new introductions. It fits the game well, but players looking for a new album by Pablo Vega may be disappointed. I feel a need to point out that the turn based element is one I particularly like. Preforming any action costs a turn (moving, shooting most weapons, hacking, etc.), and then the robots will each move. However, Bionic Dues has no request prompts, so if you simply want to run across the map you can do so in realtime, but you can simply step away from the keyboard at any point if you wish and the game will wait for you. It allows you to pick your own pacing- Will you run in blasting anything that moves as the robots charge you down? Maybe you'll sit back and analyze each robot and pick the most efficient attack pattern, or maybe throw down an ambush using automated defenses, mines, or an enemy you hacked into being on your side.If you don't like replaying games trying to work different mechanics, Bionic Dues may not be for you. Those looking for a well developed story will find very little of that here (lots of setting, but the plot is something you make yourself).In any case, I happily recommend Bionic Dues.			"

It's old-school but still pretty innovative, and you really have to use every tool available to you to take on the overwhelming odds. Stuff like using a sentry turret so a BlunderBot fires a rocket, in the hopes it goes the wrong way and takes out its buddies without risking it aiming at you instead. That kind of thing.			"

However, each has 3 slots where you can put upgrades into them. All the loot you get is in the form of upgrades which you throw into the various slots on each bot in order to augment their abilities.			"

												Arcen Games makes a variety of games with interesting, niche gameplay, and Bionic Dues is no exception. If you're looking for a little bit of turn-based strategy in your Rogue-like RPG, Bionic Dues will fill that need. Just keep in mind that the game can be very convoluted in the way it presents your goals: your ultimate goal is to upgrade and survive for a pre-determined number of turns before the machines make their final assault on your base. The missions you engage in will determine how strong (or weak) the robot horde is when the final defense occurs. The game can be cleared in a few hours on normal difficulty; the real challenge comes from the harder modes and playing with different loadouts of robotic exos and commander units. The asking price of $10 is more than fair for a game with this level of replayability, so long as you're willing to put in the time to learn the nuance of the rules at play. Even if you aren't, consider buying Bionic Dues on sale if you enjoy more traditional Rogue-like titles.			"

												Brutally addictive turn-based strategy from ARCEN. Some of the best turn based strategy games I've played have all had that 'one more turn' appeal. Bionic Dues nails that feeling and nails it right, with random level and world generation, punitive death mechanics, a ticking time bomb scenario, and a one unit/four faces squad mechanic. Featuring all the quirk that ARCEN can muster in the art department, and a loot and gear scheme that would make any RPG proud, Bionic Dues is old school, addictive, and one of the better strategy titles I have played in a long time.

For me, the only downsides to this game was a feeling that the enemy is a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (with all the malfunctioning weapon etc.) and aforementioned lack of robots to play with. Apart from that, soundtrack on its own is worth what they ask for the game, making it almost a theft and a no-brainer for all everyone fond of turn-based strategy games.			"

												This as the blurb is a rogue-like game. Pretty cool, mistakes are often fatal, with a steep learning curve. Haven't made it to the end yet but have throughly enjoyed it thus far. You need to like robots... and you need to like er 'killing' them. Humourous in my opinion too, a number of times i've been reading equipment flavour text and fallen off my chair with amusement, any game i would quote text from i think is pretty awesome. Anyways throughly recommended if you don't mind simple graphics and turn based action, and tweaking your layouts (oh so much tweaking). I give it 7 camels of awesomeness!			"

												Enemies often kill you in one hit, equipment and stats are extremely complex and confusing. Difference between victory and loss feels arbitrary and cruel at first.11/10 GOTY all the years(In all seriousness it's extremely good but it makes no bones about being a brutal oldschool roguelike)			"

												Probably one of their best titles so far along with tidalis (though different genres)You have 50 turns to make your team strong / make the enemy team weak in the final conflict. Each turn can be used to play a  a type of mission until turn 50 where you will be automatically placed to defend your HQ.Game plays like your typical point and click grid based strategy. Think classic(the 90s!) space marines.			"

												Simple strategy game that is rather unforgiving if you're not paying attention--yet not so rogue-like, in that most losses are very short-term. At least half of the time I played seemed to be spent on inventory management (especially in the latter part of the game), but there is a button you can push to automatically assign equipment if you just want to jump back into play. Each enemy has a specific exploitable weakness, and each of your mechs has specific strengths that come in handy when used correctly. A fun little game that you can pick up and play with relative ease.			"

												WHY WAS I PROGRAMMED TO FEEL PAIN?[ENG] Maybe the graphic could negatively represent the game because it's poor, but this is a very cool RPG. The gameplay is simple and addictive, but honestly i don't remember if i bought it from steam sales or external giveaway sites.The full price of 10 Euros is a bit too much, but if this title will get a nice sale i absolutely reccomend it.(Update) By the way i just finished the game right now, it's a bit repetitive but i had fun playing it, and i still reccomend it if you can find it on sale :)Ps: the menù and in-game music are fantastic![ITA] Forse la povera grafica può negativamente influenzare a prima vista il gioco, ma è un RPG veramente ben fatto.

												Comming from a primarily FPS and sandbox background,I  still found this game rather enjoyable. It was a nice mix a strategy and managment of your robots. I will say, that it does get a little repetative, so that might be a turn off for some people. You have to do 50 missions (30 if you play your cards right) which, despite being classified as different types, basically all boil down to destroy everything you see. It took me about 3.5 hours to do a full match over the span of a couple of days;  I had to take breaks every 40 minutes or so because it was a little too repetative. I played on the easiest difficulty, but I think I would have been a little more excited on a hard level. But overall, I would recomend it, especially if you are a fan of real time strategy type games.			"

												Literally bought this game because of the awesome intro song. Lyrics below:The night is drawing closely, the shadows dark and ghostly, As sunlight dies, you hear the city's howling cries. No peace, no hope, no power, scared of every passing hour, Hiding out unseen from the eyes of the machines. But we will hide no more, we'll stand and fight this war, And strike in battle like we never have before. No matter what they do, we'll fight and we'll pull through, And turn this place back to the home that we once knew. Our streets are scorched and battered, our hearts are torn and shattered, But we'll survive, we'll bring our city back and thrive. We'll start a revolution, fight for power and retribution, Dark, and vile, and mean are the eyes of the machine. "

												 I played a bit of this game, and what i've noticed so far is that each exo suit can have up to 4 guns, they start with 2, but once they get their epic upgrade get more and extra stuff ect ect. basically there's room to add new parts. Overall the intro music is great the missions are pretty cool it's just a long game and you should also know that you have to read the tool tips in combat to do good. yep that's my review probley not that helpful. but it's not a bad game, just misunderstood.

												Turn-based strategy game. The robots will attack you and you have 50 days to prepare. You can do a variety of missions to collect gear or weaken the enemy. 1 mission equals 1 day. 1 full playthrough of 50 days took me about 10 hours.Pros:-There's a lot of costumization: 6 different exos to choose from each of them with their own strengths and weaknesses and lots of gear to choose from.-Large enemy variety, every sort of enemy needs to be dealt with in a different way.-Some strategic choice in choosing missions.-1 mission for each of your 4 exos that upgrades it with extra weapons.-Missions themselves have a lot of tactical depth thanks to having 4 different exos available each with 2-6 mostly different weapons.-Lots of replayability if you like the combat system: each mission feels different thanks to procedurally-generated levels.-Missions are short (15 mins) so you can play when you don't have a lot of time.-I personally really like the soundtrack.Cons:-Lots of different types of missions with different win conditions, but most of them feel the same because they all require you to kill most of the enemies in a level.-Can get repetitive if you're not a fan of the combat system: you'll be doing basically the same thing with the same 4 exos 50 times until the end of the game.-The way achievements work is a bit silly: same achievement for every difficulty level.

												Interesting game, after only a few minutes I think I can tell you what I think.After doing my first mission I have a feel for what this game is all about. Strategy and logic.As you move enemies move as well, some will attempt to attack you while others may move on a predetermined route. Use the environment to your advantage, while some obstacles may hinder your vision it also hinders the enemies vision. I feel like the movement and combat was partially enspired by another game called Legend of Grimrock.The fact that this game has voiceovers was suprising, especially the voiceovers for the enemy bots (Which by the way is actually pretty funny). As you shoot the bots (and they miss their shots at you) they let off some pretty humerous lines like ""Why was I programmed to feel pain?!"" or ""Stupid GPS..."".Graphics aren't really the focus here as the game is entirely 2 dimensional however the art style is pleasant on the eyes.All in all here's the conclusion:8/10 Would definately recomend this to casual gamers.

												Warning: This game is extremely unfair. And equally hilarious.The robot armies outnumber you a thousand to ONE. Not four, ONE. Your team of exosuits can only be controlled one at a time, and unlike you the robots don't have to spend most of their armor padding a fragile meatbag in the center of their cores. Each robot has their own advanced weaponry, all of which deals heavy damage to your exosuits, and some have special abilities which can utterly decimate an enemy opponent.Luckily, they are mind-bogglingly stupid.This is literally a core element of the game; nobody knows how or why they managed to program insanity into their grunts, but the robots are the extreme opposite of machine efficiency. Security guards shoot water pistol damage on their first two turns. Grenade bots are constantly drunk and can't move straight. Rocket launchers are too scared to move on their own. And all of them are so stupid they can be easily hacked and turned to your side, giving you their benefits and a hardened distraction to shoot at.Also, they are programmed to feel pain. Hearing their death cries is satisfying.They have firepower and numbers. You have stealth and brains. Make the most of it andPrepareToDieAnd when you're done dying, leave none alive.			"

												A competent turn-based tactical game from Arcen Games.  In Bionic Dues you control a squad of four 'exos' (remotely piloted mechs) one at a time to stop the advancing robot menace.  The game features random loot, as popularized by Diablo, an overall strategy screen, and the tactical map where all the robot stomping happens.  You have 50 days (turns) to prosecute a campaign against the tide of robots trying to eradicate humanity.  Each day you choose an available mission for your exos from those shown on teh city map.  After 50 days the remaining mass of robots arrive on your doorstep, and you have to KILL THEM ALL!For the most part the robots themselves, and the AI controlling them, are pretty dumb.  The 'bots try to crush your puny human resistance through sheer numbers, rather than any sort of awesome tactical genius.  On a similar note, though, there isn't much randomness to the combat itself.  You never feel cheated because your stupid exo managed to miss several shots in a row, or because you didn't realize that 'bot could shoot you.  All the info you need to make good decisions is right there on the screen.Audio and music are competent.  Everything sounds pew-pew and rata-tata as you'd expect.  The music isn't the sort of thing I'd listen to in the car, but I enjoy it enough to listen to it as I play.Graphics are clear enough that you can understand what's going on, but not spectacular.  It's 2D, top-down, tactical game, so a step up from pixel graphics, but you can't really admire the robot models, because there aren't any.The game isn't quite the same tactical depth of FTL, but your exos have a lot of options available to them.  Equipping them with loot is almost its own mini-game, and you will see a LOT of loot over the course of the game.  The biggest complaint I had of my first game was that the 'bots were a pushover.  I felt like I was moshing 'bots with impunity after only 20 turns or so, and by turn 40 I just wanted it to be over because I was so thoroughly dominating them.  That first game took 17 hrs to finish.  There are a decent amount of options for replayability, with six different commanders and exo types (each game you have a single commander, and up to four different exos).I enjoy turn-based tactics games like this, so it was worth the ten bucks I spent.  Definitely worth it if you can get it on sale.			"

												A challenging and entertaining roguelike featuring a team of mechs. Game features a healthy variety of missions and a host of upgrades. Has a bit of a learning curve like all roguelikes but is worth the time due to the highly enjoyable gameplay.Could use some balancing with characters and enemy abilities. Also the boss fight feels a bit lacking and in the late game constantly applying new upgrades can get a bit tiresome. Overall addicting and worth trying out.			"

												A very good Sci-Fi Roguelike, Bionic Dues sadly has some serious oversights that make the game pretty difficult to play. It's still very good, and convinced me to buy The Last Federation from the same developper.Pros: - Good RPG aspect with items & equipement - Time management in a sense through the attack countdown - A fair share of Exos (classes) selection - Epic Exos add a little twist - Game modifiers - A little touch of humorCons: - Splash Damage can get ridiculous and purely unbalance the game, i gave up my first playthrough when i got Epic Siege, 11 splash radius on Plasma Gun with 3 Ammo - Mistakes are always very costly, it's way too easy to get caught in explosions or one-hit, i wouldn't even try ""Dead-is-Dead"" mode - Similarily, it's way too easy to kill enemies as you progress throughout the gameAll in all, it's a really good game, albeit suffering from some balancing issues.

												Bionic Dues is another game by Arcen Games, and it features many similar elements as their most popular series- AI War Fleet Command- AI Rebellion, weakened humanity, difficult/punishing gameplay, sharp difficulty curve, slow paced thoughtful gameplay, occasional oversights in the tutorials due to game mechanics.However, where AI War was a strategy game involving often absurd numbers of ships, in extreme cases numbering in the tens of thousands, Bionic Dues is a much smaller game. The city map is randomly generated, as are the actual maps from what I can tell. The abilities and variation between the various ""Exos"" the player can pilot are both interesting and well definied, with each having a 'niche' that is generally obvious (brawling, assault, sniper, hacking, etc), but with smaller 'modules' that allow you to customize each ""Exo"" to fit your own playstyle. The difficulty ramps up rather well, but I've found on lower difficulties its easy to become slightly overpowered. Individual variation between mission types helps keep the game from getting repetitive, as do various ""Pilots"" you can select from the beginning that give you a bonus that will significantly effect the nature of your play. (One gets bonuses for the shopkeepers, one starts out with epic units, one has the ability to pursue missions futher away, etc.)The game is not without flaws. It has the Mass Effect problem where every mission gives you loot for surviving units, and most missions have hackable doors and lootable cans, making keeping track of modules, especially late game, a bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It also occasionally becomes too open, with a lack of really clearly defined goals besides ""upgrade your equipment and survive the invasion in 40 days"".The soundtrack is mostly rehashed from AI War, with a few new introductions. It fits the game well, but players looking for a new album by Pablo Vega may be disappointed. I feel a need to point out that the turn based element is one I particularly like. Preforming any action costs a turn (moving, shooting most weapons, hacking, etc.), and then the robots will each move. However, Bionic Dues has no request prompts, so if you simply want to run across the map you can do so in realtime, but you can simply step away from the keyboard at any point if you wish and the game will wait for you. It allows you to pick your own pacing- Will you run in blasting anything that moves as the robots charge you down? Maybe you'll sit back and analyze each robot and pick the most efficient attack pattern, or maybe throw down an ambush using automated defenses, mines, or an enemy you hacked into being on your side.If you don't like replaying games trying to work different mechanics, Bionic Dues may not be for you. Those looking for a well developed story will find very little of that here (lots of setting, but the plot is something you make yourself).In any case, I happily recommend Bionic Dues.			"
