												Turn Clue into a first-person shooter on 1920's era luxury liners, sprinkle in bits of The Sims, and you've got The Ship. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. To be more specific and familiar to the gaming audience, The Ship is a very polished and creative take on the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer experience (but also keep in mind that this game came before the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer genre was released)....where the main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so, there are plenty of lethal weapons and objects to wield, and even some environmental traps that you will find yourself potentially avoiding. To add flavor, everyone else on each map has a quarry as well. While pursuing your own target, you'll need to stay alert and attempt to spot the passenger readying a knife for your back. The Sims element of the game, quells upon your daily needs to survive (food, drinks, toilet, sleep, etc). The 'character's needs' element makes for a deeper gameplay experience, as your character is vulnerable to attack while you're downing a bag of chips or snoring on a bed. And it is surely funny when your friend murders you on the toilet. The Ship is one of very few games that brings a large amount of enjoyment to my friends and I. Built on Valve's Souce engine, a majority of gamers can experience a $20 title with basically 4 copies to gift away. A little too much? Ask four of your friends for $4 each, and your all set! Overall, The Ship is a very innovative, satisfying and humorous experience that a bunch of 5 friends can't pass up. ""Let us set sail!.""			"

												This is the Multiplayer portion of The Ship. I said I didn't like the singleplayer, but the multiplayer is a totally different story.Also another little note, at time of writing, the in-game server browser is broken. You can find games through Steam (Steam Window: View > Servers > Change Filters > set game to The Ship).The Ship seems to be a lesser known, yet highly underrated game about murdering other people without being spotted. It's a true blue stealth game in that you actually have to kill your quarry without being seen by anyone. If you pull out a weapon in front of a guard, security camera, or are seen holding one for too long by other players, you get arrested and penalized. The game also punishes random deathmatching, so players have less incentive to grief. The game is really tense because everyone is a target. while you're hunting your target, someone else is hunting you, and you have no idea who it is until they start looking shifty, make a move on you, or kill you.It also combines a little bit of The Sims in that you have to manage your needs: hunger, thirst, toilet, cleanliness, boredom, fatigue, socialization... All the while trying to hunt down your quarry. The game also encourages mixing up your murder weapons by increasing the money you get for a kill with a given weapon the longer it goes without being used. Once a weapon is used, it drops to the bottom of the list and only gives you the minimum payout.The game is a buttload of fun and deserves more love and attention. This game also comes with a bunch of copies that you can give to friends. I highly recommend it, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.			"

												The Ship is an amalgam. It combines gameplay genres in satisfying and entertaining ways. Whereas many games that incorporate multiple genres end up as generic experiments gone wrong, The Ship not only manages to keep from sinking, but sets sails for the high seas of adventure. This is one seriously imaginative game. While certain elements may remind you of other popular games, The Ship manages to combine these elements to create a unique concept in gaming. Essentially a murder mystery, The Ship combines elements of the whodunnit classic board game Clue with shooter elements, in addition to some personal management features not unlike The Sims. There's lots of action, tasks, strategy, and laughs to be had. You can play with others online or offline with bots. Each mode has its own good and bad points, but the good points outweigh bad.The unique part is that this means that you yourself are someone's target, and must avoid being killed by your secret stalker while you're looking for your own target.The basic idea behind The Ship is that you play out a murder mystery on a luxury liner that's decked out in the art-deco style of the 1920s. But this isn't an adventure game, despite the Agatha Christie premise. A first-person perspective and maps loaded with narrow corridors and small rooms make the game feel like a shooter, although instead of blasting everyone in sight, you're assigned to kill a specific victim on the sly for cash, and his or her current location is updated at the bottom right of the screen every 30 seconds. Instead of blasting away with shotguns and BFGs, you mainly do your dirty deeds with improvised weapons such as golf clubs, letter openers, barbecue tongs, and croquet mallets. The Ship brings a hilarious, fun, yet totally odd style to the first person shooter community.  When most players are playing along, this game is a blast and there are some really great moments to be seen here.  The single player mode leaves a bit to be desired, as it mostly just acts as practice for online play, but it's still actually pretty usable and fun.  For its budget price, it won't work if you're looking for great graphics or a lot of all-out action, but once you get into the game's wacky style of play I think you'll find it's wonderful and very satisfying.

												I spent about 2 hours playing this with a couple friends today, and as another review had said, it is autistically fun. Playing the ""World Leaders"" mode is absoutely the most hilarious thing I've experienced in a videogame thus far. Becoming George W. Bush and being assigned to take out Margaret Thatcher, you just can't beat. On a satisfaction scale from Fruit Stripe gum to a guilt free blowjay, I give this game a ""Sneeze that's been holding back for half an hour"".			"

Yes, the graphics are a bit dated, but if you put three or four computers in the same room running the game and get people started... there's nothing like killing your friends. ""That was you?""

												Does anyone remember when Assassin's Creed announced it would have a multiplayer mode for the first time? I sure do, because at the time, all I thought was that they were ripping off the ship.I was wrong. AC multi is a lot worse.The Ship is one of the best multiplayer experiences on the internet. It's a combination Assassin's Creed, The Sims, and a little Madworld mixed in.Players are stranded together inside one of several large cruise ships as a random skin, populated with a large host of NPCs as well. Each player has a target, who they recieve a face for and nothing else. Their job is to find that player on the ship and kill them. The trick is that you lose points if you kill anyone you're not hunting or being hunted by, including said npcs. There are cameras at various locations around the ship, which will cause you to get arrested and timed out if caught brandishing weapons openly. However, you have a set of needs such as hunger, thirst, hygeine, bladder and sleep, similar to The Sims, which force you to keep moving to meet them, usually away from the cameras. Your goal is to act as much like the unassuming NPCs as possible, both to avoid detection from those hunting you and to disguise yourself from the prey you're tailing, all while managing your meters and picking up the weapons you'll need to secure the kill.There's a huge host of weapons and environmental hazards with which to do so, and point values for each vary wildly over time. This forces players who want to stay on top to constantly be changing their tactics and style. Certain weapons can only be found in specific locations on each ship, so highly desired gear can become choke points which force players to meet similar to Q3A duels.The ship is full of more than weapons, though. In addition to portable food items which can restore health or your need meters in a pinch, most guests board with more than the clothes on their backs. By raiding their rooms for garments, you can swap out your clothing if you think you're being followed or after each kill to disguise yourself and throw the other players off your scent. You can't change your face, but someone following to the side or behind may think you're an NPC and move on.The result of all this craziness is a really clever form of deathmatch that uses true stealth and deception, because you're trying to trick other players instead of AI. Stalking prey feels really rewarding and so does tricking your attacker into revealing themselves under a camera or turning a corner and unexpectedly fighting back. The ticking time from your meters at the bottom, the rapidly changing point structure and high ranking players attracting more hunters make the pressure always on and puts players on their toes.If all this seems right up your alley, wait unless you're super eager and have nothing better to do. The Ship is getting an HD version in early 2016, though as far as anyone can tell right now, it will be multiplayer only. The Ship also has a singleplayer campaign, though it's not nearly as fun imho. The unique aspect of Ship combat is pvp stealth and sneaking up on Sims in their sleep feels more like a clunky, uglier Hitman Absolution.			"

												Think ""The Sims"" crossing over with ""Assassin's Creed"", you are all random shipmates with individual pseudonyms aboard a variety of different and even exotic vessels for maps. Your main objective: Kill your designated quarry, whilst watching out for other competing hunters, and tending to  your own basic human needs; hunger, sleep, boredom, hygiene, and using the facilities (Make sure you close the door first!).And proclaim your prominence as the dominant hunter, with a comedic arsenal of fun assertives such as: A Tommy gun, Blunderbuss', shanks, Wallet-bombs, and even Mannequin Arms. Just don't get caught by the fuzz when commiting your dasterdly deeds!There's just nothing more amusing than whipping out a full automatic, and eviscerating your best friends while they're busy ""passing time on the porcelain throne""... *sighs happily* Good times.All in all...

												The Ship is definitely not your usual first-person shooter, where you just shoot anything that looks at you funny - although there is a game mode for that.It feeds on your cleverness and paranoia. Each game round, you have to kill on specific person onboard one of several ocean liners - the titular Ships - and at the same time, someone is hunting you. Both you and your target - or 'quarry' - can take cover under the watchful eye of a Security Guard or Camera, but your hunter will likely be quite happy to bribe the Security to ignore their crimes while they bring that big ol' bat of theirs and beat your ♥♥♥ to death with it.Each other player you meet is a potential threat, and whether they come right at you wielding axe or gun, or sneak around and try to whack you from behind or lure you into a trap is up to them.But, again, it's not just that simple - the winner of the match is decided by who has earned the most money for their kills at the end, and each weapon has a randomized and steadily increasing price for its use, be it Frying Pan, Revolver, Flare Gun, Umbrella or Wallet Bomb. Once the weapon is used, its price drops down to a measely $100. Thankfully, you have access to a list that shows which weapons are paying out the highest. It's up to you to find them, mind.While all of this is going on, your character has needs of their own - hunger, exhaustion, hygiene and growing loneliness all play a factor, and the longer you're alive, the harder it becomes to stay that way.The environments are beautifully stylized. Each map has a different theme while sticking to a creepy, paranoia-fuelling atmosphere. The larger ships are a little dark and foreboding, while the smaller ones are much more colorful and fun. As the amount of people out for your blood increases, the atmosphere and your sanity darkens.Every ship is laid out completely differently, from the very simple to the aggressively complex. Learning the maps and where to find hiding spots and secrets is the key to success.The character design is quite cartoony, something between TF2 and TellTale characters. It fits the tone very well, being neither silly nor realistic.The sound design is just marvellous. Every weapon impact on your quarry is satisfying, my personal favorite being the 'THWANG' of the Frying Pan or Cooking Pot. Old timey music plays through every radio and in every bar and restaurant, footsteps getting louder behind you make your heart jump, the wind, splashing water and airhorn blasts outside make you chill, and... well, let's say your character's visit to the bathroom is... descriptive.If I have to criticize it, I will say the AI bots are very thick, more concerned with wandering about like cattle, more grazing, sleeping and pooping than hunting, only engaging in combat when they happen upon their quarry by chance.All in all, I love this game. An exciting, fast-paced murdery romp on the high seas, combining regular first-person combat skills with strategy, planning and lunatic paranoia. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be totally enthralled.			"

												This is a fantastic game especially for one that was created all the way back in 2006. You forget that it is 10 years old when you are playing; this is mainly due to the fact that it is a concept that is currently unrivalled when compared to games of today. Admittedly, it takes a fair amount of effort to create a multiplayer game; the server has to be hosted by a member of your party as there are no public servers available (This requires forwarding of port 27105). Other than that, it's an easy game to get into. The basic premise of the game is that you have to hunt for your quarry, while being hunted. You get a list of the best priced weapons when pressing M, if you find these and kill your quarry without being detected and therefore detained, you will get a higher amount of money. There are various maps, all of which are fairly good, these can be selected with console commands. The spare slots in the server are populated with a fairly good AI.If I can offer one piece of advice, it's keep an eye on the people around you, and watch that eye.My only complaint is that this game is so old, if it was revamped and brought into today's standards; I could imagine an even greater game would be born.

												The ship is an interesting game that has a lot to offer. If I had to describe it I would say it's like the Sims and the Assassin's creed multiplayer combined, all along with a rather interesting art style. It is like the Sims in that your character has persistent needs throughout the game that you must deal with, and along with the hunt and hunted type pvp you'll be doing means you have to balance killing your target, hiding from the person hunting you, and making sure your hygene, hunger, tiredness and other statuses are fullfilled. The game also features an ecconomy where you get money for kills and this can be spent on items or supplies to refill hunger or thrist.Overall the game is a boat load of fun and it gets even better with friends, if you and some friends can buy this together it should keep you entertained for a while. I've not seen any downsides yet and the only one I could list is if you don't really like this type of pvp multiplayer.			"

												This game sells itself short. Well, it fails to sell itself at all really. Gifted to me by a friend, who was equally unsure of the game, I thought I would give it a try. What an excellent addition to my 2013 collection The Ship turned out to be. Just in the nick of time as well!To put it simply, you're a predetermined character on a ship and are given a mark. Similarly, another character has been given you as their mark, so you can't just run round willy-nilly. If you ever watched Ace Ventura as a child then you'll catch the game's drift fairly quickly. You're on a hunt - for humans. Varied weapon choice provides replayability and good humour. There are plenty of bizarre and wonderful weapon to find and take out your mark with, each with a reward. Bat someone with an umbrella in a public place and you'll be well remunerated. Similarly, tipping hats to Cluedo and whacking someone with a candlestick will also get you big bucks.Considering that the sole goal of the game is to commit murder, The Ship is surprisingly light-hearted and amusing. It's one of those games you can dip in and out of without getting hooked, but get quick jollies from. I've thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat hidden gem and would recommend it highly. "

Gerçekten eğlenceli.EnglishGreat fun and suspense game. In different maps you hunt and get hunted. But you have no idea who hunts you. Most of the time nobody trust no one and you spend your time following and running. It is very easy to play and learn. Whenever you die or get into the prison (because you tried to use your weapon while people were watching) you start over, but you can find weapon and other stuff you need in the closets very easily. You basically gear up from scratch every time and start hunting. So easy and fun.			"

												An amazingly made game which should definitely be noticed. It revolves around a ship which is suspiciously marooned or something, away from any chance of rescue. The strange Mr. X - the complete leader of the ship with a strange kind of Russian accent - orders the ship's passengers to kill or be killed.You get a quarry to kill in the Multiplayer. But there's a twist... you're being hunted. And so the main aim is to stay alive with the Sim-like twist you have to fulfil your needs so you don't die of having to go to the ♥♥♥♥ or starve.In the Singleplayer, you're tasked with incredibly unique missions, and eventually you will complete the game.One-of a kind.

												This is one of the first games I purchased on steam and It's honestly one of the best games out there. You're given a quarry to find and murder and you're someone else's quarry for them to find and kill but you have to be sneaky and wary of your surroundings, if you're spotted with weapons drawn you'll be arrested and most likely miss your chance to get to your quarry. The weapons (frying pans, scalpel, syringes full of poisonous liquids) have different worth's and the better the worth the more money you will gain from killing your quarry with them with the worth changing on each round, The player that gets to a certain amount of cash wins. If dealing with all that wasn't enough you have to compete with your own body, you have to deal with hunger, thirst, hygiene (sort of like the Sims)  and if you don't shower often enough you will turn into dust and perish.I murdered my quarry while they were on the toilet with a blunderbuss. That's the kind of game this is.			"

The ShipThe Ship is a fun semi-realistic multi-player game that takes place is a semi-modern early 1910's. The game modes consist of Hunt(You have a name of another player/CPU and you must find him/her and kill them without getting arrested or killed yourself), Team Elimination(Simple; Two teams find and kill each member of the opposing team), Death-match(Kill everyone), Duel(One-on-one battle), and Team VIP(Kill the enemies teams, VIP whilst keeping yours safe). I gotta' admit it, It's a very fun multi-player game. I especially like the realism aspects such as, Thirst, blatter, colon, hunger, sleep, entertainment, loneliness, and some more(If I remember correctly). If you fail to attend to those needs, Your player will die in a unique way according to which thing you forgot to attend to. Anyway, In conclusion; The Ship is an awesome multi-player game and I for sure, suggest that you guys should try it out.RatingsCategoryRating

												The Ship is a game where you hunt other people while being hunted yourself.Ever played Assassin's Creed's Hunt mode or Trouble in Terrorist Town? This is very similar.The main difference between The Ship and those games is its Sims-like needs system.This concept may be foreign to people unfamiliar with The Ship, but eating and drinking are essential to not dying.Too hungry? You die.Too thirsty? You die.Too tired? You fall asleep and somebody literally stabs you in the back.Managing one's needs is a way The Ship forces players into the open.Just skip the Single Player game, it's agonizingly slow and boring.

												This game is one of the most unique, creative, and best multiplayer games that there is. It requires you to be a lot more strategic compared to other games in the FPS genre. Every round, you are given a random person (called a Quarry in the game) that you have to try to hunt down and eliminate without being caught by security guards, security cameras, or witnesses. If you get caught, then you go to jail for a bit. But at the same time, you have someone that is also trying to hunt you down and eliminate you in a stealthy manner as well. Every so often, you are notified of the location where your Quarry is/was. But your Hunter is also notified of the location where you are/were every so often as well. So it's a constant feeling of uneasiness because you can't really trust anybody as you're moving around the ship. And you're trying to eliminate your Quarry while also trying to not get eliminated by your Hunter (and you don't know who your Hunter is). If you eliminate an innocent (someone that is not your Quarry or your Hunter), your character loses money. And if you eliminate too many innocents and put your character in a lot of debt, you automatically get kicked and temporarily suspended from the server for 1 hour. Another good thing about this game is that all of the characters have real human needs that need to be attended to every so often. These needs include eating, having a drink, going to the washroom, showering/bathing, sleeping, socializing, reading something, etc. Having to attend to these needs prevents players from just camping the whole time. If a character's needs are ignored, then there are consequences such as the character naturally dying. Or falling on the floor and going to sleep for a bit which makes you completely defenseless against your Hunter if they find you. So the requirement of having to attend to real human needs every so often is one of the things that makes this game so unique and different from the rest of the FPS genre. The game also requires you to use different weapons/methods towards eliminating your Quarry each round. Eliminating your Quarry with the same weapon repeatedly every round results in very little award money for you. Each round, the weapons get a different award money amount based on which weapons have been used the most so far in the match. The weapons and items that you will find as you search around are randomized. The Ship also has a pretty decent single player campaign/story. And it also has a tutorial for new players to teach them the basics of playing the game. The game can be played by yourself offline with bots or online with other people (and bots if wanted). You can host your own server by yourself (playing with bots at first) that other people can join (players that join replace the bots). The game also has different gamemodes and maps as well. This game is very deserving of a lot more online players than it currently has. So I definitely recommend The Ship for people that are looking for a multiplayer game that's very unique, creative, and different!			"

												This game is a fantastic group experience for anyone wanting to spend an evening stabbing your friends in the back. The Offline part is garbage, and playing the online multiplayer is decent fun, but the game truly shines when you have a large group of friends (4+) on a private server taunting eachother over voice chat and screaming in panic when you pull the shotgun. If you're flying solo, then keep on browsing, but if you've got friends to VC with, this game earns a flawless 10/10.The only downside is that, rather than fix the server issues (There are no dedicated servers, you have to find publicly run servers to play on or make one yourself.) They instead released a worse version of the game under the pretense of it being a ""remastering."" The new version straight up removes some of the game elements and changes others,  while adding little, if any to compensate.Worst of all, in my opinion, is that with the release of a re-mastering, they've removed the ability to buy a 5 pack of the Ship for 20 dollars. 5 friends tossing 4$ in the hat was the single greatest purchase I've ever made on steam, but asking each person to pony up 10$, especially when the game's most fun with friends? They properly shot themselves in the foot with that.TL;DR This old version is better than the remastered one, and the game is best experienced with friends, voice chat, and perhaps just a little alcohol.

												Multiplayer:Fun as hell if you're playing it with friends. Knowing that one of your friends might be the one who is assigned to kill you  (or maybe you're the one who's quarry is your friend) makes the whole thing funny while you are Skyping or smtn.Singleplayer:It's quite short and the story is pretty much meh. All you gotta to do, are some tasks given by the Bellboy. Those aren't the ""Kill that guy""  objectives only. Hard difficulty makes your butt clench very hard, especially while fighting with the melee weapons.Overall: Mostly it's a multiplayer fun - lots of maps, weapons, interactions... Interactions kinda reminded me of The Sims. Even the animations and characters looked like from The Sims. Ships are confusing at first and walking around non-stop might affect your patience, because sprinting drains fast and restores slowly. Also, your character needs drain annoyingly fast.No achievements, SP is short, MP is fun while playing it with friends only, in my opinion. Wait for the sale, it's not worth 10 euros.6/10Btw, why the ♥♥♥♥ there are 3 different downloads for this game - MP, SP and even the Tutorial needs to be downloaded???			"

												The Ship is a very fun murder game where you have different ways of murding someone and different gamemodes.Gameplay: The gameplay is great as you must kill your victim, but you can't be seen by a witness, camera or a security guard. The style of gameplay is great as the game makes you use a different  weapon to earn more cash than using the same weapon.Gamemodes: There isn't just one gamemode where you have to kill your quarry, but there are different types like that. Take deathmatch for instance: kill anyone you see. That gamemode is good for people who like having a bloodbath and going on ruthless killing sprees. Or there is The Hunt: you must hunt your specific target before the time limit, and you must protect yourself from your hunter as everyone on the boat is a quarry. The Hunt teaches you not to kill everyone you meet straight away.Conclusion: The game is a brilliant massacre on a boat and I love throwing a wallet/purse bomb into a small room with loads in. 10/10  Would kill someone with a cane again...

												The ship is a very interesting idea for the game. It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.The Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a ""mark"" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost ""stalemate"" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.I expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a ""training area"" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play ""multiplayer except with bots"" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The ""levels"" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to ""role play"" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the ""sprinting"" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called ""sprinting"" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!The tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to ""play"" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.I know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.+GREAT potential in multiplayer+Funny killing animations-Outdated graphics-Annoying mechanics (read review)-Servers not up in-game			"

												I'll start with the Con's. Graphics not very good anymore. Annoying music keeps looping in levels. Built-in server browser is not working so you need to manually add servers for multiplayers. And then the good.... Well good sides goes something like this: I lurk around the ship corridors nervously looking for my target while avoiding exposing my back to others too much. One can never know when YOUR killer strikes. We all hunt each other - problem is you can never know who it is until the weapons are brandished. Assuming you see them do it. Bam! i found my pray and in a busy intersection i find a quiet little spot where nobody is looking. I whip out the ice pick and stab the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to death from behind. Yes! price money is mine. Later i get hungry so i head for the bank automat and pick up some cash. Life is good. i head for the nearby snack machine. There is a bit of a crowd here so surely nobody would try anything? Like a poker player i place my back against the corner and take some potato chips to sate that hunger. As i take my first bite the man standing next to me in the crowd puts away the book he was reading and whips out a shank and stabs me in the ♥♥♥♥ing face while i am enjoying my potato chips. It just happened to be so that i placed myself into a defilade and the crowd was not looking at me at the right moment. I fall down into a pool of blood and my killer scurries behind the corner and starts to walk casually away. I can almost hear him whistle as he does his casual trot on the corridor. A crowd gathers. 'Oh, yet another one bites the dust'. and then they carry on with their own game of cat and mouse. Many more will die tonight. This dear reader is what 10/10 moments are in a game that is revolutionary in idea but unfortunately very much ignored when it was released and thus it is almost abandoned except for the player base. Did i mention even newbies can be good at this game? Practice a bit with bots and then hit for the MP servers.			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2015/01/ship-opomijeny-deathmatch/The ship is a great experience, especially with friends. It has some of the most hilarious ways how to kill a fellow passanger, like closing them into a freezer or throwing an umbrella at them. It's a better hunting simulator than other actual hunting simulators out there :D. In the beginning of the round, you get a name of your quarry and your future murdurer gets your name. It's only up to you to escape and still kill your victim. All that while managing your human needs. The insecurity and distrust is incredible, if you use teamspeak during the game and it reaches the fun level of Trouble in Terrorist town mod. The ship is great fun but doesn't offer much replayability, only if you really fancy it I guess or have 20 friends who do, because the servers are sadly very empty these days, playing with the AI is decent though 8/10 "

												I've only played the Multiplayer side of it, I haven't try the single player segment, but I'm gonna review this since the multiplayer is a reason to buy this alone. This is one of the most unique deathmatch experience I ever had, at first it might seems like a pointless game, that make their player roleplay, but in the end is one of the most detph deathmatch game, without the high skill entry point. Instead of jus finding weapons and killing everyone that move, the game rewards you for being smart at it, it make you track your target and kill him without witnesses, including the police. Since when they spot you they put you in jail, in which if you're lucky and play your card right you can make your kills there. The game have a wierd sense of humor, I can't explain what is, but is both fun and dark, also the wierd and twisted violence combine with the slow but tense paced of the game, can make some of the most funniest moment in any game I'd ever seen.My only complain about this game I have is, I wish I had played this a lot sooner, there's still people playing this, and there's hardly an empty server, but I just wish had played this on the glory days.

												The Ship you and some other passengers, are enjoying a free cruise out in the middle of the ocean when the person who gave you the free ticket tells you that you the passengers will start hunting each other, at least that's the single player part of it, now if you decide to buy the arcade version only (charging for single player, EA take note) you will spawn as a random created person with a random name (my favorite being Moses Bring) there are rounds, and in between each round you have a set-up period where you can take of your needs, (Like the eating, the pooping, the talking) or getting new weapons, but when the round begins you are given a name of another person on the ship, and their realitive whearabouts, are you are tasked with killing that person without being seen by the ship athourties, however there is a person with your name tasked to kill you, so it adds a lot of suspense to the game, that being said, there is one HUGE flaw in the game, when you want to play online and you go through the game, the game won't be able to find any servers, this however can be fixed by going to view and click on servers then find the ship. so that being said, The Ship is a Very fun game, with countless hours of gameplay, not to mention 1920's era music playing through the ship, so that's always nice			"

												A fantastic multiplayer experience as The Sims meets Hitman. You have a specifc person to kill every round and must do so without being detected by security.  Your choice of weapon will affect the bounty you get.  Weapons that have been commonly used give less money, so finding a rarer weapon might net you LOADSADOSHHHH.Mix in the mind games on trying to stalk your prey whilst keeping yourself safe.

The Ship - one of the most original games I`ve played.The devious Mr. X (original name right there) hosted a game on a ship that`s miles away from land. Every one is a hunter, and a hunted. The game's a murder mystery one, that hosts quite a lot of original ideas, for example: you're a human being, so you need needs, like entertainment and sleep. Multiplayer is the main focus of the game, as shown by the hour long singleplayer campaign.I recommend the game, but only if you can deal with it's small playerbase.			"

You must avoid holding weapons infront of police, cameras and lots of people. But beware someone might have bribed time to ignore crime so they can kill people even infront of police and cameras. To sum it up in one word is incredibly hard, because it isn't just a murder game. It's not just sims. It's The Ship			"

												Clue meets the first person style of video games!This underrated game combines the element of assassinating and downright murdering someone's face with a tad bit of life simulation of having to take care of yourself- the need to feed, bathe, sleep and so on. It also gives the feeling of suspense and danger as you too are being hunted.A really top game to play with friends and family, and decent people. And if playing with others just isn't you thing there is always the single player piece of it to play. For either case there is bound to be hours of fun.Other great aspects of the game is the hilarious rag-doll physics, the lack of lag, and even the some-what stylized look of everything which helps keep it from feeling too outdated.

												It can be a pain to get the multiplayer set up for this game, but it's absolutely worth it. The multiplayer (which really is the main part of the game, since the singleplayer, while interesting, is basically just a fancy tutorial for the multiplayer and doesn't last more than an hour or two) is pretty dead at the moment, and while you can still find servers to play on if you check the forums for how to find them, you'll generally have to supply your own friends to play with if you want to play with actual humans. There is an HD rerelease launching next year, which will hopefully fix the server issues and revive the playerbase, but for now, if you've got a group of friends and want to kill each other with an assortment of weapons on boats this is a great way to do that without getting in trouble with the law.

												It's a pretty damn good game.Pros: - Source Engine, it's a damn good engine.- Single Player, and Multiplayer.- Fun with friends and fun solo.- Can steal someone's clothes off their corpse.- Good Variety of Weapons.- Good Graphics.Cons:- Sometimes when I'm standing still out of the way of a camera or cop, and it says I'm not being seen, I pull out out a weapon such as a gun and I'm instantly caught even though there was no witness.- Can get tedious if you constantly get arrested because of bs that the game makes up.- Sometimes throwing weapons can be sparratic.- No Master Server Browser. (You have to look up a Server IP on your browser, though that's not very difficult.)Overall? I give this game a 8/10, it's a good game to play despite all the cons.This game gets the Melon seal of approval.			"

												I played this with a friend, and it is hilarious.Okay so its not a great graphical game..so what? Minecraft seem to be populair even tho that game is balls and it looks like a rubix cube.Yeh the Pyshics in this game doesnt really fit in and the graphics arent that great.That doesnt stop this game from being hilarious and funny.I recommend buying this game with multiple people/friends and play it while having microphone communication.Awesome!Would totally play it again... if i had a friend playing with :D			"

												Now, I don't normally pay for games like this. Honestly when I saw the price, I was a bit skeptical. But, I was told that it was a rather good game.And then I began to play.Holy crapsicles I love this game, if it asked me I would give it my virginity. I can't complain about much, I only have two complaints.1: Map Size.   Seriously, make the maps bigger.2: Server problems.    I've had problems in the past finding servers.Still, this is friggin' amazing. Gameplay is good and the singleplayer story is good. So, I'd give it a 9/10			"

												I first picked up The Ship when it was released and played a few games against people I didn't know. It was OK but I found myself tiring fast of bloodlusting killers and people living infront of cameras and security guards.Since jumping back on with a dozen or so friends, it's been a hell of a lot more fun. The paranoia and light-hearted competitiveness really make it such an enjoyable and engrossing game. Definitely worth a purchase if you've got a group of people to play with.			"

												This game is one of the best indies I have played. In saying that this was made in 2006, and games today don't get as good as this. It is an action packed fight to the death assassin game, there are multiple ways to win, and watch out if your seen with your weapon or attacking someone you will be put into the slammer. I think that is an amzing way of coding the game and the fact that they thought of that blows my mind. It is absolutely fantastic the gameplay. Though I have to say the bots can be stupid at times, but you will never know what could be around the corner waiting for you.			"

												I've only played the Multiplayer side of it, I haven't try the single player segment, but I'm gonna review this since the multiplayer is a reason to buy this alone. This is one of the most unique deathmatch experience I ever had, at first it might seems like a pointless game, that make their player roleplay, but in the end is one of the most detph deathmatch game, without the high skill entry point. Instead of jus finding weapons and killing everyone that move, the game rewards you for being smart at it, it make you track your target and kill him without witnesses, including the police. Since when they spot you they put you in jail, in which if you're lucky and play your card right you can make your kills there. The game have a wierd sense of humor, I can't explain what is, but is both fun and dark, also the wierd and twisted violence combine with the slow but tense paced of the game, can make some of the most funniest moment in any game I'd ever seen.My only complain about this game I have is, I wish I had played this a lot sooner, there's still people playing this, and there's hardly an empty server, but I just wish had played this on the glory days.

												I just downloaded The Ship yesterday and I must say I am already hooked on it.  The concept of the game had me very intrigued.  To have to kill another passenger before they kill you, can really put you on edge.  It's so much fun because you have no idea who is hunting you till it's too late. (Well for the most part) You can also kill who you think is after you.  Anyway I recommend everyone get this game, it's pretty addicting!			"

												One of the most unique concepts for a game I've ever seen.  Clue meets the Sims in this early 1900's cartoon fps.  The only thing that brings this game down is it's buggyness, but when it works, it's a whole lot of fun.  Makes an excellent drinking game as well!  I definately recommend playing this game with friends either in the same room or at least on Skype/whatever online phone program you have.  Being in communication with others and playing as a group makes this experience much better.  Keep the ship alive!			"

The servers may not work in game. But you can get through it in Steam. By hitting ""View"" at the top right. But anyway it is great game if you are mad at your friends or so. Enjoy killing your friends and fellow shipmates!			"

												I absolutely love this game. It's fast paced enough to keep you on your toes, running from an unknown hunter, and slow enough to let you lounge by the pool as you admire the sunset with your target one last time. My friends and I love playing, even though I know all the secret passages in the ships and they don't. ;)			"

												Okay, let me just say, this game is great, are you the hunter, or the hunted? Well, both, You chase down your quarry, on a boat. Once you mindlessly beat your quarry to death with a pool que, you think everythings okay. Well it turns out the man that followed you into the womans bathroom is your hunter, so your in trouble, you can run to the nearest guard to prevent a pot in the face, or you can of course fight back and perform organ surgery with a umbrella. Some times it is difficult to avoid cameras and guards, so its hard to kill your quarry sometimes, be stealthy, and fallow your quarry, zig in and out of crowds, keep an eye out for your hunter, have a weapon, have a change of clothes to confuse your hunter, bribe the officers, and kill them all HAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, this game is great!			"

												Summary: A unique, but flawed game with a very comical style.Cheapest price: $1 in bundles from time to time. $5 when on sale (as of 12/2014).Pros:-The hunt game mode is unique and works quite well. You're on a mad chase to find your quarry, but you're also on the lookout for your hunter. This idea was later copied by Bloody Good Time (this game's spiritual sequel) and Assassin's Creed, but I believe this is the original. Once the first kill occurs, a timer counts down until the end of the round, then the cycle repeats.-The stealth system works well. Pulling out a weapon or attacking someone in front of a guard sends you to jail immediately. Getting seen by other players starts a timer that will get you arrested in a few seconds once you pull out a weapon, with the timer being shorter if more players are watching you. This often forces you to wait for your quarry to go somewhere quiet before you can attack.-Player interactions on multiplayer servers are always fun. You're usually on edge for your hunter, so many of the players are aggressively defensive, resulting in awkward and hilarious encounters. You learn to fake people out to keep suspicion low, similar to multiplayer survival games (although there's no voice chat). You get good at distinguishing bots from human players and plan accordingly.-Maps are well designed and memorable. Most of the maps are built for arcade-style games, rather than focusing on realism, and the best way to get good at the game is to memorize the maps and spawn locations. Each map has authentic music from the 1900s-1920s (roughly) which gets stuck in your head after awhile. Also, there are secret rooms and passages which are fun to find.-The animations and sound design are.... interesting. The way people yelp and react when you hit them with household junk is hilarious when coupled with the pretentious period music playing in the background.Cons:-The master server is permanently broken, so the in-game server browser doesn't work. Use the ""View"" tab, then ""Servers"" on Steam to join multiplayer games. This alone probably turns many people away when they don't see any games. However, there's probably an average of 30-50 people online at most times, peaking during the evenings in the US.-Some of the mechanics are dated and clunky. Your inventory is a mess to keep track of, and the way you can assign numbers to weapons is more trouble than its worth. Moving money in or out of the bank is slow and clunky. Looking at the map to track your quarry down takes too much time. Other mechanics such as paying money in the sickbay to heal yourself (you can't see your health), paying off guards for info or to ignore crimes (very effective if a guard is nearby),  and changing clothes to disguise yourself (not worth the time - just keep running) feel half-baked.-The needs system is excessive. You have eight needs: sleep, poop, pee, eat, drink, social, cleanliness, and excitement. Eight is a little excessive, and it's honestly often easier to get yourself killed and have them reset than to worry about them.-Winning an online game is too dependent on getting kills with high-paying weapons. After several rounds, the money-for-kills on most weapons goes up significantly. At this point finding the highest-paying weapons is crucial. Your needs and your hunter don't really matter, so long as you kill your quarry before you die. The jail fines, death penalties, and innocent kills fines aren't high enough to deter focused players from doing these things.-There's not very many good players in multiplayer. Of the 30-50 people you'll find online, maybe 10 at most are actually experienced. I probably win 50% of the time I play on any server, simply because I've played the game so much.-The other game modes besides hunt are dead. Back in 2006-2008 when the game was new you could find a server or two with deathmatch and VIP. Now you're almost always stuck with hunt.-The publisher doesn't have a license to edit the game, so the game essentially is going to stay in its current state indefinitely.Overall, a good but flawed game that is worth a few bucks if you want online multiplayer. If someone named ""Cough"" kills you, that's me.			"

												Honestly, it's a game that appeals to a very certain group.Basically, broken down into catagories: The Good: -Fun game to play with friends, though primarily you need to have more than 4 friends or it gets old real fast on finding out who's who in the murderer/victim fastion. -Most Servers have bots to liven up slow gameplay, so this isn't usually a problem.-Straightforward gameplay with only a few occasional camera/guard glitches in being detected.-The graphics are smooth, and ran on my old toaster. No issues with lag unless map's changing soon.-There's usually a shiv in the prison. Shank time 2k16.-I beat someone to death with a manniquen leg and got like $10,000. The ""Bad"":-The server system is indirect and clunky, relying on server connections through the steam client itself. It was more of a mystery to me to figure out how to get into servers with friends than it was actually finding out that the sketchy looking guy following me down a hallway was trying to pull out an umbrella to bludgeon me with.-The game is nigh impossible to play without at least 3-4 people on the server. Even then it's predictable and repetitive. For max game play experience, be sure to join a game with bots.-Sometimes the controls (i.e. opening closets, doors, etc) can glitch out and leave you stuck a doorframe until someone beats you to death. This is used more than once to block people into a room.-""Autoban"" features on most servers if your money drops too low. This is also inconvenient when you just have a really bad round. Overall, I'd say wait until it's on sale to actually purchase it. I received this as a gift from a friend, who I enjoy playing it with in our group, but standalone or on your own is somewhat unpleasant with the thin presence of other players. Suggested because the game is complete and playable, but be warned that going in this one alone might now be the experience you're expecting, especially since most people will have to google search how to join a server in the first place.

												This game is not given enough credit, partially due to the lack of online multiplayer. LAN multiplayer is, however, surprisingly fun. There are some issues with the bots and certain gameplay modes causing the game to crash, but the main Deathmatch-like mode is fine on most maps. I recommend playing this with more than two players, though, as that gets old after a while.			"

The traps sound fun in theory but in practice you'll just be shooting or stabbing your prey most of the time.

												I had no idea I didn't leave a review on this before - but better late than never! I'll just start by saying, in short, that this is genuinely the most unique, fantastic and fun Source game you'll find!This Source remake of the GoldSrc version of The Ship is an incredible one at that - not only was the free, GoldSrc version a unique concept, but this just adds to that in the greatest way possible. Whilst it's now, disappointingly, quite a dead game, it's still incredibly fun with bots and when, if you manage to convince, you pull friends along just to murder them!It's a rather casual game as opposed to TF2 or CS:GO, whilst Source has been known to have a very specific style to train for, The Ship is really easy to learn and gives you the pleasure of enjoying the engine even if you're not good at shooting or fighting in general as this game, obviously, isn't meant for constant fighting!I recommend the hell out of this - it's genuinely one of my top favourite games and has a brilliant structure to it, earning itself high marks simply due to this! Overall the gameplay and the theme it sets is definitely worth your while and can be enjoyed by even the simplest of players!			"

The multiplayer is definitely the better part of the game, as it gives you more of that thrill of being hunted while still trying to get your kill.

												If there ever was a Cluedo game where you picked your murder weapon, your persona and a murder location. It would be Kill Doctor Lucky. But if it had to be a video game, The Ship: Murder Party would be down right on the money. Where do you even begin with this game? You are a passenger on a ship, with a little Assassin's Creed mark in your lower right corner, and a Ship to scour for weapons, enviromental kills and other fun things you can do to your friends in this multiplayer experience.And while it might not seem at all proper to pipe someone's head in with this neatly convinient pipewrench you found in the highly restricted engine room, there are at least one other person out and about trying to do the same to you. All in an attempt to satisfy a masked figure who won't let you off the boat until you scored a high amount of money. How to get money? Well murder in creative ways, use non-traditional weapons. Nobody loves a serial killer with trademarks on this boat though, so out you go to find more weapons. Perhaps that big pot you saw down in the kitchen could bear down on this elderly woman's neck when she looks over to get the waiter's attention?All is tongue-in-cheek crazy and the visual tone of the game gives it the 'innocence' it deserves. And there is nothing better walking past an enemy you thought was a bystander to hear an unmistaken click of a revolver. Great game, preferably play it with friends if you can get away with it, the 4 player pack is worth every cent/penny and allows for massive entertainment. The Ship: Murder Party definately delivers.			"

												Absolutely a blast to play and one of the best multiplayer experiences out there. The Ship: Murder Party is a little bit Sims, and a little bit Assassins Creed. The combination of the two provides an interesting balance between hunting your prey, avoiding your stalker, and ensuring that you use the bathroom when you need to. It's an enjoyable, and relatively easy going play experience that allows players to take part in a murder mystery dinner part of sorts, though it's far more chaotic. For those unsure of what The Ship is, it's this summed up in bullet points:~You  recieve a target to kill.~If you kill your target you receive money based on the item you perform the kill with.~If you get X money you win the game.~If you attack with a weapon in such a way as you are seen by ship's personel, or similar you'll be arrested and fined a certain amount~The game continues in quick, several minute rounds, until someone has earned enough money, or the map changes.Very fun, though a little chaotic when playing with large numbers of players. Recommended.			"

												Personal Rating: 7/10This game is fun, however what would be more fun is if people actually played the game still. I mean, trading cards were added which is great for me as I like to craft the badges, but how many players did that honestly SHIP in. There are a variety of weapons, outfits and items to choose from that can kill and maim your shipmates, from Frying Pan to Flare Gun, you can pretty much use anything to your advantage.If you have a few friends that would like to play this game, then you can get it pretty cheap in the sales now-a-days and set up your own server. I did it a while back and we had hours of fun. Of course, to stick a twist on the endless murders, you need to keep yourself alive and cater to your basic needs such as sleeping, showering, eating and talking to people. The simplest of tasks become so tense as anyone can just sneak up on you while you shower and blow your face off with a shotgun.So, should you buy this game? If you can get it on the sale, sure, but if you're buying it for full price then be prepared to be dissapointed at the lack of players. You could always play the single-player though which is fun...			"

												I feel like The Ship is a diamond in the rough. It is definitely some of the most fun I've had playing online.This game may be old, but it's gameplay modes are so simple yet so fun to play. The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.The maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.Honestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.When you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends. If that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will.You should play this game.			"

												The story (more or less):The Ship puts you in an interesting scenario; You and several other cheapskates have been lured onto a luxary cruise liner, the bait being that it was free. The downside becomes apparent when your benefactor, Mr. X, announces that you are now all captive and part of his ship-board entertainment, which is basically a huge game of cat and mouse whilst looking after your characters basic needs, sims-style. Each person is given a target to murder, but also has someone after them as well. There is a plethora of various items scattered around the ship that can be used to kill your quarry, some giving higher cash prizes for a kill than others, depending on Mr. X's mood... but beware, for you are being hunted as well.Gameplay:Story mode is linear and....er... that's about all I picked up. We're all here for the multiplayer after all! (Moving on)Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, especially with friends or people you know. Finding a server within the game is next to impossible... due to them being shut down, but search via steam and you get a good few active ones at any time. The organic feel of roaming around, trying to find your quarry whilst simultaniously trying to avoid every other person in case they want to whop you over the head with an umbrella or frying pan is very fun. You collect money from killing your quarry, dropped wallets/purses and killing your hunter before they kill you. You can, however, loose it quite fast as well. Carry too much cash around and someone can kill you and steal a large portion of it. Get caught with a weapon out or in a restricted area and you can be fined and jailed for a set time. (Get caught with half an armory in your coat and your money will vanish in an instant). So you need to keep moving and save all your money in the bank right? Wrong. You can do that, but you need to buy food, drink, new clothes to disguise yourself and bribe guards to look the other way for a bit to gain the advantage.This game is great, organic, sneaky, hilarious, stalking fun. Murder someone on the toilet or while they take a nap, trap someone in a room and wait until they starve to death while you eat crisps on the other side of the door. It's an old game with it's fair share of small problems, but for the (at least) 3 copies you get for the price, it is awesome!			"

												Very similar to (although much better than) its cartoony sequel, ""Bloody Good TIme"".The Ship is an old game now, but still plays well and is worth picking up in the sales or a game bundle.  It's a murder party which takes place on a variety of ocean cruise liners, set some time between the wars.  The atmosphere is spot-on.  You're given a target to hunt for and, in turn, you are being hunted by one other (undisclosed) passengers.  You first have to find one of a large variety of weapons to do the deadly deed, then track-down your quarry, fool them into thinking they are not your target and find a safe place to despatch them, but away from the ship's crew and security cameras (in the 1920s ?!) or you'll get caught and put in jail for a while before re-joining the game with all your posessions gone (but there's a hidden shank in the prison!).  You have to do all this while balancing your normal bodily needs of eating, bathing, going to the toilet, reading, interacting with other people etc. and avoiding getting murdered yourself!  Great concept and it works very well, if you can find a populated server, which is the main challange!Very Important: the in-game browser does not work any more to find internet games (which you will want to do - don't bother with the single-player game).  Instead, go the the main menu of Steam, ""View"", then ""Servers"" and filter the search results for ""The Ship"" (you'll also want to tick ""has users playing"" in the browser).  There are still people playing if you look at the right time (e.g. peak hours or weekends).The same trick also works for findings online games with the sequel,  BGT.			"

												I'd recommend you play this while using a vocal chat client, it definitely makes it more fun.  Also, don't play on a tablet.  There are elements introduced in The Ship not utilized on other games of this genre - the law enforcement and disquise aspects keep everyone guessing.  It's a lot of fun, so don't judge the game by appearance alone.			"

												First of all, I've played this for at least 100 hours on an older and different account. I saw it cheap during the summersale, so I decided to pick it up incase someone else would.The Ship is a game about killing, or to be killed. The array of weapons is enourmus, not to speak of hidden ways to kill (Locking them into a freezer!). The map designed is amazing, there's secret passages and stashes you can use to fool less knowing players and while some might seem a bit small - the majority are unique and good in their own way. The game has a very special early 1900's theme to it, with fitting music playing in the background and visuals to go along with it. That said, neither the audio or art design is state of the art. (It is pretty old by now.) However, it all goes together in a sort of cartoony' but bloody murder party.As for the game, it is divided up into three different downloads. Previously The Ship and The Ship Singleplayer have been separate, but now they're two in one. The Ship is the main multiplayer game where the most fun is to be had. The Ship Singleplayer is as it sounds the games singleplayer campaign. The whole story is rather weak however, but it's great to play for variation and to learn the game. (Which I honestly think they had in mind.) The Ship Tutorial is as it sounds - a tutorial.A.t.m. I am playing this relatively alone. There's in general filled servers you can join (Use the steam server browser, the one IG is broken!) and the community, although small is in general mature and friendly. That said, in order to get the most out of the game you should play it as a Co-Op title with a voice chat program like Skype, mumble, etc.For its price, especially during sales when it goes as far as 80% off; it's totally worth. Even just playing on public servers alone or with a friend.Great game, can't wait for the HD remake next year.Edit:There seems to be SOME instabilities this time around. Most likely this is because of the aging source engine, however it's been nothing major. Crashing just before smashing someones head in with an umbrella is frustrating, but it's definitely still worth the price. I have not myself had problems at all running the game, rather it's run smoothly after turning off VSync and limiting the framerate. It's up to each individual to decide how major this is, but IMO it's still a great game.			"

												It's sad this game doesn't have a huge playerbase anymore. Last time I played, it only had a few servers with one or two players in it.THE REVIEW: I have played this game for two hours on this account, but at a friends I have logged a few more (I didn't buy the game until recently during a sale). It's a friggin fun game to play against your buddies, or against randoms. Trying to actually go about and eat, drink, shower, sleep, bathroom, etc while trying to kill someone is always awesome. The game gives you more points for killing someone with a non-typical weapon (umbrella, hammer, fish, etc) instead of a gun or bomb. They also have getting arrested, and security cameras, so killing someone can get pretty tricky (hell, you can ever kill someone while in jail). It's a really fun game. I would normally recommend it, and I do, but it's sad it doesn't have a lot of people playing it anymore. If you bought it now, you'd probably be disappointed with the lack of playerbase.			"

												Strangely addicting, since a friend gifted it to me a few weeks back I've clocked up an absolutely absurd amount of hours on it - at least for someone who doesnt really class themselves as a ""gamer"". Basic idea is a hunt, you hunt someone down and try and kill them with a weapon that will give you the most money for the kill - all whilst you are being hunted by someone else. Sounds simple but is alot of fun.			"

												One of my favs your goal is to gain either the money goal in the server or to have the most money in the server you do so bye murderering your quarry stated at the bottom right of the screen killing your target gets you money but killing those that are not your quarry will result in money loss the money you get is dependent on the money the object used is worth calculated by the last time it was used so for example you kill someone with a blunderbuss the next time you kill someone instead of getting lets say $2000 you get $100 but if you leave something alone for a long time you will see that the money from $2000 will be something higher like $8000 if you buy it youll probably ask WHERE ARE THE SERVERS which you actually have to go to steam client - view - servers - the ship and in short GET THIS GAME			"

												Strangely addicting, since a friend gifted it to me a few weeks back I've clocked up an absolutely absurd amount of hours on it - at least for someone who doesnt really class themselves as a ""gamer"". Basic idea is a hunt, you hunt someone down and try and kill them with a weapon that will give you the most money for the kill - all whilst you are being hunted by someone else. Sounds simple but is alot of fun.			"

												The bizarre lovechild of Clue and Garry's Mod's Trouble in Terrorist Town mode. You get your quarry, you find them, you kill them with a large assortment of weapons, simple as that.The 1920's aesthetic really highlights the unadulterated 21st Century rage when you find out that asshat standing behind you was trying to kill you this whole time.

												One of my favs your goal is to gain either the money goal in the server or to have the most money in the server you do so bye murderering your quarry stated at the bottom right of the screen killing your target gets you money but killing those that are not your quarry will result in money loss the money you get is dependent on the money the object used is worth calculated by the last time it was used so for example you kill someone with a blunderbuss the next time you kill someone instead of getting lets say $2000 you get $100 but if you leave something alone for a long time you will see that the money from $2000 will be something higher like $8000 if you buy it youll probably ask WHERE ARE THE SERVERS which you actually have to go to steam client - view - servers - the ship and in short GET THIS GAME			"

												It's sad this game doesn't have a huge playerbase anymore. Last time I played, it only had a few servers with one or two players in it.THE REVIEW: I have played this game for two hours on this account, but at a friends I have logged a few more (I didn't buy the game until recently during a sale). It's a friggin fun game to play against your buddies, or against randoms. Trying to actually go about and eat, drink, shower, sleep, bathroom, etc while trying to kill someone is always awesome. The game gives you more points for killing someone with a non-typical weapon (umbrella, hammer, fish, etc) instead of a gun or bomb. They also have getting arrested, and security cameras, so killing someone can get pretty tricky (hell, you can ever kill someone while in jail). It's a really fun game. I would normally recommend it, and I do, but it's sad it doesn't have a lot of people playing it anymore. If you bought it now, you'd probably be disappointed with the lack of playerbase.			"

												Though the game's graphics may be outdated today, I honestly think you should still get this game, it's a boat load of fun and the very unique gameplay will make you keep coming back even to just play with some bots. Since this game is rather old now, it comes with 2 Steam gifts of the Ship bundle (Single player and The Ship), so if you and a group of friends wanted to play together, a couple of you buy it and gift the rest of them and one of them could host a server. The single player is also fun. It's not amazing, it's rather tedious, actually. But, despite that it's still a lot of fun,  and I think you shouldn't overlook it.Anyways, I think the ship is worth getting and it's a whole lot of fun. I'd definently suggest to anyone.			"

												The Ship is one of the most layered and unique multiplayer games I've ever played (there is single player but this is best experienced with friends). It's a hunter style game where each player has a target and at least one player targeting them. The catch is you only have the name of your target and where they were last seen and you have no idea who's targeting you. You travel around the map collecting all sorts of strange weapons, each with a kill value attached (based on ease of use and how many kills have been made with it), trying to find your target by talking to the other players and bots, any of which could be looking for you. You can begin to see why this game is so tense. Once a player has been killed everyone else has a limited time to try and get their kill before the next round starts.This is just the base layer though. On top of that you have to be careful where you kill your prey, as they're are guards and security cameras that will instantly take you to jail if you brandish a weapon in their site. Also committing a murder in front of to many player witnesses will have you serving time and paying a fee. If that wasn't enough, you also have to manage a number of The Sims-esque statuses. You have to eat and drink, use the bathroom and shower, participate in leisure activity, get enough social interaction, and most terrifying, sleep. All of these are tied into your actions, if you sprint you get hungry, thirsty, and tired. If you go to the bathroom your need to clean goes up, etc. If any of these aspects max out, you die.All of this makes for a deep experience, lots of hilarious exchanges, and tense standoffs and hunts. The biggest issue is setting up and getting connected to multiplayer games. The in-game master server list is broken but you can look up guides for selecting a server before launching a game. For private games Steam does include a dedicated server tool or you can do what I did and set-up a VPN and play as a LAN game. Whatever route you take it is worth the effort.Also of note: buying this is essentially buying 5 copies of the game. You get one and 2 gifts. The people that receive those gift copies each get one additional gift copy. Coordinate with your friends and the base price is less than five dollars a copy. If you find it on sale then the price per copy can drop to under a dollar a piece.			"

You are a passenger on a ship, with a little Assassin's Creed mark in your lower right corner, and a Ship to scour for weapons, enviromental kills and other fun things you can do to your friends in this multiplayer experience.And while it might not seem at all proper to pipe someone's head in with this neatly convinient pipewrench you found in the highly restricted engine room, there are at least one other person out and about trying to do the same to you. All in an attempt to satisfy a masked figure who won't let you off the boat until you scored a high amount of money. How to get money? Well murder in creative ways, use non-traditional weapons. Nobody loves a serial killer with trademarks on this boat though, so out you go to find more weapons. Perhaps that big pot you saw down in the kitchen could bear down on this elderly woman's neck when she looks over to get the waiter's attention?All is tongue-in-cheek crazy and the visual tone of the game gives it the 'innocence' it deserves. And there is nothing better walking past an enemy you thought was a bystander to hear an unmistaken click of a revolver. Great game, preferably play it with friends if you can get away with it, the 4 player pack is worth every cent/penny and allows for massive entertainment. The Ship: Murder Party definately delivers.			"

Very simple to jump into -- hosted a game and friends on the LAN saw it immediately, no opening of ports or closing of firewalls or any of that nonsense.

Winning by killing your prey and watching out for your hunter. And the dynamics are easy to understand, and the maps are very interactive. You have needs and responisbillites in this game, such as eating and going to the bathroom, but they are never much annoying. All the different weapons are fun to try out and I never get bored.			"

												The story (more or less):The Ship puts you in an interesting scenario; You and several other cheapskates have been lured onto a luxary cruise liner, the bait being that it was free. The downside becomes apparent when your benefactor, Mr. X, announces that you are now all captive and part of his ship-board entertainment, which is basically a huge game of cat and mouse whilst looking after your characters basic needs, sims-style. Each person is given a target to murder, but also has someone after them as well. There is a plethora of various items scattered around the ship that can be used to kill your quarry, some giving higher cash prizes for a kill than others, depending on Mr. X's mood... but beware, for you are being hunted as well.Gameplay:Story mode is linear and....er... that's about all I picked up. We're all here for the multiplayer after all! (Moving on)Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, especially with friends or people you know. Finding a server within the game is next to impossible... due to them being shut down, but search via steam and you get a good few active ones at any time. The organic feel of roaming around, trying to find your quarry whilst simultaniously trying to avoid every other person in case they want to whop you over the head with an umbrella or frying pan is very fun. You collect money from killing your quarry, dropped wallets/purses and killing your hunter before they kill you. You can, however, loose it quite fast as well. Carry too much cash around and someone can kill you and steal a large portion of it. Get caught with a weapon out or in a restricted area and you can be fined and jailed for a set time. (Get caught with half an armory in your coat and your money will vanish in an instant). So you need to keep moving and save all your money in the bank right? Wrong. You can do that, but you need to buy food, drink, new clothes to disguise yourself and bribe guards to look the other way for a bit to gain the advantage.This game is great, organic, sneaky, hilarious, stalking fun. Murder someone on the toilet or while they take a nap, trap someone in a room and wait until they starve to death while you eat crisps on the other side of the door. It's an old game with it's fair share of small problems, but for the (at least) 3 copies you get for the price, it is awesome!			"

												Personal Rating: 7/10This game is fun, however what would be more fun is if people actually played the game still. I mean, trading cards were added which is great for me as I like to craft the badges, but how many players did that honestly SHIP in. There are a variety of weapons, outfits and items to choose from that can kill and maim your shipmates, from Frying Pan to Flare Gun, you can pretty much use anything to your advantage.If you have a few friends that would like to play this game, then you can get it pretty cheap in the sales now-a-days and set up your own server. I did it a while back and we had hours of fun. Of course, to stick a twist on the endless murders, you need to keep yourself alive and cater to your basic needs such as sleeping, showering, eating and talking to people. The simplest of tasks become so tense as anyone can just sneak up on you while you shower and blow your face off with a shotgun.So, should you buy this game? If you can get it on the sale, sure, but if you're buying it for full price then be prepared to be dissapointed at the lack of players. You could always play the single-player though which is fun...			"

												This game is like if Clue and The Sims had a baby that was a first person shooter, and that first person shooter baby was injected a high dosage of heroin or steroids. This is a title you wont want to miss, and will most likely lose track of time playing. Highly addictive gameplay mixed with a sense of paranoia and excitement breeds exceptional scenarios that make you think.. How the heck am I going to kill this guy with a paddle bat...The only issue I have with this is that the in game server browser is broken/ has never worked, which can be worked around via an online game server list and enabling console to connect to the servers, which at the moment are HIGHLY POPULATED.TL;DR, Super addicting, needs server browser to work but we just use console and internet server lists.Loogie gives dis game a 8/10, I dun like having no server browser sorry.

												When I find out this game is like 11 or 12 years old I thought it was gonna be terrible. But it's AMAZING. It's got everything you need and I like style and the gameplay like having a target and limited amount of time to kill him AND knowing that someone is targeting you that is just awesome I give this game an A+++.

												Enjoyable party game. Hunt down your target and kill him or her unseen while you avoid being killed by your hunter at the same time. You have no idea who is chasing you and it could be any of the available passengers. It's a multiplayer oriented game. Get it if you have some friends to play with otherwise skip it. The community is dead but there are still servers running, accessible via steam. How to acces the steam servers: Don't start the game. Go to your top left corner in steam and click on View--->Servers---> Change filters to 'The Ship'---> Select a server and connect.			"

												This BARELY got a recommendation, it can be a really great game, but at times it can just suck.The game has three parts, all of which are seperate games in your Steam library:The Ship (the multiplayer mode)The Ship - SingleplayerThe Ship - TutorialI'll start with the latter two.The tutorial goes thru the very basic parts of the game such as item handling, and a lot of the important gameplay stuff is explained by the tutor but never demonstrated. It's a very bare bones tutorial that doesn't really justify being seperate from the main game.The Singleplayer feels a bit like a continuation of the tutorial, it's got a tiny bit of story and hardly anything else to it, just a bunch of ""go from point A to point B and do X"" style objectives. Oh, and I never actually ended up completing it because of a game breaking bug.Overall the singleplayer modes are weak and not really worth installing when you can just find a guide or a video on how to play.The Ship (the multiplayer mode) is a game where you are assigned a quarry, you must kill your quarry in the 90 second time limit. The sillier the weapon you use, the more points you earn from the kill. But be wary, because someone else is hunting you too! Also watch out for the security as if they see you with a weapon you will be arrested.The gameplay can be great fun, it feels very rewarding when you finally hunt down and kill your quarry.The game is not without its issues however, and it has a lot.So far the greatest issue is that the community is pretty much dead, playing on servers might as well just be the same thing as playing a local bot game. (which is nowhere near as fun as with real people)If you can find a way to play with friends then you can have some fun with them, if you manage to get everyone a copy.I realise this is an old game, but it lacks SteamPipe features such as being to setup a lobby in game and have it Just Work without screwing around with server settings and port fowarding.If you manage to port foward then you can host a listen server from the game itself for your friends, you just need to make sure you sv_lan 0 because the server will think it is lan only.With all of that out of the way, time to address the gameplay issues themselves.In this game you have two main classes of weapons, melee and firearms. The melee weapons prove to be hard to kill anyone with as security will arrest you as soon as you pull out a weapon. There's no regenerating health, health can only be regained by eating, which makes melee fights pretty much a case of either who hits first or who has the most health.The firearms are very powerful, but are also hard to come by, you will find yourself looking around trying to find a decent gun as the melee weapons are like pencils in comparison. They have lots of advantages, such as high damage, high fire rate, ability to shoot people who are inside a secured area by standing outside the guard's view, and range in general.Because of this the game tends to have a degree of luck instead of skill, as there are no ramifications for using a firearm like there are Melee weapons.The maps are too small for servers of 32 player, but are also too large for 2-6 players. Even so the time limit is way too short to deal with everything else and trying to find your quarry, which brings me to another part.The needs system. It's meant to add a challenge but ends up just being tedious, there are so many ""needs"" that must be kept satisfied otherwise consequences will occur, ranging from an animation of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants or gaining an army of flies, to dying on the spot.The security guards end up just being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ as they are everywhere and always in the worst places, there needs to be a time limit for how long you can hold a melee weapon for until the guard notices (which will be interrupted by attempting to swing the weapon of course), as he just notices instantly and you get thrown in prison.Prison is also know to be abused by people after they've killed someone to avoid being killed by their hunter.Overall it's a fun game to play with the right people, people who don't play seriously and just kill everyone completely ruin the game. If you can find a good bunch of people who are able to play seriously enough to not be a nuicance then I can safely recommend this game as it can be loads of fun (even with its flaws), if you're just looking for some multiplayer games to play then move along, this game's public multiplayer is dead.

												Kill your target without detecting by guards, cameras and witnessed by civillians. That seems simple but the game itself really full of fun. Also there is a singleplayer campaign and bot-match option except multiplayer.But there is a problem about multiplayer: when you try to join a server, it pops out a message that says ""Error verifying STEAM UserID ticket."" I tried many things but i couldn't get over it. Other multiplayer Source-powered games i have runs well.Last thing: i don't know that still in effect while you reading this, but when you buy one, you get one spare copy.

												Simple but fun, awesome to play with friends.Let me just write down some excerpts from gameplay with my friend Nick that we busted out laughing from.My target is Nick, I pull out a sword to kill him and he pulls one out to defend himself. We both get arrested and sent to jail.Nick: good thing they took all your weapons, now you can't get me.Meanwhile I find a shiv in my cell and go out to have ""lunch"" in the cell room with him. I stand up and look at himMe: Now Nick, it's best we get this over with before you get out on parole *pulls out knife and chases him into the showers*I die and my target is Nick again.Me: Nick, grab my weapons off my body. They're expensive D:Later we go to a ""safe"" spot for him to give them to me but he gets arrested so I wait outside the jailcell until he gets out.Me: Who are you looking for?Nick: Someone named Ferdinand.Me: Oh, I saw her go this way! Follow me.Nick: ...Ferdinand is a dude...Needless to say I did not kill him that time since he caught onto me.I would rate this game a 7/10, great party game but kind of bland when playing by yourself with people you don't know. Best if you get everyone you know with mics into a voice chat lobby like curse or mumble!			"

												This game is great.It's one-of-a-kind with its play style that combines suspense and tactics with a first person shooter. Well, I say 'shooter' - you'll probably spend more time rooting through cabinets and suitcases or clubbing people in the face than you will actually shooting.If you've got this far, you'll probably understand the basic idea of the game; you have to hunt someone whilst being hunted. But it's not just that. You also have to stay out of jail, keep on top of money and look after yourself by going to the toilet, having a bite to eat or taking a nap every now and then, and all of this takes place in a maze of similar-looking corridoors filled with falling lifeboats and lunatics who want to kill you with a letter opener. If it weren't for the viewable map, the game would simply be filled with passengers constantly dying of thirt whilst searching for a bar at which you can buy some life-saving beer. And all of this is outside the main purpose, which is to stay on top of the leaderboard. To do that, you've got to search for a weapon that'll give you a good amount of money for your kill, before hunting down and slaughtering your quarry within the time limit - whichever deck they happen to be on. Whilst all of that's happening, you're trying to work out which of the random people you bump into is going to brutally murder you, which will undoubtedly lead to you carefully backing away from, or pulling a gun on, any person who looks remotely suspicious, despite their totally innocent intentions (murdering somebody who isn't you).tl;drI impaled a man with a set of knitting needles because he looked at my funny, and you will, too.9/10 (one point lost because of issues finding servers)			"

												Well then. My first experience was a single player match as in i couldn't figure out how to join a multiplayer game. I was on some tropical island restore dock thing which isn't really a ship to begin with but whatever. I spawned to find out i was a skinny looked to be starving black women. I grabbed a pot out of the kitchen to go after the man i was supposed to kill. I then promptly fell into the water and got eaten alive by piranhas.10/10			"

												""The Ship"" is a thrilling mystery murder game. Passengers are on a boat, and paid assassins but use what they can find around them to eliminate their target. If desperate, even a mannequin arm can be used to take out the assassin's target. Players can play as a hunter or a passenger. As a passenger, you can aid in security by performing a citizen's arrest on those you find to be suspicious. All in all, this is a fantastic game of wit and skill, similar to source mod, trouble in terrorist town.			"

												Getting a server hosted for this can be an issue at first, but if you manage to figure it out, you have access to a hidden gem. A rather odd but nifty combo of covertly detouring your target somewhere away from the prying eyes of security and fellow members of the cruise, keeping a keen eye on what items will grant you the most valuable kills, and all the while making sure to keep your money safe and your personal needs satisfied. Imagine elements of The Sims thrown into Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer... on a cruise. Odd thought.Get a big group of friends together for the inevitable arguments, screams over wallet bombs, and hasty searching through prison bedside drawers for the one shank available. You can even decide to play with World Leaders. Who would win in a fight: Margaret Thatcher with a frying pan, or Ronald Reagan with a croquet mallet? Don't mind Tony Blair, he just got shot by Saddam Hussein with a flare gun. Enjoy!			"

												Now this is interesting. For all intents and purposes, this is a first-person interpretation of Steve Jackson's ""Killer"" live action game, but set in a tighter environment and with more weapon variety. With that in mind it even has shades of the excellent pre-murder-mystery game ""Kill Doctor Lucky"".Now, you might think that a game that, intentionally or not, reflects these other sources may be a bit derivative, but it really isn't. Indeed it is a particularly refreshing thing to be playing, not quite as frenetic as the FPS games out there, but lacking the long-term sense of digging in that the survival games have. It really does sit nicely in its niche and seems likely to occupy those periods where I need a quick blast of multi-player gaming that requires the use of my rarely deployed sense of deviousness.Graphically it isn't amazing, but it is still certainly appealing and a good job is done setting the different shipboard environments. more than anything though, this game is probably going to generate a lot of anecdotal moments and that is increasingly rare these days.Sure, the graphics aren't top notch, the sound is atmospheric but not rich and the environments are not sprawling (and this is a good thing), but what we have is a great little self-contained game that deserves ongoing attention. Well worth the price of admission.			"

It is a guilty pleasure, it’s very tense for those actually vying to win the match; nothing comes close to explaining the thrill of tracking and finding your quarry…and murdering them in an unsuspecting manner..Each round you are given a name of a person you must assassinate using random weapons you find (which have different $ rewards), all while keeping an eye open for a person who is doing the same: hunting you.  The maps are deep and intricate, they really put effort and care into this game.  There are secret passages to sneak and escape, you can bribe officers to turn a blind eye, and you can steam people to death, explosives, firearms...I mean come on its awesome.There are also other types of gameplay like Teams and Deathmatch; there’s also a seasonal Christmas version of maps too.As aforementioned by others, a big beef is the lack of players, but when you get a good server its truly an amazing treat, sometimes you gotta wait for other parts of the world to log on (RUS & AUS I’m talking to you, get more players!).

												This is a highly entertaining game. I had never heard of it til I saw it on the Nov 14 Steam sale. It was cheap and sounded good.  My friends and I love playing (LAN multi only, online is no longer supported).  Basically everyone is an assassin and each person tries to kill their target without getting busted by the fuzz.  Controls are dead simple. It's even better when you don't know which character your opponents are controlling. I think it is a shame that the complete pack no longer has the gift copies (due to lack of gifting). Luckily (for my friends) the bonus was still in effect when I bought mine (amazing deal really when you consider it had 4 EXTRA copies)! And none are being wasted! Only wish we had heard of it sooner (maybe we could have kept online going),			"

												Yes and no. Yes if you don't mind playing over LAN (which is, thankfully, not an ordeal to make work) but no if you expect to play this online. It doesn't work online, none of the fixes that have been offered work any longer (Direct IP connection, Steam Server List, Console Commands) if they ever did to begin with, although there are some public servers put up by a blessed few that seem to work don't expect to be customizing your private game. Further, the publisher stated they were unwilling to purchase the development rights to the game, meaning there will be no patch.The game itself is exactly how it advertises itself, it's a game of discreet MURDER put on by a Victorian era madman, this doesn't go as far as Clue levels of mystery which is a bit of a shame but it is a fun Cat and Mouse game... of MURDER. The enviornments are lovingly crafted, the game engine is functional with its wacky bits only complementing the wacky nature of the game, and the game balance allows for both a back and forth AND instant death.Camping isn't much of a problem in the game, not only due to the need to kill your target but also because your character will need to read books and piddle from time to time or they will die, like a chihuahua. Killing everyone you meet isn't so smart, either, likely because you will be seen with so much murdering, and because you quickly lose the game due to point loss. With these two issues countered there shouldn't be much to worry you about game balance.			"

												Yes and no. Yes if you don't mind playing over LAN (which is, thankfully, not an ordeal to make work) but no if you expect to play this online. It doesn't work online, none of the fixes that have been offered work any longer (Direct IP connection, Steam Server List, Console Commands) if they ever did to begin with, although there are some public servers put up by a blessed few that seem to work don't expect to be customizing your private game. Further, the publisher stated they were unwilling to purchase the development rights to the game, meaning there will be no patch.The game itself is exactly how it advertises itself, it's a game of discreet MURDER put on by a Victorian era madman, this doesn't go as far as Clue levels of mystery which is a bit of a shame but it is a fun Cat and Mouse game... of MURDER.

If you recieve it as a gift, you also get a free copy to gift)Points of Interest-Comedic and silly gameplay, and a great casual or competitive game-People may say the online community is dead, because the in-game server browser is broken and they don't know better. To actually connect to an online game: Open the steam client and go to View > Servers > The Ship-The Single Player mode is not nearly as fun, but can be interesting.			"

												This game is just brilliant to play with a group of friends! Sure, the servers are lacking players but I find it more suspenseful when there are fewer players fighting on a massive ship. Basically, this game is like the sims (In that you need to keep your character sociable, well fed & hygienic) mixed with the ability to beat the hell out of other people with canes, umbrellas etc. The ability to throw a weapon is also such a laugh, you can run away from your pursuer sure, but more often than not that just means that they're going to throw a fire axe straight into the back of your head. The good: - Can wear kilts- Can find tommy guns in bedroom drawers (Easy there Michael Corleone) - Can get brutally murdered in the shower/ in your sleep/ while urinating!- There are many different ship maps to play on. (Each map is quite unique) - Range of weapons ranging from a simple umbrella to a winchester rifle :O- The element of suspense (Sure, it's a cartoony game, but when people are chasing you, oh god...)- Requires some form of strategy - The need to find your target & then take them out without any witnesses.- There is a lot of interaction within the game (As stated before, it is like the sims in some ways) - Range of game modes - Elimination, Deathmatch (Just a few examples) & the team varieties. - Well worth the money (Just a decent pick up and play game for the casual gamer)The bad:- Sometimes when the game indicates that there are no nearby witnesses, you get arrested out of the blue. - Going to prison within the game can be a traumatic experience (Don't drop the soap!) - Doesn't seem to be a mode in which you can just kill everyone freely at your leisure (Not good for those who are insane and itching to commit mass murder)The ugly: - The graphics (Don't worry, they don't ruin the fun or the tension of the game) So as you can tell, the game is pretty good. Sure, it isn't amazing, but it isn't to be expected from such a low budget game. However, there can be a lot of funny moments within the game when playing with friends especially. For example, a friend of mine was like 'You come in this room and i'll kill you' to which I merely shot him through the window with my tommy gun. Like I actually needed to go into the room... ;) If you're looking for a game to pick up and play whenever you feel like chasing people with an axe like a rapid lumberjack, this is the game for you!

												This is a highly entertaining game. I had never heard of it til I saw it on the Nov 14 Steam sale. It was cheap and sounded good.  My friends and I love playing (LAN multi only, online is no longer supported).  Basically everyone is an assassin and each person tries to kill their target without getting busted by the fuzz.  Controls are dead simple. It's even better when you don't know which character your opponents are controlling. I think it is a shame that the complete pack no longer has the gift copies (due to lack of gifting). Luckily (for my friends) the bonus was still in effect when I bought mine (amazing deal really when you consider it had 4 EXTRA copies)! And none are being wasted! Only wish we had heard of it sooner (maybe we could have kept online going),			"

												EDIT: Blazing Griffin has now announced that they are making an HD remake of The Ship. I understand that some people may want to wait and buy that version. But if you love classics and originals, this version is still definitely worth it.The Ship holds a special place in my heart for many reasons. There's a lot to love: The numerous game modes, the strategy and suspence, the humor (if blowing people up on the toilet is your sort of thing). Looking at the game from a non-biased, technical point of view, yeah, there are flaws. The graphics are a bit dated, and every once and a while there are render glitches. But those two flaws are easily ignored, especially the graphics, which in my opinion suit the game very well. If you're looking for a fun game, or strategy, or controversy (World Leaders game modes), or just plain bashing heads in with umbrellas, this game is for you.			"

												So, this game. The Ship: Murder Party. A ""Murder mystery"" set on a 1920's cruise ship. Very reminiscent of TTT(Trouble in Terrorist Town) a gmod game that is also a ""murder mystery""A cartoonish graphical style, time era, and a good atmopshere is somewhere to start with all the good things about this game. Plenty of choice, so diffrent playstyles are possible. Good amount of maps, and it really doesn't get stale ever. There is no ""overpowered"" strategy to win.  Plenty of funny moments to be had. Good fun.However, no game is perfect. There are also plenty of flaws with this game, mostly in bugs and annoying cameras. Or just getting stuck. The UI and inventory are quite clunky aswell.The game overall is quite good for something of it's age I'll say. Give it a 4.5/5.			"

												Just as ""Zombie Panic: Source"" this multiplayer game (there is a singleplayer but I've never played it, it's meant to be a multiplayer title) is more relaxing and fun than most other FPS are. It's not strictly an FPS; though you are playing from the ego-perspective and your goal is to kill your enemies using guns and melee, it has rather simple but gameplay-wise important ""needs"" to be taken care of by the players one may know from life-simulations like ""The Sims"".Each player is assigned a specific player to kill when he spawns. You are given his vague position on the ship. You must find him and kill him within a specific time limit with one of many weapons found on the map. Each weapon gives you a different amount of money on kill. If all people kill with the very easily-and-everywhere-found fire axe they won't get much money. So you search all decks and rooms for more rewarding tools, while you constantly must look out not to get stabbed from behind by the player who is supposed to hunt you (which identity you don't know; there are random player models and you can merely guess who is your hunter by paying attention to the behaviour of the players). At the same time you need to take care of common needs like eating, drinking, sleeping and all - which again makes you vulnerable; of course the same applies to your quarry, so waiting for a good chance to get close to him is important. You also need to avoid security guards, cameras and other players serving as ""witnesses"" - if you don't you are put in the ship jail, losing some money and important time. Sometimes you are lucky/unlucky enough to have your quarry/hunter put in there too; if you find a self-made knife in one of the prison cells that gives you a seldom chance to get rid of him. There are traps on the ships like saunas, lifeboat releases or cooling chambers, but it rarely happens you get to kill your target with those.This basic concept leads to many unique and funny moments. There are other modes like Deathmatch and VIP in which there are two teams who must defend their own VIP and hunt down the one of the opposing team, but those are rarely played. Unfortunately so is the regular hunting mode, because there are almost no servers left to play on. The game was badly advertised and has almost died, if it was ever alive to begin with. There are Steam groups promoting the game and trying to get players to play it, but even that only leads to one or two fully-crowded servers at best.Ubisoft who has or had the rights on the title adapted this hunt-or-be-hunted concept in the Assassin's Creed series. I played the multiplayer of Brotherhood on my PS3 once, and while it was sort of entertaining I didn't get to like it too much. I would still prefer ""The Ship"". A sequel ""Bloody Good Time"" in a hollywood/movies scenario was released, but it doesn't look like Outerlight had much more luck with that. They are no more and the rights on ""The Ship"" apparently went to a company called ""Blazing Griffing"", who intends to produce a sequel called ""The Ship: Full Steam Ahead"" (http://www.blazinggriffin.com/the-ship-full-steam-ahead), but only if they get enough support from ordinary people: You can help them fund their so-called ""Kickstarter"" project here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/709089895/the-ship-full-steam-ahead "

This would be hard finding an optimum server that has low ping and can support your friends aswell, the website http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ should be a primary guide for you to find a server but it has limited servers and many empty ones. Remember before you buy this game it is old, outdated, wont be patched for any bugs you come across but it is extremely fun if you can get over those.			"

												Wouldnt recommend getting, or the remake.You can still get on plenty of servers for the game, but the games mechanics are pretty ♥♥♥♥. You can lock someone in a room, shank them twice and get arrested but people having a brawl in the hallway with letter knives get nothing, makes no sense and the game doesnt bother to explain it either, green eye means OK to kill, red eye means bad, somehow, you're still going to get spotted in a locked room with green eye.

												Very entertaining and good to unwind from fast paced games! I sincerely hope people pick up a copy of this game, though before you do, I must warn:-It doesnt have high end graphics;-The sprint the game is good but how long you can sprint is a bit short;-The game isnt for ahrdcore shooter fans, its basically a cloak and dagger game all about killing silently or out of sigh;-It might bget boring if you don't have friends with the game;However there's a bunch of funs thing, such as the Sims style needs where it makes it interesting how long you can stay hunting and hunted without dying, sleeping or needing to use the bathroom, plus you can also bribe cops to ignore crimes for a small amount of time and also for information, you have an arrawy of weapons and each of them give you a certain amount of cash when you kill with them.BUT OVER AND ALL, its a good game to play with friends!

												A great game with a very unique concept. Not to mention it's quite cheap and comes with 5(!) copies. You are on an early '30 cruise ship and you have to kill a randomly assigned passenger. However, another passenger is also gunning for you. The big twist is that you must kill your target without people noticing. You'll be arrested if you pull out a weapon in front of a crowd. it's like one of those hidden identity type board/card game.  The closest analogy for this game is probably Assassin's Creed multiplayer. Some of the mechanics don't hold up very well when experienced people go full tryhard mode (it's almost like a different game in that case). In-game server browser is also broken. Additionally, a lot of the server are not stress tested at all, (due to low player number) causing unplayable laggy game when there's too many players on a server.This is a great game to play at LAN parties or play with a bunch of friends. I recommend playing with 8 or more players, and without bots. Buy a 5-packs or two, it's cheaper than almost any board game you can buy, and enjoy a great weekend of get away on The Ship.			"

												DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE! THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD! The default in game servers are dead yes. But the game is far from dead. To access the servers just go to view - servers - and then select 'The Ship' in the games tab. The Ship is about a crazy man only known as 'Mr. X' who threatens all the passengers that their families will be killed if they don't play his game. That's where you come in. You will be randomly generated as someone and your task is to find weapons and kill your target. Each weapon will get you a certain amount of money and once the weapon is used...it's borderline useless unless you wish to defend yourself with it. For such a simple game it's pretty in depth. You have needs you must take care of while killing your targets/avoiding your hunters. Which makes it more interesting. You win by having the most money. The amount of kills and deaths do not matter. I got killed many times and came out on top with just one kill with a very high money grabbing weapon in one match.  The two cons to this game are:1. If you don't have a weapon you are completely defenseless. You can't use your hands other than to push.2. People can block you in rooms and hallways making half the game about just trying to move a couple of inches at a time or just waiting for a loser to back away so you can exit through a door. It can get frustrating.Pros (yeah it's weird starting with cons but there was less to say...good thing right?):A cool mix of 'The Sims' and 'Assassins Creed Multiplayer' with a goofy twistA quick jail system for when you get caught (great way to get all your needs done for free in one small area)Diverse weapons""Discovering"" who people are. Talk to them to have an easier time knowing who to kill and where they are.Diverse maps (No there isn't just ship maps. I've been in a blimp map (which was horrible), a house map and a dock/tropical island map)Overall, this game is small but really in depth and addicting. I was gifted this game but I would easily have paid for it. My only original doubt was that the game was dead. And it most certainly isn't. 9/10			"

												I enjoy the way you.....well kill people. Sleeping syringe + scalpel= Happy me. It has a wide array of servers you can join, and then you can proceed to pick up any combination of weapons and outfits in a large assortment of maps. If you like Gmod, then you will like this game. My complaint is that the server list is still broken and you have to kinda guess at which server is good to play on or not. What also sucks is how people can easily kill each other when they arent targets and receive almost no punishment for it.			"

												Crochet mallets, hammers, screwdrivers, umbrellas, blunderbuss or tommy gun. The tools of murder are many. So arm up and set out on the hunt. Watch your back, kill anyone following you too closely and be smart (or die).I really enjoyed this game so far, and I am only a few games in. Best when the server has 10 players, not 32.			"

												I have a very Love/Hate relationship with this game. I love it, my friends hate it, and I hate a few of my friends when they play it. The premise is that you are a passenger on a cruise ship which is taken over by a mystery villain. He declares that each person on the ship will have a target to hunt, and a hunter who's target is them. This means that you are always being stalked by somebody else as you try to outwit your target and kill them, keeping you on your toes. The suspense is only ever ruined when that target happens to find a Blunderbuss and spends the rest of the game hiding in a cabin and blasting anybody who comes near them.My group picked this game up on a good sale and we enjoyed playing it despite the cabin camper in our midst. It was entertaining trying to hunt down our friends and outwit our hunters. But at the end of the day we had a few people who took the game a little too seriously and some hateful words were said. Taken with a lot of salt The Ship is a wonderful game for every now and then. But it's definitely not for everybody.			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 88, I have never touched a cigarette.

This game is rlly a lot of fun and even though i ignored it a bit due to the server not showing issue i have been playing this quite frequently again. Basically you´re given a target wich u need to hunt down while killing it with an object ranging ffrom an umbrella to a machinegun. The idea is to not get caught by the camera's or guards doing it else u will get arrested [wich u can get killed in there as well if ur unlucky] prety simple right? Wrong not only is there a time limit to it but the object u kill the target with based on the object kill list [highest ranked object gives most cash] matters and u have to deal with hunger, thirst, sleep, hygiene and the occasional toilet visits as well to keep ur character from dying. And the biggest treath is that you are beign HUNTED as well :O. So kill ur target and escape from ur killer till timer runs out and gratz u won the first time now try to get on top of the list till u win the whole round] I highly recommend playing the tutorial first as it rlly gives u a idea on how everything works[takes like 10mins max] .  If u can get past that i wil guarantee u will have a fun time wether playing solo or with friends.			"

												After finding this game on sale through Steam for four bucks, the decision to pick it up (along with two free gift copies) was a no-brainer.  It’s a bit like “Clue” in that the mysterious Mr. X has invited a bunch of people to embark on a cruise…but things get ugly when you learn that cash is rewarded to people who manage to murder their targets.  Guards and cameras exist to keep people from going homicidal, as well as a full-fledged jail for anyone caught breaking the rules. On top of being sneaky, you’ll have needs to meet like in “The Sims”…thirst, social, that kind of thing. The game does support AI…in fact the game comes with three different game modes: Tutorial, Single Player, and Multiplayer.  It’s best to try out the tutorial first, followed by the single player. Once you manage to get past those, you’ll find that there are a few in-game modes available: Hunt and Elimination.  Hunt uses a timer to mark the length of rounds while rounds in elimination ends with the last person standing.  It takes getting used to, but overall I found it to be a lot of fun.

												The ship is a very interesting idea for the game. It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.The Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a ""mark"" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost ""stalemate"" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.I expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a ""training area"" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play ""multiplayer except with bots"" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The ""levels"" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to ""role play"" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the ""sprinting"" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called ""sprinting"" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!The tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to ""play"" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.I know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.+GREAT potential in multiplayer+Funny killing animations-Outdated graphics-Annoying mechanics (read review)-Servers not up in-game			"

												I don't get how people stand to play this. It's way too buggy, the hallways can only fit 1 person in 1 direction. And everyone will kill everyone, regardless of whether or not they should. It's not even really stealthy. And there's ""necessities"" like sleeping that are really painfully unnecessary. Hopefully the 'Remasted' version is better.			"

												Whenever I bought this game, I was expecting a game where I WAS the ship, attempting to murder my passengers by ramming into an iceberg at 420 miles per hour. I was disappointed to find that I am instead a passenger attempting to navigate a complicated ship and find my target while sleeping and eating and drinking and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and pooping and reading and talking to people. I never did find out where my ship was going. I am thinking South Africa. This game tests friendships, and ruins them, often. 10/10 would play 23/6			"

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			"

												The game is okay - the multiplayer MASTER SERVER is no longer available and you have to use a different way in order to play multiplayer - Multiplayer can be fun but also frusting on the same time - you have to find items - weapons, disguise, food, stuff like that - most annoyingpart is probaly the blocking by other characters in the game - You have to find your target which is randomly given and you have to kill him.You get money ( which is points and u can buy some food with it) from the kill and the weapon will have effect on how much u get. Usually a weaker weapon grants you more money, but the money keep changing overtime.You have to becareful, you will be a target for someone else too.You can't kill a target if security sees you, or else you will be send in jail.If you are familiar wth THE SIMS, like ""peeing, sleeping,fun"" everything in THE SIMS si also in this game, The idea is nice but its just sad there are no MASTER SERVERS anymore.Graphics is ok for this game. not too HIGH qualityill give this a 6/10			"

												A word of warning for those looking to play this game online. The servers don't show up by default. There are servers but you have to search for them by entering the IP Address under the favorites tab or by using the console.That being said, there is still singleplayer and arcade mode. Arcade mode is simply multiplayer but with bots. The AI isn't that good at hunting though. I've gone whole matches with no deaths and I highly doubt it's MY skill that's keeping me alive but the bot's lack of skill. The game itself has the potential to be fun but, alas, there's just no way to play with anyone else with the servers offline. If new servers ever come online, I imagine there'd be a nice and steady swarm of people lining up to join in.			"

												While the game is more like a hunt and not a murder mystery it is still fun, when someone is killed nobody tries to find out who did it. As nobody cares.... You just need to camp in a room til the person you are trying to kill walks in or someone trying to kill you walks in, or do what I do and run around and kill everyone.

												The tutorial is wonderfully made.A well laid out how to play and suggestions both fro single and multiplayer.Single playerThe storyline was well linked, though I think the map being player oriented would have made it easier to navigate.The quarry was too easy to find to me, and i never encountered my own hunter so it didnt feel so much as a deathmatchMultiplayer/ArcadeArcade mode was the best to me, the NPCs weren't very easy to beat  and made for a better game. Did not appreciate when kept being arrested for pulling out my weapon in an empty bathroom.as for multiplayer i am so disapointed. I live just north of Venezuela and i have no access to any games.Even if i leave all the options open I don't see any online games, nor can find a way to join any games. i bought this games with the sole intent to play online and that is the one thing i cannot do. i have checked on multiple occasions just in case there was maintenance an there is no change at all.

												This is an amazing game with the best multiplayer gameplay I know of. It's also fun to play against computer just because of the A.I.'s stupidity. EXAMPLE TIME! When playing arcade mode (against computer) you will often find A.I. characters crouching down in the middle of a room with their weapon out. They will most likely get caught by police, sent to jail, and get blown up when they get out due to you placing a wallet bomb at the jail exit. *Insert nerd-laugh here*			"

												A wonderful idea for an FPS - you are set to kill a single person, but you have no idea who is out to kill you. However, the main server is down and you have to work around to find a server - which usually only has one or two proper players on, and while playing with computers is fun, they can sometimes be a bit stupid. Still, it is very fun, especially having to keep track of all your character's needs, so it is worth buying.			"

												The Ship is an incredibly fun game ! And it really is fun - it is not the victory of each round that makes it fun, it is the actual gameplay! - if you win it is just ""hey, I won"". It is not the victory, but the gameplay, that makes this game worth playing - you can easily spend 2-4 hours playing it. I did try to up the resolution to 1600x900, but then some of the fun went away - it the characters are a bit pointy, it makes the game more fun, more cartoonish you might say.The Ship is a fantastisc game, no doubt about that, and it is really worth buying! the singleplayer part is both short and a bit boring, but the multiplayer part is so much fun!A must buy!

												The Ship is a game that, well it's in the title, takes place on a ship. You control one of many passengers on said ship hunting one another, I mostly played the multiplayer version of this game. Whilst doing so, my character needed to use the toilet, as each player also has to watch there characters basic needs. So on my way I noticed my target, they noticed I was out for them and ran towards the toilet. They ran in there realising it was a dead end, closing the door. I opened the door whilst equiped with a Blunderbuss then quickly shooting him in the face, he died sitting on the toilet.			"

												The Ship is one of the most interesting multiplayer games I've played. Instead of running around and killing everyone, you're tasked with tracking down a single opponent (and avoiding the player who is out for you), all the while taking care of your personal needs, such as sleeping and eating. What results is a tense, exciting game with a great atmosphere of paranoia. Is that guy after me or just passing by? The gameplay encourages you to switch up your tactics by giving a higher payout for using certain weapons (the winner at the end is the player with the most money), and there are times when forgoing hunting down your enemy in order to track down a good weapon are in order. If I had one complaint about this game, it would be that the ships in the game have many narrow corridors, causing annoying traffic jams. With that said, The Ship is a unique, interesting game you should seek out. The playerbase isn't huge, but there's always enough people to have a decent game.			"

												Possibly the best experience of my life.This game alone is MEH, at best. But get some friends and it's just incredible. I can't even explain the funny ♥♥♥♥ we had happen. Just buy it, get your friends to buy it and play. Almost 10 years later, still what I'd consider too be a multiplayer master piece.THE MUSIC.You know those nights when you just can't sleep? And you just kinda lay there with music playing in your mind, this is what I hear. And I actually love it.Graphics.MEH, it was 2006, if you care that much about graphics wait for The Ship HD remastered in 2016.Gameplay.This game has some of the best gameplay I've ever experienced, it can be clunky or frustating some times, but when you blast someone across the room with a blunderbuss, it's just the best feeling. The ''Needs'' system keeps gameplay unique. It keeps the game from just murdering your quarry, it makes you worry about yourself even more so than you usually have too.8/10 Incredible music, great gameplay endless fun.Would have been a 9 or maybe a 10/10 if the controlls were less clunky, and if the graphics had a bit of a touch up.

												Great Fun! Its a slow paced game while you try not to be killed while trying to kill. It charming little game. The A.I. is bad i mean bad! You could get stuck in a room because the person is blocking the door. There are many items you could use. Scince they had a sale for 4.99 its a steal. Remember hunt or be hunted "

												A wonderful idea for an FPS - you are set to kill a single person, but you have no idea who is out to kill you. However, the main server is down and you have to work around to find a server - which usually only has one or two proper players on, and while playing with computers is fun, they can sometimes be a bit stupid. Still, it is very fun, especially having to keep track of all your character's needs, so it is worth buying.			"

												I saw Nerdcubed play it, asked a friend if I could get a copy, and he gave me one.It was not a mistake installing this game. Story - 2/5You are on a ship, (duh) lost at sea. You are hundreds of miles away from your last recorded position, and a villan as set up a little game. People are hunting eachother, in an attempt to be the last person standing. No real story other then that, the meat of this game is in the gameplay. Gameplay - 5/5You have a variate of weapons to complete your goals. (I.e, killing your target.) Axes, walletbombs, shanks, e.t.cIn the standard gamemode, you have a target, and you are targeted by someone. In a certain amount of time, you must kill your target without being killed or caught. You also have needs, such as bathing, eating, using the restroom, e.t.c. Its both fun playing with bots, and online.Multiplayer - 5/5Look at gameplay and story, but with your friends.Trust no one.AI - 4/5The AI is a bit questionable. You can easily find your hunter by watching them run at you, (Straight at you.)They often can get stuck behind doors, and dont often fight back. Extra -All the weapons are extremely well made for certain situations. Got a long hallway without anything to catch you? Use a axe or other blunt weapon. Need to set a quick trap? Use a wallet bomb. Have a short space, and need to quickly kill your target? Use posion, or a sleep syringe and a quick melee attack.Extremely fun on multiplayer and singleplayer.Would I recommend?Of course.Overal rating -4/5 "

												The tutorial is wonderfully made.A well laid out how to play and suggestions both fro single and multiplayer.Single playerThe storyline was well linked, though I think the map being player oriented would have made it easier to navigate.The quarry was too easy to find to me, and i never encountered my own hunter so it didnt feel so much as a deathmatchMultiplayer/ArcadeArcade mode was the best to me, the NPCs weren't very easy to beat  and made for a better game. Did not appreciate when kept being arrested for pulling out my weapon in an empty bathroom.as for multiplayer i am so disapointed. I live just north of Venezuela and i have no access to any games.Even if i leave all the options open I don't see any online games, nor can find a way to join any games. i bought this games with the sole intent to play online and that is the one thing i cannot do. i have checked on multiple occasions just in case there was maintenance an there is no change at all.

The situations where your quarry is in prison, and your'e waiting outside the door, waiting to pounce, when suddenly, your hunter jumps in with a blunderbuss and blows your guts all over the outside of the release office, and the cops don't notice, because your hunter isn't in the cameras view. There is just pure satisfaction when you find a tommy gun on the closet, or the teasing, agonizing feeling that you get when your quarry is right next to you, but there are too many witnesses. The ""needs"" system is a great addition, but it's really annoying when you pass out or waz yourself right behind your quarry. (9.5/10)			"

												Fun game. but you must add servers manually. The game was abandonded a couple of years back but still functions very well. You must kill with the weapon that is of most worth, and kill a specific individual before you yourself is hunted down. Avoid cameras, security and witnesses. Eat, drink, socialize, clean yourself and play to keep yourself fit and sane enough for your involuntary murder spree. The turotial/singel-player is difficult and very fun. I suggest gaming with friends for that extra ""nuh uh, im not hunting you *grin*"" situation			"

This is what I really wanted from 'The Ship'!The original single-player game is a pain in the drain! I could never kill that dude before he wacked the old guy in the wheelchair (and who cares?!)'The Ship: Murder Party' finally puts things in order! Now, single-player is simply offline-with-bots - just like CS, baby! And it works GREAT! TONS OF FUN!!!Originally posted by Redey59:""The master server is down, so the new way of joining servers is by ""searching"" for em, though there are probably more site's that do this, the 1 i use is http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/

After doing that, you can choose between servers, click on 1 of those server names.

If done correctly you should see a green line of numbers at the top left, copy that line.

Then, inside ""The Ship"" you need to activate the devolper console. (its the same as in all other half-life 2 games so feel free to skip this part if you know how to enable it already)
-Go to ""Engine Room"" (this is the ""options"" menu here)
-Select Keyboard
-Select Advanced
-tick ""enable developer console"" on

Now, back to the reason why you copy'd that line of numbers a while earlier, press on the ` key (this is to the left of the ""1""/Under escape/Above tab
You should see a box pop up, in this box type :
Connect ""the line of numbers""
i.e
Connect 789.489.495.228;27015

Now you are on your way to a multiplayer server :)

Thanks for reading, i made this guide becouse i want to avoid the massive amount of questions at the ""disccussions"" tab, which is why there are not any strategies or tips here.

Edit: you can also go to the ""favorites"" tab in the server browser and then press ""add server"", if you type the IP there it will stay there forever, removing the entire process of going to the site and such. (thanks for the tip: Flaming Waffle and Tyrak)

Edit2: You can also look at all available servers in the steam client by going to: View > Servers > Change the filter for ""Game"" into ""The ship"", this will then also show a list, rightclicking on a server and then looking at its server info will then give you the IP of that server.""THIS IS COOL: at one point, I decided to play as a passenger, so I could just get a look and feel for the game. As a 'passenger' rather than a 'hunter', I couldn't carry weapons (and you can be killed) but I had freedom to explore the maps and then discovered that you are basically a mobile security cam! For over an hour, I followed 'hunter players' around, freaking them out and faking them out (they don't know who's after them). If they do something whle you're watching they go to jail. One dude didn't play that and wacked me fast. I was laughing my a$$ off (which is dangerous since I don't have much to begin with)!!!10/10 would get viciously killed acting a fool, again! "

												In a few words: ""Counter-Strike: Intelligent Warfare"". Set in 1920-1930s you are on the ship with other players (or bots) and you are...um...bored, I guess :D . Coz you participate in a game where you are the hunter and the hunted. You gotta kill and not be killed. Make it ""le intellegent"" way: use huge number of various weapons, don't forget to eat, sleep, read, take shower - you are human after all %)Very much underestimated game concept reincarnated once again in Bloody Good Time later.

												This game does not have dedicated servers to play. This means the average person cannot play with their friends over the internet.EDIT: Thank you Tiveran. In order to access the servers you must find them OUTSIDE the game. Please see Tiveran's directions. This game seems like fun with friends, I have not had a chance to test ti much. I will leave this review as negative for other people with the same problem.			"

												The ship is one of these games that you should consider owning simply because it is such a classic title. It is starting to show a little bit of it's age but the cartoony style helps.This is basically the multiplayer game equivalent of a murder party turned FPS game, you only have one quarry per round, but knowing that someone is after you and that it is the only other person that you may kill without repercussion adds a healthy dose of paranoya to the mix.The game throws in a fair bit of deception too, change clothes to lose the trail of your killer, the maps are rigged with a few original traps and secret passages, And there are a few tools for the crafty players, such as sleeping drugs and wallet bombs.There are maps of various sizes that will accomodate a good variety of players (unlike a lot of games this is sort of important on the ship) and it also has ""passenger bot support"" which can help to add a ""bulk"" of innocents if you lack in player volume. Bots can also be hunters but they are pretty poor at this job.			"

												How do you make a game with this much potential, then fail to fix the easy stuff that would allow people to actually play it?I like this game and it does have great potential, and that makes the disappointment that much worse. Developers: why are the simplest of things broken? Seriously. First of all, the single player campaign is not worth the money. It is far too short. Secondly, good luck getting into a multiplayer game with other people. You can't join a server from in-game. This seemingly simple mechanism is broken and apparently the developers could are less to address it (as evidenced by long threads complaining about it). I figured out that you can actually retrieve a server list within steam, which had me excited right up until every single server in the list returned a ""server not responding"" error message. I have tried to get into a game for 3 days now and I'm hanging it up at this point. With so many great games on steam, dont' waste your time on this one.			"

												Not a happy bunny. This is used to be a fantastic multiplayer game, however the servers have been abandoned for what feels like years now. Of course you can still use the singleplayer and coop feature, but its false advertising. Whats even worse is that the only alternative is a buggy remastered version with donald trump in it, who the f** wants to see donald trump in a game? The developers have been really cheeky and offered this alternative for a hefty price, with no discount or compensation for current owners of the ship:murder party!			"

												Hate is a strong word, but I hated this game for a number of completly legitimate reasons, not only with game play but with the game itself. Even though I only have about 70 minutes of time in game, it was enough time to tell that this game was not worth the $3 I payed for it on sale, very much less $10 full price. First of all, when opening the game to play it, abouy 3 out of 4 times the game stops working. Doesn't matter what computer i'm on, there's always a good chance of the game not opening. The game also will not give me the trading cards. It is supposed to have 3 card drops but after 70 minutes of play I have only gotten one. Needs to be fixed. Now onto the game play. When you first dive in, the game is exciting. You must kill other passengers without being caught and without being killed in return. Weapons and disguises can be bought or found to help you do this. But after playing for even a small amount of time, for me between 25 and 45 minutes, you begin to get bored with the repeatativeness of the game. Also, how you get caught makes no sense. I have pulled out wallet bombs with no one in sight and been arrested and fined but when a waiter is 10 feet away and I pull out an axe, nothing happens. Nobody plays online either so if you get the game, be happy playing with AIs. On an entirely different note, the graphics are good.			"

												Want to be an assassin on a boat that is far away from shore with all hands on board? Then this game is right for you. The game takes place in a boat that is not coming back to shore any time soon, and you are forced to play a game that you have become the hunted and the hunter. You have to track down your quarry and try to avoid the person that's his or her quarry. AND THAT'S YOU! After a few moments you now have to take care of your needs, which means you are in a Sims game (Sims is a game where your trying to take care of your family) and you have to take a bath, eat something, drink something, talk to people, go to the bathroom, have some fun, just about you would do to take care of yourself. Sure, you going to have to deal with this every time you play this game. But, don't worry, there's different game modes if you don't want to play hunter. This is like tag and hide and seek mixed to together. Only, your try to kill each other.			"

												I really, really want to like this game. But it's so unbalanced it's not even funny. They might be just my beefs, but it's really annoying.Let's start off with the pros.Pros:+Brings a game out where it's hunt, or be hunted. There are a variety of weapons that are capable of doing different amounts of damage and different ways to hunt your Quarry. It's like a scavenger hunt for different people.+Multiple weapons to bash your Quarry and Hunter's skull in.+Feels very unique.+Could be fun with friends.Cons:-Already like, what? 10+ game modes exactly like this on Gmod that are well coded?-You get spawned too close to your Hunter that it's not even funny. They have a Katana, Tomislav and Revolver in their room (all which one-two hit kill) while you get a Shiv or a Mannequin Arm to defend yourself with.-There seriously needs a Map. Can't even really find your quarry when he's four floors above you with no stairwell or elevator leading all the way up there.-Needs to be more time to hunt the Quarry. That is an extreme beef, because then you feel rushed and get caught by security with X-ray vision.-Money is needed to win. And if you have the strongest weapon in the game, it practically only gives $1000 compared to $20000 with a Knitting needle, which you most likely won't win against because they'll have a stronger weapon than you.-Weapons that one hit. No weapon, in any game, besides a Headshot or a Backstab from the Spy from TF2 should do that. Ever. Completely unbalances everything.-If you get killed by your Hunter, it's over for the round. You can't get redeemed, you can't go and kill your Quarry, nothing. You're stuck waiting until the next round and losing money.-No knives should be in jail. Griefers just spawnkill you until you're all out of money, which it then goes into the Negatives of money.-The Security is my absolute biggest beef. The passengers seem to count as Security as well, and they're everywhere. Security works if you bring out a weapon, a simple MISCLICK will get you fined. 0.1 seconds is literally all it takes for a weapon to be seen. And your Quarry absolutely loves to hang out where the Camera's and Security are. So if you have a weapon out and are ""too slow"" to put it away, you lose $2000 - $6000 for just having in your possession six weapons. I thought that the crew knew this was going on and was paid to make sure no one was going against it!-Everyone in the game has Asthma. If you thought the Running in Half-Life 2HL2's running was never bad or Skyward Sword was bad, then wait till' you just tap the Shift key. In just four seconds you're out of Stamina and it takes about half a minute or more to refill unless you sit down, leaving yourself very vulnerable to a Griefer or your Hunter.-The AI is absolutely stupid. X-ray vision security guards, and the Passengers/Quarry that don't get out of the way, making you run in place, have to kill them in order for them to get out of the way, which costs $250-$2000 if you have to get through a bunch of them because they won't stop blocking you, in which you lose your Quarry.-With all the AI blocking you, takes too much to get to one part of a ship to the other, there needs to be more stairwells and elevators.-You have a lot of needs, Sleep, hunger, thirst, social activity, bladder, taking a dump, showering, etc. Most of these go down very, very fast. Especially Sleep, hunger and thirst. I have yet to see what Thirst does, but Sleep makes you sleep in place for seven seconds, and it keeps your Sleep in the red, which is 8/10 of the meter, and you end up sleeping in place for the next few rounds until you find a bed. Hunger makes you unable to sprint, which I saw no difference in gameplay.-You can't put out Fire on yourself or get rid of Poison. So if you killed the guy coming for you, too bad, you already lost and are out for the rest of the round.-Like I said earlier with the hunters spawning too close to their Quarry, I mean it with you're just walking around after a round, and after another one starts, the person holding a gun earlier is aiming rihgt at you, and you die, ending your round as a Player and what not.-If some idiot is trying to RDM you(Yes, mass RDM on this game like in Gmod with TTT.) and you try defending yourself, you get $1000 taken from you. I'm not kidding.With that being said, it has a lot of potential. But it feels more like an Early access game. It really, really needs a lot more improvment in terms of balance and gameplay before I give it a yes. If you want to try it, give it a go. I got it for $2 on sale. In all honesty, it needs to be free. Major malfunctions in every way and more bugs than a jungle covered with sugar. Just get Gmod, for all that is holy.			"

												This is by far the most stupid game i have ever bought. The single player was the only thing working.The multiplayer was crashing from all sides (when you create a game/join a game/switch to headphones audio/go to friends section of the server list/add a server to favorites/or just crashes on startup) I spend 3 hours trying every single listed solution on the internet and nothing worked.And the best part is that i got this game for 5 of my friends. So i hope at least they have a good time without me...			"

												I have been playing Tiger Woods '08 PC on a regular basis since it came out back in 2007. No modern game has come close. That is until this game was released. The graphics are top notch and very realistic. The addition of trees and bushes since last year improved the visuals a great deal. The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s graphics technology.Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to play with up to 8 players. You can stop and resume your round at a later time. There are loads of different play modes available. If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online. The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last round from a number of different angles. Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for the game is the freecam mode. Take a virtual tour of the entire game from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.This game has lived up to its potential. Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month. This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come. Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.			"

												The Ship is a relatively entertaining game, but is plagued by many flaws.It came out a while ago - 2006, in fact, and it does show its age, unfortunately. It's ""old-school"", but not in a nice way. It all feels just a little bit clunky and laboured while playing it, and that just wouldn't be tolerated if it came out today.Onto the game itself. I'll address the singleplayer first and foremost - it's pretty short and only lasts about an hour or two. It is intended to prepare you for the multiplayer, the main part of the game, but it's rather ineffective in doing so. You're never placed into a situation you would actually face in the multiplayer - mostly it's a case of go here, talk to this person, kill this guy, rinse and repeat (leaving out the occassional other trivial act). It doesn't help that the singleplayer is very frustrating at points and feels lazily done. To be honest, there's no real point in playing it.Now, the multiplayer. If you're reading this, I assume you understand the whole concept of the game. The concept does seem extremely entertaining. However, it's not executed as well as you would like. The maps are all too small for 24-32 players like the very few servers remaining are and you often find yourself cramped in rooms, getting blocked in corridors etc. The inclusion of security is poorly done - guards, cameras and witnesses seem to be just about everywhere meaning you rarely ever find a good opportunity to take out your quarry. You look to take out your target, only to realise there's a camera watching and you're arrested for pulling out your weapon. The needs system becomes tedious quickly - I can't be bothered going to the toilet or sleeping when I'm avoiding my hunter and searching for my quarry. You also only have 90 seconds for each round to kill your quarry, which is nowhere nearly enough time. The jail system is another major flaw in the game also - if you kill your quarry, you can deliberately get yourself arrested so as to be protected from the person hunting you. This can then also be undermined by your hunter deliberately putting themselves into jail and seeing if they can get the shank to take you out. There are plenty of other examples of things like this that just make you think ""That could have been done so much better"".It doesn't help that quite a number of people who play the game run around like headless chickens killing on sight as they are suspicious of anyone around them. Your enjoyment of this game is almost entirely based around other people and how they act - and when they act like they often do, it ruins it.And I still haven't mentioned the obvious yet - the game is pretty much dead. Servers are mainly filled with bots rather than players. The developers, Outerlight, don't even exist anymore so hopes of changes are nonexistent. However, there's a sequel on Greenlight that looks like it could be very good. Perhaps I'm not giving the game enough credit - it is relatively fun...for 15 to 20 minute periods. Then the same old flaws appear again and again and you just want to go and play something else. It's a real shame, because if this game had been much, much more polished and it had an active community these days I would have tons of fun with it. I got it for 70p on Bundlestars, and I don't really mind at that price. Let's hope for more in the sequel.			"

												The Ship is a very good game, don't get me wrong. It's a very good concept and it was executed well. However it gets boring after about an hour or so of gameplay, and after that point it really loses it's re-play factor. Yes, it is multiplayer and through that each game you play will be different, but at the same time it's basically all the same things. Everyone rushes around for the best weapons and then chaos ensues.If you're looking for a good game to screw around with friends on for a night, then if this is on sale pick it up. Otherwise I wouldn't spend money on it.			"

												Enjoyable... with a disclaimer.This game is very enjoyable, with a great art style and a fun concept: a bunch of people on a cruise-ship together must get weapons and battle each other to the death for a huge cash-prize.Sadly this game is not all roses and tommy-guns.One of the biggest flaws with this game is the 'mood' system, which feels like it was copy-pasted from 'The Sims', and shoehorned horribly into this game. The problem with it is that you must constantly maintain numerous personal issues like hunger, thirst, bladder, tiredness, etc... or else you will fall over dead. The big problem with this though is that it's so easy to cause these issues to spike, like how killing people makes you nervous and you need to talk to people to feel better, which is smart... but if you're in the middle of a cluster♥♥♥♥ of gunfire, and you kill too many people, your anxiety will skyrocket, you'll be frozen in place while your character has themselves a little crying break, leaving you open to any and all attacks for at least ten seconds.Overall the game is enjoyable, but it certainly has problems, and I mean MAJOR problems. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone on the basis that it takes a specific kind of person to enjoy it, so be sure you don't waste money on this game and instead find a friend who has it, and play their copy for a while.

												If you are actively trying to play this game in multiplayer, you are going to be immensely let down. The object is to  find and kill your target, all while evading your own pursuer; however, because this game is multiplayer, you are quite often going to walk into a room and get murdered because these are other people you are playing against and don't actually feel like playing a game. Essentially what this game comes down to is if you find a gun, you win the game because you can back away into an unobserved corner and kill anyone that even walks into the same area as you, or you are going to get murdered by someone who is neither your target nor your pursuer. This game has potential, but because this being played by other people, the entire fun and novelty is destroyed.			"

												Мультиплеерный шутер с очень необычной задумкой: действие происходит на корабле - круизном лайнере, каждый из пассажиров которого становится одновременно охотником и жертвой. Другими словами, каждому из игроков дается имя одного другого игрока, которого надо убить. Получается, что ты знаешь, как выглядит твоя жертва, но не знаешь, кто из остальных игроков охотится за тобой. Дальше начинается игра в прятки, потому что на корабле полно NPC, в том числе полицейских, и если кто-то из них увидит, как вы несетесь с топором за найденной жертвой, вас ждет минутное заточение в корабельной тюрьме и денежный штраф. Очень нестандартный экшен, где нужно не только стрелять, но и думать.			"

Total: 3,327 (or 3,547 according to other sources)Notes:	Lifeboats: 20 (sufficient for 1,178 people)RMS Titanic (/taɪˈtænɪk/) was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The largest ship afloat at the time it entered service, the RMS Titanic was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.Under the command of Edward Smith, who went down with the ship, Titanic carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. A high-power radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger ""marconigrams"" and for the ship's operational use. Although Titanic had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, there were not enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard due to outdated maritime safety regulations. Titanic only carried enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number on board, and one third of her total capacity.After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland before heading west to New York.[2] On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the ship's hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a ""women and children first"" protocol for loading lifeboats.[3] At 2:20 a.m., she broke apart and foundered—with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived at the scene, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.[4]The wreck of Titanic, first discovered over 70 years after the sinking, remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet (3,784 m). Since her discovery in 1985, thousands of artefacts have been recovered and put on display at museums around the world. Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history; her memory is kept alive by numerous works of popular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials.Contents  [hide] 1	Background2	Dimensions and layout3	Features3.1	Power3.2	Technology3.2.1	Watertight compartments and funnels3.2.2	Rudder and steering engines3.2.3	Water, ventilation and heating3.2.4	Radio communications3.3	Passenger facilities3.4	Mail and cargo3.5	Lifeboats4	Building and preparing the ship4.1	Construction, launch and fitting-out4.2	Sea trials5	Maiden voyage5.1	Crew5.2	Passengers5.3	Collecting passengers5.4	Fire5.5	Atlantic crossing5.6	Sinking6	Aftermath of sinking6.1	Arrival of Carpathia in New York6.2	Insurance and aid for survivors6.3	Investigations into the disaster6.3.1	Role of the SS Californian6.4	Survivors and victims6.5	Retrieval and burial of the dead7	Wreck8	Legacy8.1	Safety8.2	Cultural9	Appendix10	Titanic replicas11	See also12	Notes13	References14	Bibliography15	External linksBackgroundThe name Titanic was derived from Greek mythology and meant gigantic.

Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co.

Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The largest ship afloat at the time it entered service, the RMS Titanic was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line, and was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the disaster.Under the command of Edward Smith, who went down with the ship, Titanic carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America.

												This game had a very interesting concept behind it, but it just doesn't work well online, my experience anyway. You get people who like to think they're funny blocking hallways and doorways so you can't get through, the ""needs"" are quite a bother, I can never seem to be in the right place at the right time (to locate my target) and everyone stands in a pack so it's damned near impossible to find your target AND move around. Again, the concept was great, but in the actual game... Didn't work so great. MY experience though. YOU may have a better time.			"

												Official servers were closed, not many people playing this after that. You'd be lucky to find a server to play in. Plus the devs are bringing out a new ""The Ship"" game that's now on early access. This is a fun game but you won't be able to enjoy multiplayer, which makes buying it pointless.			"

												(This review was updated from its initial version to indicate that the game can be played via the Steam server browser. I still would not recommend the game right now because it's just too difficult to find a good server populated by humans instead of bots.)The Ship's core gameplay is interesting and fun for short bursts (now that I got it to work), but sadly the multiplayer community is almost nonexistent. This is probably because the in-game server browser is completely dead, and apparently the developers can't update their game at all because of licensing restrictions.A workaround using Steam's server browser is available (Steam Client > View > Servers > set filters for The Ship)) but it is clunky, unreliable, and has to be reset each time you start Steam.But even using that, there are barely any servers populated by real humans. Most are filled with bots. Of the 3 populated servers I could find, there were 10 total humans online. I've joined games where after a few rounds, all the people had left and I was left with all bots again. It's a sad state of affirs.I also didn't realize how old the game was (2006) when I bought it on a Steam sale in late 2014. It probably would've been a lot more fun in its heyday, with a fuller and more vibrant community.As it is, it might be worth it the pick the title up on sale for a few online rounds (if you're lucky), or if you have a few friends who are for sure into it, but otherwise I wouldn't bother unless they fix the multiplayer. It's fun, just not worth the headaches, IMO.			"

												This is a great game! Really! Unfortunately there is a rather decent chance the game's aged engine will not run at all no matter what your system specs are (even on old and cutting edge hardware/ believe me I tried it all) and consistently crash on start. There is virtually 0 support from the developers or any known solutions to this weird problem so purchase at your own risk. I picked this up for a dollar last sale and I admit I may be a little too salty but it deeply saddens me to see the servers becoming sparse and the developers ignore this game-breaking bug. Please rate this as helpful because the plethora of people who picked this up and gave up on the game running have simply not spread the word. I'd like some of you guys to save your few bucks for some other WORKING or POPULATED games or maybe even a cup of coffee....			"

												So my friend saw this game on sale and it looked really awesome, the concept of the game sounded really cool.We even rushed to get Steam Wallet money when the sale of the game was supposed to end (Saturday) cause we were that exited to get it.We bought 4 copies of the game, and gifted the other 2 to our other friends.That's another thing to add to my list of regrets..The game's dead, bland, and boring.I imagined it was fun before, like a few months ago when it was apperently big.But now it basically feels lifelless.- Servers are practically empty- The game feels lifeless.- With friends it might be fun, but only for a really short period of time- I cannot imagine anyone playing this game for more than an hour.- To go online (Since the devs are done with the game) you have to go through Steam > View > Servers. which is way too much of a hassle.- It's not worth it, even on sale- IT WILL DISSAPOINT YOU, I can promise thatThankfully there's Steam Refunds :D~ Got all 4 games refunded :D~ But the time wasted... that's forever gone.

												This game is okay if you have some friends to play it with....here's a recipe for pancakes, enjoy!Ingredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												The ship is unique in how many titles have taken from it in recent years. The gist is you have to assassinate another player on the map. The trick is that every character (including you) look very similar to all the NPCs on the map. Your also avoiding assassination yourself from another player.One of the recent Assassins Creed games took this concept almost verbatim, and it's likely more will follow suite. However while comparing The Ship on it's own merts it doesn't stand up any longer. The game hasn't aged well and it's community is long since extinct. It stands a curious piece of history from a bygon age of modding.			"

												Don't let the hours I have spent on this game fool you. My account freaked out and no matter what I did, it just said I was in game for 60 hours straight. I really only spent about an hour in single player mode in this game, mostly because my multiplayer won't work for this game, which is a bummer. Multiplayer might be quite fun for this game, but this isn't multiplayer. This is single player.It's not that interesting. Kill people on a boat, and try to not get killed by someone else that's going after you. It'd be great for 10 bucks, but for 20?! That's just too much for this game. Again, the multiplayer seems like it would work, but if you're playing with NPC's while the story limps around while passing out from alchohol poisoning every couple minutes, then it's simply not worth it. The music gets repetitive, and the characters are cardboard cutouts of a vauge stereotype, or typical character. ""The Bad Guy"", ""The Bartender"", and ""That French Guy"" are all you really get from these people.Don't buy this game, unless your friend want's to play it against you on multiplayer, because like I've said so many times already in this review: I can see the concept and gameplay being very entertaining when playing it against your friends. I wish I could delete it from my hours played, but now people now think I'm an expert at ""The Ship"", when I really don't like it.Don't buy it if you have no other friends that have it is my final choice. If it was 10, then I'd say go for it, the multiplyer seems fun from videos i've seen online, and it might be worth it! But, there are so many other great games for 20 on Steam. Go buy Portal 2,  or get a fancy hat in TF2 or something instead.			"

												I really do love the concept of this game. Pretty sure playing this game with friends would be awesome, but playing it on your own (as I do) is not much fun.When you buy this game, you get three files in your library:The first one is a tutorial, which consists out of the player standing in a bedroom and getting instructions. Nothing more.The second one is The Ship Single Player, which I really liked at first, but the lack of checkpoints make it rather tedious to complete.And last but certainly not least; The Ship, for your arcade and multiplayer desires. Arcade is pretty nice, though filled with AIs. I was expecting a real challenge when I started up my first multiplayer game, but I won it easily.Besides all of that, there are two more things I'd like to address.Firstly, I bought the game during a sale, and I think the price I paid was good. Looking at it off-sale and seeing it costing €20 (or €19,99 but cmon) kinda irks me. It's not a bad game, but not worth that much in my opinion.Secondly, if you buy the game, you get an extra 2 copies to gift to friends. If you gift a copy to a friend, said friend gets another copy to gift, thus creating a seeminly endless stream of copies, making it rather silly to buy the game for any price. Cheapskates unite ;DSo yeah, if you're looking for a fun game to play, I'd say get somebody to gift it to you give it a try! However, if you're looking for a challenge, you might want to keep looking.			"

												A nice little game. First time I played this old gem, I lived in Germany and my life was very calm, so I had time to game some. When I first came across this I couldn't believe my eyes! My prayers were answered! It was all I ever wanted and more. A game where you could sneak around on different maps(most of them shipsm which I really love) and roleplay simultaneously. The idea is a realy good one. I highly recommend this old classic masterpiece to every single person on this earth and their family. Play it and love it!			"

												First off, this ♥♥♥♥ing game is broken. I don't care that there are guides to getting into servers. This game came out in 2006. For ♥♥♥♥s sake please fix this ♥♥♥♥ing server ♥♥♥♥. I want to be able to play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game without having to lead my friends through a maze of links and Steam guides. It's not as fun as you would think. Second, this game is frustrating. Everything about this game wants you to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. The map is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. I cannot count the amount of times I have looked at it trying to find my quarry only to go the opposite direction. Your needs are annoying. The time in which you have to hunt your quarry is too short. And I'm not talking about custom servers. I mean the default settings. The combat is awkward. It comes down to clicking the attack button as fast as you can and pray ♥♥♥♥ING PRAY it doesn’t turn into an awkward affair. Getting more than three kills is unlikely.  The A.I is ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal (don't even consider single player). If you aren’t smart with your killing there is no way of winning. Oftentimes it is the player who kills the smartest that rules the map. Not the one with the most kills. The penalties for doing ♥♥♥♥ wrong are steep. Your quarry becomes unkillable if the ♥♥♥♥er decides to stand next to a guard. If you do try you are sent to jail for a minute or so giving you ample time to deal with your needs.  If you aren’t a retard with killing there are times in between rounds where you're doing ♥♥♥♥ing nothing waiting for the next round. The atmosphere is bland. It's like they were too lazy to go all the way with this roaring twenties aesthetic. Or they retextured normal ship interiors. That's the only explanation I can come up with for the fact that there are security cameras.  Animations are stiff but the models themselves succeed in their goal of being cartoonish. On the up side it's certainly different than a lot of other ♥♥♥♥ out there. It’s a good game concept wise. A murder dinner party game where you must take care of your needs while hunting your prey while being hunted yourself. Unfortunately it didn’t quite come together so well. A Steampunk themed sequel titled The Ship: Full Steam Ahead is listed on Steam Greenlight. Maybe it will be better whenever it comes out.			"

												This game is alright. It provides a solid [online] experience with well implemented mechanics and generally fun gameplay. But that's it. Expect nothing more than a very simple stealth/crime game that you play with your friends on occassion. On top of the meh gameplay experience, it seems the developers of this game have no idea what they're doing. It's highly overpriced at 20 dollars, and the only reason me and many other people even have this is because other people gave copies to us. If you want a simply basic fun game to play with friends then this is for you, but PLEASE only buy this during a sale.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game is highly addicting but i just didn't like it in my opinion for 1 it has many glitchs and the physics need to be fixed also to add the ending didn't make me feel good it was too short of a campaign and the game runs very well with good framerate but the campaign wasn't good also to add one more thing is this game is only for people who like murrderr games like garrys mod murrderr mode.

												This game sucks, a waste of time and money especially on the multiplayer one (murder party the servers don't even work). I feel bad for recommending this game to my friend I feel even more bad because my friend actually bought the game thinking it was good. If I knew that this game wasn't even going to work I would've never bought it let alone recommend it. If I could I would ask for a refund but sadly steam doesn't allow refunds(which really sucks a$$).~Sincerely a gamer who wasted money on this game and a YouTuber who will never be able to do gameplays on it with friends.P.S buy this game at your own risk, you've been warned. (I know that this is a very harsh and brutal review on it, but I honestly think this game needs some brutal honesty and criticism, like come on now, everyone needs that every now and then...)			"

												F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon is a survival horror first-person shooter developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment. It was released on October 17, 2005, for Microsoft Windows,[1] and ported by Day 1 Studios to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[4] Timegate Studios has released two expansion packs, F.E.A.R. Extraction Point in October 2006,[5] and F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate in November 2007. A direct sequel titled F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, was released in February 2009, and a second sequel, F.3.A.R., was released in June 2011, though it was developed by Day 1 Studios (now known as Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore), not by Monolith Productions.The game's story revolves around a supernatural phenomenon, which F.E.A.R.—a fictional special forces team—is called to contain. The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R.'s Point Man, who possesses superhuman reflexes, and must uncover the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl.F.E.A.R. was well received by critics, scoring 89% on Game Rankings,[6] and The New York Times calling it ""as thrilling and involving as Half-Life.""[7] A ""Director's Edition"" DVD version of the game was also released. The DVD included a ""Making of"" documentary, a director's commentary, a short live-action prequel and the exclusive first episode of the promotional P.A.N.I.C.S. machinima. A related Dark Horse comic book was also packaged with the DVD. Along with the Director's Edition, F.E.A.R. Gold Edition was released. Gold Edition included the Director's Edition and Extraction Point. F.E.A.R. Platinum Edition features the original game and two expansion packs.			"

												I bought this in a bundle. 6 of this to be precise. As it turns out, the bundle had 2 copies to give away (each!)... and those copies had shareable copies...To make a long story short, I blew about $10 on it.The singleplayer portion of the game is frustrating, repetitive, and highly hilarious. I beaned an old lady with a throwing pan. I beat a guard with a pool cue. I gunned an assassin with a flare gun.Some portions of the single-player mode were stupid. Like the infinitely respawning guards in the ""steal the map"" mission.Anyways. I'm writing because this is only a buck on Bundlestars: http://www.bundlestars.com/store/the-ship-complete-pack/The multiplayer is dead these days, but if you have a few hours that need entertainment, pick it up now.

Should I buy it?In short? YesThis game is largely a multiplayer PvP game, it has a single-player mode, but I haven't touched it. The premise of the game is pretty simple, you're a passenger on a boat, and you're engaging in a hunt. You've got a mark on your head, and you've got a target. Your goal? Kill your target before you're killed.There are many additional mechanics that hinder your progress. Certain weapons give more reward money, while others give less, these prices fluctuate. You can't be seen with your weapon out, or you'll get fined and incarcerated.On top of all this you'll also have to find your target, knowing only their last-seen location, and micro-manage your needs.The game is easy to pick up and play, but highly enjoyable and quite challenging. You definitely ought to pick it up.			"

												the reason I wouldn't reccomend this game is because it's too much a hastle to have to find the correct hamachi site, get things set up with frineds (which can take forever) such as IP, joining groups, getting the server to appear on their computer.. ect.The only reason I wouple play this is to enjoy a game with my friends, but that is a long shot at this rate.

All in all this game is really good fun, perfect for a group of friends, or you could always just find a normal server to play on. It's got a bit of a learning curve to it, but a tutorial (which unfortunately is a standalone program) is included to help get you playing without too much confusion.			"

Servers are deserted and the only fun you'll be able to have is with a L.A.N. or custom server. It's a good game, but deserted. Better to get the single player because that is very fun! (8.6)			"

												The Ship takes place on a cruise ship some time in the 1920s, where a number of unsuspecting passangers are forced to partake in Mr. Xs twisted game for his amusement.Players will be given a 'Quarry' Whom they must hunt down and  murder . But while you're hunting down your quarry, Someone else is hunting  YOU  down. But you can't simply shoot, shank, and bludgeon every last person who crosses path, because every kill that isn't your quarry or your hunter will incur a hefty cash penalty.Speaking of cash, there are plenty of shops, from clothing stores to food bars, and not only is cash going to be used in shops, but it's usually your goal to attain a certain amount of money in the ATM. How do you obtain this money you need? By murdering your quarry of course!But you're not just some main character who does what they like, you have needs! Hunger thirst, sleep, toiletry, cleanliness, entertainment, and social interaction are all obstacles for you to overcome whilst you try to murder people. If oyu don't know how to take care of these basic needs, then you MAY have failed as a human being.There are plenty of weapons, but if you think using the same weapon over and over is a good idea, you're wrong, for once a weapon is used, it goes to the bottom of the weapon list, and the longer a weapon goes unused, the more cash a quarry kill with it generates.The singleplayer sucks though, this is where it's at.

												See, this is what happens when you make a singular multiplayer idea into a whole game.  So long as it was a good idea to start with, the result is gonna be pretty damn good.  The Ship is basically the Assassin's Creed multiplayer with a Source game background and I happen to be way too ♥♥♥♥ing good at it.  The roguelike choice of character and weapon payout is quite impressive.  I like the maps, attention to detail and it's quite surprising that a multiplayer focused Source game from 2006 has such a dense community.			"

When you are in game go into console, type connect and then copy/paste one of the IP addresses into it to join a server.  Once you join a server play for awhile to get a good feel on how to play.

												One of the most underrated multiplayer games of all time: the core idea is a new take to deathmatch, with a lot of twists and factors to consider. The main objective of the game is not only killing your prey but also providing to your basic needs, with a the sims-like simulation, and try to stay alive, avoiding your hunter. There are different modes and several maps, these are really detailed and require time in order to learn the weapons locations and the best spots. On the downside, it's a game that requires a lot of dedication in order to play it strategically, however the community is so tiny that it's quite difficult to find servers.Bottom line: buy it, especially when it's on sale, you can give the two free coupons to your friends (I still have them if someone wants) and learn the game together; let's make the community grow!

												I got this game about three days ago, but due to issues both on Blazing Griffin's end and Valve's end, I have been unable to connect to any servers to play this game. Blazing Griffin apparantly only has publishing rights to the game, and unless Valve updates it (which won't be likely), we all have to go without playing the ship as a multiplayer game, which is how it was intended to be. In my honest opinion, this game has sacrificed its integrity in that manner. I would recommend it, because I'm sure that it would be insanely fun, but I can't because I've never even been able to begin to play it. So therefore, I cannot recommend this game. As far as I am concerned, however, this issue has been going on for over two years, and the fact that I had to do such extensive research to figure out that the game cannot be easily played is ludacris. I do not recommend this game for those reasons. The only game that is under The Ship's name that you CAN play is the single player version, which is very good, but short (only about ten missions to accomplish; it can easily be completed in under a day). It is a shame, it really is, that a game that is beginning to get a surge of popularity from YouTube is unable to be played by people who want to play the game without monetary gain.			"

												This is an amazing game! It's fairly simple, it features a bunch of people who have to kill each other on a ship, sort've like in Gosick, and you must win by making the most money off of the killings... At least in one gamemode. Not a lot of people know about the gamemodes from what I've seen, and things like Elimination and Deathmatch are really fun. Nothing like running around shooting people with a thompson on tons of different maps. Oh yeah, there's also stats you need to keep up with. I usually take care of those in the in-game jail. Also, this game is a perfect game to listen to the song ""Kuusou Mesorogiwi"" because it is so fitting for it.			"

This game is fun and addicting with a single player with a great story and the online is not laggy it is not buggy and most of the servers dont crash or randomly disconnect you. The game is $20.00 and that is not too much unless you only buy a $20.00 Steam Card.This was the first paid game I played on Steam and it is by far one of the best.

												Don't buy this game, it's a scam and it shouldn't be on the store as it is right now. Even if your computer meets the recommended requirements there is a very high chance that the game won't work inmediately after instalation. Then after reading in the forums you'll probably try two so called ""solutions"", after that there is a high chance neither will work, so you'll start trying to contact steam support by this time. After they answer they'll tell you to refresh the steam files and verify the game cache with an automated message, both suggestions are useless since what's wrong is the game not steam. And then you will run out of options and you will finally realize you have been scammed.On the bright side there's a slight chance that the game will work inmediately after installation and then you will notice the game server is messed up and you can only enter a game by inputting the adress and port of a server manually, which is not that bad considering you are at least able to play the game.

												Although this game is fun from gamepaly I've seen of it, it looks like the master gameserver died for this game, don't bother wasting your money, unless you want singleplayer, but multiplayer with friends is the way to go.  If you want to play a game related to the same concept of this, get Garry's Mod and play the gamemode ""Trouble in Terrorist Town.""  It's basically the same concept, you are either killing people or killing the ones hunting you, but it's slightly different so make sure to look at the rules or something before jumping in.Now that I'm done with my TTT ramble, I'm going to mark this as I don't reccomend this, not due to the fact that I don't like the game, but just because the master game server doesn't seem to be working anymore.

												The Ship You know the rules : Hunt or be hunted .. They do not work on that game !You are supposed to kill someone but you should remember that you are the target of another player !!You should try play the game only because it's the only one of it's kind! *Except Bloody Good Time , but it was less entertaining* I cannot actually write the descripton for the game because I don't know much .. But ! What I can do is say , what are the plusses and what are the minuses !!Plusses :+ Multiplayer game with high re-playability+ Kill-The-Famous-Country-Leader Mode+ Huge amounts of weapons to kill someone with+ Cops !! *Even though that they do nothing except watching you doing strange stuff*+ Very well made models of the Ship's *They actually DO look nice!*Minuses :- REALLY LOW amount of servers- Little communityActually , the game on steam costs 19.99 but you can find cheap steam keys nearly everywhere !

												A fun murder game with a unique take on murder games (if any others exist.)My favorite mode is you are given the name of someone else to hunt, and you must track them down and kill them without arousing suspicion from them. At the same time, everyone else has been given someone else to hunt down (it could be you!) An optional system in the game is needs, which you must balance hunger, thirst, and other human needs with hunting.Overall, this game is extremely fun with other people, and buying the game includes two giftable copies to hand out to friends as well!

												Great for LAN Parties or for groups of friends to play. Lot of silly little secrets and things you can do to be funny/♥♥♥♥ off your buddies. For example, injecting your friend with a sleeping potion when they go after their quarry. Or shooting your target through the bars of the brig when they think they're safe. Or repeatedly pushing them into a shower while you're in passenger mode so they can't go after their target.Generally speaking, it's just a rousing good time to get a bunch of friends together, pile onto voice chat, and have a bloody good time.And bloody as in death.And murder.10/10 would murder again "

												This is a ton of fun to play, especially with a bunch of friends in the same room. Never since the old days of LAN parties has there been so much taunting and trolling. The needs system adds an interesting dynamic to the game. Not only do you have to take care of yourself, but you can stalk your target until they need to satisfy their needs. This leads to a lot of murders while they're on the toilet. I never thought I'd say this, but murdering your friends is hilariously fun.			"

												I am very satisfied with the gameplay. If you like assasination and murder games, this is for you! Try and kill your quarry, but don't get caught! Also be careful your quarry doesn't kill you before you kill them. Don't kill anyone else but them, but remember, you're being hunted too! The only people you can kill besides your target are random noobs that attack you for absolutely no reason, and your hunter. This game is also hilarious when it comes to killing with all the interesting weapons! Whoever gains the most money in the end wins the hunt. But besides hunting, you have to take care of yourself too. You're only human. Eat, drink, bathe, entertain yourself, and do pretty much everything you would need to do in real life. It's like a combination of The Sims and murder games. Also, with your purchase you get TWO extra gifts to send to your Steam friends! Also, each friend who gets it will get yet another gift to send, but only one, not two. This game spreads like a plague! :P10/10Example of how this game gives you a smashin' good time from my own experience: I set fire to a man and finished him with an axe. While he was peeing.			"

												Everything else is boring to you?Then play this, it's awkward and yet it's fun. The stalker simulator you've been waiting for.You can roleplay too!Here's what I did for lolz:- Sat on stairway with knife out, slicing passerby. People fled for their lives even though they weren't my targets.- Stalked random individuals, crouching, pretending I'm looking at others but following them, eventually they panic and the reactions are hilarious specially if their hunter kills them and you are not even involved.- Hunting, killing random ship mates is still a better love story than twilight.- Setting traps, and watching people try pick them up and go to space.- Stalking a person and pushing it into a room, then closing the door. They always panic and pull out a gun or melee weapon, all you have to do is run out (assuming you survive) and they'll get arrested, pull out a weapon and join them in jail then find a shank and stare at them for a while, pull out the shank and have fun.This game is surely best with friends. The only thing it lacks is direct and global voice chat which I hope new devs will implement. The server browser is cumbersome (read community hub) but it works.Worth a buy, specially on sale as the game drops cards which quickly redeem the game in worth anyway.			"

												Now that I've finally been able to play the game online with some friends, I've changed my opinion on the game. The concept of the game is really awesome. It has some issues here and there which I hope will be addressed in the new version, but overall, it's definitely a fun game... if you can get a game going (helps to have someone who knows what they're doing to host the server).The game is sure to create a huge amount of stress and frustrations, but it's also sure to cause a lot of laughture and priceless moments.Contains a bunch of gameplay issues which should not exist at all. Example: If you're in a small washroom stall and the door is closed, when you go to open the door again, you either need to be standing on top of the toilet or risk getting permanently wedged between the door and the wall since the door will not stop trying to open completely. Also, guns make melee weapons almost pointless. If they have guns and you only have a melee weapon, seriously, good luck with that.			"

												What a fun game this is. Even though it may seem like a copy cat of some sort the fun you'll have with this game (and your friends) is priceless. The AI doesn't seem to be too stupid to actually participate in the game but they could be a bit more active though. Also it is not always clear how you got caught doing bad things to other passangers and get jailed for it.But(!) aside from the above this game is totally worth it, if you have friends who want to play with you. As grand as this game is, it is - in my opinion - a multiplayer based game. More so a game where you really should invite friends to play with - it'll be so much more worth playing it than alone or with strangers.			"

												its a fun simple game where you have to kill and not be killed.if you can find a decent server.some intersting easter eggs (indiana jones, james bond)cant wait for the HD version to be released (and on sale hopefully)fun if you like the game Cluedo/Clue.UNFORTUNATELY:'old-fashioned' music can be annoying, repetitive, and stuck in your head.servers are few and far between and can have custom mods, which can be good or bad affecting gameplaypeople are annoying. some people just kill everyone, some servers kick these people, most dont.weapons are TOO available. they are everywhere. it takes away the emphasis of getting paid more for using certain weapons as most just use what they can find. and usually its a gun not the golf club or the croquet mallet)most people just crowd trying to find thier target      (you have to identify others names first as everyone has one of the same 8 faces)Recommended, if you get it in a humble bundle or something for less than $2. bear in mind its an old game.

												I was surprised by this game. I'd heard nothing about it, the graphics are a little on the old side, and to find a multiplayer game to connect to you need to use an external site.That said, once I started I kinda couldn't stop.Multiplayer assassin game. You're dropped on a cruise ship with a random skin and outfit, and you need to find somone based on their name and the last place they were seen. You identify people by looking at them (that gets you their name), and you need to find and kill your target before you are found and killed by the person targeting you.It's worth nothing that there are a ridiculous number of AIs for you to sift through; but also a large number of other players.A fun twist is that you need to acknowledge your bodily functions. Go too long without showering? You start to stink. Go too long without sleeping? You pass out. You get the idea. In the Assassin's Creed multiplayer, you try to blend in with AIs because you share their skins. In this, you're the only You on the ship, so you need to give yourself a fighting chance. Keep moving, changing outfits, and looking at people's names. Don't get caught by cops or other players. And try not to die.			"

												Fun little game, with a cartoonish feel about it.The game is pretty simple, you must murder your target, and preferably in a very unbecoming manner (to gain extra points) without being caught.Secondly you yourself are a target, so you'll have to watch your back, while trying to assassinate your target.Most of the game takes place on a ship, hence the name, but one or two maps are based on a small island.Gameplay is pretty good, and if you have a couple of friends, who feels like playing the game with you, it instantly turns into a lot of fun.You can choose to play against bots, bots and humans, or only humans.Getting away with murder, or just assault, isn't that easy, as you'll have to be aware of cameras, security and ""forbidden"" areas.All of this makes for a fun game, which is a lot more fun, when playing with or against a group of friends.

												The Ship shows just how important it is to carefully design every aspect of your game. Everything from the weapons to the maps is designed to be simple and easily accessible while still rewarding players with an attention to detail.The Ship is a great game for people who don't much care for multiplayer FPS games and instead want something a little more 'clever'.However, a word of warning. There are not a lot of servers for The Ship and, at the time of writing this, the Server Browser doesn't really work. So, I recommend you look up some servers on the internet, then add the IP addresses to your favorites to easily access the servers. Even if you don't live in the countries where these servers are located, don't worry. The Ship is surprisingly forgiving when it comes to latency. 200-250 ping is usually good enough for you to kill your way to the top 3.Once you get past all that, you're looking at one of the most well designed multiplayer experiences ever made. If you've taken a brief look, and you like what you see, get it. It is well worth the money.			"

												'The Ship' might be one of the most unique and fun multiplayer experiences yet. Want to know where Assasin's Creed's excellent multiplayer came from? Step right up. (Also, the servers DO work. Look up online how to connect to them. Although, the A.I is actually pretty good, so you'll still have fun playing with bots) Perplexingly, the game is split into three seperate games. One is the tutotial, one is the singleplayer, and the other is the multiplayer. Why these can't just be lumped into one baffles me, but it doesn't really matter. Play the tutorial first, uninstall it, play the singleplayer, uninstall it, then just play the multiplayer from then on. The tutorial is straightforward enough, and the singleplayer is occasionally funny, yet mostly underwhelming. It's useful as an extended tutorial however, as it helps you work out how to manage your 'needs' and seek your target. The multiplayer is where it's at. Anyone who's ever been on a cruise-ship knows it's the most boring place in the world and you'll most likely develop utter contempt for anyone who's stuck on this tiny floating hellhole with you. So turning the whole thing into a cartoonish Agathe Christie 'stab-em-up' is curiously delightful. The 'Deathmatch' mode might be the most civilised deathmatch in gaming, as you take a break from murdering everyone with an umbrella to sip some tea at the cocktail bar whilst classical music blares; barely drowning the sound of utter carnage. The graphics are basic yet effective. The level-design is surprisingly excellent, with there being many hidey-holes and secret passages. The game also utilises the Source Engine - which is one of the reasons why this game has aged so well, along with the unique gameplay. If you keep checking on BundleStars.com, this game often goes for 70p (about a dollar) and it's more than worth it.			"

												The Ship is a combination of Assassin's Creed Multiplayer and The Sims. You need to hunt down and kill your given target, all the while not getting detected, or killed by another player and at the same time tend to your needs. This game can be pretty tense as you only have so much time to kill your target. You also need to bag as much money as possible; so you need to search for high money weapons. The amount of money you get for killing someone with a certain weapon varies. Some areas of a map are under surveillance so if you get caught you lose money, all your weapons and opportunities to kill your target. Other people will be out to get you too so keep watch, otherwise you lose everything in your inventory. Tending to your needs can be difficult as well; as you will spend a lot of time trying to find and kill your target. All of these gameplay mechanics make the game fairly tricky, but it is a good challenge and a very enjoyable game that I highly recommend.			"

												Everything else is boring to you?Then play this, it's awkward and yet it's fun. The stalker simulator you've been waiting for.You can roleplay too!Here's what I did for lolz:- Sat on stairway with knife out, slicing passerby. People fled for their lives even though they weren't my targets.- Stalked random individuals, crouching, pretending I'm looking at others but following them, eventually they panic and the reactions are hilarious specially if their hunter kills them and you are not even involved.- Hunting, killing random ship mates is still a better love story than twilight.- Setting traps, and watching people try pick them up and go to space.- Stalking a person and pushing it into a room, then closing the door. They always panic and pull out a gun or melee weapon, all you have to do is run out (assuming you survive) and they'll get arrested, pull out a weapon and join them in jail then find a shank and stare at them for a while, pull out the shank and have fun.This game is surely best with friends. The only thing it lacks is direct and global voice chat which I hope new devs will implement. The server browser is cumbersome (read community hub) but it works.Worth a buy, specially on sale as the game drops cards which quickly redeem the game in worth anyway.			"

												Sadly, this game never recieved its popularity. The Ship is a fun and surprised filled game, but it was so unpopular and it's very outdated. Servers are deserted and the only fun you'll be able to have is with a L.A.N. or custom server. It's a good game, but deserted. Better to get the single player because that is very fun! (8.6)			"

												Source mod gone full retail. The Ship is a great premise: Find your target among the people on a cruise ship and take them out, while someone else is doing the same to hunt you down. Throw in a Sims style needs system so players can't camp, a weapon bounty system so players need to try out new weapons, and a lovely 1920's style atmosphere, and you *should* have a great game. However, The Ship does show many problems, mostly when compared to it's mod predecessor. In the mod, there would be many civilians to confuse and work around to get to your target. In The Ship, you rarely see more than one or two civilians in total on these large cruise ships. Because of this, many games just turn into a deathmatch rather than a complex game of stalking and decieving. You can turn up the amount of civvies, but there's still a very small limit on that, and rarely multiplayer servers turn this config on.The Ship is also very dated. The game hasn't been updated in many years, and the controls show it. Even once you get past that, there's still some very strange workarounds you can find on the levels. It just feels old, rather than classic or ""old school"". What's worse, the previous devs have been absorbed into Ubisoft, and the current publisher for The Ship, Blazing Griffin, can't secure the rights to modifiy the game's code (even after a failed Kickstarter campaign), so it's stuck like this for the forseeable future.If you can gather together a group of friends who all understand the little things and problems with The Ship, you can enjoy it for a while, but it won't last forever. Grab it if it's on sale. "

												The Ship: Murder Party is a first person shooter computer game using Valve Software's Source engine developed by Outerlight. The game was released on July 11, 2006, on Steam with retail distribution in Europe and Australia in September, and April 10, 2007, for North America.[4] A playable concept for The Ship was released as a modification for the game Half-Life in 2004.The game is set on a 1920s recreational cruise ship. Each player is assigned a quarry, and the object is to murder him or her with nobody watching, while at the same time watching out for, and defending yourself against, your own hunter.Story:A mysterious man named Mr. X has handed out free tickets for his luxury cruise. Little did the passengers know they were falling into his devious trap. All the passengers are required to track down and murder another passenger. If a passenger chooses not to do so, Mr. X will kill him or her.Would buy again 10/1920x1080			"

You'll find a great variety of weapons and disguises stashed throughout the ship.Oh, and when you buy the game, you get 2 additional copies for your friends, who in turn get one additional copy each for a friend of a friend.

												In this game, you're a passenger on a cruise ship. The ship is filled with weapons, and your job is to find a decent weapon and kill a certain passenger without being caught. But my favorite part of the ship is not the gameplay, but the ship itself. It's a lot of fun to mess around on the huge ship, blasting the guards, destroying all of the food, and even robbing the bank. Instead of killing my target, I just bring up the map, find the parts of the ship you're not supposed to be in, and shoot all the crew to loot the place before placing my secret stash of weapons under some dude's bed.

												I have put so much time into this game and it doesn't get old. The goal of the game is that you are given a quarry (target) and you have to kill that target without being seen by secuirity or other passengers while doing so. You can find a map to see the entire ship. You also have to fufill your needs just like The Sims, or concequences will hapen. Overall a great old game. 8/10! A must buy if you have $10Edit: Remastered Version coming out...YEA!			"

												The game is very simple and entertaining.More fun when playing multiplayer with others also fun when playing alone.I get the problem of many that you cannot access servers from the main game. I know many people have already found solutions to this and it is very simple but a bit annoying. When switching between tabs and all.All in all the game is fun, everybody gets a query to kill one another and you can find weapons all around the ship from cupbaords, drawers, on the wall etc.. You are not allowed to kill your query in front of guards or staff personnel and you should try to remain non suspicious the whole time or else others can kill you. At the same time you have things to keep updating yourself through out the game such as your food intake, bladder, sleep, shower, reading a book etc...Maybe the bad part I would say or not very bad but it kinda finishes the game quickly is one thing. You can know where your query is, it will say on the right hand side where your query was the last time which makes the game finish quickly.All in all ITS FUN, it is a calmer version of Gary's Mod murder where everybody is a killer to another. I totally recommend it specially it is very cheap.			"

												Fun little game, with a cartoonish feel about it.The game is pretty simple, you must murder your target, and preferably in a very unbecoming manner (to gain extra points) without being caught.Secondly you yourself are a target, so you'll have to watch your back, while trying to assassinate your target.Most of the game takes place on a ship, hence the name, but one or two maps are based on a small island.Gameplay is pretty good, and if you have a couple of friends, who feels like playing the game with you, it instantly turns into a lot of fun.You can choose to play against bots, bots and humans, or only humans.Getting away with murder, or just assault, isn't that easy, as you'll have to be aware of cameras, security and ""forbidden"" areas.All of this makes for a fun game, which is a lot more fun, when playing with or against a group of friends.

												A hidden gem in the Steam Store, this game is sure to make your friends rage and also requires detective skills. This is basically The Sims with murder in it. You have a target or ""the quarry"" to kill, but the trick is that another person is hunting you down called your ""hunter"". The goal is to get as much money as you can from using the weapons and each weapon is randomly generated per a round a ""MFK"" or Money For Kill (ex. a revolver gives $3213 money for each kill or next round the same revolver only gets $2153). This game is hella fun to play with your friends but sadly none of my friends have this game, or they do, but never play it. Not only you have to hunt down your quarry, you also have to take care of yourself. There's food, beds, showers, etc. You need to take care by keeping cleaning, nourished, and also going to the bathroom, just like I said before the Sims. And, you dont need to worry about your identity, your given a random gender, name, and appearance every time you die. There is a variety of maps and weapons. I'd have to say, this game was sitting in my library, until I got bored and let me tell you it was a great decision I made. The game is really cheap ($5 I think? not sure didnt checked). Please. Grab this game, especially in 2-pack form so you can give an extra copy to your friends.			"

												I can recommend this game, but really only for the single player.Comparing the single player to the multiplayer, with support for multiplayer only coming from LogMeIn Hamachi, one does not have the ability to play with [say] 30 people at once to create the ""who is it"" environment that ""The Hunt"" in Single Player tends to achieve rather easily.The game has aged, not necessarily well, but not badly either. It stands that older games can be a good play, even if they aren't typically available for online play. The gameplay tends to be lacking as it is ""run around and don't get caught"" in style.I found it interesting that you could die from afflictions other than murder. These include drowning, being eaten by pirahna fish or dying of simply smelling like ♥♥♥♥♥. Did you use the waste containment bag?I'll rate this game 6/10. The goods coming from it's half-decent single player, and the negatives coming from the lack of support for multiplayer and [as I noticed] lack of NPC's in multiplayer.I await the HD remake.			"

												This game is very unique in the way that it plays. Its a bit clunky, but it is very fun to play. its a game all about trickery and using various weapons to kill your target. It is also all about killing without being caught. The game can get boring after a number of hours, and can also feel lacklustre online with randoms. The way to get the best out of this game is to play it with friends and by trying out different modes, such as the world leaders mode. Overall this game has potential but ive lost the motivation to play it and so it shall be left behind, I might go back to it.Whitty's rating: 5/10			"

												This game is fun, even when it's just you and a bunch of dumb bots.It's really creative, and the story line is pretty brilliant. Try to find your victim, while trying to disguise yourself, outrun, and outsmart the one hunting you (and maybe kill him first!). To add to the strategy, you have needs that must be constantly watched (kinda like in The Sims -- hunger, bathroom, shower, sleep, social activity, etc.). But it's really not as cheesy as you might think.Sadly, though I've enjoyed playing with bots, I've never found other people to play with (granted it's been a year or so since I tried looking for players). This game would have been awesome in a full server.You can even choose to be a non-combatant and wander around messing with the people by being a bothersome witness; making them nervous; etc. :D			"

												The Ship is a game where you hunt other people while being hunted yourself.Ever played Assassin's Creed's Hunt mode or Trouble in Terrorist Town? This is very similar.The main difference between The Ship and those games is its Sims-like needs system.This concept may be foreign to people unfamiliar with The Ship, but eating and drinking are essential to not dying.Too hungry? You die.Too thirsty? You die.Too tired? You fall asleep and somebody literally stabs you in the back.Managing one's needs is a way The Ship forces players into the open.Just skip the Single Player game, it's agonizingly slow and boring.

												Intellectually created with wonderful gameplay, the ship offers a truly unique experience which encompasses a wide variety of factors.Being a murderer on a boat stranded in the ocean with a load of other murderers has never been so entertaining as in this clever strategy game. Plan out an assassination and locate your target on one of several ellaborate cruise liners. With a extreme variety of methods to kill your victims ranging from flare guns to prosthetic arms, The ship entertains in forms of humour and  suspense.The ship has strategy in the execution of a murder to the planning of the rest of your time. As food, sleep, and hygiene are all in game components to prevent you from dying or being unhealthy. Fun for single players or large groups looking for a murder mystery multiplayer game.The only real place where the game could improve is that the nudity isn't as graphic as it could be. When I play this game I viciously masturbate in order to get the most out of it, but it's difficult to get my ♥♥♥♥ to maximum hardness when the nudity isn't as prominent. But for a game with excellent market value for how good of a game it is, you don't have to go any further than The Ship.			"

At the beginning of rounds it starts off slow since you need weapons to kill your quarry (hit basically) but when you get them, it feels so good to get the kill. But youre always worried that someone is hunting you down and you must stay alert about that too.  When im not playing other games with friends, this is the game I go to.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine If you love going on cruises then this cruise is not for you. It is going to get dangerous and bloody...The Ship: Murder Party is a game I have been playing since its inception. Its only recently I have decided to buy it on Steam and keep it as my own and boy has time surely caught on...The Ship's objective is that you are a passenger on a cruise ship owned by Mr. X, your objective is to kill a random passenger you have been assigned to but a hunter is hunting you down too. Its a simple game but can be really fun to play alone or with your friendsThe game has shown its age and even now the game's menus don't work properly so much so that you have to take the long way round and play the multiplayer aspect differently. Thankfully people do still play this game however only at peak times do you find a lot of players playing the gameThe Ship does also offer a seperate tutorial and single player. The tutorial basically shows you the basics on how the game works and the single player offers you a story while showing the game's mechanics in action. For me, the single player is nothing special, even for new players, the single player is nothing special and could only be used to see how the mechanics work for a whileThe Ship: Murder Party has always been by my heart and I appreciate that a company like Blazing Griffin has taken the rights from the now defunct Outerlight and continued to perfect the gameThe big choice is whether you should get it. For players like me who remember playing this game back when it first came out, I'd say yes, just for the nostalgia, however for new players, I'd sadly say no, its too old and now the new owners of The Ship are making a remastered version of the old game so its best to wait for the remastered versionBut, its one hell of a bloody good time! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												The ship is all about the sneaky underhanded murder of your friends and loved ones in ship-based environments.Kill to win, but kill sneaky. penalties await those who are seen commiting murder or even just attempting it.Beware too, as you have to take care to satiate your characters many needs. Disregarding them is death.if all this sounds fun, then the ship is worth the money :)HOWEVER!The main server IS down, so you can't play it without some friends or some hassle.Guides will show you how to connect but the server number is pretty low.The game comes with a free (maybe two) copies, so getting a bunch of people to play with is comparatively easy, but considering the price there are better party games.THUS:Good time to be had, to an extent.Commit to forcing it on your friends.7/10would recomend more if properly supported, but as it is its a fun game -provided you find someone to play with			"

												The Ship is a unique game due to it being mainly a multiplayer style murder/simulation game. When you have a group of friends together and you play, even just 2 of you with bots it is fun. But when you get a full server it gets really good!All you need to do is monitor your characters needs throughout the cruise ship and find your target to get the kill before anyone else so you can beat the timer to the next contract. It can get really tense and is just a riot to play with friends!One big issue is the games available to play are very limited if any at all, so you may be playing bots more than real players. But again, get some friends together and you got yourself a party!			"

												This game is very(and I mean very ) worth it. The single player is nice when you want to enjoy a simple plot line. The game explains very well what you need to do and how you need to do it. In the beginning of the game you will probably feel invincible because it seems that no one is hunting you. You don't need to watch your back and you can actually enjoy doing some activities. As the game progresses, the npcs start hunting you. Now eating, peeing, and bathing starts to get a bit difficult and you become paranoid. Luckily, the single player campaign(or mode) is a short game, therefore, there is no need to worry.The multiplayer is very fun. In the multiplayer you can't be as relaxed as in the singleplayer. You got to get the supplies you need quickly or it may be to late, depending on who you are player with. So in the end, I think you should just get the game.			"

												This game is original, exciting and will probably never get old. And as a bonus on that they're planning on making a remastered verision of it, which you will get a 25 % off if you own this game in your steam library. About all these people talking about the dead servers that's not true. From what i've heard the in game browsing is broken so you have to find the servers another way. Go to the servers on the steam platform without having the game started and filter for the game there and you will see at least 10 servers to join, with a lot of private ones aswell.And no the developers aren't gone, the game just switched owners. And because of some weird legal stuff the new developers are not able to change anything in the current game, and that's why they're planning on making the remastered verision. The owners seem to be close to the players and are eager to answer questions and help the game(heard they even read all the reviews of the game so they could improve the new verision). So buy the game before it's too late, it's really fun :D			"

												If you hated the Assassins Creed multiplayer, this game isn't for you. But if you didn't hate it, you may like this. Its basically that except you must find your own weapons, manage needs, like eating and drinking, and it takes place on a ship of some sort (YOU DONT SAY). Win the round by reaching the victory money amount first. Be a hunter (passenger is spectator), and you will need to be a hunter or be the hunted. Good luck, try to survive!			"

												Grab a few friends, join each other in a single room (screens facing away) and just go to town with this game. It is so much fun being certain you're safe only to be gunned down by someone you never suspected was following you. Sneaking around in paranoia because one of your friends is being -too- quiet only to be taken down by a useless NPC causes both rage and laughter. I can't recommend this game enough if you have friends to play with it. The single player is pretty dull but at it's heart The Ship is a multiplayer game. Unfortunately the few servers which still seem to be played online are full of people who enjoy kicking people for no reason but I have spent 95% of my time playing this with friends and I'm sure I will keep coming back to it time and time again.

												I had wayyyy to much fun playing this.If you have a friend, it's great to fire up a server with bots, or join a regular server on your own. This has got to be one of the best games of its kind. You randomly will recieve a person you will have to kill before time runs out, if you fail, nothing happens, if you kill them you'll get money based on the weapon you use. However, you have to be extremely careful to not get noticed by a guard, or security camera.That would be too simple though! You have to be careful to more than just good guys, there's someone out to kill you as well! You're randomly selected to be someones target as well, and you'll never find out who until they attempt to kill you (or if they tell you, but what's the fun in that?).It's a great suspense and strategy game, trying to avoid being killed or seen, while still having to get your target away from the crowds.I would highly recommend this to basically anyone!

There are a few dedicated servers you can find using Steam's own server search option.If you need any more advice in getting this game, I recommend going on Youtube and look up any famous Youtuber such as Seananners or Chilledchaos doing gameplay of this title.  That should be more than enough to convince you.  All it takes is a couple of friends and a Friday night and you are golden.			"

												In this game, you're a passenger on a cruise ship. The ship is filled with weapons, and your job is to find a decent weapon and kill a certain passenger without being caught. But my favorite part of the ship is not the gameplay, but the ship itself. It's a lot of fun to mess around on the huge ship, blasting the guards, destroying all of the food, and even robbing the bank. Instead of killing my target, I just bring up the map, find the parts of the ship you're not supposed to be in, and shoot all the crew to loot the place before placing my secret stash of weapons under some dude's bed.

Only disappointing thing is that the storyline is somewhat very short and the entire game is finished within a matter of hours, which is really quite upsetting because you really do get sucked into the story here. This game is definitely worth the money, as it is quite cheap and delivers fun for a few hours :D			"

												The Ship Is a very enjoyable game, think of it like the sims and cluedo - except everyone is trying to kill each other. However because this game is fairly old the servers have been shut down. So dont be suprised if you have to go on the internet to find servers with players in them.			"

												This game is fun, even when it's just you and a bunch of dumb bots.It's really creative, and the story line is pretty brilliant. Try to find your victim, while trying to disguise yourself, outrun, and outsmart the one hunting you (and maybe kill him first!). To add to the strategy, you have needs that must be constantly watched (kinda like in The Sims -- hunger, bathroom, shower, sleep, social activity, etc.). But it's really not as cheesy as you might think.Sadly, though I've enjoyed playing with bots, I've never found other people to play with (granted it's been a year or so since I tried looking for players). This game would have been awesome in a full server.You can even choose to be a non-combatant and wander around messing with the people by being a bothersome witness; making them nervous; etc. :D			"

												This game is very unique in the way that it plays. Its a bit clunky, but it is very fun to play. its a game all about trickery and using various weapons to kill your target. It is also all about killing without being caught. The game can get boring after a number of hours, and can also feel lacklustre online with randoms. The way to get the best out of this game is to play it with friends and by trying out different modes, such as the world leaders mode. Overall this game has potential but ive lost the motivation to play it and so it shall be left behind, I might go back to it.Whitty's rating: 5/10			"

You play as a 87 year old meth seller named Robert Fagot whoes hard life on the streets has turned him into a god damn tank. A zombie outbreak occurs in northern Englad and you and your cat are the only two who can stop it. This game gets intense right away they dont ♥♥♥♥ around by holding your ♥♥♥♥, if you can't 1080 quick-no scope don't even try and play, the zombie will ♥♥♥♥ in your eyeball and ♥♥♥♥ you in the mouth.

												I bought The Ship: The Murder Party while it was on sale ($2.49) is definitely worth it because it is a great game. It's great with parties and making a server really isn't that hard. Many servers are also available on websites. It's just upsetting that the master server(s) aren't working anymore. Due to that fact, it shouldn't really be worth $9.99 unless that problem is fixed. The AIs are super fishy and creepy, so it is always better to play multiplayer. I also like how the game relates to ""Sims"" in a way (bathroom, hunger, etc.) but I feel like that ""Sims"" feel isn't making much of a difference in the game since it doesn't really add very much difficulty to the game. Besides the few flaws of this game, it is definitely worth to buy, but not with the original price until the servers are fixed. "

												Story: 6-the story is that this man Mr. X is making the passengers on a cruise play a ""game"" of kill or be killed The ones who don't play his ""game"" get killed anyways by outside sources like sharks and ect.                                                                                        Multiplayer: 8-the Multiplayer is the strong spot for this game Because it is the thing they want you to play to the point that they are planning to take single player off the market and sell it as a thing that comes with the multiplayer game.     Gameplay: 7-It is a fun game even if you are new to the game you can probebly get used to it a combo between Multiplayer and the story because the story makes the Multiplayer have meaning and with all of the diffrent modes You are sure to have a good time.Price: 8- they could bring it down by like 1 dollar but It is golden around were it is.In conclusion I say get the game it is a Fun game Just get it.

												Great fun, alone or with friend/s, and comes with two more versions of itself than necessary. It's basically first-person Cluedo, but everyone is the murderer. And that not only means that you have to hunt down and kill your quarry in the set time, but you yourself may be hunted, sometimes by more than one player. There is a constant barrage of needs that you must fulfill over the rounds you play, much like in the Sims, to avoid death and forfeiting aforesaid rounds. There is also a money/points system set up for best weapon kill, which rotates each round, to keep things interesting. Still surprising myself with the many sneaky ways you can go about hunting and finding out who's hunting you.			"

												The Ship is, for the most part, a good game. It's fun with friends and offers an interesting dynamic where you never know who your being hunted by or who you can trust. The game is especially fun with friends. The game has interesting weapons, some compelling mechanics such as disguises and surveillance officers. The game runs on the premise that everyone is a hunter and everyone is being hunted. You have only so long to kill your quarry after the first murderer on the server kills theirs. You can then steal some items off their corpse and even off innocent people you may have killed along the way. The art style is somewhat appealing, and has an almost TF2 look about it. Most of the maps are fun and gratifying to explore and some of the weapons like the poison in a syringe is just damn fun to use. The needs system is for the most part unique and interesting and gives killing your quarry an extra layer of difficulty.But...The game has a fair amount of flaws that make it unenjoyable in some spots. The game has a strict ""Kill Quarry Only"" policy that makes it hard to just screw around and have fun with friends, since, if you kill too many innocent people, you are (indefinitely in some cases) banned from the server. Some of the maps are way too damn big, or are just straight up horrible to play on. The needs, while there for the soul purpose of making your life difficult, are ridiculous sometimes. For instance, why in the hell, when I'm about to kill my quarry, should my character stop everything he's doing and go, ""Nope. No way am I killing this guy, until I've read me some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Shakespeare."" The Single Player and Tutorial versions that are treated like entirely separate games, are essentially pointless because the game just isn't fun without friends. And don't worry. The game has made it a priority to make it as frustrating and unnecessarily difficult as possible for you to connect with your friends and play the game properly. The in-game server list does not work. You MUST use the one accessed through the Options menu or you can't play with friends.All in all I do recommend this game, but only if you have friends to play it with. "

												Grab a few friends, join each other in a single room (screens facing away) and just go to town with this game. It is so much fun being certain you're safe only to be gunned down by someone you never suspected was following you. Sneaking around in paranoia because one of your friends is being -too- quiet only to be taken down by a useless NPC causes both rage and laughter. I can't recommend this game enough if you have friends to play with it. The single player is pretty dull but at it's heart The Ship is a multiplayer game. Unfortunately the few servers which still seem to be played online are full of people who enjoy kicking people for no reason but I have spent 95% of my time playing this with friends and I'm sure I will keep coming back to it time and time again.

												This game is very(and I mean very ) worth it. The single player is nice when you want to enjoy a simple plot line. The game explains very well what you need to do and how you need to do it. In the beginning of the game you will probably feel invincible because it seems that no one is hunting you. You don't need to watch your back and you can actually enjoy doing some activities. As the game progresses, the npcs start hunting you. Now eating, peeing, and bathing starts to get a bit difficult and you become paranoid. Luckily, the single player campaign(or mode) is a short game, therefore, there is no need to worry.The multiplayer is very fun. In the multiplayer you can't be as relaxed as in the singleplayer. You got to get the supplies you need quickly or it may be to late, depending on who you are player with. So in the end, I think you should just get the game.			"

												The Ship shows just how important it is to carefully design every aspect of your game. Everything from the weapons to the maps is designed to be simple and easily accessible while still rewarding players with an attention to detail.The Ship is a great game for people who don't much care for multiplayer FPS games and instead want something a little more 'clever'.However, a word of warning. There are not a lot of servers for The Ship and, at the time of writing this, the Server Browser doesn't really work. So, I recommend you look up some servers on the internet, then add the IP addresses to your favorites to easily access the servers. Even if you don't live in the countries where these servers are located, don't worry. The Ship is surprisingly forgiving when it comes to latency. 200-250 ping is usually good enough for you to kill your way to the top 3.Once you get past all that, you're looking at one of the most well designed multiplayer experiences ever made. If you've taken a brief look, and you like what you see, get it. It is well worth the money.			"

												The Ship, gifted to me by a friend and I love this game. You do not need a cutting Edge computer to play it but the graphics are not dirt. This game is fun and addicting with a single player with a great story and the online is not laggy it is not buggy and most of the servers dont crash or randomly disconnect you. The game is $20.00 and that is not too much unless you only buy a $20.00 Steam Card.This was the first paid game I played on Steam and it is by far one of the best. I need to get a better computer after seeing the huge library of games on Steam and seeing that I cannot run a lot of the games. I definetley reccomend this game and it is worth your money.			"

												Don't buy this game, it's a scam and it shouldn't be on the store as it is right now. Even if your computer meets the recommended requirements there is a very high chance that the game won't work inmediately after instalation. Then after reading in the forums you'll probably try two so called ""solutions"", after that there is a high chance neither will work, so you'll start trying to contact steam support by this time. After they answer they'll tell you to refresh the steam files and verify the game cache with an automated message, both suggestions are useless since what's wrong is the game not steam. And then you will run out of options and you will finally realize you have been scammed.On the bright side there's a slight chance that the game will work inmediately after installation and then you will notice the game server is messed up and you can only enter a game by inputting the adress and port of a server manually, which is not that bad considering you are at least able to play the game.

												Really fun game with quite interesting mechanics. You are trapped on a Ship along with other Players, having to murder each other to win the competition. Each player is assigned to the other in a pair. A Hunter and the Hunted. A Hunter is trying to find and kill the Hunted one, while the Hunted one is most likely a Hunter to someone else and tries to find them and kill them.So basically you really need to watch your back, as anyone might try to plot to kill you, perhaps waiting for the moment when you go to sleep... Yes, sleep. In the game you have to sustain your character's needs via sleep, eating, drinking, talking and reading books/entertaining. Think of it as The Sims with a twisted plot where characters must kill each other off.Also... Killing people won't win you the game. Killing them in the most paying way will earn you the victory. Each kill is awarding amount of money based on the weapon you use to kill someone (unless you use environment, like the Freezer/Life-Boats.)Amazing game, fun to play 1v1, but it is recommended to play on the server with other players. You can also play alone against bots. They sometimes can surprise you, but most of the time they are slightly disappointing.10/10 - Recommended.			"

												This game could of been an epic mulitplayer murder detective game, they have a fully customisable outfits, NPC's that you can talk to, sim's style needs, shops, restarunts, all fhe features are there for a great game, in  which NONE are used in any of the game types. Its a crime beyond belief, the players and the imersive ship enviroment are never brought together. As a result no one played it when it was released, and no one plays it now.I't really needs a 2 teir objective system, yes the hunt to kill your quarry, but another objective system that imerses you into the ship and makes & rewards you actually act like a passenger on a ship, instead of treating it as a deathmatch arena.Outerlight released a 2nd game (BGT) with the exact same issues and subsequently went bust.

												Murder your friends.The servers are no longer supported so you have to search for open servers outside of the game (and there's only 3 maybe).The game is played with a number of bots to fill the boat with ""people-who-aren't-your-target"". You're given a target to go murder discretely (or at least not on camera or in front of guards) while at the same time you're looking over your shoulder for your hunter. You also have ""The Sims""-like needs to manage at the same time.It's an interesting extension from its Half-Life 1 mod and makes for a really fun game to play with friends. Because you never know if your pal is going to be shanking you in a few seconds.			"

												I own The Ship for a couple of years now. It really is very entertaining.Not the standard FPS, but that makes it even better!You can poison your enemy's, set them on fire with a flare gun or lock them inside a sauna and let them fry.+ It has some elements from The Sims in it, you have to feed yourself, stay clean, stay sane and go potty every once in awhile. Else you DIIEEE!BUT!The only problem to this date is, the community is dead. It's very hard to find a server with some life on it.And well I wouldn't recommand playing vs NPC's cause that's just plane boring.So my recommendation, only buy this if you're gonna play with friends or your money will be wasted.

												When I first saw this game I saved it to my wishlist to come take a closer look at it again. I picked it up for half off on sale because it looked like a quirky game with interesting PvP mechanics, what I hadn't noticed is that the game was actually from 2006.The Ship is very fun and exciting starting out and discovering all of her quirks. But after coming back for a few days playing a few matches it lost the momentum, I've mostly stopped returning. I would however have a lot more fun If I got together with some mates and played together as the game can get high-strung and hilarious. Cons- First off, you can no longer acess servers directly in-game. You have to look them up in steams view --> servers --> filter/The Ship.- The text in each corner showing you where you and your mark are can get greally difficult to read, especially because the colors often match the enviroment.- There's no point in ulitlizing the shops and pulling out cash because there are stored outfits and weapons everywhere.- Hallways and doorthresholds can often create impasses as characters cannot get around each other, and your stuck fidgeting for a hole minute or some jackass won't let you leave the room.- The UI wasn't well planned, as I'm learning the map I'm tired of having to look in the top corner, then all the way to the bottom and then center again, it's tiring.Pros+ The gameplay is unique+ Good mark payout system+ Gameplay is generally fun, and exciting.+ Several different maps to learn+ An additional needs system (although most are easily taken care of if you're arrested+ Sense of satisfaction when finding your mark, or pre-emptivly killing who was supposed to kill you.

												I love The Ship, always fun to play with friends. I don't know why it says i have less than 5 hours played, I've played at least 20+ hours of it. Anyway, it might be glitched for you when you try to find a server, but if you look online theres always a place that has the IP's listed for you.Killing your target is always satisfying, even if you only get 100$ for it.

												I bought The Ship: The Murder Party while it was on sale ($2.49) is definitely worth it because it is a great game. It's great with parties and making a server really isn't that hard. Many servers are also available on websites. It's just upsetting that the master server(s) aren't working anymore. Due to that fact, it shouldn't really be worth $9.99 unless that problem is fixed. The AIs are super fishy and creepy, so it is always better to play multiplayer. I also like how the game relates to ""Sims"" in a way (bathroom, hunger, etc.) but I feel like that ""Sims"" feel isn't making much of a difference in the game since it doesn't really add very much difficulty to the game. Besides the few flaws of this game, it is definitely worth to buy, but not with the original price until the servers are fixed. "

												This is a brilliant game, the basic idea is this:Up to 30 players spawn on a ship, and each player is given a target to kill, however, someone is also trying to kill you. You must search the ship for weapons, food (you have to eat, drink, shower, etc) and try and be the last player standing.Hopefully the recent sale will remedy the very small playerbase, most of the time there are less than 10 players playing.If you see it on sale, grab it!

												This is a great game, the player base is dwindling a bit, but there is constantly at least 50-60 people playing.  I enjoy the unique gameplay and the clever game rules that make this game intense and sometimes even scary.  You tend to your random character and are assigned a person to murder.  The clever bit is that you get money based on how not used a weapon is/ more money for weapons that have not been used.  Great game I would wait for sales as those times are when the player amount skyrockets.  Fun with friends as well!			"

												Murder your friends.The servers are no longer supported so you have to search for open servers outside of the game (and there's only 3 maybe).The game is played with a number of bots to fill the boat with ""people-who-aren't-your-target"". You're given a target to go murder discretely (or at least not on camera or in front of guards) while at the same time you're looking over your shoulder for your hunter. You also have ""The Sims""-like needs to manage at the same time.It's an interesting extension from its Half-Life 1 mod and makes for a really fun game to play with friends. Because you never know if your pal is going to be shanking you in a few seconds.			"

The goal is to kill your targets and make the most money, while avoiding being killed yourself.I threw a purse bomb at him while he was taking a dump, got shot while I thought I was in a safe zone (my friend was just outside the safe zone, behind the guards) and we ended up throwing fire axes at each other across the bow of the ship.Pros:It's hilariousThere's a massive selection of weaponsThe needs system keeps you moving around the ship so nobody can just camp in the toiletsYou essentially get 5 copies for £15 (one for you +2 gift copies, then the two friends that receive those gifts get another gift copy each) so it works out to £3 each which is pretty cheap for the fun that can be hadCons:Creating a server can be annoyingYou can't find a server to play on unless you know the IP to connect to			"

												I am very satisfied with the gameplay. If you like assasination and murder games, this is for you! Try and kill your quarry, but don't get caught! Also be careful your quarry doesn't kill you before you kill them. Don't kill anyone else but them, but remember, you're being hunted too! The only people you can kill besides your target are random noobs that attack you for absolutely no reason, and your hunter. This game is also hilarious when it comes to killing with all the interesting weapons! Whoever gains the most money in the end wins the hunt. But besides hunting, you have to take care of yourself too. You're only human. Eat, drink, bathe, entertain yourself, and do pretty much everything you would need to do in real life. It's like a combination of The Sims and murder games. Also, with your purchase you get TWO extra gifts to send to your Steam friends! Also, each friend who gets it will get yet another gift to send, but only one, not two. This game spreads like a plague! :P10/10Example of how this game gives you a smashin' good time from my own experience: I set fire to a man and finished him with an axe. While he was peeing.			"

												A brilliant, stylised murder mystery simulator; where you take the role of one of a group of hunters all out to kill one another or a witness enjoying their cruise. Gameplay is split between stealth, murdering people and tending to your needs - think of Cludeo crossed with the Sims - and its all wrapped up in a variety of 1950s nautical settings. For a source mod released in 2006, the game boasts an impressive amount of multiplayer gameplay types, an arcade mode with just bots and a single player campaign with tutorials.If you’re weighing up whether the game is worth it and considering buying it with some friends, it should be mentioned that you receive two extra passes for the game, gifting of which will each give another pass; effectively giving five copies for the price shown on the store page.

												The multiplayer is fun, even with bots, but the Campaign is absolute rubbish. It's a tale of good idea, good elements, but NO dev support. I will most certainly buy the sequel for this game, but I would like to firmly reccomend this game. It's gameplay isn't for everyone though (look it up on Youtube, it's kind of like the Sims if it were a 1920's massacre simulator) and on easy the bots get stuck in corners and behind doors. I'd like to clarify this much; although buggy, I still reccomend it even if it has (sadly) no multiplayer community, the bots are enough to satisify even the pickiest of the connoisseurs of the strange multiplayer games I tend to delve into.

												Instead of telling you about the game I will just tell you exactly what happened through a round with just me and my friend and some random bots. It started with me spawning with my random looking and named character walking out of my room looking to the left at a set of two people wandering around. I look to the top right and see my friend as my quarry wich means you must kill them in a set time limit I then searched the deck entirely for gear what I found was just what I needed. A blunderbuss, a shortsword, a wallet bomb, a good bit of food and drink, and some spare clothes in case i needed to disguise. I walked out the room saw my friend chasing his quarry around like a retard with an umbrella. After I finished laughing I heard him say he is taking the elavator down in a bit to search for some more gear other than his ""Godly"" Umbrella. I quickly ran to the elavator opened it up and went in then closed it. He pressed the button to bring up the elevator i took out my blunderbuss and ♥♥♥ the doors spread open he sat there and all i heard was his girly scream, my blunderbuss going off, my ridiculous laughter, then him crying/laughing in the background.

												When I first saw this game I saved it to my wishlist to come take a closer look at it again. I picked it up for half off on sale because it looked like a quirky game with interesting PvP mechanics, what I hadn't noticed is that the game was actually from 2006.The Ship is very fun and exciting starting out and discovering all of her quirks. But after coming back for a few days playing a few matches it lost the momentum, I've mostly stopped returning. I would however have a lot more fun If I got together with some mates and played together as the game can get high-strung and hilarious. Cons- First off, you can no longer acess servers directly in-game. You have to look them up in steams view --> servers --> filter/The Ship.- The text in each corner showing you where you and your mark are can get greally difficult to read, especially because the colors often match the enviroment.- There's no point in ulitlizing the shops and pulling out cash because there are stored outfits and weapons everywhere.- Hallways and doorthresholds can often create impasses as characters cannot get around each other, and your stuck fidgeting for a hole minute or some jackass won't let you leave the room.- The UI wasn't well planned, as I'm learning the map I'm tired of having to look in the top corner, then all the way to the bottom and then center again, it's tiring.Pros+ The gameplay is unique+ Good mark payout system+ Gameplay is generally fun, and exciting.+ Several different maps to learn+ An additional needs system (although most are easily taken care of if you're arrested+ Sense of satisfaction when finding your mark, or pre-emptivly killing who was supposed to kill you.

												This game is one of my all time favourites.The ship is about you and other passangers being captured in a ship and petted against eachother.but there are rules like dont get caught infront of a camera or a guard when killing your designated target.you also have to keep your eyes on your needs to eat,sleep,keep your hygene and go to the bathroom all the while watching out for the one chasing you.frankly i dont think this game has gotten the attension it deserves probably because its name is ""the ship"" ( i actually thought it was some kind of ship simulator or something the first time i heard of it)and because of that the multiplayer is sadly dead.so i recommend this for players that like to play with their friends as a group or those who just want to play a fun singleplayer game.

												This is an amazing game! It's fairly simple, it features a bunch of people who have to kill each other on a ship, sort've like in Gosick, and you must win by making the most money off of the killings... At least in one gamemode. Not a lot of people know about the gamemodes from what I've seen, and things like Elimination and Deathmatch are really fun. Nothing like running around shooting people with a thompson on tons of different maps. Oh yeah, there's also stats you need to keep up with. I usually take care of those in the in-game jail. Also, this game is a perfect game to listen to the song ""Kuusou Mesorogiwi"" because it is so fitting for it.			"

												The Ship is honestly a very fun game to play with friends, has its very funny moments when you're not expecting someone to be the killer and they randomly just pull a gun or weapon on you. I found the most amazing part of the game was when you were playing against other people, you could actually bluff with your weapons and make them kill you to have them lose money.I honestly recommend this game to play with friends, it was a whole bunch of fun with my friends and it was quite enjoyable when I got to throw pool cues at random players and my friends continuously.

												The Ship shows just how important it is to carefully design every aspect of your game. Everything from the weapons to the maps is designed to be simple and easily accessible while still rewarding players with an attention to detail.The Ship is a great game for people who don't much care for multiplayer FPS games and instead want something a little more 'clever'.However, a word of warning. There are not a lot of servers for The Ship and, at the time of writing this, the Server Browser doesn't really work. So, I recommend you look up some servers on the internet, then add the IP addresses to your favorites to easily access the servers. Even if you don't live in the countries where these servers are located, don't worry. The Ship is surprisingly forgiving when it comes to latency. 200-250 ping is usually good enough for you to kill your way to the top 3.Once you get past all that, you're looking at one of the most well designed multiplayer experiences ever made. If you've taken a brief look, and you like what you see, get it. It is well worth the money.			"

												The Ship is a combination of Assassin's Creed Multiplayer and The Sims. You need to hunt down and kill your given target, all the while not getting detected, or killed by another player and at the same time tend to your needs. This game can be pretty tense as you only have so much time to kill your target. You also need to bag as much money as possible; so you need to search for high money weapons. The amount of money you get for killing someone with a certain weapon varies. Some areas of a map are under surveillance so if you get caught you lose money, all your weapons and opportunities to kill your target. Other people will be out to get you too so keep watch, otherwise you lose everything in your inventory. Tending to your needs can be difficult as well; as you will spend a lot of time trying to find and kill your target. All of these gameplay mechanics make the game fairly tricky, but it is a good challenge and a very enjoyable game that I highly recommend.			"

												This game is a great game to play with your friends. No matter how many people you have, be it 2, 3, 4, and beyond, all the bots ensure that no game is empty. Beating your friends in this game is a thrilling experience, and it's an all around great game.			"

												Very fun in arcade. I like all of the gamemodes all the weapons the maps everything about this game is goodsadly no one plays it anymore and best of all if comes with two steam gifts of The Ship: Murder Party and The Ship: Singleplayer. Go in the fourms if you want this for free because everyone is giving it away. I recommend it very fun on multiplayer (with attual people not bots) i give this a 9/10.			"

												I bought this a while ago through the ""Ship Compete Pack"" and was pleasently suprised that it came with extra copies. Those were promptly sent to my friends and before long we were engaging in all sorts of wonderfully nailbiting hunts aboard Mr. X's shipThe legit ""single player"" version is ok, serving as more a tutorial than any real purpose. The real fun comes when you play The Ship against Bots, or better yet your friends in LAN Connectionthen the error came (and apparently im unique in this complaint)For some reason or another it decided that it doesnt even like THINKING about multiplayer, and will crash HARD whenever I tried to do so. So naturally I contacted publisher with a generic ""WTF"" email. The publisher took 3 weeks and only said words to the effect of ""No clue whats going on, talk to steam"". Then i contacted steam and was promptly advised to contact the publisherEven after uninstalling it, reinstalling it, CCcleaning it, reinstalling it 5 total times... it has yet to fix the crippling bugSo while the game provides unending fun in both bot mode and multiplayer mode, the issue i experienced (and its decided lack of help) makes me regretfully unable to reccomend this game			"

												The Ship is an interesting game, if you've ever been a fan of Noir crime like Poirot or And then there were none, with a hilarous twist of dark humor this is for you. As you are pitted to murder each other by a man in a mask you must use what ever comes to hand be it croquee mallet or brbeque fork to end your target's pitiful life, a very simple and well done game, although is suffering from some serious glitches. TIP IF YOU BUY THE GAME, to access multiplayer click view at the top of the navigation bar while outside of the game and then click server, narrow the search to view only the ship servers and join game's via that. Trying to join via the game itself will not work, you must do it this way.			"

												The Ship's multiplayer mode is pretty hilarious. Frustrating at times, but hilarious. It can be difficult to find populated servers, a hassle really, but (at least at time of writing) they are going out of their way to re-populate the game by giving you four free passes (two for you to send out, then each of those friends get another to send) so perhaps it will become the thriving game it should be eventually...

Only reason why most people think game dead is because they never learn to check the forum and find out that only way to find servers is to do it from Steam > View > Servers and filter to the ship. The problem may not get fix at all because Dev that made this game are gone and only way get to any server is from the filter.

												set sail for adventure with the ship, the game where you assassinate george bush for money. the object of this game is to kill your perp before time runs out. its also a sims game with guns because your character apparently has to eat a bag of chips before they brutally murder someone with an umbrella or they need to wash their hands before the bash someone on the head with a lead pipe or even take a ♥♥♥♥ before they gun someone down with a tommy gun. its gets very tedious to make your person happy before you kill someone. however, you cant just grab any weapon. you gotta use the most expensive weapon, and when you do, the more money you get, the more you get closer to winning. all you have to do is find an expensive weapon, sit on a chair, then follow your perp and kill them. but its not that easy either, you gotta be elusive ans stuff and gets hard because everyone is suspicious. also another thing is that the servers do not work at all, so you gotta go into steam and do all that manual server search. nobody ever plays anyway. and most of the servers have killers who dont even care who they kill. toot oot			"

												It's a multiplayer game (with bots if you would like) in which you are assigned a target to kill without being caught. The less effective the weapon the more money you get. The more money you get the higher score you get. It's really, really fun. Plus, you can make it so all of the players are world leaders (nothing like killing George W. Bush as Raul Castro). It's almost like the one gamemode from Assassin's Creed where you try to hunt your target while being targeted at the same time. A SAW puzzle, if you will, with a lot of humor, fun, and addicting, great gameplay.Score: 10/10			"

												Catching the game in Halloween sale, this is definitely an unexpectedly well made game.Starting with a solid tutorial, an interesting singleplayer and of course, the multiplayer that is quite entertaining with at least one or two friends playing with you.Last point is very easily achieved because with every purchase you get two additional copies of the game ready to be gifted to friends. Once activated by them, they also get one copy to share...So basically you pay less than 5€ for the game itself. And it's definitely worth it!The names you get, the persons, how they look, what you can use as a weapon and all the funny moments (watch the kinda epic trailer) make the game pretty damn solid.The bots can be configured to play with you, although they are quite stupid. But watching them getting caught by the officers trying to commit a murder is somehow entertaining.But there is one major drawback after all: Too few people are playing it!After all, you are not dependant on the developers to play the game in multiplayer, so catch it when it is on sale or share the price with your friends...

The goal is to kill your targets and make the most money, while avoiding being killed yourself.I threw a purse bomb at him while he was taking a dump, got shot while I thought I was in a safe zone (my friend was just outside the safe zone, behind the guards) and we ended up throwing fire axes at each other across the bow of the ship.Pros:It's hilariousThere's a massive selection of weaponsThe needs system keeps you moving around the ship so nobody can just camp in the toiletsYou essentially get 5 copies for £15 (one for you +2 gift copies, then the two friends that receive those gifts get another gift copy each) so it works out to £3 each which is pretty cheap for the fun that can be hadCons:Creating a server can be annoyingYou can't find a server to play on unless you know the IP to connect to			"

												I really hate that you can't really host a server if you have a router so your friends can play with you without having to play on the very few servers out there that who knows who you have to play with and probably won't be the game mode you want to play, but if you don't have a router and you're connected dirrectly to internet, or you have a router and you have a friend that can host it or want just to play in your LAN, this game is really fantastic, great, awesome, killing your friends with many weapons is really fun.

												It's a nice game, but only if you manage to get one of those copies that are going around for really cheap. It is not a long game at all, but it's fun. Sadly the multiplayer function is kind of broken and you have to search for individual IPs on internet. Most servers are empty or full of bots generally, but once in a while you find one with people and it's extremely... Not fun, entertaining. God, I felt like my heart was about to blow up when I saw my victim right in front of me while trying to not get caught. Totally reccomend, if obtained for the right price. 7/10.			"

												Got gifted this by my friend and had a short game session with him (a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get the multiplayer working tbh but we got it sorted). The goal is to kill your targets and make the most money, while avoiding being killed yourself.I threw a purse bomb at him while he was taking a dump, got shot while I thought I was in a safe zone (my friend was just outside the safe zone, behind the guards) and we ended up throwing fire axes at each other across the bow of the ship.Pros:It's hilariousThere's a massive selection of weaponsThe needs system keeps you moving around the ship so nobody can just camp in the toiletsYou essentially get 5 copies for £15 (one for you +2 gift copies, then the two friends that receive those gifts get another gift copy each) so it works out to £3 each which is pretty cheap for the fun that can be hadCons:Creating a server can be annoyingYou can't find a server to play on unless you know the IP to connect to			"

												A really interesting and under-appreciated experience. I've been playing this game intermittently for 7 years and it still feels a fresh and original experience.The game is first-person built on the little dated but reliable Source engine. To win you must earn a certain amount of money. Cash can be used to buy food, items, healing etc and to earn it you must find, identify and covertly kill your assigned target while ensuring that you are not yourself killed by the anonymous player assigned to hunt you. More interesting and unique methods of assassination earn you a greater reward. If you are killed by your hunter you will be out of the round and you will be unable to earn anything until the next round.While doing all this you have to maintain your basic human needs; eating, drinking, sleeping, washing etc which if neglected will disable you and bring about your early demise. This clever little mechanic ensure you can't just camp in a safe place and wait out a battle, and gives your hunter the opportunity to catch you unawares. You must kill your target covertly; if you are witnessed brandishing a weapon either by security, cameras or multiple witnesses you have your weapons confiscate, be put into prison for a set amount of time, and fined a heavy penalty. Not only does this delay the elimination of your target, it also leaves you in a very vulnerable situation to whoever is hunting you. The art and level design add significantly to the experience. Set on a variety of 1920's era cruise ships the art style is stylish, lighthearted and a little slapstick.  The level design is fantastic; each map has all kinds of secret locations, stashes and traps that make them a joy to explore. Even after playing for many years I still discover new exciting details. One thing to remember is that this game is meant to be enjoyed as a multiplayer experience. While the AI passengers can sometimes catch you out, and are suitable for practice, it's broadly speaking pretty dumb and doesn't offer much of a challenge. The AI is most useful for padding out the number of passengers on a cruise, making identification and execution of your human target more of a challenge, indeed doing your best to imitate the sometimes strange behavior of the AI can be an excellent technique to lure you target into a false sense of security.There are only really two criticism I can make of this game; The first is a little unfair given its age but worth mentioning. There is a limited population in the online servers which can make finding an enjoyable populated game a little difficult. Luckily buying the game contains 2 additional copies free which gives you some copies to share with friends which is a pretty good deal. Especially considering there is no joy quite like hearing the frustration of a good friend when you catch them out and brutally eliminate their avatar. Secondly the learning curve can be a little steep. However I believe there are a single player and tutorial package included now although I have yet to try them. On the other hand its pretty easy to pick up with playing with a friendly experience player.  tl;dr a unique multi-player assassination experience that is still worth the asking price despite its age. Best shared with friends.			"

Its a crime beyond belief, the players and the imersive ship enviroment are never brought together. As a result no one played it when it was released, and no one plays it now.I't really needs a 2 teir objective system, yes the hunt to kill your quarry, but another objective system that imerses you into the ship and makes & rewards you actually act like a passenger on a ship, instead of treating it as a deathmatch arena.Outerlight released a 2nd game (BGT) with the exact same issues and subsequently went bust.

You randomly will recieve a person you will have to kill before time runs out, if you fail, nothing happens, if you kill them you'll get money based on the weapon you use. However, you have to be extremely careful to not get noticed by a guard, or security camera.That would be too simple though! You have to be careful to more than just good guys, there's someone out to kill you as well! You're randomly selected to be someones target as well, and you'll never find out who until they attempt to kill you (or if they tell you, but what's the fun in that?).It's a great suspense and strategy game, trying to avoid being killed or seen, while still having to get your target away from the crowds.I would highly recommend this to basically anyone!

												Murder your friends.The servers are no longer supported so you have to search for open servers outside of the game (and there's only 3 maybe).The game is played with a number of bots to fill the boat with ""people-who-aren't-your-target"". You're given a target to go murder discretely (or at least not on camera or in front of guards) while at the same time you're looking over your shoulder for your hunter. You also have ""The Sims""-like needs to manage at the same time.It's an interesting extension from its Half-Life 1 mod and makes for a really fun game to play with friends. Because you never know if your pal is going to be shanking you in a few seconds.			"

Some things that the developers could work on is getting around the ai because it's very hard to walk around someone!! Overall great game I would give it a 7/10.			"

												This game is fun, but it needs people in order to make it so.  Even though it says that there are no servers available, thankfully some people have learned to walk around that.  There are a few dedicated servers you can find using Steam's own server search option.If you need any more advice in getting this game, I recommend going on Youtube and look up any famous Youtuber such as Seananners or Chilledchaos doing gameplay of this title.  That should be more than enough to convince you.  All it takes is a couple of friends and a Friday night and you are golden.			"

												I've never read anything by Agatha Cristie but I've seen plenty of Poriot on Masterpiece Theater so I know what I'm talking about here: This is a pretty fun game but annoying. First of all, if I'm on a boat full of potential murderers the last thing I'm going to be doing is worrying about where I can get my hands on a bag of chips. Matches on average last about thirty minutes, so why does my character have to use the bathroom five or more times a game? Why do the DIE if they don't make it to the bathroom in time?The whole ordeal reminds me too much of The Sims, where the needs of my character is a delicate system of checks and balances. Once one need is satisfied it throws all the other needs wildly out of order until the whole game devolves into a mad dash to get to the bathroom, then to eat, then to take a shower and so on and so forth until one can't help but completely forget that they were supposed to kill someone.

I have been playing this for little more than one hour and already experienced a rich array of the most varied bugs. Crash on loading, crash during the game, crash on exiting, freezes that makes you force close the application, the steam-can't-connect-to-master-server bug, every other time I launch the game I hear a splash screen (yes, you understood that right, I open the application and goes directly to the main menu, then I open again and I HEAR the splash screen but never see anything).

It really is very entertaining.Not the standard FPS, but that makes it even better!You can poison your enemy's, set them on fire with a flare gun or lock them inside a sauna and let them fry.+ It has some elements from The Sims in it, you have to feed yourself, stay clean, stay sane and go potty every once in awhile. Else you DIIEEE!BUT!The only problem to this date is, the community is dead. It's very hard to find a server with some life on it.And well I wouldn't recommand playing vs NPC's cause that's just plane boring.So my recommendation, only buy this if you're gonna play with friends or your money will be wasted.

												Fun game. Like others say - made to be a multiplayer game.For that reason it's pretty annoying that the online isn't working how it should, but you can still find IP's to connect to via a website (instructions on steam).As long as you can get the online function working it's a good game. Fun graphics and weapons. Short rounds so plenty of action.			"

												A game which hinges on it's multiplayer community. It's basically the Assassin live-action game rule set. It's a silly game to have some fun with, but doesn't have a well balanced sense of play.Everyone is huntering another person on the ship, and your goal is to kill your target with the most valuable item at the time to earn the most cash before the round is over. If you die by another person hunting you, your hunt is over for that turn. But, if anyone else that kills you during that match, you can still hunt down your quarry.The game tries to discourage camping, but the negative effects doesn't rise fast enough before any single match is over to prevent camping a safe spot. Additionally, there isn't too much to discourage people from out right murdering everyone they see. If they are already behind in the game, the deduction on killing someone not as your quarry will remove some cash.If you're looking to have some laughs, this is a good game to grab and play with your friends. But you might struggle to find a sense of balanced play if anyone decides to play cheesy.			"

												Very fun game to play with friends. Maybe even better if using mic. You are given a target (another player)  you need to kill in a certain time, and at the same time you are also the target for another player. You gain money for each kill you make and the more peculiar is the weapon, the more money you gain.I already appreciated this kind of gameplay, which has also have a The sims like stats. You are still a human being, so you also need to eat, drink, sleep and so on, and this is makes the game really interesting to play. Probably best with friends, especially since the servers aren't that full of players, mostly bots. Graphics are so-so. Nothing special, but neither bad.I recommend it to buy if on sale, if you are searching for a simple multiplayer game.			"

												The Ship is a take on a first person shooter. You can either become a spectator or a hunter. If you choose to become a spectator you get to board the ship as a spectator and you can interact with other players but you can not loot or kill people but can yourself be killed as an innocent bystander. If you however choose to become a hunter you also board the ship but you can loot people and containers in order to get weapons, once you have some weapons you will be given a target; who if you have identified you will have a picture of; you will also be given a location where they where last identified by someone. If you have not identified them yourselves you will only be given the rough location. Once you track down your target it is your job to kill them in the most unique way with the weapons not used in a while giving you more money then those used recently. To increase the difficulty you must also kill them whilst not in view of any cameras or staff and depending on the settings other people in general or you will be sent to the onboard prison. Finally you also have to interact like a standard human being ensuring that you eat, drink, sleep, entertain yourself aswell as using the bathroom for the toilet and for cleaning purposes. However the server list on steam is broken :( and you will have to look on the internet to find some of The Ship servers. I should also note that the graphics on this game serve it well but its not going to win any awards in anyones books. However this game is great fun and I would highly recommend it to people who want to have some fun.10/10			"

The Sims-like elements really adds an extra challenge to the game, and opens the gameplay up to a lot of hillarous situations.

												This game is the best of all time.I am so happy for it.I play it so much, and its never boring.You are a kind of an assassin.Mr x gives you the target and you have to kill him, but in the singleplayer you must escape the ship and there are 10 chapters to play.The game is old but its still an awesome and excellent game in all my years of gaming.Hope this comment was enough for you guys and girls cause i dont want to spoile the fun on the game.Good luck! ;)			"

												Spend first half of time playing trying to figure out how to connect to a server,finially join a server, after a while get a purse bomb, accientally kill about half the players,get automatically kicked and banned for an hour.This happened in a span of 80 minutes.(aside from the ban)probably the least enjoyable part, at least for me, is the slow pace caused by slow character speeds, and virtually useless running.

You must search the ship for weapons, food (you have to eat, drink, shower, etc) and try and be the last player standing.Hopefully the recent sale will remedy the very small playerbase, most of the time there are less than 10 players playing.If you see it on sale, grab it!

												THE SHIP – A TWISTED FPS SIMS GAME THAT YOU'RE NOT PLAYING.  The Ship is a game by Outerlight that is available on Steam.  It's a curious little game, a mixture of first person shooter, The Sims, and Clue.  However, instead of a mansion, you're on a cruise liner and instead of trying to solve a murder, you're trying to off your fellow passengers.  The premise of The Ship is that you're one of the hapless passengers stuck on a cruise liner, prisoner to the mysterious Mr. X.  In order to amuse him, the passengers are tasked with offing each other with weapons, both esoteric and mundane, located on the ship.  There are some rules:  Each passenger is assigned a particular target to kill and will get money based on the method of killing them.  Some weapons are worth more than others.  You get nothing if you kill someone you're not assigned.  Also, you must kill your quarry without being seen.  Guards and security cameras are positioned all over the ship.  Kill carefully!			"

												Very fun game to play with friends. Maybe even better if using mic. You are given a target (another player)  you need to kill in a certain time, and at the same time you are also the target for another player. You gain money for each kill you make and the more peculiar is the weapon, the more money you gain.I already appreciated this kind of gameplay, which has also have a The sims like stats. You are still a human being, so you also need to eat, drink, sleep and so on, and this is makes the game really interesting to play. Probably best with friends, especially since the servers aren't that full of players, mostly bots. Graphics are so-so. Nothing special, but neither bad.I recommend it to buy if on sale, if you are searching for a simple multiplayer game.			"

												Simplified Review: This game will break friendships 5x faster than Mario Kart, and that's not an easy accomplishment.Actual Review: The game is complex, unforgiving, and undying fun. You have to pay attention to everything and  never let your guard down, and if you do, you'll wish you didn't. You must hunt your quarry, before YOUR hunter hunts you. Search every container you can find, and if you see a weapon you fancy, grab it. But when you get that weapon, keep it holstered until you see your quarry. Security Guards and cameras are everywhere, and boy do they make you regret everything and let your rage out on chat (it happens sometimes, trust me). If you're smart enough to know all this, it pays off gloriously. The satisfaction you have when you kill your quarry is like the satisfaction when you pass a test, you think you can't do it, but then you work hard and finish well. Hopefully, you can be high on the leaderboard by following the normal procedures needed. The only problem I have encountered in this game is it's bugs and difficult multiplayer browser. Overall, the game is one of the lil' gems tucked in Steam's growing library. If you can get it on a sale.FINAL VERDICT: 8.5/10			"

												A hidden gem in the Steam store, The Ship is easily capable of giving you tense and suspenseful gameplay. You'll have the goal of hunting someone down and killing them (without being noticed) while another person is chasing you. It makes you panic from the fear that anyone could be the killer. While the multiplayer servers are dead (I think), the singleplayer is more than enjoyable. Plus, you could get some friends together and enjoy The Ship. (8 out of 10)			"

												As of the 21st of December 2011 The Ship is back for sale under new owners (poor Outerlight) I must sincerly tell you people how fun this game was.The aim of the game is simple, kill your prey without getting killed by your hunter or spotted by the security of the ship and other passengers with a hilarious amount of weaponry and traps on board a series of art deco turn of the century era Ocean liners and other boats. You think this would be easy but there is catch. You have to eat, sleep, use the facilities and wash leaving you and your prey equally open to moments of bloody murder.The man or woman with the most amount of money for pulling off the perfect murder wins. This game has a cartoony-esqe class as charming as TF2 with gameplay fit to match please do buy it and gift a copy to a friend and give it another chance.			"

												Every Body Are hating this game for no reason. for reasons like, Oh this would be worth 10 dollars if the server where up and, oh we bought this game but there is no point playing it cuz we don't know what to do. Yeeeezez just search up server on it and type connect (IP) on the console and you are in, the most servers have like 20 people in it. This a hillarious game to play with friends and so. Really recomend it if you have friends who playn it.			"

												This game is original, exciting and will probably never get old. And as a bonus on that they're planning on making a remastered verision of it, which you will get a 25 % off if you own this game in your steam library. About all these people talking about the dead servers that's not true. From what i've heard the in game browsing is broken so you have to find the servers another way. Go to the servers on the steam platform without having the game started and filter for the game there and you will see at least 10 servers to join, with a lot of private ones aswell.And no the developers aren't gone, the game just switched owners. And because of some weird legal stuff the new developers are not able to change anything in the current game, and that's why they're planning on making the remastered verision. The owners seem to be close to the players and are eager to answer questions and help the game(heard they even read all the reviews of the game so they could improve the new verision). So buy the game before it's too late, it's really fun :D			"

												Hunt your fellow man for money, be hunted by your fellow man for money (and because if I'm totally honest, you're a bit of a ♥♥♥♥), shower regularly to maintaiin good hygene, give your quarry a good paddlin', steal a colostomy bag from the sick bay for those times when the toilet is just too far away, read the entire Bible in less than 3 seconds, then follow it up with the Kamasutra, enjoy a friendly chat over coffee with a mate, then send their corpse careening across the room with a shot from a blunderbuss.No matter what it is you're into, this game truly has something for everyone. It's cheap, easy on even the most low end machine (like mine) and best of all, there's endless potential for being a raging cuntbiscuit. Anyone who's not a raging paedophile or supporter of Hitler is sure to love and adore this absolute treasure of a game. I give it a perfect score.			"

												What a fun game this is. Even though it may seem like a copy cat of some sort the fun you'll have with this game (and your friends) is priceless. The AI doesn't seem to be too stupid to actually participate in the game but they could be a bit more active though. Also it is not always clear how you got caught doing bad things to other passangers and get jailed for it.But(!) aside from the above this game is totally worth it, if you have friends who want to play with you. As grand as this game is, it is - in my opinion - a multiplayer based game. More so a game where you really should invite friends to play with - it'll be so much more worth playing it than alone or with strangers.			"

												This is an amazing game! It's fairly simple, it features a bunch of people who have to kill each other on a ship, sort've like in Gosick, and you must win by making the most money off of the killings... At least in one gamemode. Not a lot of people know about the gamemodes from what I've seen, and things like Elimination and Deathmatch are really fun. Nothing like running around shooting people with a thompson on tons of different maps. Oh yeah, there's also stats you need to keep up with. I usually take care of those in the in-game jail. Also, this game is a perfect game to listen to the song ""Kuusou Mesorogiwi"" because it is so fitting for it.			"

												Everything else is boring to you?Then play this, it's awkward and yet it's fun. The stalker simulator you've been waiting for.You can roleplay too!Here's what I did for lolz:- Sat on stairway with knife out, slicing passerby. People fled for their lives even though they weren't my targets.- Stalked random individuals, crouching, pretending I'm looking at others but following them, eventually they panic and the reactions are hilarious specially if their hunter kills them and you are not even involved.- Hunting, killing random ship mates is still a better love story than twilight.- Setting traps, and watching people try pick them up and go to space.- Stalking a person and pushing it into a room, then closing the door. They always panic and pull out a gun or melee weapon, all you have to do is run out (assuming you survive) and they'll get arrested, pull out a weapon and join them in jail then find a shank and stare at them for a while, pull out the shank and have fun.This game is surely best with friends. The only thing it lacks is direct and global voice chat which I hope new devs will implement. The server browser is cumbersome (read community hub) but it works.Worth a buy, specially on sale as the game drops cards which quickly redeem the game in worth anyway.			"

												Now that I've finally been able to play the game online with some friends, I've changed my opinion on the game. The concept of the game is really awesome. It has some issues here and there which I hope will be addressed in the new version, but overall, it's definitely a fun game... if you can get a game going (helps to have someone who knows what they're doing to host the server).The game is sure to create a huge amount of stress and frustrations, but it's also sure to cause a lot of laughture and priceless moments.Contains a bunch of gameplay issues which should not exist at all. Example: If you're in a small washroom stall and the door is closed, when you go to open the door again, you either need to be standing on top of the toilet or risk getting permanently wedged between the door and the wall since the door will not stop trying to open completely. Also, guns make melee weapons almost pointless. If they have guns and you only have a melee weapon, seriously, good luck with that.			"

												It's a fun game full of all the things to get your murder thrills with untill you forget right this is also like the sims to where i have to make my person happy but then you also remeber when you go to kill your quarry oh right camera's and cops  probably should've waited to kill my quarry untill he/she wasn't balls deep in shopping for a new hat. all in all fun game a lot of cool unique elements, and it also helps that it takes place in pesudo 1920's because the music, uniforms and wepons all make the game seriously diffrent from anything made on source. also prison shanking chased down with reading the kama sutra good times a plenty. 8/10 P.S. there is also a mode where you get to kill world leaders so if you ever wanted to squash the beef between bush and bin laden you can do it here.

												I've never read anything by Agatha Cristie but I've seen plenty of Poriot on Masterpiece Theater so I know what I'm talking about here: This is a pretty fun game but annoying. First of all, if I'm on a boat full of potential murderers the last thing I'm going to be doing is worrying about where I can get my hands on a bag of chips. Matches on average last about thirty minutes, so why does my character have to use the bathroom five or more times a game? Why do the DIE if they don't make it to the bathroom in time?The whole ordeal reminds me too much of The Sims, where the needs of my character is a delicate system of checks and balances. Once one need is satisfied it throws all the other needs wildly out of order until the whole game devolves into a mad dash to get to the bathroom, then to eat, then to take a shower and so on and so forth until one can't help but completely forget that they were supposed to kill someone.

YOU MUST GO TO VIEW<SERVERS<DROPBOX< SELECT THE SHIP. There are like ten servers that are consistently active. Most of the active ones are fairly serious, so the trolling is minimal. I highly recommend this game for anyone that likes alternatives to FPS games. Shoot me an invite for an active friend to play with.			"

												Instead of telling you about the game I will just tell you exactly what happened through a round with just me and my friend and some random bots. It started with me spawning with my random looking and named character walking out of my room looking to the left at a set of two people wandering around. I look to the top right and see my friend as my quarry wich means you must kill them in a set time limit I then searched the deck entirely for gear what I found was just what I needed. A blunderbuss, a shortsword, a wallet bomb, a good bit of food and drink, and some spare clothes in case i needed to disguise. I walked out the room saw my friend chasing his quarry around like a retard with an umbrella. After I finished laughing I heard him say he is taking the elavator down in a bit to search for some more gear other than his ""Godly"" Umbrella. I quickly ran to the elavator opened it up and went in then closed it. He pressed the button to bring up the elevator i took out my blunderbuss and ♥♥♥ the doors spread open he sat there and all i heard was his girly scream, my blunderbuss going off, my ridiculous laughter, then him crying/laughing in the background.

												now, i can understant that this game is really not for everybody.  however, with this in mind, i think it is fantastic!  if you like the basic premise you should like the game: you are on a cruise ship, taking care of yourself sims style (with increasing needs such as hunger and thirst and tiredness (thatz a word now) but, the catch is that you have to protect yourself from the person who is hunting you, while hunting down your target and searching for good weapons. it is really fun.

												For a game as old as Steam itself, The Ship is still surprisingly good fun. The perfect mix of hide 'n' seek, cluedo, poker and the Sims. As it stands you technically get 5 copies upon purchase too, making it easy to pass this among friends as Christmas approaches and then murderize each other, for fun and profit. :)			"

												Really fun game with quite interesting mechanics. You are trapped on a Ship along with other Players, having to murder each other to win the competition. Each player is assigned to the other in a pair. A Hunter and the Hunted. A Hunter is trying to find and kill the Hunted one, while the Hunted one is most likely a Hunter to someone else and tries to find them and kill them.So basically you really need to watch your back, as anyone might try to plot to kill you, perhaps waiting for the moment when you go to sleep... Yes, sleep. In the game you have to sustain your character's needs via sleep, eating, drinking, talking and reading books/entertaining. Think of it as The Sims with a twisted plot where characters must kill each other off.Also... Killing people won't win you the game. Killing them in the most paying way will earn you the victory. Each kill is awarding amount of money based on the weapon you use to kill someone (unless you use environment, like the Freezer/Life-Boats.)Amazing game, fun to play 1v1, but it is recommended to play on the server with other players. You can also play alone against bots. They sometimes can surprise you, but most of the time they are slightly disappointing.10/10 - Recommended.			"

												Hmmm. I can see how this game is fun if playing other people, particularily friends and family on the internet, but I was completely disappointed with single player and arcade mode. Once you learn the basics and kill like 5 or 6 marks it just becomes completely boring. Although I was slightly amused when I had to throw a purse bomb at a lady sleeping on a couch then run down the hall way, hit the detonator and watch her be blown off the couch. I paid $10.99. I wouldn't advise paying more than $4.99 for it. It's a shame they don't have available servers for this game as it would be much more entertaining playing other vpeople online.			"

												I've played this game a lot with friends over the years, I can whole-heartedly recommend it. The gameplay is unique and very funny, with a well-inspired mix between a plain ol' FPS and a Sims/Second Life simulation.Find your target, keep a low and non threatening profile, and just crack the backbone of your shipmate with a frying pan.One warning though: make sure you have some friends you can play the game with. The servers are mostly empty, so it's hard to just jump in on a game with strangers.			"

												The ship is a creative source engine take on a familiar concept (murder mystery party), and is just crazy enough to be a sucess. This game feels like ""Team fortress"", ""Hitman 2"", and ""Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory"" had a baby, and that baby really liked ""Clue"".(Screenshots here.)You will play as a passanger on a ship, or other enclosed map, and be assigned another player to assassinate. There will be a player trying to assassinate you at the same time, so you'll need to be watching your back, as well as hunting your target. You can search your enviornment for weapons, but be careful, because if you get caught with a weapon in your hand, or attacking someone in front of a witness, and you'll be thrown in the brig!The true fun in this game is in multiplayer, and the server finder is broken, so you'll need to find games through the Steam  interface, rather than in game. From the Steam app, look at the bar up top left of the screen and highlight ""View"" with your mouse. From there click ""Servers"", and filter by game to only show ""The Ship"". You should be able to join games from there.This game is not without it's flaws. The learning curb is steep, and it's not always clear when you can and can't get away with drawing a weapon without instantly being arrested.All in all, I'd say this game is worth the money, and is a lot of fun. I would reccomend spending the money on it if you find the premise interesting, and are willing to spend some time learning the game's quirks.			"

												One day you wake up in your own cabin. You pay attention to the piece of paper lying on the table, read it, and know that he was drawn into a kind of sadistic game. On a piece of paper the name of a passenger is written, that the passenger who is to die by your hand. Realizing that he or you, or you him, you have no choice, how to find the first available weapon and start looking for his victim.The cabins of the ship looks relaxed. Passengers, scurrying back and forth, seemingly not paying any attention to you, and it does not prevent you closer to your goal. You look everyone in the face, in the hope of finding a victim, but there are only strangers. You look at the time, and you realize that it is very short.You pass on and you hear behind me a strangled cry. You turn the knife in his hand, ready to strike, but to my surprise notice how the girl who welcomed cute you some time ago, standing over the corpse triumphantly, and with her knife dripping blood of the victim. Woman robs the body and takes off as if it did not exist anymore. You get scared, but the thought of the impending murder and ending time starts driving you crazy, and you keep looking.At last you have found the victim. She - a woman aged in lilac dress - sitting in the restaurant and dine quietly. You understand that you can not come to the victim and kill her as soon as you go to jail, so you wait patiently. And the victim was full enough, gets up from the table and slowly goes to the toilet. Realizing that this is your chance, you go for it. She stands at the sink and washes his hands, and you at this time going slowly to her and stabs in the back. Victim muffled screams and falls to the floor. It beats in agony, blood flowing slowly across the floor, and you stand at this time, and try not to go crazy from this terrible picture, and waiting for the victim to die. Finally, it gives off the last breath. You're in a hurry you hide the bloody knife in his pocket, dragged the corpse into the toilet cubicle, and with a relaxed expression on his face come out of the closet.Only then will you realize that very hungry. After removing money from the card you are in a hurry to the dining room, to celebrate the victory, but halfway you match your neighbor's cabin - low fat little growth. He politely asks you where the captain's cabin, and while you're trying to figure out, it pulls from his breast pocket a revolver and shoots you in the chest. Falling on the floor and trying to cope with the intolerable pain you realize that he was as much a victim as the woman. With thoughts about losing, you close your eyes and plunge into the darkness ...And you wake up again in his own cabin. Do you feel full of energy and trying to understand what happened, but your gaze falls again on a note where it is written the name of your next victim. Trying to cope with them, you give yourself a word, that this time will be cautious. Very careful.			"

												Murder Party isn't a thing, dont buy this if thats what your relying on. The Ship itself is an AMAZING game fyi, even tho the multiplayer is screwed up, all you have to do is bypass the master server and ba bam your with 150 other people playin. Its fun, i recommend it, buy it if its on sale, have fun.			"
