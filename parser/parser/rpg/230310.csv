Tl;dr: It's a decent hack 'n' slash game with good artwork, can get repetitive, made primarily for mobile devices, DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM SINCE IT'S FREE ON DESURA. Read below for more info.I bought this game months ago (during a sale, phew!), and at first I remember I loved it. I loved the artwork, I loved the hack 'n' slash. I simply found this through browsing Steam, not their Kickstarter. I used to love just hacking and slashing, one downside was that to get better loots you have to do the same missions a few times with higher difficulty, just like other games, but this one doesn't make the higher difficulty more fun, it's rather boring to do it again and again in fact. (Which it still is now.)As of writing this on November 11, 2014, yes, this game is free on Desura. Yes, there is micro-transaction, which is because this game was supposed to come out on iOS and Android as well. However, reading the comment section of their Kickstarter, there isn't any news on the phone versions yet. The weird controls are a result of this game being primarily a mobile game. You only use mouse left and right clicks which can be extremely irritating if you normally use WASD to move around.The developing team is literally 1 person alone, and he had 2.7k people back the game with a total amount of 200k USD. Despite that, I didn't have high hopes after downloading it again today. In August, 2014, in which he replied comments on Akaneiro's Kickstarter, the developer explained the slow progress was due to him being alone in the whole development, HOWEVER, after the Kickstarter success in February 2013, he had since 1 failed and 1 successful Kickstarter campaign, both on different projects, with the latest successful one in August, 2013. So is he slacking off on developing this game?I was fine with just going along and playing the game like I used to. However, I couldn't even load the one mission I wanted to play... I'm sorry but for now, I cannot recommend this game, especially since it's made for mobile WITHOUT controls for PC players, and its horrible development.			"

												Everyone has that ""one game"". The game they regret buying or preordering. Some people have more than one. This game is ""that one game"" for many people. Spicy Horse has essentially abandoned the development of this game (they posted that the development team has been reduced to 2 members), leaving out many features such as Co-op (They have been claiming that multiplayer will be implemented since 2011), yet still left in the general chat box that connects to no one. They also mentioned that even though this game was a complete financial flop, they will leave the servers open to people (As even though there is no multiplayer, you must still log into their servers to actually play), which they claim they are ""Taking one for the team"" and losing money keeping the servers open for the handful of folks who still play. Honestly, I figure that if they closed the servers there would have been a much larger backlash from people still waiting for this game to enter its full state.They even had the audacity to leave in their Cash Shop along with the cosmetic items that cost real money. I am aware that some people do still play this game, but the original concept of this game has been completly gutted and trimmed into a shell of what it was promised to do upon initial release			"

Early Access Review
								Akaneiro is a potentially cool Diablo clone ruined by a greedy free-to-play pay scheme. Yes, it's f2p- except on Steam, where you spend $10 on in-game currency to play it. $10 should buy you the whole game, and even then it's so simplistic it would be hard to recommend. And it still isn't feature complete, despite a $200,000 Kickstarter and charging microtransactions on an unfinished game. Totally unbalanced, too.I'm not even sure what the state of the game is, either. It's still listed as ""early access"" but I don't even know that it's being worked on any more. From what I can tell Spicy Horse has moved on to other projects on Kickstarter, leaving Akaneiro a half-finished mess. Having loved their work on Alice: Madness Returns, I'm disappointed by this game and their questionable business ethics.			"

Early Access Review
								I loved this game to bits in the beginning! Was looking forward to the promised co-op option. Sadly didn't happen. Was cool to have the option to summon a random character to help you out a bit, at least. I was shocked this game brought little to no profit to the developers. After the big changes that were made to the game, like changing the control keys (they used to be very well thought out, now they're confusing to use), I don't mind if a game is difficult, but the character is suddenly extremely weak physicaly and I have to heal every few seconds and constantly runaway from even one monster to avoid getting killed.. aaand ofc microtransactions.. I don't mind it as long as it's actually worth it, but here, it's not. Looked through everything and even though I was open to buy some of the karma crystals and/or shards, there's actually nothing really worth spending money on. Shame.. It used to be such an awesome and fun game in the beginning. *sad face* :(			"

								Wow, usually I'm smarter than this. This is paying for a F2P game. With microtransactions. If you buy this, you're just an idiot like me. Don't be an idiot.As a free to play game, it's pretty bad. F2P usually means MMO. In this case it means barely functional. The UI is terrible and hard to figure out. The camera isn't controlled, so melee tank classes are highly favorable. Levelling up is a mystery (does it do anything?). Coming from having played many ARPGs, this one is definitely different. And not really in a good way.			"

												This game is quite litterally unplayable. The servers are officially up, but it's impossible to log in anymore, and the developer has stated that they don't intend to fix this issue. Anyone trying to start the game will be met with the message that their username or password is incorrect. They are fine with selling the ""starter pack"" on steam though, even if it's impossible to actually play the game.			"

								It's not all bad, but the graphics get a bit redundant and many critical items require a type of currency that is almost impossible to acquire; at least, impossible to acquire without shelling out actual cash. It reminded me very much of Diablo II. Generally I expect more from this kind of a franchise.			"

												I like Akaneiro: Demon Hunters from what I played. It feels very unfinished and rough so I can see how people who payed for it could really end up regretting there purchase, especially considering development looks like it has really had some trouble. I remember seeing Akaneiro: Demon Hunters when it was still being kickstarted and advertised and I remember being interested. It was not until yesterday (12/15/15) that I saw not only was the game on Steam, but that it was free!The gameplay is pretty average ARPG stuff, but the environment and music are bot pretty coo Japanese painting looking. From what I have seen there are a good deal of missions and levels so the game is of decent length. I have yet to finish it but I have played enough to let everyone know I think its pretty neat.

			The Main Theme for upcoming game Akaneiro: Demon Hunter, as composed by Kian How for Spicy Horse. The Game: http://www.angry-red.com/ The Greenlight: http://bit.ly/O7T10E...		

The connection fails as the Chinese developer Spicy Horse (same people who made  Alice: Madness Returns) no longer exists.Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Akaneiro: Demon Hunters...but the tech support is...pretty bad.  For months, this game was inaccessible to the general public due to the servers being down.  Now the servers mysteriously came back up...sounds good, yes?   Well, it IS playable, but sadly your map progress is not saved.  Everything else is saved, but don't expect your progress to save.  If you want the level completion achievements, then you must play through in a single boot.This game should either be fully fixed now that the servers are up, but...sadly, it isn't.Score when the game was operational:  6/10Current score:  3/10RIP Akaneiro: Demon Hunters.  You were fun while you lasted.			"

Early Access Review
								I first wrote a review of this game on 09/01/2014 13:48 GMT, now I feel I have to change it slightly.Second review based on playing the early access version 06/05/2014 18:44 GMTStill in Early Access, hardly anything has changed, bug fixes etc but no game changing mechanics no improvements on current mechanics and no massive new content. I regret buying this product, and I've seen them adveritising and kickstarting other games. I don't think they care for this game anymore, now that I've heard they lost like $2m of what they put into the game when the kickstarter campaign was only asking for $200,000. I sense a little corruption here and I'd stay SO FAR away from this game before you think about buying it. Try it when it has come out of early access, when it does become an actual free to play game. Or alternatively, I think there is a legit browser-based version of this (same content) that you can play FOR FREE.- - - -Parts of my original review, some edited.I also disapprove making this game free to play and having it ridden with in-game stores, in-game currencies, bypassing gameplay and easy leveling/gear acquiring. I will be really disappointed if they stick to this because in my opinion it's very corrupt, and I'd rather pay full price than to have store updates, store discounts, and other cash-related ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shoved in my face. This game has a lot of potential if they would just leave this out of the game. It reminds me a little of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, and the in-game currency system pretty much ruined the 'fun' and 'drive' for me.The only issue I've had with the game is that, once you get the starter pack, you need to claim your items from the in-game mail system in the village ON YOUR FIRST EVER CHARACTER and put your items in your stash if you ever decide to delete the FIRST CHARACTER. Making a character, then deciding you want to delete it BEFORE acquiring the exclusive items, will delete them. I know this from experience, and I'm now awaiting a reply from Spicy Horse support regarding this awful situation. I'm sure it will be resolved, however I don't think I could recommend this game with out warning others first.*****NEW EDIT************* It never got resolved, and my hope was diminished. I actually messaged them and a few weeks later after the incident - they finally got back to me and said that they couldn't give me the shards, they could only give me the items, like the food, Steam necklace, etc, BECAUSE since I bought the game and had the problem and WAITED for a reply from their support, their Early Access starter pack changed it's meaning - but they still advertised it on their store page. I was extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at this. They couldn't give me the red or blue shards (these are used to purchase things, and blue shards are extremely hard to come by, unless you pay for them for in-game currency) so, I basically bought a FREE TO PLAY game, because I don't use EXP boosting food, or any ♥♥♥♥ like that. I bought a free to play game!!! For £6.99! Outrageous.- - - -Hugely disappointed in Spicy Horse, I loved the hour or so I had on Alice Madness Returns (double check your origin version of the game, there are bugs, I hit a massive glitch and I can't get any further now with out rebuying the game on Steam cos I'm guessing you keep that up to date) and I had high hopes for this game. I even made a video about it and expressed why the micro transactions and the whole free to play state of mind will crush any chances of this game being good. I was right. I can't recommend.Hugely disappointed. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off I paid money for it, and I refuse to stick up for it just because I did. Spicy Horse get your act together please!!!!			"

												I blame Okami, I love that game and when I saw this game...well the awful reviews hadn't fully come in yet.  So I thought ""Yeah a Diabloesque beat'em up that looks like Okami, but with Little Red Riding Hood as a demonhunter instead of the goddess Amaterasu as a wolf.""   So I forked out the money......And that's just the start of where this game falls apart.  This game should have been free from the start, as the game relies heavily on IAP.  Enemies escalate quickly while upgrading for equipment is a joke.  As well, it costs currency to add new skills to your character.  Nor is the character selection balanced, enemies will tear through your defensive character because of their heavy damage and the ranged character is simply too weak at everything to do anything other than get mobbed to death.  So only the slayers worshipping Little Red Riding Hood...oops I mean the Maiden in Red are effective in this game, so instead of hitting a wall at 3rd or 4th stage of the game - they might go as far as 6th.The game is also ridden with bugs and crashes a lot.  And the makers of this game have essentially given up on this game and say they have gutted their Akaneiro crew to two programmers spending time to deal with the huge problems in this game.  Yikes...considering how much difficulty they have with their new games elsewhere, you can expect a patch for this game a decade from now. This game has beautiful artwork and a nice if rather empty pseudo-Japanese styling (I've seen larger and more active town populations in old SNES RPGs and the first Diablo than this game).  That's the only positive to this game.  Otherwise this game is mired down in a ton of problems and isn't going to improve.  I have only one purchase regret for Steam and it's this game.			"

								I signed on to the Early Access of Akaneiro quite some time ago (not fully understanding what early access meant) but it showed alot of promise.  The game itself was pretty enjoyable and things were working well, in addition it was a sort of different take on the game style (in terms of the character options and enemies).  I though the game was sure to be out within a short time.  Since then if anything the games seems to have fallen into disarray, things that did work no longer do and strange archaic systems have been added.  I would avoid this especially since it is ftp elsewhere and wait until the game is finished			"

												I thought by the reviews that wouldn't be much worth it, but it ended being fun than I expeted it to be. Sounds quite OK for an Action Role Playing Game. You have 3 classes, one has more damage, one has more armor and one has more spells and critical hits, however when you level up you can choose which class stat you want to boost, aswell as you can learn other classes' skills and upgrade them aswell. You can hire a pet and a soldier for a short period of time to help you in the dungeons.PROS (the good stuff):+ Similar to Diablo and Torchlight.+ Bears an unique style, using Japanese mytology and folklore.+ Each dungeon has 5 difficulties (more difficulty means more exp and money).+ You Have 3 classes, however you can learn other classes' skills and, when you level up, you can also choose boost stats that identify other classes;+ Each skill is upgradeable up to 5 stars (passive skills from the class are upgradeable aswell).+ You can sell your items directly from your inventory, even if you are in a dungeon.CONS (what they should improve or fix):- No Zoom option. (which may turn difficult to move with the cursor on some corners)- It randomly goes to windowed mode when you're choosing your character.- The Settings option itself, it's very sparce:You cannot change the resolution, there is no option for it.There is no option for key mapping nor key binding, so you cannot change your keys.- Some random crashes that might happen when you're accessing the inventory at the town.- It lacks multiplayer or co-op.

After clicking on it, nothing else happened.... No popup windows in-game, just the red background art, and the (actually nice) intro music. Nothing else!!! No Start the game, options or anything of the sort....Looked up forums in hope I find a solution. Went to the spiceworld website, trying to launch the browser version, what did I get? Connection timeout... In Mozilla, in Explorer, and also in Edge (didn't try chrome cause I hate it and don't even have it installed but I bet it would have been the same).You can't even register an account on their website because the picture of the ""captcha"" or whatever is not working... :DLogging in with facebook you can't even download the new client on their website because there's no option for it (it might not even be available at all...) Tried to login today as well, from Establishing Connection it went to ""Your account name or password are incorrect"" also with an OK button, and clicking on it ended with the same result...

The controls are easy enough, hold the left mouse button and move the cursor to walk and click left to interact.  There's a few keys with menu's or special attack mapped to them.  Also, the game basically plays itself if you don't turn off the auto-attack option in the menu.The art is interesting, the music is nice, there's an interesting story and world to explore.  I want to recommend it, but with three crashes and one that shut down my computer, i can't.			"

								Ein wirklich geiles Indie ""Diablo Like"" RPG in wirklich schöner Cell Shading Optik. Ein wenig Englischkenntnisse vorausgesetzt, begeistern die Macher mit einer gelungenen Story, wobei Paralellen zu bekannten Genrevertretern schon allzu offensichtlich sind. Mit den Investierten 9.99€ bekommt man ein angemessenes Startpaket was den späteren Wert von etwa 20€ entspricht. Denn dieses Spiel wird bei Release ein Free 2 Play Modell bekommen.			"

												I consider American McGee's universe as one of the most creative of all times. I played the Alice series, even wrote about them and when I discovered this version of the Red Ridding Hood, I was pleasantly surprised. I must confess that I've appreciated the graphics more than the gameplay, just personal. Akaneiro is an example of McGee's genuine combination between art and gaming, more than being a great game itself.			"

								I wanted to like this, I really did. Another Diablo clone. Which generally means great fun, or boring grind. Unfortunately, this is more of the later. It has plenty of style and personality to set it apart from it's peers, but that's pretty much all it has going for it. The entire system feels unpolished and unrealized. And there is a strange time based restriction system on replaying quests, like a few facebook games I've experienced.I tried to like it, I really did. I feel bad for it, but it's just not any good.

								This game has been in Early Access so long, I'm not sure it's ever going to leave it. And that's saying a lot for a game that's supposed to be F2P with microtransactions. Those microtransactions also spell out the quality of the game. Sorry, Spicy Horse, but you should have put some real effort into this title and released it for $15 to $30. As is, I recommend people avoid it, at least until a time that the game isn't crashing repeatedly and removes microtransactions in favour of gameplay depth.			"

								I had high hopes for this game, and have been following it for a while. I last played in the beta, but here were still numerous problems with it, the most frustrating being the PS1-like loading screens. Decided to give it another try, but loading screens are still EXCRUTIATINGLY long for a game with very limited gameplay and cartooney graphics. In addition, there are still numerous bugs that need to be sorted out, and enemies often get stuck on the edge of the map where you cannot attack them. I may dabble in this game every now and then but would not recommend it to anyone.			"

								First of all this game is a f2p, you can play for free with the client avaiable on the game home page. On steam you get some in game item.The graphic stile is amazing, but the gameplay is repetitive, you get attacked by a horde of enemy with a really bad AI and the only 3 class that you can chose is bad balanced, you can chose from the awesome class and other two weak class.The game is still on early access so you know that can have trouble but at the moment the game is totaly unplayable (the big one you can't level up you class) and the dev team got reduced from 20 people to 2 people. So i can't expect good thing from this game.			"

												The game requires you to be online in order to play, there's even a chat option too but multiplayer is nowhere to be seen (even in the store page states it's a single player game, which makes no sense to be always online).The game is free to play but be aware the more you play the more unstable it gets, the amounts of lag make it unplayable (4990 of ping? seriously?) .The art is pretty, the music is good, the gameplay is nothing special, with lots of bugs the worse of them is when your character can't level up for no apparent reason, so you keep playing expecting to level up at some point, enemy meshes overlap each other A LOT, it could've been better if it wasn't due to the online always feature, at leas it could've been bearable.

												So much wasted potential.Back when it was first released [before it even got on steam,] the game was actually really good. Loading times were fast, fps was smooth, and there weren't random lag bursts or high memory usage/leaks.Now it has more content, but is completely ridden with bugs and overall clunkyness.I believe, unfortunately, that any revival attempt will be a wasted effort. It was a really nice game, and could be so much more, but money is an issue for the developers, and the players arent willing to supply that with what they have now.The best hope for this game to actually become playable like it used to be is either the developers making it open-source and letting it go, or selling it dirt cheap to some other company that's willing to work on it.In short, RIP Akaneiro, you could have been so much more.

												Here are the problems with the game as I see them:1. Constant screen and sound stuttering. 2. Quality of Life improvements aren't even an afterthought - they don't exist. For example, you can't ctrl + click or Shift + Click to get items to and from your stash. The vendor where you buy items, you can't sell there. - How counter intuitive is that? It does have this nice feature where you can just sell anything from your inventory - ok, neat, but again counter intuitive. You can't use your mouse scroll wheel to scroll the item boxes at any vendors.3. This game lacks polish all over. Tooltips aren't helpful. The buff bar only gives you icons, if you hover your mouse over them, nothing indicates what that icon is doing. The ""auto attack"" feature in the game interferes with your ability to use skills. The UI is also clunky and the games does little to explain it to you, so this is why it feels clunky.4. Where is the lore, story, plot? Anything that I could use that might give me a reason to be engaged is missing almost entirely.The only nice thing I will say about the game is that I like the art direction. I like the eastern theme. I do not recommend anyone throwing money at this game until they fix some of these issues.			"

I got an absurd lag playing this from Brazil, don't know if it's different for others countries. The game has a good design but lacks a good story, I think the only good thing it there's a Linux version of the game and the genre (ARPG) is lacking in the Linux world at the moment. This game can get a lot better if the devs can polish these things.			"

												Akaneiro: Demon Hunters is a free to play ARPG.  It worked somewhat, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, was understandable.  The graphics style looked ok for the game theme.  It looked like you could play for free for a while. Has 3 classes.  Appears to be this game was Paid at one time, now it is free to play.  Looks like it is a single player game but IDK. UI was ok.  Game is a Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile Clone.  Has a storyline.CONS: - Looks like you would have to repeat the same quests.- Was buggy starting up the game, ran troubleshooting compatibility, game ran better afterward, crashed on quiting the game.- No good tutorial or manual.- No camera control.- No graphics control.  - No character looks customization.- Laggy, Buggy.Try it maybe, you might like it.  You might could find a better game than this.For more info:

								This game is fun.  No doubt its an odd little game, but the time I have played it has been really enjoyable.  I go back to it from time to time and still enjoy it...for an hour or so at a time.  Its a fun little grinding game if you enjoy that kind of thing you should enjoy this.  I think my favorite thing about this game though is the look and feel of it.  Its very...artsy...or stylized if you will.  I like supporting these smaller games, especially when they look this...different from everything else out there right now.

								Honestly I don't remember buying this game but hopefully I didn't pay a full $10 for it. I suspect I made this purchase sometime in 2013 in what could only be described as a period in my life that was filled by a blurred binge of two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls... But I am getting off point, the point was that this game was SO forgettable that the developers themselves forgot about it (one blog post doesn't mean they didn't forget). It brings me great joy knowing that several people working on this are now laid off, maybe now they will understand the risk of being an Early Access purchaser when they are turning tricks in the alley behind Arby's.P.S. Anonymous person at Spicy Horse, stop writing blog posts. It just makes you look like a child when you blame reviewers for the game's negative press and financial failure. But thanks for plugging that new Spicy Horse game advertisement in your blog post! Real transparent of you guys.			"

It does freeze about once an hour but that may be due to network problems with my satellite connection.  This requires terminating the process to close it.  Level progress is lost but gathered items are retained.  While the game is not finished (and won't be) and there are a few item bugs, it's an enjoyable RPG that doesn't require much investment if you just want to run around and kill things.

												Terrible, even if this game were free I'd not buy it. I realize it's early access, but still, I've never played an ARPG since the origional Diablo that didn't allow key rebinding, Also, the default view when I go out on the first mission reminds me more of a 3rd person shooter game, and zooming with the Z key just made it worse (it brought the character even closer, not further as I hoped). I simply cannot move my character toward myself easily, as there is so little ground to click on with that view. I was expecting a view more like what I see in the village or the gameplay videos that made me decide to buy. I cannot reccomend this. If you have $5 to spare, wait for one of the two Torchlight titles to go on sale, or just eat the $5 bill and digest it, and then you'd get more from your money than I got from this game. I wish Steam gave refunds more easily.			"

								-->its free on desura so go try it there<-- and only pay for it here if you want to support this game (be warned it could be doa)has promise but it isn't making much so they only have 1 guy working on it so it could be abandoned soon.typical clicky game with action abilities in a cell shaded Asian aesthetics. rather nice actually.your not locked to the 1 (out of the 3) rolls you pick at 1st. you can still upgrade abilities, armor type, and weapon types for the other classes though you will need to watch how you level since they do have a min. state requirement.its pay2win but thats ok since it PvE. if they add pvp the buy item will rule. at level 10 i'm getting items with all stat+1-6 the buy items are +25i only recommend this game cause its free on desure. PLAY IT THERE! don't buy this here unless you really want the items it gives or are a game collector.			"

								I was participated in the beta testing for Akaneiro also, and since then it was improved a lot. I loved the art style, like most of Spicy Horse games it is more like an interactive art piece then a game. Similar to Alice Madness Returns. One of it's great features is the implementing of eastern cultures, art and music into the game. Anyone who is interested in eastern cultures and mythology will find a lot of familiar elements in Akaneiro. It has it's faults also, but I believe that compared to the ammount of people who were working on it it's a very nice little game. Challanging, but not too hard. it has a nice way of giving the players the choice what difficulty they want to play the game in, and it's not only makes the game harder, but the rewards higher also. I say try it. It will either convince you to spend a few  evening as the hunter / huntress smashing Yokai, enjoying the story of the clan of hunters founded by Red or you will not like it that much.. I think because of the art it worth a try.Also what is very much recommended is to get the artbook from Amazon or similar place (Art of Akaneiro). As mentioned earler Akaneiro is more like an interactive art, then a game in my opinion.			"

												""Promises are made to be Broken""Seems like that has been the Moto of Spicy Horse for a very long time. The game is quite good but could have been better if they have just finished it. They charged for this but never quite 'finished' it since the features they should have added long ago is now lost in the passage of time.They have unique sense in making games but they just lack the resolve to push and finish what they started.

								The combat seems to be okay, but the animations lack a littleFor example, you're surrounded by wolves, and you just stand still hacking into the wolves, one by oneAtleast you have 3 abilities you can use from the start, but that normal attack on left mouse button is really a boring thing to watchEspecially when you have to kill a lot of enemiesSo this is an ARPG, which is online. Why? There were no one in the game. I was all alone with the enemies and the NPCsThis also seems to be pay 2 win, since you can just buy more skills, or buy the upgrades to said skillsOverall a little boring. Might be a good time waster, if you have nothing else to doNot worth 10€			"

								First Impressions:If you like dungeon crawlers this worth the $5 sale price. It will inevitably be F2P, but the starter items you get with the purchase will hold you over for quite a while. The art style reminds me of Japanese paintings, the traditional sounding music fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the pacing has been good.I was surprised to hear that the game has a lot in common with Bastion, but after seeing how they did the town I can see it.At this point in early access the game is designed to start sending you back to the earlier areas at higher difficulties to allow you to grind xp and items. Enemy variety has been good for the early part of the game, but the maps appear to be static. I have always felt that randomized areas help give dungeon crawlers longevity so it'll be interesting to see what they do.I suggest starting with the Fortitude character, currency is shared as well as the stash so if you decide to have multiple characters it's easy to pass stuff between them.It also appears that you can summon an ally, even if offline, and they will get rewards for it. Very cool concept.			"

												Even the hell wouldn't want this game, I am considering being cheated by a succbus called Spicy HorseUpdated**: Okay, I may put some more efforts here stating why I hold my grudge towards this game. The gamplay actually are not that bad, worth little time. However, it is the dishonest customer service made me hate this game very much.It starts off a paid game on steam, I can't remember the exact price (it was long time ago), but it wasn't free. I was one of the original founders here supporting this project by paying to get this game on steam. At that time, features like steam achievement, trading cards were none existance in Akaneiro Demon Hunters, but I still had supported them!Surprisingly, later it turned out the developers decided adding several trading cards, pluging in some achievements into the game which I suppose was a good thing. This was where everything went wrong. As a strange result, I NEVER get the trading cards which I was paid for, 3 cards in total. As someone support this game on its critical times, it wasn't even a question they should deliver their service immediate. Ironicly, not for long, the game switched to a F2P game. All I could think of was a "" What a F**K?"" at that time.It wasn't just me having these issues, we've posted the problem a number of times in the forum and NEVER got an official explanation about why we don't deserve to receive our trading cards as the founders of this game. Not being surprised again, the developers NEITHER reply nor fix the issue we are still having as if it never exists in the first place. Maybe Spicy Horse, you are too busy planning making your American McGee's Alice III and doesn't care to explain the matter of your one off porduct then I wouldn't be sorry I left a nagative review here, because you are well deserved it.Scarlet's Score: 3.2/10			"

												It was disheartening to see nothing related to Red Riding hood, or any of the Grimms tales like I was promised.  I bought a game that is probably going to simply sit on my account.  It has features belying it to an MMO, but they're missing all three letters.  Massive - The game seems rather small, in what I can figure are up coming areas I've yet to be. Multiplayer - It certainly WANTED to be at some point, but it fell short in the fact that... you play by yourself.  Sure the character creation screen is limited due to them wanted to be online, and sure they have a number of purchasable features in game, but I came into this expecting a single-player action-adventure rpg.  What I got was some kind of purgatory between a Multiplayer game and a Single-player campaign.  Online - When you first get onto the game you're greeted with a ""Connecting to online"" screen briefly.  This surprised me as nothing I had seen said anything about it being online.  You then go to your typical MMO character creation screen and, subsequently, build your character.  Then you have to create a name, and anyone who's played an MMO before knows how arduous a task this is... I digress, but after several different tries I got one that worked. Then I connected to the game.And I was alone.  There was not a soul to be found, save the NPCs that eventually show up in town.  The little chat box at the bottom lay barren, devoid of any purpose as there was nary a soul to talk to.  The game-play itself isn't bad, it plays a lot like guild wars.  The story seems to be there, but the awash of MMO features seem to render it bland and leaving of a bad taste in ones mouth.  Purgatory seems a good way to describe it.  Like a sort-of Limbo, never will you feel more isolated and alone than if you were to play this game.			"

												This is a diablo clone wich mixes red riding hood & fudal japan.graphics are nice but not great.Quite a few graphic errors and some bugs.Does not feel like a ful game yet.This is a free to play game (free to download on their website) the price on steam is for some extra currency and gear.and there are optional micro transaction in the game.It is a fun game but does not feel finished.try the game for free on their website.6/10			"

												I still think this is a really good game... BUT, I always experience a memory leek under Linux. [ Manjaro-Arch_Linux ]I've had it happen under Ubuntu too.after about 40 min into the game it will slow down and crash.added note: I'm also running the game using the SteamOS Runtime.

Early Access Review
								American McGee worked on this game! American McGee's Akaneiro: Demon Hunters with American McGee is a diablo-type game using an Asianfied Red Riding Hood storyline. Confused? American McGee isn't! The game is funnish when you're allowed to play, but it has strange facebook game timers and weird Free To Play mechanics that means once you've used up all your fun you can either wait around for more fun to unlock, or pay real people money.American McGee is a jerk :/			"

												Waste of money.  Every level is effectively the same as the next, save for artwork.  Development was halted almost immediately after they delivered the first steam version.  Their development team was never interested in listening to their tester team, which I was a part of.			"

												 Was very dissapointed in the long run as their was no co-op or online multiplayer to atleast set it apart from the other generic dungeon crawling games. The characters & item handling was poor and the dungeons were mediocre leaving no replay value it was more forced to grind.			"

												Regardless of how 'Akaneiro: Demon Hunters' may go down in ARPG history I will praise it for the artistic creativity that went into the look of this stylish linear Japanese lore inspired title. It instantly drew me in for the sensational surrealist world of characters, but turned me off by the fixed camera and highly linear single player only format. Still for 5 bucks I can't complain about price either. As for the rest? Apparently the developer left the publisher? So not sure about the future of this brand or its final product.			"

												It's broken and support has shut down.  Don't bother downloading it.It is a shame since it wasn't a bad little dungeon crawl.  Boo to you Spicy Horse games; if your not maintaining a game anymore you should remove it from Steam.			"

												Do you have friends that play stupid games on Facebook? Do you make fun of them? Play this game and they will make fun of you! Click on the screen and relax, while your character fights with some mobs on his/her own!I bought this game a few years ago, when it was still in beta. Now it's pay-to-win and it still looks and feels like beta of a crappy game.			"

												This game doesn't look good, doesn't feel good, and can lag the hell out. But it's fun. I don't even know why. There's never any danger of dying (at least at low levels lol), and there's little actual skill involved in controlling your character. It plays more like a casual Diablo 3 than anything else. In the end, it's just a very very unfinished game. But play it -- it's free. You might find, like me, that it's actually very appealing.			"

												I really liked this game when I started it. The grapics are cool and unique. The user interface is simple. The fluid dicipline system is a good bonus. Being able to go through a 'hunt' or dungeon once (before I had to grind in order to gain enough in-game money to continue) and get gear I could use was refreshing. I first tried the standalone client, then the browser and eventually switched to Steam. This game has a lot of potential to break the norm. I  have experienced some bugs that did not totally hinder my game. What I found dissapointing was finding out that the game has been abandoned by most players and that an active community does not exist. Upon first deciding to try out the game I was banking on it being an MMO only to find out it will have a co-op feature in the future.I thought overall the game was good, still needs fine tuning and attention. I don't know if after this long it's going to succeed unless somehow enough resources are accumulated (through Spicy Horse or a different company that potentially takes it over) and it's really given some TLC. Some suggestions I thought of while playing:-Bigger inventory or base storage.-The option to use they keyboard to move and fight.-More character customization.-More tutorial/walkthrough in the beginning on more complex concepts than moving and attacking.-Make dropped items easier to see and/or pickup, perhaps with an auto-pick up option.-Be able to preview multiple pieces of armor at once (esp. with special items.)-Because the game is dungeon-based make some aspect of that more in-depth, original and unique. Something different from all the other dungeon-based games out there.I'll hold onto the hope that development begins soon, it being 2015. However, until then, I don't know how much longer I will play.Finally, I would reccomend the free versions of this game for first time players, if any. If you like it a lot, buy it on steam. Otherwise, wait.			"

												Decent start, the aesthetic is unique enough to suck me in, but the gameplay is repetative. Not only that, it's balanced in a way so I have to revisit areas again and again to gain enough power to complete the later stages. Or to buy boosts in the in-game store. Oh yes, an in-game store in a repetative game. Does anyone else hear ""cash crab"" whispering in the wind?			"
