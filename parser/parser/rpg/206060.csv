												Maybe the best all around Avernum on steam (or at least until Avernum 2 and 3 show up in some form).  If you've never played an Avernum it might be best to start with ""Escape From the Pit,"" but Avernum 6 is probably a stronger game overall.  Like EFTP it's very open world (although a few areas are closed off at the start), but it's biggest advantage is in its stat system, which uses the older skill based system that EFTP abandons in favor of a more simplistic skill tree model.  Plus, unlike Avernums 4 and 5 (which had trouble justifying their existences plot wise), the writing is great, setting the game in a sprawling kingdom in decline and exploring some darker themes like drug addiction, famine, and terrorism.  A great end to the series. "

												The Avernum series is a great lineage of games by a little company. They're quite lengthy and tell a great tale of the course of several games. I started with the second one and went from there. There's a whole world to explore and the difficulty is pretty high, one wrong step into a tunnel and you'll become food for some unkown horror. There's magic, priesty heals, ranged stuff and of course good old melee combat. All the characters are very well defined and the lore is solid. Be warned though, if you don't like reading, this probably isn't for you. There's a lot of text. So that's just a matter of taste. If you don't want to play the super old ones but still want something like this without feeling left out of the story; go play Geneforge. Same company, same engine, different story. It's definatly a solid buy.			"

												Just a short review, which I have to write, so I can recommend this game (and I will post the same review at Avernum 4, 5 and 6 pages).After finishing the second Avernum trilogy (4, 5 and 6) I can honestly say, this was one of the most rewarding roleplaying experience I had in a long time. I played a lot of rpg titles, from classics like Eye of the Beholder, Ultima 7 and Infinity Engine games to newest games like Skyrim, Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, and although Avernum does not have fancy graphics, I still think this series is one of the best rpgs ever.Avernum has great setting and story, great playability, decent length (about 100 hours) and many sidequests and secrets. Leveling up system is balanced and nowadays almost forgotten turn-based combat is a welcomed change from flashy action oriented battle systems. An old-school rpg which proves, that doesn't need ""ultra high detailed"" graphics to create an immersive atmosphere. Highly recommended.			"

												Just like its predecessors, this plot heavy game will scratch a hardcore RPG fan's itch. There are some minor complaints about this game, but if you have played the previous ones you will see some improvements. Sadly the visuals are still quite bad. Avernum 6 is a classic old school RPG for a select audience. Those looking for a quick RPG fix are probably better off looking elsewhere. Still, I can assure you that you will easily get your money's worth if you buy this game, especially now when the whole bundle cost 1,79€.			"

												I bought Avernum VI on a sale. I knew what to expect but had never played any of Spiderweb’s games before. After finishing, I thoroughly recommend it, with minor reservations.The graphics are simple but effective; actually, the sprites can be quite charming. I’ve played Dwarf Fortress and a number of rogue-likes so the graphics didn’t get in the way of my enjoyment of Avernum. The only complaint I have about them is that it was quite a challenge to target enemies and move a tile when there were many characters around you during combat, especially in cramped corridors and rooms. The UI is also a bit unfriendly. There are a few issues with combat, imho. It works fine, but it can be very grindy towards the end of the game. I played in the normal difficulty and some of the fights dragged for too long, with enemies that were hit sponges, could hit multiple times, and could summon, all in the same round. I imagine that it must be complicated to balance the challenges in a RPG such as Avernum. I also understand that good games don’t take the player by the hand. That said, after 100 game-hours combat fatigue started to weight me down to the point that I saw myself rushing to finish and avoiding combat (or combat side-quests) whenever I could.  Where the game truly shines is in its story. Jeff Vogel (the creator of the game) is a gifted writer. He managed to present the land and its people very convincingly, sometimes in just a few strokes. Although you encounter most NPCs only briefly, their descriptions usually convey them as fleshed, three dimensional characters with a strong sense of their emotions and previous history. I suspect that some of them (and the places) are survivors from previous Avernum games and it must have been thrilling for veteran players of the series to re-encounter them again. I also enjoyed that Jeff avoided the simplistic moral narratives or Manichean accounts of “good x evil” that are quite common in fantasy RPGs. In summary, I’d give the game 8/10 and would recommend it for anyone who likes “old school” RPGs (however you define such an open-ended term). I bought his first installment in the revamped series (Escape from the Pit) and I’m looking forward to play it in the future. Keep up the good work, Jeff! "

												Summary: This is pretty fun BUT it's basically a beta for the Avernum 1-2-3 remakes, and kinda falls apart in the last third.I know its somewhat unfair to judge a game due to lacking the features and balance changes that were introduced in later sequels, but having played Escape from the Pit / Crystal Souls first, I wound up missing a lot of basic quality of life features. For instance, if you want to make an attack with a ranged weapon and you're too far away to do so, the game won't just run your character forward, but will instead tell you that you can't attack. A lot of annoying little things that alternate between that and outright balance changes:*You basically get into combat the second you see an enemy, so you never have time to buff before a fight - you either run through the overworld with buffs constantly on, or give up on them entirely.* Clerics get their first area of effect spell very late, and it's a fire spell that rolls around just when you're fighting mostly fire-resistant enemies.* Fire-resistant enemies that love to block melee attacks. I never really felt my party was in danger past the early game unless I stumbled into a sidequest combat without being prepared for it, but a lot of the unavoidable maingame combat was horribly sloggy, with the enemies being way more tanky than necessary.* The game is kinda balanced so that you get a lot of challenge out of optional sidequests on normal difficulty while unavoidable maingame content is quite a bit easier (if sloggy). Not sure if I approve of that, and the very notion of going through the sidequest combat on a higher difficulty is frightening.* Game kinda falls apart in the end. You kill the ostensible main bad guys, and are then left retreading the same ground for a few hours, cleaning up loose ends and doing fairly unimpressive quests until you're allowed to access the endgame battle. An endgame which doesn't even have named enemies.With all that in mind, I had a great deal of fun fighting and exploring for about two-thirds of the game, and was invested enough to slog through the remaining third, poor balance and annoying interface issues and all. Not quite the epic sendoff the series deserved, but probably worth your time nonetheless.			"

												While it may not look amazing, this game turned out to be extremely fun and addicting. While it's decently complex with skills and all that, it doesn't take too long to catch on how to play. Plus, you don't need to have played any of the other Avernum games to play this one. It's extremely fun and I definitely recommend it to those who enjoy RPGs, and it's a big plus that you can make your character a lizard. ;D Plus there are other playable races as well!			"

												Avernum 6 is by far the best of the Avernum titles.   And is a fun throwback to when games worried more about a good storyline and content over flashy graphics.Dont expect much to look at... but if you can look beyond graphics you will find gripping gameplay and an excellent storyline that really immerses you into the game.The battles are tactical and deadly, and strategy will win over simple brute force.I find the game worth the small price of admission and would recommend it to any serious RPG gamer.(RPG)			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 18Avernum 6Purchase Date: 7/11/2013Avernum 6 closes out The Great Trials Trilogy.  It's developed by Spiderweb Software, which if you have already played any of their other games, you'll have a good idea what to expect here.  In the event you haven't played any games from Spiderweb Software, then this probably isn't the best game to start with.  Strictly speaking its not required to have played earlier Avernum games, but it helps provide some background.The game is entirely presented in 2D, with a top-down tile based isometric view of the world.  While the presentation is simplistic, the world is still very detailed.  Compared to Avernum 5, the UI has undergone some changes.  The map has been moved to the top right.  Game icons are no longer on the right side of the screen, but across the bottom.The game still begins by having you create a party of 4 characters.  You can select a character type (class) from a list, which looks identical to Avernum 5 except the Scout class is being referred to as Rebel (as it was in Avernum 4).  You will also assign skill points and pick from an optional set of traits.  Traits are a set of advantages and disadvantages that can be given to a character, in exchange for an experience penalty or bonus.  The experience adjustment depends on the severity of the benefit or disadvantage chosen.Customizing the look of your character is still extremely limited.  You can select from a list of portraits, which will define the look of your character in the world.  This is also how you specify your gender.  Most of these portraits are exactly the same as Avernum 5, but it looks like they added a handful of new ones.Once your party is created the game begins.  Each of the Avernum games begins in a similar way, with some on-screen tips to first remind you how to move and interact with the world.  Then the story will find an excuse to quickly get you into your first combat so you can get a feel for the combat system.Combat looks like the same turn-based combat found in Avernum 5.  Characters have a limited number of actions points to move and optionally perform an action such as using an item or ability, or attacking a target.  Like the other Avernum games, combat is kept simple at first to give you a feel for the basics.  As you level up, you will get more skill points to spend on skills.  New spells and spell upgrades can be purchased from certain vendors.Avernum 6 (as with any other game from Spiderweb Software) is not for everyone.  Each of their games are inspired by old school RPGs like Ultima, with it's simplistic presentation and focus on plot over spectacle.  If you prefer cutscenes and voice acting, then this game isn't for you.  If reading lots of quest text sounds boring, then you likely won't appreciate what Avernum has to offer.But if you aren't turned off by these things, and enjoy an in-depth role playing game with lots of combat, then you'll feel right at home with Avernum 6.  In fact, you might consider just picking up the entire bundle of Spiderweb's games.  Even at full price ($45), the collection of 13 games is a great value, especially considering the length of each.			"

												The Avernum (Exile) setting is one of my favorite. Dank caves littered with angry lizard people, cat people, and the occasional demon. A proud but broken kingdom teeters on the edge of the Abyss while rebels and malcontents sense the weakness and instigate rebellion. The graphics are garbage. They wont compete with AAA titles from 2003. But honestly, that doesn't matter. The writing is superb, the setting is epic, the open world goodness mixed with challenging tactical battles more then makes up for the 2d sprites. If you are looking for a game to play for hours on end, look no further.			"

												I like that the play style is the classic gameplay and same as the previous in the series. I don't like that they changed a few key & helpful options. When I looked at weapons/armor in the previous versions, I could see a comparison to what I already have equipped so I could tell if the purchase was worth it. Now I have to physically switch back to the screen an remember the attributes of the equipped weapon/armor. I also am not able to choose which play is first when the round starts. I can place the chars in order I want, but it does not change which char starts a round. I do like the extra options though when creating characters.			"

It's a really good game for those of us that get interrupted alot and get pulled away from the game - it's turn-based; you can walk away at any moment without touching a key.			"
