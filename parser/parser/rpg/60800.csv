												I've been trying really hard to like this game from the moment that I started playing. With each passing encounter, with each newly introduced event, with each new NPC speaking and each logic flaw in either narrative or combat; my task grew to become harder and harder. Finally, I give up. This is the day that I'll leave an RPG unfinished.As the curtain opens, we watch a cinematic about a legendary artifact; the Sickle of Chronos being stolen. Then, we choose between two 12 year old siblings - one male and one female - to take as our character, and begin playing a pesteringly long, somewhat illogical and predictable prequel story. By the end of the prequel, our ""hero"" is given the ""choice"" of becoming the champion of one of the 9 Olympian Gods to compete in a contest. If she/he prevails, her/his one wish will be granted by the gods. To accomplish this deed, our hero is sent to the Island of Machantar to the main temple of his/her deity. After that point, our hero will venture out on an unending journey of hack & slash to acquire that accursed sickle.Numen: Contest of Heroes is a single player 3D RPG in a run on the mill MMO model - which is based on fetch quests or killing a certain amount of monsters to get a certain drop - with the skill bar, mobs to kill and levels to gain. You slay monsters, gain level and loot, travel to new areas with tougher monsters and so on and on... which would be quite alright if it wouldn't be for a couple of downers. To begin with, the storyline is botched, with you always ending up aimlessly wandering around to try and discover ""what to do next"". Quest indicators fail to present pointers or direct towards locations. Any and all areas of the game are open, so it wouldn't differ whether you are level 20 or 80, you can always find a mob to get yourself killed by accidentally.There is a monstrous imbalance between classes; warrior being overpowering, mage being somewhat decent and archer being completely pointless. Skill and item usage are completely laggy; you end up pushing a hot key 2-3 times before the game decides to cast that spell and by then - guess what? - You are usually dead. There is no actual lore to gods or no differentiating factor between gods, so your choice of whomever you decided to follow there is somewhat irrelevant. The game fails to deliver any kind of authentic lore: there are Greek names and figures thrown around, bravo. As if that would be enough for a setting. Aside the main scenario - and a vague one at that - side quests are not many, and they end up popping around in completely imbalanced levels. Dialogue is forced, unimaginative and usually contains a couple of typos anyhow. Arena battles or tournaments rely on luck and how laggy your casting would be instead of actual skill and reflexes. Oh, and as far as atmosphere goes: graphics and textures are okay - with no facial or physical customization option for your character, and the soundtrack decides to take long pauses of silence as you play for no apparent reason.Phew, sorry. I hate being thoroughly this negative, but Numen: Contest of Heroes would be a somewhat acceptable MMORPG. As a single player RPG, it fails to deliver either interest in story, any character or scenario involvement, decent game or combat mechanics or basically any good time. I remember having better time with Metin 2. That was multiplayer at least. When I bought this game, it was on sale for 99 cents so it's not a big loss, but if you are interested in an Action RPG in a Greek Setting, Titan Quest is most definitely a better choice. Good day.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												Numen: Contest of Heroes  basically plays like a single player MMO, complete with hotkey bar, ability cooldowns, and combat that doesn't feel like it's quite connecting.   It isn't a great game, but it's at least a decent one, and well worth the huge sale prices I've seen it (currently $0.99 as I write this review.)  I myself picked it up for $7.50 soon after release, and don't really regret it, though $5 or less is the sweet spot here IMO.The introductory / tutorial section is pretty boring, but persevere and the game becomes more enjoyable later.  You start out as a kid, and through a few quests learn the basics of the three primary classes - Warrior, Archer and Mage.  At the end of the tutorial you get to pick which of the three classes you want to become, and appear as a leveled up adult with only the abilities of the chosen class.  At the same time you also pick which God to worship, granting you additional abilities and bonuses, which increase as you make your God more proud of you through your actions.Then it's standard fantasy RPG fare.  You go on quests, trigger events which advance the plotline, unlock new areas and make more quests available, kill monsters to level up and get better loot, and eventually kill the final boss and beat the game.  You encounter other heroes along the way and choose whether to help, hinder or ignore them.  And there's an Arena tournament event where you can fight these heroes as well.  The balance seems a bit off in some areas.  A couple times you can be thrown into a new area severely underlevelled for the enemies, and have to grind before you can take on more than one of them at a time.  Then 3/4 of the way through you find that 90% of your attacks are critical hits and enemies don't stand a chance as long as you don't get careless.Overall I'd recommend the game when it's on sale, though not at the base $9.99 price.

												It's not a good RPG, but it's not a total catastrophe either... The item and level grinding is boring, it lacks in story and especially in side quests and the level 'design' is pretty much non-existant. Most of the game looks more random than Diablo while it isn't. While the game isn't a complete waste of time and has some moments, the lack of speech for the few NPCs, the mindnumbing and pointless arena fights and a lot of other small details make the game very dull and sometimes tedious to play. There's just so many better Diablo clones around and this one is hardly worth anybody's time. The final battle is a joke compared to the other boss fights. So many design flaws in one game that it's almost a candidate for a rotten tomato award... Unless you're extremely bored and have nothing better to play, stay away from this game.			"

												I really like this game.It looked to me like an arena fighting game at first glance so I always ignored it. I bought it on sale for 79 cents on a whim and I'm sure glad I did.It looks like Titans Quest, but It plays very much like an MMO. Tab targeting, auto-attack, skills hotbar, camps of mobs you have to carefully pull, etc. If you aren't in to MMO-style combat, you may not like this. The combat reminds me of Vanguard and several others. Fights are quicker though, mobs your level usually die in 10-15 seconds.The leveling is relatively fast so far. I've been playing about 6 hours and am level 31. I did grind out a couple of levels once to make an area easier, but it only took about 10 minutes. A big plus for me is that there are 16 item slots, including four ring slots. I prefer many slots and slower upgrades rather than constant upgrades to 6 or 8 slots.One of the things I didn't like about it are the slow walking speed when you first start the game as a child. But once you leave the tutorial island and become an adult, the walking speed is very good.Another thing I don't care for is the day/night system. You have to find a campfire to rest, with the option of resting to restore stamina only, or until morning or evening. It seemed like I had to rest until night time to make one quest mob appear but there was no indication of this that I saw so I roamed around looking for him before trying to wait until night time. So far, this was the only time day or night mattered, other than picking some flowers on the tutorial island, and you are told to do that at night.The last thing is the save system. You can only save at one of the campfires. There are plenty of them around so this is not a big issue for me, but a ""save anywhere"" would be nice. I only went to the arena for a few minutes and it was kind of weird and not all that fun, so hopefully it'll be mostly optional.The graphics are on par with most MMO graphics and the sound is adequate but there is not a lot of music.Having finished all other RPG's that interest me, and being between MMO's at the moment, I'm having a lot of fun with this. I would have easily paid the full $7.99 for it had I realized what it actually was.Edit:1) I finished the game in 13 hours at level 80.2) The arena is optional. I never went there again and only lost a little favor with the gods for missing a tournament.3) The night/day thing was not a big deal. There are 3-4 times someone or something will only appear at night.4) A couple of the quests are a bit vague. I consulted a walkthrough a few times.5) It did crash on me twice, both times after saving and entering a new zone.It was still probably the most fun I've ever had for 79 cents, and is well worth even full price, imo, if you can overlook a few minor issues.

Numen: Contest of Heroes is a third-person hack & slash RPG. Having demonstrated enormous courage as a child, you are selected by a Greek God to be its hero and must compete against those of other Gods in order to find the Sickle of Kronos first.Pros: You get to pick from a boy or a girl, although can't actually customize your appearance. When beginning the game, you are given the option of using different weapons, and your class is determined by the type you used the most. Your mastery of any weapon comes from using it. Each of the three classes allows you to pick from three different Gods to be the champion of, so the game offers a total of nine sets of spells and powers. There is a large variety of equipment you can find (common, enchanted, rare and unique) and may equip up to 16 at a given time. Some of the items you find are only good for one gender, but can be refitted to your character. Rather than being class-specific, items are attribute-specific, meaning a mage that works strongly enough on its Strength will be able to use that badass sword usually meant for Warriors. Graphics are ok, most textures are pretty good, and each piece of equipment have a different look on your character.Cons: The writing is bad: sure, I spotted several typos and even apparent missing words, but the bland story itself is badly written with many mistakes about Greek mythology (example: Neptune is NOT a Greek God), you never actually feel like you're playing in Greece. The game lags and drops in frame rate when looking too far away. Combat is uninteresting, you click on the opponent once and look at the character fight, this game should've been an isometric hack & slash, but that would probably make the tiny size of the maps too obvious. There is little to no development, interactions with other champions are very limited and fighting them in arena battles is lackluster. The game is short, very few main or side quests, no branching paths, save a few short class-specific quests in the early game. The game itself would be over quickly if you didn't spend that much time grinding for levels, the first few hours of which is so tedious that I almost stopped playing (although the grinding got less annoying a few hours in).Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itI've seen worst, but it doesn't excuse Numen: Contest of Heroes from being an uninteresting game that offers no surprise, no excitement, and no replay value. If you have it in your library AND have the patience to tough it through the boring introductory level, you might as well play through it to get it over with, but I otherwise don't see how I can recommend to someone to purchase this.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												I will only reccommend this game to people playing RPGs on a budget. I'm sure you can get this game for a dollar during a sale, and I'd say it's worth it at that point. Besides that, it's a low-budget, not quite horrendous but still not-good RPG with an ancient Greek aesthetic. For some reason, it plays exactly like an MMO in spite of its being single-player only, and the titular contest comes down to you dueling one or two NPCs over the course of the game. But if the struggle is real, there are far worse games to spend a dollar on.			"

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit.  I bought it back around the time it released for full price, and I never regretted it.  And even now years later I look back fondly on this game.  I think I may play it again as one of the other classes...You can choose three basic classes - warrior, ranger, mage.  Later on you get to choose your god based on which class you choose (3 per class iirc).  These choices add certain other abilities.  But they do not seem to make a ton of difference from what I saw.  But it was still a neat idea.The game is fairly basic, and the combat lacks weight (feels like you are hitting air).  But If you enjoy MMOs or mythology, you will probably enjoy this.  It does not take a lot of time to finish it (30 hrs, and I am one of thos egamers that explores every nook and cranny and goes back to previous areas to re-explore after important plot events).  It is a good in between game while you are waiting for something else to release.The story was nothing spectacular, but definitely enough to keep me wanting to see more.  I was definitely engaged.

												If this game was free, I might've felt better about playing it. I thankfully got it on sale for very cheap, but I'm still unquestionably disappointed. After one playthrough, anyone would be able to notice that this game has many, many faults. Pretty unforgivable faults, especially since it's so expensive (relative to the quality, that is): Bland textures and animations, dull, boring gameplay, and a silly, confusing storyline. The developers made the mistake of substituting true, engaging gameplay moments--quests, fights, anything--for easy-to-implement, overdone bloat. I'm talkin' fetch quests, more or less forced grinding, and unintuitive mechanics. I think there was a very small few fun moments, but... they aren't even remotely as abundant as the bland moments. On top of all this, this game's ending is... awful. Just awful. It's honestly, sincerely pathetic. Like, if you're a game developer or wish to become one, I'd recommend you play this game just to see the ending find footage of the ending and see a perfect example of how NOT to end a game. An abysmal ending on top of an already mostly mediocre game? Sounds like rubbish to me.It's sad, too, because I really wanted to like it. An under-the-radar RPG with a Greek mythological setting? Yes, please! Unfortunately, this did not deliver. At all. Stay away from this.			"

												This is a fun RPG with some interesting elements. While you may notice right off the bat that some of the design decisions are a bit lower quality than some games like Mass Effect or Fallout 3, this game is still fun nonetheless. There are 9 classes all of which have unique abilities that actually feel powerful. The world is rather large, the monsters are varied enough to keep things fun, and so on. If you're a RPG fan, and want something new to play, check this one out. At least pick it up when it goes on sale if you aren't sure about it.			"

												Numen is a game that I respect greatly. It may not be the greatest game in its field, but it truly shines in its ambition to try something unique.The idea of creating a competition based system between other characters who favor specific gods, and trying to reach an ultimate goal is what grabbed me in the beginning. What stops it from being the best it can be is the inability to weave this narrative into the story in a solid. There will be points of conversation you will have between other characters during your travels, but they do not mean much, and do not carry weight, as the overall mechanic of favor does not influence your character meaningfully.I think making this a single player adventure is a strange choice, too. It screams for multiplayer functionality, or long-term co-op adventures, but may not have been able to be done by the developer.On that note, the developer has been amazing in communication and support for their game (at the time of release). Implementing additional challenges and puzzles for players to solve within the world (treasure hunting), gave more of a connection of the world, inspired by the islands of the Aegean Sea.I wish the story was better. You are able to follow a young child through their life, from humble beginnings to completing an epic quest, but there is something that gets in the way of my investment. Maybe it is the confusing connection between your character's level and their respective age, or maybe it is connection the game has to wanting to be an MMO, because it certainly wants to be one of them.I only recommend this to those who wish to learn from other's experiences, and how games are made, and who ask critical questions about development. This game is a great example of the potential games can have to be fantastic experiences, but fall short for one reason or another. It is certainly a mixed game, and demands patience from its players (especially when the game crashes and corrupts your save file).			"

												A Titan Quest clone. So Diablo's grandclone. Great graphics, but the gameplay isn't very innovative. The story is new, and the game isn't bad. It's just not worth paying for if you already own Titan Quest.It is definitely different from Titan Quest, but not different enough that I don't feel like an idiot for buying them both. In Titan Quest, you click a button to choose your class. In Numen, you ""role-play"" your class choice. How you play through the beginning of the game determines what class of character you play. Numen feels more like a single-player MMO, whereas Titan Quest feels more like a proper Diablo clone.C+. Not bad, just not unique.			"

												Single-player MMORPG is the work of the devil.This is just my opinion and all but in many cases the MMO aspect is the sole-redeeming quality of these RPGs. When you're bogged down in worthless quests grinding for animal skins so you can afford a purple bowtie instead of settling for a green one, at least you should have a few people to shoot the **** with. With Numen however you're all by your miserable lonesome. There are zero compelling aspects to Numen. The story is pap, the combat is awful, there's no sense of exploration or even a shred of creative design. It's like a series of templates messily slapped together. How much did I pay for this game?

												Not worth it, even at 99c on sale. Like many of the others say, it's basically just a single player mmo. It's so grindy though that it just isn't worth it. I was so bored by playing this game that I just couldn't stand to continue. For anyone that loves extreme grind without anyone to talk with/adventure with, this is probably a gem. But that just isn't me, so I can't in good conscience recommend it. Play a f2p instead. Give the dollar to a homeless person. Buy a cheeseburger. Buy a pack of gum. There are plenty of other options for your money that will satisfy you much more than this will. If you spend it here, the dollar will feel wasted.			"

												Numen: Contest of Heroes is a surprisingly robust RPG, with attractive 3D graphics, well animated if not particularly innovative enemies, and minimalist but adequate sound design.  The game features a leveling system similar to the orginal Dugeon Siege where using a particular attack type, whether melee, magic or ranged will make your character gradually progress in that specialization.  The system is well implemented here and the result is a game that comes across as a nice hyrbid of the setting from Titan Quest and the gameplay mechanics of Dungeon Siege.  Both widescreen and Steam Overlay are supported, but unfortunately the Xbox 360 controller is not.  I would recommend this game to anyone interested in the RPG genre.			"

												An rpg with a distinct MMO-blandness to it, but no actual multiplayer. If it were online, it'd be the game you suck it up and play with your friends because they think it's good for some reason. As a fully singleplayer experience, it's, well, pretty much equivalent to playing a bad free MMO on a server with no other people. Weak interface, graphics, story, audio, animation, character customization, pacing, enemy variety, art design... Good setting. Ancient Greece has lots to draw from, but just go play Titan Quest or something.			"

I hate these so I just skipped them all.I went outside and the tutorial told me how to play, I went to a spider and hit the ""2"" key rapidly 'till it died.I took it's items and went on, killing more and more spiders. I killed them all, and went back to the village, more dialogues and its BORING.I stopped playing there, this game is like a normal online RPG but that isn't online.Nothing special about it.			"

There was even some article from developer, crying how steam is unfair with pricing and they are not able to make any money. Well, they do not deserve any. This game is flustrating, boring, it has no good story, controls are bad, combat is usability nightmare.

												The graphics look nice. The sound is ok. The game play is a mess. A indie company developed this as a MMO however they didnt have the budget for it so they made this. Its a real mess of a game with open barren areas with many baddies all grouped together and no good directions as to where to go.The reason for this is to make the game last longer as told on the steam forum..Save your money and buy another RPG game. Do not buy this game. I got this for free.			"

												Wow! I dont even know where to start! This game is amazing and a massive gem! From the slow and epic combat to the endless running in and out of caves, this game is amazing. I know I only have 9.4 hours, but I finished the main story and it was the best 9,4 hours in my entire life. There are loads of sidequests as well, and óptional areas, so I bet you can squeeze at least 12 more hours out of this masterpiece. If you´re looking for a game that challenges both your patience and your will to live, THIS IS IT RIGHT HEREPros:No control - your character is extremely annoying to control sometimes, which adds to the challenge of the game, making the treat a longer experience.No surprise - Are you bored and annoyed of all those good storylines with cool events? then play this game! you will literally just stand and fight different mobs for hours and hours. ♥♥♥♥ up everything you see - in just 9 hours, I reached a point where I can literally just go around and 1-hit everything I see! FUN!Crashes - The game crashed at least 17 times during my playthrough, because of errors. Which was fun, and made reaching each checkpoint much more satisfyingCons: The game is simply too good. It´s so good that everything else you play after this will be total ♥♥♥♥. Too fun. I died from all the fun I had. Especially when I got to run through a huge labyrinth for like 16 minutes, and then discovered I was too low level, and got to run all the way back from there, farm for like 2 hours, run back through maze and then out again.I wont give this game a score, because I believe this game is so good that it doesnt fit into the current dimensions of scoring, I would like to give it an infinite dimensional score of infinitely large value. perhaps (infinity+1)/(infinity)= score (where infinity is a growing variable), would be a formula that gives this game it´s score. Perhaps the score would be an imaginary number? Who knows because I feel like my entire playthrough of this game was just one amazing dream.			"

												A shallow and very boring experience. I couldn't bring myself finishing the first world map. Lacks story, atmosphere, some kind of suspense and it's repetitive. Quests have you waiting for in-game-nightfall. Lacks lots of genre standards. If you're into greek ARPG you'd have a good time with Titan Quest instead or Zeus (Master of Olympus) for a general ""greek-themed"" startegy game.It's not worth your time if they'd pay you to play it.

												I played a lot of this game and tried to like it.  Got half way through it and decided a single player MMO type of game that is broken in some area's is not worth the time.  Could have been cool, but fell short b/c I had to grind and finding new missions/levels are vauge/hard.  I spent over half the time I played it walking around trying to find something to do... when I ran out of obvious stuff I could do going from island to island... I turned it off.			"
