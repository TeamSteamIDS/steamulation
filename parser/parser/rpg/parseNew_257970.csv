												Loren is a fantastic, polished game with well developed characters, fun turn-based battles and interesting, meaningful choices that affect the plot (granted, sometimes in small ways).If you're on the fence about buying it, or not sure if you'll like it, here are a few details to help you make your decision.* You can choose from one of two player characters - a male human and a female elf.  Their backgrounds are pre-defined, and both have access to the same skills.  Who you pick determines mostly how certain NPCs react to you (some may mistrust elves, for example) and what your romantic options are.* Yes, there are romantic options in all flavors.  Up until the very last screen of the romance, there's nothing risque - just a bunch of meaningul campfire scenes between you and your beloved (kind of like Dragon Age Origins).  The last screen of the romances tends to be a little racy, but it's easy enough to click through it in a microsecond if you wish.  Each completed romance also gets a rather sweet scene or two in the epilogue.* Combat is turn-based, and reminds me of the old-style Wizardry games.  The screenshots give you a pretty good idea of what it looks like.  There's a priority system to attacks, with fast characters going first, slower ones second, etc.  Each attack or spell lengthens your wait timer by a different amount.  The end result is surprisingly intuitive.  * There are a ton of excellent skills to play with.  Each character gets two skill trees.  The first one is fighter, mage or rogue, and shared with other characters of that class.  In my playthrough, I seldom put points there.  Instead, I focused on the far more interesting second skill tree, which is peculiar to each character.  There you find things like Assassination, Dark Magic, Nature Magic, Berserker, Martial Arts, etc.  There's enough variety and 'oh, neat!' factors to keep you experimenting with them for hours.* Though simple-looking, combat is strategic. You need to juggle placement (fighters up front, ranged in the back, etc.), status effects, buffs, debuffs, attacks with various AoE shapes (all enemies, just a column, just a row), and a Pokemon-like strength and weakness system ('You cast rainstorm at Fire Demon - it's super effective!').* Let's talk loot. There's a lot of it here.  You can find it by defeating enemies, solving quests or buying it at a shop.  Shop prices drop as your reputation in each region rises, so it pays to complete non-plot-related tasks in the towns that produce your favorite plate armor, etc.  Each of your followers has a loyalty quest, just like in Mass Effect or Dragon Age.  If you finish it, not only will you have learned more about your companion, but you'll have a powerful piece of equipment they alone can wear.* Speaking of Dragon Age, the story here is similar in outline to that of Origins: an ancient evil has resurfaced, but the factions that could take it down are too busy bickering with each other, and it's up to your band  of adventurers to earn the respect and confidence of each region in order to unite them for a common offensive.  It's a solid framework that kept me entertained for the 10+ hours I played - not once did I feel like skipping through a text box or chat bubble.* Which reminds me.... the characters are not entirely silent.  You'll hear their battle cries and comments in combat.  It's a nice touch, but be aware that most of the rest of the game is text-based.The first time I clicked 'play' it was early evening, and I 'just wanted to try it out'.  I figured I'd do the tutorial, see if there were any glaring errors or red flags, then shut it off and go do something else.  Didn't happen.Instead, I found myself glued to the screen until 6:30 AM.  This is a really, really good game, folks, and if you're into old-school Wizardry-style RPGS with memorable characters, you should definitely give this one a try. "

												Loren has the distinction of being the first game ever where I picked the male PC to use over a female PC for a first playthrough. As a woman gamer, this is really rare! But Loren presents two interesting backstories to choose from and those backstories really do influence how others treat your character and the dialogue options you have. So, to back up: this is basically a low-fi version of Dragon Age. It's heavily story driven, with several interesting characters, tons of dialogue and interaction, huge amounts of world-building, lots of really cool and diverse types of female characters, realistic conflict between characters, and Loren manages to do it all without BioWare's budget or AAA status. The character designs are really cool (Dora and Chambara are probably my favorites) and once I realized (about 5 hours into the game, whoops!) there was a ""fast combat"" option in the menu to speed things up, the classic turn-based combat made me fairly nostalic. My big complaint with the game would probably be the skill trees, partially because for strength-based (warriors) characters most of the skills were useless and for will (mages) and skill-based (thieves) the skills were often unbalanced and there's never a marker to tell you when/how you can gain certain skills (is it progression? A certain level of will? What? Why can I NEVER pick that skill?). It gets frustrating, particularly at higher levels, as the skill points you receive are minimal throughout the game. Regardless of my frustration with the skill trees (and by about hour 7 I just gave up and started auto-assigning), Loren's definitely one of the better RPGs I've played recently. I'm looking forward to the other playthroughs I intend to do to see alternate paths, romances, and endings.			"

												The game certainly has unique features, but is still very far from being excellent, although the beginning is promising. For once you do not play as the namesake of the game, but her servant - a ""lowly"" male by the Amazon's standard, or a female elf (both slaves), accompanying her to go rescue her mother. You make some choices about your past actions and here you go for your stats boost. And the whole thing is very verbose, as promised.Problem being that for a game mostly a visual novel (the RPG aspect is just there to flesh out a bit the adventure), the story is too standard. After rescuing Loren's mother, you learn that Evil lurks. And yes, once again, it's an Evil that was already vanquished in the past, but as everyone know, there's not a soul in the multiverse able to properly seal any evil being whatsoever. Fost, said Evil is uninteresting and clich√©. Let's be honest, for the game's lenght, the background is detailed enough, but still... Too classic. Elves antagonizing humans, orcs, dwarves, dark elves, demons aplenty, lizardmen, etc., things we have seen a bijillion times before. And if there are some talks about tolerance and all that, do not expect much subtelty from the plot, neither originality. Gather all the nations, go to the Big Bad's lair, insert fights, slay said Big Bad, get the girl, the end. Now the dialogs are quite decent, and some characters are delightful, like the female dwarf Dora (beg yer pardon, totally not a thief !) or the snarky dark witch Chambara. For what I saw, the romances are pleasant too- up to six possibilities, and yes, you can flirt with characters of the same gender as yours. Concerning the dialog options, you will have three most of the time : joking, friendly or forceful. Of course other people will react differently depending on your choices, I couldn't estimate if having a majority in one kind really forged a real reputation, but that may very well be. And where does the gameplay fit in all this ? Well, you'll have a great number of fights, six VS six at maximum, with some scripted ones (like having only two members in your roster). Back row cannot be targeted by melee attacks while there are still at least one unit in the front row, wich make it ideal for missile units (bow/magic). On your right you can see in what order characters and ennemies will act, then plan accordingly. There are three classes (warrior, thief, mage), and each of your characters has a skill tree rendering him unique, like the druid being able to cast a heal spell on all a row.Thieves can use mana for special arrows (fire, ice...), warriors can force an enemy to switch position with one on the back row, etc. Insert potions when needed.All in all it plays smoothly, but I really fail to see the claim of the developers : there's nothing hardcore in it. If anything, it's quite casual and simple, not much strategy is involved. Money and equipment are not being scarce, the game is quite easy. Towns have an infinite amount of replayable tasks for money, XP and discount at the local shop ; making the possibility of skipping the odd random encounters sound. Now, I'm one of those stressing the value of story over gameplay for RPG, a reason why Planescape Torment is one of my eternal favorites. But I must insist : the game's intrigue has been seen too often to really be epic. The lack of artworks is rather grueling in that regard, many scenes would have benefited from a dedicated drawing to better depict them. Decently fleshed out characters (the personal quests help) cannot alone bring all the appeal. This not to say a simple story is something bad, here, it's just lacking in a genre where it should shine. One great flaw is the DLC. I do not know about you, but 17 buckazoids is already a bit steep a price. 6‚Ç¨ for content which could (and should) have been in the vanilla game is a blatant rip-off. You'll even get a message in the base game stating that you could recruit Chambara and a certain monk, but, hey, show the money first ! Worse, those two characters can have a crucial impact on the game's ending, wich is just wrong. And as for the replay value ? Yes, you can still change the starting character, romance other people, make a few other choices... But is it really worth going back to the same story without any surprise ? The game itself is not sure of that, as you can skip all the dialogs you want, and have cheat mode enabling you to win all the battles once you have completed the game for the first time.I was intrigued by the aspect of Loren the Amazon Princess at the start and still enjoyed it. It made me think of a Fighting Fantasy gamebook with actual character development.But if you are tempted, my advise would be to wait for a special promotion like -50%. 14 hours-ish of a classic plot (DLC accounted for) with marginal gameplay and satisfying protagonists are just not enough to be worthy of such a price. ""Two novel's worth of in-game text"", by the way, is quite meaningless : are we talking 100-ish pages sized novels, or Stephen King's sized novels ?			"

												I hate overly positive reviews. The entire review scale on most websites has been shifted because these incarnations of Pollyanna insist on giving everything 10s. Just the thought that 3/5 or 5/10 isn't considered ""average"" makes me want to extract vengeance on the endless parade of perfect scores. Now that I have adequately set myself up as hypocrite of the year, let's begin the review.This game is about Loren, who happens to be the princess of the Amazons (yes, I am Captain Obvious, and I'm going for promotion - I like the sound of ""Major Obvious""). Going against all gaming tropes, she doesn't get kidnapped, nor do you play as her. Loren: The Amazon Princess begins with the titular character decapitating some training dummies, then berating her slaves for failing to provide more. She is then quickly informed that her mother (the Queen) did not return and is presumed dead. Loren rejects this and embarks on a mission to save her mother, but the captain manages to force Loren to take the Amazon's most prized slave - that's you.This game's greatest strength is its characters. Sure, Loren may be a terrifying-dual-sword-wielding-badass, but she's also never left the citadel before, and it shows. Within an hour of starting the game, she will have demanded to speak to the Queen of a republic, choked a bartender for the crime of ignoring her, and referred to the Amazons as better than all other nations. Other characters are no less entertaining, as you meet characters like Draco Firestarter - a fire mage who likes to start fires (am I a major yet?) and manages to cause the rest of the party to burst out laughing every time he talks, or Dora the explorer nicest thief in town - she teaches that the best way to make friends is to give them money.This does lead me to one of this game's few flaws - while the dialogue is well written all around, you have little insight into what your character will say. Every dialogue choice you make is one of four options - Joking, Friendly, or Forceful - and occasionally Romance. While the latter always progresses that character's romance, the first three aren't very clear on what you're about to say. For example, early in the game you arrive in a nearby city and Loren insults it. Your response? Joking, Friendly, or Forceful, without any indication on whether an option agrees with Loren or not. The only surefire way is to save before you choose, then pick every option and see which you'd prefer.The graphics are a matter of taste - this game isn't meant to melt your GPU to your motherboard. Many of the reviews seem to hate the graphics, I personally enjoy the graphics. The only graphical issue is with a few of the backgrounds - I noticed stairs leading up to a castle tower looked exactly the same as stairs to an inn's rooms. Minor, but a little strange. Overall though, I'd suggest looking at screenshots and seeing for yourself if you like the graphics. I really don't suggest deciding to purchase (or not) a game based on graphics. The gameplay is fairly straightforward if you've played RPGs before - everyone is either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, and you've got Strength, Skill, and Will to put points in. Certain enemies might be weak against or resistant to certain elements (you used typhoon on fire demon! It's Super Effective!). However, there are a few gameplay elements that aren't self-explanatory, and they aren't explained to you either. For example - dual-wielding carries a penalty (except on Loren, who has a skill to remove this penalty). However, if you wield a dagger in the offhand, you aren't penalized - the game never actually tells you this. It also doesn't bother clarifying stats such as ""Attack"" , ""Damage"" (aren't they the same thing?) and ""threshold"" (I still have no clue that this does).The vast majority of modern games have a few places at which you can choose a different path - and it almost always comes across as a failed attempt to get the player to play the game again. This is one of the few games where it actually works - once I finished the game, I was ready to start over with another character right then and there. Very few games have such replay value, but many of the choices you make actually give you a different story for a while.This is one of those rare titles that actually appeals to gamers that care about characters and story, rather than running 4096x2160 at 120fps, or shooting everything you see with generic guns and getting racial slurs in return. If this type of game doesn't appeal to you, then go download Duty of Calling: Fieldbattle 12. But if you care the slightest about deep characters or a game that can pull you into its world, then I can't recommend this more.			"

												If you like giggly romance, simple dialogues and a regular fantasy setting with a few rpg elements thrown in, then this might be for you.I did like it, but it's still hard to recommend from a neutral perspective. If you look at the game mechanics, writing, character depth, story etc then this is all quite average or below.However, for a Ren'Py game (the engine) it's way above average! And if you know Ren'Py games/visual novels in general, then you already know what to expect: a bit of silliness, lots of romance and recurring pictures. Don't get me wrong... that's part of the charm and quite on purpose!The only thing that disappointed me a bit is the climax of the romance. It could have been a bit stronger, more dramatic or so, honestly.Although I'm not entirely sure, I'm giving this a thumbs down because I think the price is too high. Maybe get it when it's on sale again and if you liked the demo (available on winterwolves homepage).			"

												Loren The Amazon Princess is my favorite Winter Wolves game, by far. This is most likely due to the fact that this is a lot more RPG than VN, but some of those are good as well.The combat is enjoyable and has a fair amount of depth for what is available, with a wide assortment of enemies with differing strengths/weaknesses. There is a wide variety of characters (+3 more in the DLC) who are all completely different. I loved pretty much every conversation with them. The characters all look fantastic, as do the various backgrounds. There is a LOT of text to read in this game, but if you're used to RPGs/VNs, this should be no problem. Depending on the difficulty chosen, the game can offer a decent challenge, requiring careful consideration of abilities, items and attributes.Despite how much I loved it, I'm hesitant to recommend it at the full purchase price of $20 ($25 for Deluxe with DLC). Several of my hours spent were in 3rd/4th playthroughs for achievements. Whenever there's a discount, go ahead and pick it up; you won't regret it.			"

												The biggest issue the game has are the dialogue choices.After the character creation, every dialogue option is: Joking, Friendly, or Forceful. (and sometimes ""romance"" >_>)  These descriptions are simply not enough to make the choice you want.  It forces you to either pick dialogue options you don't like, or (if you're like me) just save before every single choice and then try all three answers to see which one you like most.  Update: I've learned that you can use the mousewheel to scroll back to the dialogue choices, and choose a different option.  This makes figuring out the dialogue choice less tedious, although it still is annoying to have to select and then back out of each option.To give you an idea of how bad these dialogue options are, lets do a scenario.  Person A Is arguing with Person B.  They turn to you for your thoughts.  Your options are Joking, Friendly, or Forceful as always, without giving you any indication of who those options side with.  It's only through saving and reloading 3 times that you learn  Joking and Forceful side with Person A, and Friendly sides with Person B.  Very tedious.  Very annoying.  Now imagine the above scenario for Every. Single. Dialogue. Choice.TL;DRThe dialogue system is an utter failure. (and that's without mentioning my issues with the story or the problems with combat)			"

												I recommend this game under the condition that it's in a HumbleBundle or more than 75% off. $20 is too much for what you get, but if you pay less than $5 then it's well worth your money. Keep in mind that that this is pretty much a visual novel with some RPG elements/combat tossed in. Pros:- Fun, casual gameplay - Catchy soundtrack- Artwork isn't bad- Male/Female playable characters- Many romance options- Random encounters are skippable (as opposed to having to ""flee"")- Combat system is interesting and relatively intuitive- Many different classes and characters to fight with, all with a broad range of usable weapons and armor- Cheat mode to skip combat after beating the game once, to view different endings more quicklyNeutral:- There is A LOT of dialogue, and there are plenty of times where somebody repeats what they already said to you to another character- Elemental weapons are an option, but they aren't entirely useful due to enemy resistances; you're better off using normal type weapons for consistent damage and leaving the elemental attacks to the mages' spells- Some unique boss drops can be purchased in shops, for some reasonCons:- As previousy discussed, the price tag- Story isn't anything new or special- Cliche/annoying character personalities- Can only romance one character per playthrough- Only one or two background images for each location, plus a few common ones that get recycled (tomb, forest, etc)- A few continuity problems with the dialogue depending on your previous choices/the order in which you choose to do things (like when Dora exclaims her fear of Death Knights and how she has never seen one/hopes to never see one, despite having already battled one)- Combat mechanics don't seem to work consistently; sometimes using Taunt III will increase your aggro by 30%, other times by 4% (and the enemies will attack somebody else anyway)- There are fights that require certain characters to be used, which can be annoying if you don't usually use that character and they are underleveled/poorly equipped as a result- There is a severe lack of cloth/padded pants and belts in the shops; Dora and Draco were bottomless for the entirety of my playthroughOverall, it's an enjoyable little game to waste some time on, but wait for a sale.

												Let me just say that Winter Wolves is a company who ought to get much more in the way of support- because this game is essentially one of the greatest visual novel games I've ever been able to play.Loren the Amazon Princess is a game that is actually worth the full price- a rarity in these times, but if you like fantasy or adventure games, you'll want to grab this.  For once, you don't even play as the title character- instead, you play the second banana- either a human male slave, or an elven female.  The character you choose may have different observations about certain scenarios, and they may have a different set of people they might start a relationship with, but to be quite obvious, that's all the difference between them.  Both the male or female characters can get the same moves and the same classes, so really the only thing you're getting is a different view of the world.Combat is actually very well-handled- you just place your characters, and go.  Their turn comes up, you pick a skill or an item to use, and then you repeat until the combat is done.  You'll always have a healer on hand, because whatever you pick for your character- gender or class- you get a class of Healer right off the bat.  As far as the story, it's actually well-written, and the characters have their own personalities.   You can talk to them in camp, you can flirt with a certain few of them, and if your scores are high enough, you'll even end up having to make a choice in a lovers' triangle between two party members- or maybe even more. There are both gay and straight options for both male and female characters- even more than Dragon Age, for crying out loud, and that's saying something.  There's even a bit of DLC, which unlocks four more party members and expands the third chapter with an entire new area.  It is completely worth it, no matter what.  Finally, a bit of warning:  Yes, the Steam version is the toned-down version.  There's a wokaround that you can use, but fair warning- this does create some NSFW scenes in the story, and changes some of the outfits on characters.  Take it as you will.All in all, I would play this again and again and again, unlike some full-price console games and the like.  Go buy this game!			"

												I got curious about this game when I saw the idea of fusing RPGs and visual novels.  Though I've seen the mechanic a few times, ""Loren"" seemed to focus on doing ""more"" with both of its parents.I can't call the game an insta-buy at $19.99 -  it's going to depend on wether it's for you.  Me, a person who likes his RPGs with loot, skills, story, and choices (and now and then likes a game that you can sit down with for 30 minutes or 2 hours), thinks he got his money's worth.  It is definitely a replayable game as well, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try different endings and plots, then that's a plus.  I found a full playthrough is about 10 hours (winning unlocks  cheat mode)""Loren"" is the story of an amazon princess who's mother vanishes, presumed dead, and promptly gives up her queenship to find her.  She's given a single slave to help her - that's you by the way - and very quickly you're necessary as Loren is essentially a niave, unsubtle, combat machine.  Very quickly Loren and your chosen hero/heroine (who you do get some customization of) end up caught up in wars and intrigue, and collect a ragtag bunch of somewhat familiar characters.  So it's off to battle orcs, lizardmen, demons, and more because the world's problems are a LOT bigger than a missing queen  . . . The game mixes visual novel style branching storylines and classic ""Camp"" dialogue with point-and-click maps and classic RPG combat.  It actually balances all of these pretty well - most events are ""bite sized"", combats don't drag on for long, and there's a pleasing level of detail in things like equipment, character development, and battle strategy.  If you're an accomplished RPG player you probably won't find ""Normal"" too hard, though there are moments that will push you - you do have to pay attention.The best part of the combat and character building are how different factors interact - Status effects are a big part of the game, and soon you'll be trying to figure the best way to put your foes off guard.  Classes are meant to work together, especially in boss battles - and every character is ""dual classes"" with a generic class and a specialty class, adding a nice bit of customazation to the usual trinity of Warrior-Mage-Theif.  In short you're always ""this basic class and . . .""The story is the big selling point, and frankly, ""Loren"" delivers a giant heaping helping of common fantasy elements and characters that we're all familiar with (perhaps too much), but then actually goes the distance to add little personal details that bring the characters and events to life.  Sure the prose has a purple tinge, and some elements border on stereotype, but it's fun and you'll find a few surprises - you actually get a nice amount of character backstory if you dive into it, as well as interesting romantic complications.  There are parts that will definitely pull at your heartstrings, and I found myself geniunely liking some of the cast.So a buy?  I'd say if you like your RPGs with story, want a good RPG you can play in short bursts or long sessions, and if something a bit experimental like this appeals, go for it.  I think this is also a game to encourage, because the fusion is quite satisfying - and I'd like to see more.			"

												Wow, what a fun little approach to a lunchtime rpg w/ story elements, character development, Dragon Age/Bioware npc relationship progressions, and old school turn based combat.  This may not be worth the full $20 price it's starting at--but, it's certainly an enjoyable game w/ much going for it.  Even the soundtrack is worth keeping on during play.  Overall, the dialog is both detailed and brief enough to keep the story interesting and enjoyable.  The choices in action and dialogue do have somewhat of an impact in the progress of the story.  But, having played a bit more at this point, I'd have to say most of it is just 'when' you see events, rather than true story impacts.  The 'camp' dialogues are limited in player options for responses (Joking, Friendly, Forceful, and the occasional [Romantic]) w/ fairly obvious outcomes from each.  It gives the feel of relationship development, but at a graphic novel level rather than actually giving a role playing experience.The fact that you play a supporting role instead of the lead is a refreshing twist on the entire experience.  This may even be worth a replay to see what different choices may accomplish.  But, the story follows a fairly straightforward direction.  It is a standard high fantasy tale worth your attention if you're looking for a lunchtime break that includes some playable strategic combat, predictable but enjoyable 'relationship' elements, and dialogue that is decent and not excessive.For the record, please don't rate this down just b/c you think the game's not epic.  I'm not saying it's a Bioware title.  I'm saying, it's a decent $10/$15 game that is worth spending some lunch hours on.Hope this helps!			"

												This game quickly became one of my Top 5 Favorite Games on Steam. It's a JRPG-style game from an non-Japanese indie game company named Winter Wolves. This company is mostly known for dating sims and visual novels, but honestly, I think this game is their best yet. (Although, to be fair, I haven't played all their games yet.) Important note: The DLC is a MUST HAVE. Honestly, the story would seem very incomplete without it, so if you get this game, get the DLC. This review is also based on having it.While this is definitely a RPG, the fact that a lot of their games are visual novels definitely shows in the design. There is zero action in the turn-based battles. In fact, they rely solely on pictures to represent what takes place in the battle. For a lot of people, this is a flaw, but for me, I was indifferent to this type of gameplay. What was important was that the game was fun to play. It took me roughly 20 or so hours to get through the game the first time. This is considered short for a RPG, but it has potential for several playthroughs. Personally, I went through 13 playthroughs, going for all the achievements. It can get a bit repetitive going through the game that many times, but thankfully, the creators realized this; there is a cheat mode that enables ""story mode"" in which the player automatically wins every battle, which can get you through the game much quicker. Obviously, the game is story-driven, which is a big highlight to me. The story is definitely influenced by Lord of the Rings. I can't blame for that, LotR is awesome. However, there are a couple of races that do not exist in the LotR world that exist in this game. Another 1-up this game has is that there's an even distribution of gender between the characters, unlike the sausagefest that is LotR. There is a bit of a dating sim element to this game, but you can actually get through the game without romancing anyone (in fact, there's an achievement for that). There are several people the main character can romance, which is what gives the game the potential for several playthroughs. Each one has its own unique effect on the story. Kudos to the creators for allowing same-sex coupling, which is a reoccurring thing in the Winter Wolves games. Sort of spoiler-ish, but not really:There are also a few different ways to end the game. Ultimately, the Death Knight (main villain) is defeated in each ending, but how you defeat him depends on things you do in the game. I looked up which way is canon out of curiosity, but ultimately, it's up to the player to decide how the Death Knight should meet his ""fate."" There's also a pretty heavy hint at the end of the game that there will be a sequel. Flaws:- There are absolutely no people of color in this game. White people EVERYWHERE; there isn't even a NPC that has a shade or two. And no, blue-skinned dark elves do not count. I mean realistic people of color. - The game could do without so much sexualization of the characters, particularly the women. It isn't really necessary that they be half-naked, especially when they're supposed to be fighting in a war. - I found one technical error in the game. In each town/village, there's a shop and a fame score. The player can earn fame by doing tasks for that particular town/village. Well, sometimes, if you go to a shop in a town/village that has no fame score yet, it'll re-direct to a previous shop. For example, while I was playing, I went to the elves' village's shop and it was linking me to the Citadel's shop. However, once I earned some fame in the elves' village, it correctly went to their shop. This error can actually benefit the player, so it isn't a huge deal.Despite its flaws, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, especially if they enjoy story-driven games and visual novels / dating sims.

												I LOVED this game. As someone who is not particularly well-versed at RPG's, I was pleased that the battle system was easy to learn and navigate, and the battles themselves were well placed throughout the storyline. With a mix of RPG, visual novel and dating sim aspects, I was never bored and while the story might seem pretty cliche, I think the characters and their individual stories were what really made this game enjoyable for me. Once I started playing, I found it hard to quit.The art style was simple and while some may complain that some of the backgrounds were overused, I found that to be part of the simple charm. Chances are, if you're concentrating more on the backgrounds than the story, this game probably isn't for you.As an added bonus, the story had great continuity and the characters each had their own personality and quirks. Easy recommendation.			"

												After playing Loren the Amazon Princess, I had to read the game description again and laugh. The game promises vivid characters, a strong plot, and meaningful decisions but delivers none of the above. A demon lord, who looks like someone traced a picture of Sauron off a Lord of the Rings DVD box, wants to take over the world. You must convince each race (elves, dwarves, humans etc.) to fight the demon by completing a task for them (killing something.) It's the plot of Dragon Age without the nuance and well written dialog. Writing your own ""backstory"" consists of choosing whether you were a stable slave or a castle slave in order to get either thief or warrior stats. Customization is extremely limited. For instance, the thief talent tree is 20 different ranks of inflicting a status condition on a staggered enemy. Overall this was a simplistic and boring game with simplistic and boring characters. It feels unfinished, since they clearly meant for the player to be able to choose to be a mage and they made the romance option nothing more than pressing a big button with the word ""(romance)"" on it. I can't help but think that this is a placeholder for real dialog that they never got around to writing. Don't let the word ""novel"" trick you into thinking that there is a good story to be had.

												(To those of you worried about my play time, I play most of my games in offline mode)(For people who want to know how to get the uncensored version [you know who you are], check out this page.)This game is an interesting one.  The story is lots of fun and the branching endings give it a surprising ammount of replayability, ut what really keeps me coming back is the combat.  It's turn-based and entirely minimalistic, but oh man, it's a very fun system.  I've gone through two run-throughs of this game and I've realized that that was part of the reason that I loved this so much.  It's amazingly done, especially considering the game was built in Ren'Py.While I wouldn't recommend this game to everyone, pick it up if you want a solid game that has plenty of hidden content that will keep you coming back for more every time you find out something new.

												First thing before i start review is 2 recommendation before you play this game...1. Get the DLC. It add so much more content and interesting story to the main story2. IF you are old enough. Play with Suggestive content. IT is not really bad at all and it's really not that much nuddie involved even during romance scene.Alright.. I like this game a lot. It's a 80% VN and 20% RPG fomular. The battle, level up and equipment system are very simple. You can change difficulty anytime you can pull up the main menu. Most of the battle are really simple as long as your characters are properly equiped even on hard difficulty.  (personally i found killing goblin king on hard seems to be the hardest fight of the game). There are a few boss fight you need to kill them on hard to get the achievements.Overall Graphic is quite well drawn. Basic 2D design with elegent and clean character design. The Music is decent and mostly quite come. Some time the music cut abruptly and it feels like it can still be improved further.The story writing is quite interesting but nothing too speical. All the character backstory seeem good but it feels like i have played other Games or read other books that have the same plot. There are really no special eye openers and intense moment.All the achivements are really easy to get but quite a pain to get to. I will probably need to spend 8 more hours to replay story a few times to get all the romances even with save/load function. At least 2 different play though is needed. Since human male character and elf female character have different romance options.I give it a 7.9/10. I enjoyed quite a bit and i wish i can enjoy it a bit more. As i said before 80% VN + 20% RPG. That kinda of VN/game balance feels like sengaku rance. So i would recommend it more for VN fan then RPG fan.			"

												The game isn't bad. Let's be clear about that, but it has some flaws that detract from it's fun factor (for me anyways).The graphics are good - about what you'd expect for this genre of game.There's a lot of story. It's not badly written, but it's not best seller material either - again, about average for the genre.I do like that there are places where the plot diverges - I haven't put in enough time to see if it's just a case of B then A, instead of A then B, or if it's a permanent change to the game.My main complains with the game have to do with the combat system .Since that's the main point of the game other than the story, I consider them pretty serious issues.First, I'll explain the skill system. Each ""skill tree"" consists of 6 or 7 skills, each of which has 3 levels and some skills require other skills to unlock. Each character has 2 skill trees available. Every character has one of 3 basic class trees (mage, thief, warrior) and their own class tree of unique skills.Some skills seem almost pointless. Others seem very counter intuitive.Example of a pointless skill - from the basic class FIghter tree.Power Strike (Lvl 1/2/3) - activate to do (15%/30%/45%) extra damage but lose (10%/20%/30%) speed for (3/4/5) turns.So at level 1 it does 15% extra damage but you attack 10% slower for 3 turns. So each turn will take 1.1 'time' than normal. The 3 attacks take 3.3 'time' to complete to do 3.45 'attacks worth' of damage. Sounds like a *small* bonus. But activating the skill takes about 0.33 'time' of an attack - so it's actually 3.63 'time' for 3.45 'attacks worth' of damage. In addition it costs you stamina to cast it. Also, if you use any of those turns to do something other than attack, you're just taking a slow turn with no benefits.  These type of skills would have been much more useful if designed as single turn attacks with a smaller stamina cost.A skill that seems counter-intuitiveThe Archmage tree is basically 5 (6?) elemental types. Each skill is an AOE attack with a chance of a status effect (burn for fire, freeze for water, etc).As you increase the level of the skill, you DECREASE the damage the attack does but you increase the chance of the status effect kicking in.At level 1 - all the skills do 300% base damage and have a 10% or 30% (depends on the status) for the status to take effect.At level 2 - it's 250% damage and 20 or 40% At level 3 - it's 200% damage and 30 or 50%Again, it's not that combat is awful,  it's just many of the skills seem.. less useful than they could be. Perhaps I wouldn't be so critical of the skill system had I never played Monster's Den and Monster's Den:Book of Dread - free games on Kongregate that use the same combat style but with much more interesting and varied skills.The other problem is grinding. Each town has 3 grind battles available. As far as I can tell, each of these battles is always the same with zero variety in creatures (so fighting undead in the dark elf town means 3 skelly fighters, 2 skelly archers, 1 necro... never 3 archers or 2 necros and an archer.. never ANY variety. I don't know that I find the story compelling enough to complete the game when the combat system is so.... static and repetitive compared to other games I've played with the combat system. "

The replayability of it is great as well, allowing you to make new choices and get rewarded with entirely different scenarios.			"

												My thoughts in 50 words or fewer:What drew me to Loren the Amazon Princess was that I wasn't the main character, that my job was to make sure everyone else stayed alive. Though the combat was nice, it wasn't anything special. It was the story and character development that really sucked me into it.			"

												Loren is one of Winter Wolve's best VNs. This game happens to feature a hybrid visual novel RPG component that lends itself to degrees of challenge. However, don't expect something complicated or in depth for that matter. I found the battles to be slightly tedious at one point because I was more into the story. The game starts off as a rag tag duo of you a lowly servant and your Amazon Princess off to find out the whereabouts of her mother. The game then blossoms into your typical team of unlikely heroes out to save the world from impending evil. We've seen this plot before and it isn't unique in any sense. What I enjoyed was the individual character stories and relationship building. You don't necessarily date anyone in the game but as you spend time getting to know your fellow travelers you get the option to romance a few of them and grow closer as the story progresses. I've played through this game as both the male and female choices. There are several characters for each to get closer to and all of them eventually have individual quests that you can partake in. So while the story is linear in nature you have plenty of side quests and branching that allows you to deviate a bit in the path you take throughout the game. One thing I appreciate about this game is it gives equal opportunity fanservice. Sure characters are pretty scantily dressed and there's no shortage of semi nakedness going on you are just as apt to see topless guys as you would see nearly nude females. Also there's opportunity for gay and lesbian romance options. Options, being the key word, if you don't like seeing a budding romance between 2 men you can totally avoid it. Now the Steam version is the slightly censored version of the game in which the characters might wear a little more clothes and show a little less skin. To remove the censor there are a few guides you can reference, it's quite simple. Note that the intimate scenes are tastefully done and everyone wears underwear but aren't scenes that are of the SFW variety. But really, if you're playing this game at work it'll make little difference if your boss sees elf boobs or not. The writing was well done. I actually enjoyed all the characters stories and dialogue and it was a great reprieve in between all the mundane fighting. After you finish the game once you can unlock the cheat menu to auto-win the fights so you can play this game as a pure VN experience.  With the expansion unlocks an few additional side quests, characters and events adding an extra few hours to your journey. But you might want to play the base game first. Overall I enjoyed this game and think anyone who wants a little more variety in their visual novel would enjoy this.			"

												TL;DR: An even mixture of RPG and Visual novel. Well done story and gameplay, nothing extraordinary, but worth a play.Loren: The Amazon Princess is one of those rare birds of a Visual Novel that is equal parts RPG gameplay and story sections. Both are executed well, and complement each other very well. If I was to sum up the game it one word, it would in fact be competence. While that shouldn't be rare, the fact that this game executes everything well, with very few stumbling blocks, is worthwhile enough for me to give it my reccomendation. I did truly enjoy the game in my first play through, and the only frustrations I found were in acheivement-hunting for 100% completion, given it requires quite a few playthroughs in order to get all the romance acheivements.The story is nothing outstanding. Your main character is a slave to the titular Loren, and the game plays out as you being the deutaragonist to her. You can pick your gender, which will affect romance options, though the game treats bisexuality as the norm, as most characters have romance options with both. When I say it is not outstanding, that doesn't mean it is bad. It is a good story, and I enjoyed it at first, but it doesn't push any boundaries, and stays fairly in line with common tropes of the fantasy RPG genre. If anything, the game could be closest compared story wise to Dragon Age: Origins. Big bad threat, have to convince various factions to follow you, recruit a diverse cast, talk to them over the campfire to get their stories and personal quests. If the game has any faults story wise it is that you really don't have much control over the story itself. Dialogue options tend to be selecting tone of your character (or increasing romance points), and you get very few major choices throughout the story. Your ending is basically determined by who you romanced, a final option at the end, and whether or not you did the DLC content.Gameplay wise, combat plays out in a turn based style, with your characters arrayed on a 2x3 grid opposite your opponents similarly laid out grid. Turns are according to a characters speed and the 'delay' of their last attack. A lot of the combat is based on status effects. The entire rogue skill tree, and most fighter skills rely on the opponent either being staggered (which can occur through powerful hits), or having various other status effects applied through spells or other skills. The game seems to be intended that you would apply status effects with mages, and have the rogues/fighters take advantage of them to deal tremendous damage. In practice though, since most fights including bosses are against masses of enemies, I found it better to stack three mages with max level AoE spells, and blast them down, leaving fighters/rogue for cleanup. The game has a fairly simple level up system, where your characters get stat points every level, and a skill point every few levels. The skill points let you progress down (short) talent trees, usually getting rank 1, then 2, then 3 of an ability. For most, this is just more damage, though mages progress from single target, to row, to all. There is practically no reason to spread things out, and far better to get rank 3 in a few abilities to deal massive damage, and spread out later to other damage types. Each character has a primary and secondary skill tree. The primary tree is of the fighter/rogue/mage basic class, and the secondary is unique to that character. This allows every character in the varied class to have a unique feel, a definite bonus.The game is intended to be played multiple times, hence the sheer amount of romance acheivements being practically more than the rest all combined. After you finish the game, the game does let you put it on story mode, which essentially disables combat, and lets you quickly skip through the game to the various endings.The only major downside I found in this game was inventory management, and the lack of leaked experience. In essence,  if you want your characters to have great gear, you will need to buy it. The costs for said gear are extremely high. You can lower the costs by doing repeated fights in towns, but it only works for that town. This also serves to give you money and vendor trash, but in small amounts. Story fights give you only the occasional decent piece of gear, and character side quests will usually give you a major item, but I went through the game with most of my party missing a huge chunk of gear slots, and even my main characters were often missing rings and belts. In addition, experience is not leaked to non-party members, which means that in several sections of the game where you are forced to use certain characters (their sidequests, sections where you have to fight through hordes and have characters get worn down), if you have been focusing on a single party you will be punished severely. The only way to catch these characters up is the aforementioned grinding fights, which barely give decent experience.Overall, Loren is a well done game. It will never sit on my 'Oh my god, you must play this!' list, but it is well executed, competent, and deserving of play if you enjoy these types of games.			"

												EDIT: Yes, my play time on Steam is less than an hour. This game has been out for a while outside of Steam. No, I am not some paid review, or bot or anything of the sort. Please stop downvoting this review because you think its not legit. Look it up, and you'll see this game isn't exactly new.This game is absolutely amazing. How amazing? I've never been compelled to write a Steam review for anything I've ever played before. But this game deserves all the praise I can give it.You start off by selecting whether to play as the male human Saren or the female elf Elenor. Either way, the gist of the how the game starts remains the same. You are a slave to the Amazons, and have been for a long time. Saren was born into servitude among the Amazons, while Elenor traded her freedom for protection when she was a child.The Queen has gone missing and against tradition, the Princess, Loren, goes off to find her. By the laws of the Amazons, she is forfeiting the resources of her title by leaving to look for her. The Amazons do, however, provide her with a servant to assist her, one who has shown great promise and loyalty: you.The story begins as a search for a missing Queen, but Loren, her servant and the others they run into along the way quickly become embroiled into a much greater matter; that may decide the fate of not only the Amazons but all of Aravorn.To get right down to what's great about this game: the characters are amazing. This is one of those games where you will remember the characters long after you've hit the end credits. Whether you choose to play as Saren or Elenor will determine which characters you can pursue a romantic relationship with; if you wish to purse any of them at all.If old fashioned man-on-girl action isn't your thing (and don't worry, it has that too), then prepare to fall head over heals with Winter Wolves for selection they've given you here. Saren and Elenor may both pursue a romance with Princess Loren, for instance, however only Saren can woo the elven druid, Myrth. Only Elenor, on the other hand, can win the heart of the assassin, Rei. The Amazon Queen, Karen, however, isn't really going to be won over by Saren; but Elenor might just be able to win the heart of the beautiful Queen. She'll have noticeably less luck with the ever-adorable fire-mage, Draco, who may find his attention better drawn to Saren's manly charms.There are other romance options available, as well, but I won't spoil everything here. And there's certainly more to be interested in than just who you can romance. The characters are all very memorable, even if you don't pursue them. They'll also prove to be quite useful when combat occurs.At the start of the game, you decide not only which one of the two protagonists to play, but what class they are; either warrior or thief. This determines the sort of abilities you'll have in combat. Every character has a sub-class as well, and in the protagonist's case, it's ""Hero"", which gives you access to healing and support skills, regardless of your main class chosen.Whichever class you pick, you'll find different characters will compliment you in different ways on the battlefield. Some serve better in the front lines, soaking up most of the damage, while others are better positioned in the back where they can blast away at the enemy with arrows or magic; or perhaps heal up your party so they can keep on fighting.The combat system itself, while graphically very simple, is actually quite enjoyable and tactical. The placement of your party, as well as how you level them, and what you equip them with goes a long way towards victory or defeat; though rest assured that its pretty hard to mis-manage yourself into a corner, especially since you can go into the options and lower the difficulty at any time if you find a battle is proving too much for you.That may sound like it makes the game too easy, but it really doesn't. If you want the challenge, simply restrict yourself from using that option. At the end of the day, however, this game isn't exactly about gameplay. The fact that the gameplay is actually really enjoyable is just icing on the cake. The heart of this game is the characters, the writing and the story. What you have here is a richly crafted world, with three-dimensional (in personality, not graphical design) characters, and a story that, while perhaps not revolutionizing how we look at medieval fantasy, is clever, well conceived, well-written and well-delivered. To top it all off, while you certainly won't be making quite as many major plot choices as you would in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, you do have a very distinct sense that your character made a difference by the end of this game, and the coices you did make mattered.This game has quite a fair amount of replay value. You can see what its like picking the other protagonist, which changes some scenes and dialogue here and there; and unlocks different romance options. You can see what different romance paths are like, and how they'll effect things. You can also simply try out different character builds and try to get better at the combat system. There's also a few plot decisions you might want to try differently, to see how they play out.To sum it up, if you like RPGs, with a bit more of an emphasis on the ""RP"" than the ""G"", this is a game for you. The gameplay is solid, but I think most people who fall in love with this game like I have will do so more because of the roleplaying than the gameplay mechanics. If you like romance, this is a game for you. If you've been yearning for more games that recognize that gay, lesbian and bisexual people DO exist, than this is a game you will want to check out. I still feel like I haven't properly conveyed how much I love this game. It may not be for everyone, but if you're even considering getting it, I recomend at LEAST grabbing the demo off of the developer's website and giving it a try.EDIT: I just thought I'd add, I recommend getting the DLC if you play. Its pretty cheap, and the new content is totally worth it.			"

												Not a bad game.  I originally bought because it was on sale, and I felt like supporting some indie developers.  One play through on normal difficulty should take you about 10-15 hours depending on how fast you read through the text because there's a lot of it.  I thought the combat was pretty satisfying, you can have up to 6 members on your side fighting 1-6 enemies and each of you take turns with options of attacking, using skills, items, or magic.There are several endings to the game, and I felt sentimental reading through the last scene knowing the final fate of my character (there might be different endings to that too).  But the last boss battle was rather anticlimatic.  There's a cheat option availible if you finish your first playthrough and you can skip all the dialogue really quickly with the tab key to get to alternate endings.  Try the demo out at the official site of the game to see if you like it.			"

												I loved the game !It is quite short, I presonnaly like that : you can finish a game while still in the mood and don't have to reload your save month latter. You have some time to develop your characters but you see the finality of your choice since the beginning. The strategy is nice. I found it rather easy but you have to think during battles. The story is nice but the text sometimes uselessly long. Having romance options is nice but doesn't bring so much to the game, as the different story choice that we can make. I really loved the visual novel way to tell a story for a RPG game : it is really working for me (I don't like to have to spend my time moving my character and looking for people to seep and explore, and when I have the opportunity to do it I do it thouroughly, so... - yes, it's completly stupid, I know.). The strategical choice (in and outside batlle) are nice. I like the fact that the story give you plenty of XP, so your different character don't have major differences in level (and so you can switch the ones you use if you want).Numerous optionnal battle and other ways to win XP or money are available. If you like challenge, don't do it.			"

												Pretty decent game if you can get over the magical realm fetish-fuel aspect. Combat is a little bit like Eye of the Beholder, but unfortunately doesn't have it's sense of exploration.Being a game about narrative and character interaction, a big problem is when the game gives you options on how to respond, it's very vague about what that response actually is: for example, if someone calls your friend an a-hole, you might get three choices: joking, friendly, or forceful. So you pick forceful, thinking you're going to put that jerk in their place, only to realize afterwards that ""forceful"" meant ""forcefully agree"", and your character says something like ""YES HE SURE IS A SERIOUS A-HOLE.""Also, during the first part of the game, the vast majority of the loot you find or have the option to purchase will be considerably worse than the gear you start with, which will leave you a little bored with some of the RPG elements, at least early on.Could recommend if you're a fan of visual novel-type games and it's on sale.

												Very nice fantasy game with easy plot and interesting stuff to do. Many options to shape your own character from personality to back story and skills. There was many romance options too so that was interesting. Game may be little too long for how many romance options there is because from what I see romancing characters does not change the many events or ending that much that it would be worh to try all out. Epilogue was weak to me and not enough but good game.			"

												Moderately fun, but in no way worth $25--it's just too amateurishly done.  Buy it when it goes to 40% off or better.Good points:- The combat system is pretty good for its type, and I enjoyed trying to figure out the best abilities, combos, and strategies.  Don't believe the bit that says to choose Moderate Difficulty if you have RPG experience--crank it to Hard.  A good number of the battles seem to be scaled to average party level, so you don't have to worry about swapping in someone underpowered.- A bunch of the character dialogue is really amusing, mostly anything involving Draco or Dora.  Other dialogue was occasionally cheesy but usually good.  I wasn't bothered by the Joking-Friendly-Forceful choices not telling you what was actually going to be said, partly because they almost never affect the end result of a conversation and partly because I eventually figured out that you could use the mouse wheel to scroll back and pick a different option as many times as you like.- You can save/load pretty much anywhere and there are a giant number of savegame slots.  Alas that you cannot tag descriptions onto them.Bad points:- The documentation/help is limited and in at least one instance (the combat help) is outright wrong.  Example that irritated me right off: if you play a Thief you're asked to choose among skills that inflict status ailments without any way to determine what the ailments actually do.- It needs another pass or three of heavy editing.  The writing has a lot of grammar and phrasing and usage errors, and the storyline sometimes suffers from plot inconsistency and obvious logic issues.  In a story-driven game that relies so heavily on text, these were really annoying.   (It also has a lot of ridiculously unlikely things happen just because they're plot-convenient, but that's kind of par for the course in this genre.)  - Better branch tracking would be good too--there are two main ways to get through chapter one, but there are parts of chapter two that assume you went one way and were seriously confusing to me because I went the other.- I am not sure why the game has gear with mage-only stats that mages can't wear.  Maybe to drain gold from the unwary?- When you finally get to see a second drawing of a character in Ch 4, it's only 50/50 whether they look the same as the first drawing.  (As a related good-ish point, it's kind of amazing what they can do with only one drawing and some variant facial expressions.)I could talk about the outfits, but...  If you've looked at any of the screenshots then you know exactly what you're getting.  Whether they're a good or bad point is up to you.			"

												A really pleasant game, I rarely buy these sort of games, but this one captured my attention for two whole evenings straight, and I am already thinking of having another go. It's fun, it has a nice story and what I really miss from non-bio ware games, some party members with their own stories and characters and romance options ;) well done guys.			"

												The story read like a poorly written fanfiction and was impossible to take seriously.  I could have forgiven the incredibly cliche standard fantasy plot if the dialogue and exposition had been better.  As it is, I couldn't stomach it for more than a few minutes at a time, and after a couple attempts, retired it altogether.			"

												What I liked from Loren The Amazon Princess (I may not list them all):+ The art of the characters (Loren, etc).+ The story. It's enough to make me laugh here and there.+ Music? Well like any other music in this world, even the best music can be boring if it replayed many times. That happened in my Loren The Amazon Princess gameplay. The point is, the music is good enough for me, only that I have to turn it off sometimes. But not because it's not good or something like that...What I disliked (Once again, I may not list them all):- Lack of CGs.Do I recommend Loren The Amazon Princess to you?The answer is yes, I enjoy my time playing Loren The Amazon Princess, and I recommend it to others because that's how I think it will support the devs (and not recommend it will do the opposite).
