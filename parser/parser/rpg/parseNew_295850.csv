			NEW Vlad the Impaler out now for Mac. A choose your own adventure RPG graphic novel. Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Full Review  http://bit.ly/VladtheImpaler Get the Game ...		

Vlad the Impaler - Full Review This game is a bit of an odd one, on it’s launch day there was nothing to indicate what type of game it might be. Just this snippet:“A city gone mad with violence and the mass murder of its people. Your choices can either lead you to the ultimate destruction of this fallen metropolis, or the demise of a vicious butcher. Will you save this city as promised or will you fall prey to the killer within?” Along with the system requirements.Rather baffling I tried looking up the Developer website, only to find that they have no site. Next I tried the Publisher. They didn’t even list the game, so I emailed them just to confirm the game is from them.As it turns out Vlad the Impaler is a choose your own adventure graphic novel with some light RPG elements. A rather interesting concept to say the least, and instantly made me think of the old Goosebumps horror books I read as a child.Determined to get into the think of it and create a powerful character I was surprised to find that you only have three classes to choose from, and you’re unable to really customise them in anyway.You have the explorer, essentially a rogue, the warrior, and mage. A rather standard trio in RPG games. Sadly you’re unable to mix and match them or even their attribute points. Which can only be altered in gameplay due to dialogue choices and events.The main mechanic is choosing your own adventure by being presented with several areas to wander in, and occasionally have two choices to choose from. Yes, only two. A rather tiny amount for a game that so heavily relies on user choice as its core mechanic.Even so the game and story is riddled with inconsistencies, and ultimately your choices have little to no true bearing on the game or its conclusion.I’ve often finished a chapter without realising simply by exploring an area, as the each chapter has a set amount of ‘turns’ or clicks you can make. Thereby shooing you along further into the game while feeling unsatisfied and wanting more of the game world. This is where the inconsistencies hit you quicker and harder than jumping in front of a bullet train. As I entered the palace’s kitchen a man apparently thanked me for saving his son. “I’m sorry, who are you and when did I ever encounter your son or you?”. That’s what I would have asked, if even given the option, but no the game carries on giving you but two options. Either drink the stew he offers as a reward, or don’t.I don’t ever remember any of the mentioned events, and this could only have happened less than 20 minutes ago in the previous chapter.More inconsistencies constantly surface, even in the final act of the game. Where you somehow have all the items you need to somehow combat your foes. Such as meeting three damsels in a castle and suddenly having wild roses, which you exclaim wards off and incapacities these vile creatures. Okay, yes. Magical flowers I somehow picked up somewhere. I don’t know where, nor did I ever do so.  There are gaps in the game, and it’s a shame. One would think that since choosing your own adventure is the core mechanic the game would be simply packed full of content and choices. Sadly it’s all rather lacking, with barely any content to sate any person’s gaming or reading appetite. It fails on both accounts.  There are different class and character attributes, strength, constitution, agility, magic, and charm. The latter being emphasised throughout the game, and always highlighted. Instantly alerting you to its significance. These ware all affected by in game choices, such as speaking with someone, or witnessing something. In the case of constitution, my character lost a point simply while having his lunch and witnessing a man being executed. This was a permanent loss of one point, rather annoying but nothing series.  As mentioned charm is highlighted, and turns out to be the most important, not for simply speaking to people you encounter, but also the final conflict with the stories antagonist. It matters little that my magic points were the same as my charm ones. I was unable to cast a single spell as a mage during this encounter, and simply overpowered and subdued the creature by appealing to their humanity. So, what’s the point in all the previous options for actions, or attributes? What little there is to Vlad the Impaler was rather enjoyable, but sadly horribly marred by the serious lack of content, and depth beyond merely having a Yes or No option.The ‘game’, simply rushes you through in about an hour, and despite claiming to have replayability due to user choice changing the story; it’s simply false. The beautiful and dark art, and music is fantastic and I truly enjoyed seeing and listened to it. Still, I simply cannot recommend this ‘game’ to anyone. Whether they want a dark RPG, or a visual choose your own adventure book. There simply is not enough content to justify the price tag, and makes one wonder if this was not the reason for information and details regarding the game not surfacing on its Steam page until a day or two after launch.A true waste of what could have been something dark and wonderful.

												Recommended but ONLY while it's on sale, and ONLY if you don't mind a game consisting purely of reading and choices.Vlad the Impaler has virtually no gameplay, and the only thing you, as the player, do, is make choices as the story unfolds. At its most basic, it's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, but of course, the subject matter is different from the traditional children's books. Your character is sent by his liege, the eponymous Vlad, to investigate the increase in murders and violence in Istanbul, and depending on the character you choose, you will have different means to conduct your investigation, and defend yourself when attacked. Your character has stats, and they will increase and decrease during the adventure, making him or her better at surviving in different ways.The writing is gripping and engaging (though for some reason, the word ""and"" is always missing), and while a playthrough can be completed in fifteen minutes, you'll find yourself doing quite a few of them, because it's impossible to do everything in one playthrough. Negative points about the game are the fact that you don't know what outcomes your choices will have (and sometimes they'll be questionable), and that the stat increases and decreases seem to be a bit strange at times.So if you like reading and playing a choose-you-own-story type of game, and you have a vivid imagination, you can buy this one while it's on sale. Its regular price isn't justified, not out of quality concerns, but by how short a playthrough is.			"

												First of all when you start the game you will be thrown into a world of confusion. There is no in-game manual, no forums or creator's website to check on, you will have no idea what each of the 8 stats do and how they affect the game. You will choose among the places opened to you to visit per chapter, and subsequent chapters open up more locations and these locations hold events that shape your adventure, and each time you visit a location you will get a random event from a pool created by the developers(you may get them randomly, but the events themselves are always the same), these events will usually ask you to make one of two choices, that will have the conclusion pertaining to your choice. You have to note that the characters that you picked are not you, they are your avatars with their own history, and during events I find that characters will use their hidden knowledge that players didn't even know they know or that they are qualified for, or using clues you've obtained which was never properly explained. Depending on the places you visit and the choices you make, you will be rewarded predetermined or penalize stats(in which you have no idea how the developers came to the conclusion that these are what you should profit or lose from the experience of the event). With this method, I find it defeats the purpose of making your own choices, since a player will see all the events via multiple play through(see the spoiler to why), then pick the most advantageous choices to maximize stat gain.(Spoiler) At the end of the story you fight the boss(which is the only time these stats seem to have any use), and you choose from among the ambiguously named choices on the left panel(which are actually battle events that utilizes your stats to ""fight"" the boss). The higher your stats are, the better the story result for that option you picked, if you win in the story event against the boss he will take a strike, with 3 strikes on the boss you win, the opposite is true if the boss wins 3 battle events. In which case kills your character, ends the game and deletes the save pertaining to that play through.It just feels to me like this game is made to be a quick cash grab. Contrary to the bit about the developers knowing what we want as a gamer, this game is far from complete, alpha stage at best.			"

“I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things, which I dare not confess to my own soul.” ― Bram Stoker, DraculaI'd like to start this review with a confession: when this game was recommended to me by a friend, as a most successful visual novel I might enjoy, this wasn't what I was expecting. I got hooked up after the first playthrough and went on full exploration mode here. I really do like visual novels, and I always had a tendency to enjoy Gothic narrative when it's well-done so why not a combination of both? Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Vlad the Impaler.Vaguely based on Bram Stoker's timeless Gothic classic Dracula and mostly taking its factual background from the Transylvanian-born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia - Vlad the Impaler is a short visual novel centering around an educated traveler who had the luxury of calling the vile count ""an old friend"". Our adventurer receives a letter from the nobleman, urging him to visit the city of Istanbul and discover whatever vile force of darkness may be holding the city in its clutches. He claims that even the Sultan himself wouldn't set foot on the street, knowing full-well the supernatural danger waiting at every corner. With this plea at hand, we travel to Istanbul to either save the city, or die trying as any doe-eyed, good intentioned adventurer would do. Yet, we are to remember that once we gaze onto hell, the hell gazes back.This is when things get an interesting turn. For the game mechanics, we are to choose one of the three classes as the game starts: the explorer, the soldier and the mage. All these classes will be relying on 3 of the 6 relevant stats to pass some stat checks in each episode, and eventually face the final boss at the end. You have 15 days - or turns - to raise these stats based on your choice actions and various encounters within the city. Each encounter takes place somewhere in the city, and may result with stat raises or decreases depending on your choices. Choices in these encounters are not various but they are interrelated to several investigation branches with decent narrative.There is a 7th semi-relevant stat - which would be the charm. It is mostly an irrelevant stat, yet raising it will present you the only peaceful solution at the end of the game. Aside the stat balance, most of your choices would influence your morality, considering it is a horrendously vile setting with the worst kind of creatures roaming around. Based on your moral standing at the end of chapter 4, your class will automatically chose a sub-class and attain a 4th relevant class skill. Some encounters would be only available if you have visited and solved prior ones, so the game presents some replay value too. If you snatched this game for the purpose of achievement hunting, you'll be replaying it a lot anyhow - since the appearance of legendary weapons are purely luck related, making relevant achievements quite stubborn to fetch.Considering this whole game dynamic, Vlad the Impaler might be labelled as a visual novel with light RPG elements. Not grand, not spectacular yet somewhat satisfying. Yet, atmospherically it is not lesser than being majestic. Artworks consist of pencil drawn backgrounds, oriental city silhouettes and various mystical depictions of a medieval Istanbul, with the darkest possible elements of horror harbored into one. Music is an eerie beauty, elevating the whole setting at each turn with dreadful suspension. Narrative, aside a couple of overlookable grammar mistakes and some minor disconnections in the event flow, is dark, vile and elegant; brutally effective at describing every unsettling detail in each scene. Sure this effect fades off after your 5th playthrough or so, but it is worth the experience anyhow.At the end of the day, Vlad the Impaler is a one dollar game for you to take 3-4 hours of enjoyment out of it. If you do not expect a miracle, knowing full-well the core dynamic and genre of the game, it is worth every cent and your time to enjoy a short yet dark adventure. Good day, and good gaming to you!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

												It's a nice choose your own adventure type of interactive novel with some stat driving RPGing in the background but it is rather short... the main value derived from multiple playthroughs as you try to finish the game with different stats and alignments while adding different layers that surround the story.The biggest gripe with the game is its brevity and the story isn't anything groundbreaking but on sale I'd recommend it to adventure game fans who don't mind reading and using their imagination to add color to the monotone backgrounds.

												Now i will start of by saying that i am not really into the ""INTERACTIVE NOVEL"" type games,but this one had me hooked and i will tell you why.Its like anything else really if you like the subject matter you are going to enjoy whatever it is your doing reading a book,playing a game,listening to music,watching a movie you get the gist.If you like what it is you doing then it doesnt matter what some one else thinks as you are going to enjoy it regardless as it interests you and at that point thats all that matters.Vlad The Impaler Gameplay Trailer -

			Gameplay teaser for Vlad: The Impaler. Available now on the STEAM Store: http://store.steampowered.com/app/295850/ Vlad is an interactive graphic-novel with RPG elements where your decisions shape...		

With that said this is one story that you will find yourself totally engrossed in if you have any love of the subject matter and whilst you read you will find your character ending up in some really bad and dangerous situations.Ok lets go for the ""JUGULAR"" and get down to the ""BLOOD"" of why this game is one of the best ""INTERACTIVE NOVELS"" i have played.The graphics are up to the standard of any in this genre of games and the art is dark and forbodding enough to do the subject matter justice (all in game graphics are static though-par for the course with these sort of games).The sound is great and even though there isnt much different music in game it doesnt need it as the music that is there suits what happens in the text you read and helps to push the atmosphere of the story through to the player.There is not much spoken dialogue (well just at the start of the game when ""VLAD"" reads his letter to you as to what he wants you to do).Now the gameplay (not really gameplay though as you spend most of the time reading) lets you choose where to go and there are enough locations around Istanbul that you wont see and read all that the story has to offer in 2 or 3 sittings and the script does a great job as you go from one dire situation to another,trying to make the right decision as to what to do next (and it isnt allways cut and dry as to what the right thing to do is ??).The following video shows one of many ways to play through the game (DONT WATCH IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER HOW THE STORY PLAYS OUT FOR YOURSELF) -Let's Play Vlad The Impaler - Episode 1 - Long WIN -

			We take a first look at Vlad the Impaler, an rpg/graphic novel in our Let's Play. We take on the role of a mage sent to stop satanic foes but will we make it?		

At the start of the game you do get to choose which class to play as be that warrior,mage or spy and this seems to have little bearing on the story which is a real shame and a missed oppurtunity as it would have been great to see how people acted differently towards each class.Since they have added acheivements to the game this gives you more incentive to play as one of the three classes as you get different acheivements for making it through the game,getting to the end and............................(WELL THATS FOR YOU TO DISCOVER).There are also different weapons for each class and these are awarded depending on the choices and the path you take whilst playing the game (most of them look cool though),and also as the game progresses your character will level up their stats depending on the choices you make and the actions you take,will the townspeople love you or come to fear you only the things you do and the things you dont will decide this outcome.And the game actually does a great job of telling the story better than most and even though i enjoyed the new film (starring Luke Evans) i really dont think it hit the nail in the COFFIN like this game does.Dracula Untold - Official Trailer (HD) -

												Let me start off by saying that this is not an RPG, like a great many of my fellow reviewers would like to think. Vlad the Impaler is an adult-oriented visual novel, and is built on storytelling and atmosphere rather than hacky-slashy action bits. You do not play by mastering game mechanics so that you can beat the final boss, but by learning how the world works and using your wit.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay consists first of fifteen days you are free to spend as you see fit within the city of Istanbul, in an attempt to reveal the source of many sinister murders within the city walls. You click where in the city you wish to travel, and what you wish to do once there. You will for the most part be reading, and appreciating the artwork of the game, and then making decisions for your character underway. These decisions will affect your stats, meaning that your character is shaped by what he does in the game. For example, if you were to gain favor with a crowd of people for winning an argument with a corrupt cleric, your influence within the city would rise, thus increasing your charm stat, allowing you to much more easily persuade people to do as you would have them. Or, were you to witness a particularily horrifying sight within the catacombs, your constitution would go down as a representation of your mental health.Some people complain about this system, because it is sometimes hard to see why a particular stat has gone up or down, and becuase you sometimes cannot influence it. But I found that stopping and thinking for a moment when in doubt as to why the game had given me the stats that it did, it made sense in the end. And though it may sometimes feel cheap to lose stats because of an event which you couldn't predict, you should be fine as long as you do not actively seek trouble. For example, delving into the catacombs alone and with no map should to most people sound of mind sound like a poor idea.SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack in this game is amazing, and adds a lot to the game's atmosphere. However, it is on the short side, so you can expect some of it to loop after you've played the game for a while. This isn't really something you will notice unless you go out of your way to listen for it, though.GRAPHICSThe artwork is all beautifully hand-drawn, and invokes a sense of dread and despair fitting very well with the game. Though the game is largely text-based, the artwork along the text serves to increase immersion. I found myself searching up various scenes from the game after having completed it just to look at them again. Though art will always be subjective, I personally adore the style that the game went for.STORYThe story follows the grim journey of your player character as he attempts to unravel the mystery of Istanbul. The city is descending into darkness, murders happen on a nightly basis, and several cults and creatures are starting to rise to the surface. Sent by your old friend Vlad, you will quickly find that something has gone horribly awry, and that those who preach of goodness and piety might well carry the greatest darkness of them all...There are plenty of side-stories to follow, all of which are really well written. However, the game suffers from some disconnection as you might start a side-story and never end up finishing it, or finish a story that you did not start. There are also some grammatical errors, as the game is not made by native English-speakers. However, I find that this is not enough to break the atmosphere that the game builds, though some people may react more strongly to it.CONCLUSION:Playing Vlad the Impaler is like reading a good horror novel. It's scarier than any game I've played before, including Outlast, Penumbra and Amnesia. Not because it's got scary monsters that pop out at you, but because it builds a sense of inescapable dread and despair, the likes of which is found in the works of Bram Stoker, H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe. I would hesitate to call it an artsy game, but it definetly takes inspiration from great works of literature. If you're a fan of horror, or just classic literature, play this game. It's great value for the price. However, if you're after more of an RPG or traditional visual novel, this might not be the game for you. It also does require an appreciation for good art and writing.I don't like rating games from one to ten, because it's all so very subjective, especially in this genre. I will say, however, that this is an amazing visual novel, and it's perfect for a gloomy night, alone with headphones in a dark room.			"

												This ""Novel"" can probably be described in one sentence; Boring, confusing, bland, short, and not worth the 10$. When I first bought the thing, it didn't even work until a patch was released so we can play it. It takes about 20 minutes to beat the whole story, and the story-line structure/mechanics in the game are organized poorly (E.g., You have a stat system in-game that doesn't serve any function until the **Spoiler** Boss battle.) Although, I do admit that the art and the gui in the game is pretty neat, it still looks more worked on then the game itself. I enjoy good reads however, but with the presentation of a premade story (Which pretty much destroys the whole ""Create-your-own-adventure"" feel),vague character ""classes"" (Which serves more as a cosmetic, since Classes barely do anything except give you different starting stats and look), and the lack of effectiveness a result is from a choice made makes this game a display of wasted potential.<If I could refund this game, I wouldn't. Instead, the developer can keep the money, but in return I would want this game off my library so my friends wouldn't know that I played it.>			"

												This game is, unfortuantely, a mess. The drawings are beautiful, but there are tons of random words just missing from the narration, which can make it hard to follow. Otherwise the writing is good, but the missing words are consistent and pervasive. The chunks of story aren't written modularly enough to support having so many choices all at once; often you'll visit a place and people will reference information and events that haven't happened because you visited in the wrong order, even though there's no indication of an order. Because of that, you don't get a coherent narrative out of it unless you're lucky.  All in all, this sounded like a great idea, but it doesn't work at the moment.			"

												Seriously? Come on, Steam. This isn't actually a game. I played it through from start to finish in less than half an hour.What small amount of game there is, isn't bad. The core concept is cool, the artwork and 'main menu' event choice isn't bad. The writing isn't completely terrible, but it comes off as confused due to how limited the decisions are (and having to guess what the developers think your character should do based on a few words for each decision is annoying). The modular format ultimately leads to the feeling that your character doesn't matter whatsoever, and you're just navigating through a bunch of randomized binary events which don't have any cohesion. Not only that, but if I can play it from start to finish in half an hour and the only replayability draw is a 'gotta see 'em all' approach to the random events (which really don't have much relevance, except for the psuedo-combat event at the end), you can't really call this a game. At least the Hero Project (which is a CYOA in the same vein) had a large amount of content and was worth a couple hours of gameplay per chapter. While I wasn't overly fond of Hero Project's writing and design, it had enough content that I'm comfortable calling it a game. This isn't a game.Before it can be called a game, Vlad would benefit from a couple really basic design decisions like a 'choose your own backstory' that personalized your character and a plot that has a logical progression from one event to the next, instead of a bunch of snap shots cobbled together (and only 15 total, at that) which affect your stats in unpredictable ways and have no ultimate point (as your stats only affect one outcome, the finale).Pretty disappointed that Steam was willing to put this up for sale as a complete game.

												The art is fantastic and story is entertaining enough, although events are seemingly random with the choices you make having very little effect on changing the outcome.There are also several confusing inconsistancies where the game seems to assume you've completed an event regardless of whether you have or not. At one point, I was approached by someone thanking me for saving their child, an event I hadn't come across at all.But what took me out of the story every single time were the terrible spelling and grammar errors. You'd think the creators of a visual novel would have a strong grasp on the English language but these mistakes are littered absolutely everywhere and they're incredibly distracting.This could have really been something interesting but instead it feels rushed and sloppily thrown together without much thought or care.

 „I can see you carry the weight of the entire city on your shoulders.“ Vlad the Impaler represents a text-based adventure game (visual novel) with some decent role-playing game elements. The dark atmosphere and creepy music are well-done, and create an authentic medieval environment during your exploration of Istanbul. The hand drawn graphics are superb, and complement the atmosphere and storyline.On the other hand the rough transition between the chapters and abruptly added story-related events often cause a break in immersion. In addition your statistics do not affect the outcome of the random encounters, except for the final boss battle. Furthermore it is a very short experience, which can be accomplished in less than an hour.Overall, Vlad the Impaler is a short and enjoyable game, but a great deal of gameplay aspects and potential remain untapped.

												Despite all the negative reviews I kinda liked Vlad The Impaler. Oh yeah, it's definitely a short game that can be played through in roughly 30-60 minutes, but choosing where to go and what to do next is fun, even if you pretty much already know what's going to happen in the end. It feels like a visual novel with some small RPG elements, which is a nice mixture. Well, for me, at least. I played through the game with a mage but I'm replaying it again soon with a different character to see if anything changes in the way the story is told. In any case, it seems very likely.The music is the least thing I liked about it, because there's very little variation and it seems to repeat quite a lot.And visually this game isn't a stunner; the artwork is mostly static with a few small animations here and there. It's nicely done anyway, and has a certain gothic feel to it that absolutely fits the game and story.Yup, it's still a pricey game, so better wait for a sale if you're not entirely sure about it. But if you like good, small stories I do recommend you check it out.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Slightly different take on a story of Dracula, ""Vlad the Impaler"" is a short text-based visual novel (or choose your own adventure, if you prefer) with an interesting setting (most of the game takes place in medieval Istanbul) and visually stunning art style.The game can be completed within 30 minutes, but it takes some time to discover which choices will help you to defeat Vlad. In the key events your success is based on stats, so careful character development (giving the light RPG feel) and discovering the outcomes of the individual choices is a crucial part of the gameplay. There are 3 available characters classes, and each class can evolve into 2 ""advanced"" professions depending on your actions.The game includes a morality tracking system, and while neither deep, nor impacting the storyline much, is a nice little touch nevertheless.""Vlad The Impaler"" has its issues (listed below), but at the current price point, if you like visual novel/CYOA type of games, you can't go wrong with it. Recommended!Pros:+ amazing artwork and atmosphere! (it's worth getting for the art style alone)+ original setting+ can be completed multiple times with slightly different endings/choices along the way+ achievements extend game longevity a bit (to a couple of hours)Cons:- no manual save game option- too much emphasis on ""dry"" stat building instead of delivering coherent narrative- a number of achievementents are too much, SPOILER ALERT forcing you to re-play the game just to receive the proper item, which is randomly determined with a little chance to appear, so it's likely you will have multiple ""empty"" playthroughs just to get them.- minor bugs (if it freezes, or you don't see the choice: just quit the game and run it again, it saves your progress automatically)			"

												My thoughts after completing the game:It took me not much longer than an hour to play through the game once. But I don't care that it was short, it was so cool to play. I Definitely recommend it. I loved the writing some of the stuff that happened in the story was really interesting and exciting. I really liked the presentation, so many beautiful sketches, great music along with the narrative created a really awesome atmosphere.(optional let's play footage)Unfortunately for some reason steam does not like the URL for part 1. But if you are really keen to see some gameplay footage of this game find it in my Youtube channel here instead.

			This game is Vlad the Impaler by Section Games and Section Studios. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanovichZ1/recommended/295850/		

How would you describe this game? The best way I can think of to classify is as an illustrated choose your adventure novel with RPG elements. It's a has very dark, ominous, macabre atmosphere. Each part is backed by hand drawn greyscale scenes illustrating events which are described in text. You have the city screen where you choose where to go and investigate next. You are only able to visit 1 to 2 place each turn. You are not able to keep tabs on the entire city everyday because there will be anywhere from 5 or more locations to choose from. Within each scene you will be presented with two choices and have to make on of them. For example whether or not to carry a weak woman off a boat, I chose to help. But it turned out that she was a vampire and the reason she needed assitance was because she was unable to cross moving water. You actions have consequences. Usually choices result in the increase or decrease of your stats such as strength and magic or a change in your reputation. So, yeah basically the game boils down to choosing which places to visit each day and which choices to make in each place. That's how you interact with the story.There is basically no animation and virtually no colour in this game. But I really liked the literally very black artwork. I liked the omninous, atmospheric music. I really liked the written narrative and the setting. For example it was cool to be able descend into catacombs and be confronted by some pretty ghoulish characters. Some of scenes are pretty gruesome, terribly mutilated bodies strewn around the city's streets and some brutally violent events. For example my poor guide through the catacombs basically had a chunk of her skull ripped out by the jaws of a ghoul. Even I gasped a little when I came to some parts. The game has a very strong horror theme!So, so far I'm really impressed by this game (doesn't that make me sound horrible straight the previous paragraph lol). Okay so I haven't put replayability or variety of twists and turns of the story or it's outcomes to the test yet. But I sort of got the feeling that with only being able to choose 1 to 2 out of 5 or so locations per turn and different choices made at each place that the game has potential for different experiences for each player and playthrough. In addition there are two other character classes you can choose from that I haven't looked at yet which should affect things further. Also I got up turn 10 of 15 turns in only around 30 minutes. So if the ends at turn 15 then it's a pretty short game. But to be honest as long as I enjoy the rest of the game I would consider it is short and sweet and that would enough to satisfy me.As much as I loved this I have to admit for such a short game it may be a bit expensive for those who wish to get the most gaming time for their hard earned cash. Also I have to let you guys that the game seemed to bug out slightly at the end for me, in place of like the last paragraph of the story there was a wierd message with underscores through it. Also I've looked at one of the other reviews here and apparently at end of the some of the images didn't render properly and they could only see a big blue mass or something. But hopefully more people don't have these problems.If you like this game, click here for my review and let's play videos of Soul Gambler. It's similar sort of game, which I really liked although it is pretty short.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												I'm very afraid that I simply can't recommend ""Vlad the Impaler"". It has many good aspects, but too many bad.The art is nice, but it's composed entirely of still scenes made to appear to move by camera pans. The selection of a player type (basically explorer, warrior, mage) seems to offer promise. But it quickly reveals itself as only offering the illusion of a non-linear game. You are given options as to what part of the city you wish to visit, and a menu selection of options once you arrive there. But the options come from nowhere, with no background. (""Find the soldier's head."" WHAT soldier? ""Buy a falafel."" Same menu, honest to God.) And no matter which you choose, you will end up with the only one that actually furthers the story.The eventual result of your ""choice"" will be the increase or decrease of certain character attributes. This is where 'Vlad the Impaler"" REALLY gets squirrelly. For example, breaking into the dock master’s office and finding 6 brutally murdered bodies increases ""charm"". Carrying a dying girl to the doctor decreases your ""intelligence"", with no explanation. (NEVER with an explanation.) Making a deadly enemy by humiliating a street preacher increases ""charm"". Maybe it's cultural.Speaking of ""cultural"", many of the deficiencies are made up for by the humor created by language barriers. Several example of which: ""It seems to elude that there was a secret temple to Medusa...""""Keeping the jagged knife just beyond the slice of your flesh...""""You hurl your torch at the thing that's grabbed hold of her are suddenly struck with terror...""AND my personal favorite; ""The Order of the Dragon Hmmm""Should I ever change my Steam ID, it will be to ""The Order of the Dragon Hmmm"".Not the worst game ever. Not even the worst game today. I really DO think it gets better. Really......			"

												If I mention the phrase ""visual novel"", that probably means something doe-eyed and infuriatingly passive to you. Visual novels outside the realm of anime are as rare as unicorns but they do exist, and are on occasion just as magical. Vlad the Impaler is one such offering, allowing you to do battle with the forces of evil through a tight narrative structure and careful choices of words.After picking one of the three starting classes you are whisked away to the exotic streets of Istanbul where evil is afoot. Dark forces have gripped the city, spreading death and madness to its furthest corners. Your task is to root out the source of this blight, and you do so through text adventures. Each day you can take three actions by choosing a location from the map and an event that occurs there. As you read through the event, you'll be presented with a choice that affects the outcome, and the rewards (if any) that you'll receive.The events to partake of in Istanbul range from buying falafel at the market to unearthing eldritch gateways beneath the city, but make no mistake, every choice you make carries grave consequences. Helping a beggar at the docks might give you an important clue to use in a later tale, and small favors can unlock new options on subsequent days. Your character also has eight stats to track that are used in skill checks late in the game, and can be raised or lowered as the result of your choices.Each of these events is presented in fine narrative style, describing the action and details in clear prose. Every action comes alive with sickening crunches, putrid scents, and threatening shadows. You may also have gathered there's very little light or levity to the story, and I definitely won't deny that. Plenty of people will die in gruesome fashion, many dispatched by your own hand. For most of the game you'll find your character nigh immortal, pulling through ambushes and attacks with surprising ease. All of this is presented in an excellent monochrome sketch style that helps sell the atmosphere of ancient, unspeakable dread.You'll spend five days in the city, chasing down leads, battling evil, and hopefully getting your stats up to where you need them. That's because day 6 opens with a steep skill check that can end your game immediately if you don't make the right choice for your character build. If you manage to prevail, you'll be presented a selection of powerful weapons and then head off to the final confrontation. This is a series of dramatic scenes against powerful foes, culminating in a literal boss battle with a menu of combat options. This is not at all a simple battle, for your success will depend on the order in which you use your options and whether or not your skills support those options.The stat system ultimately is what holds this game back the most, because it is obscured in the worst ways. There's no indication other than textual cues of what stats affect what choices, nor is there any way to know what effect story choices will have on your stats until after the fact. That means your first few adventures will end quite suddenly and ignobly on day 6, and will continue to do so until you start memorizing which events give which stat bonuses. It's a surprisingly technical game but in a very static way, challenging you to puzzle through the same routines over and over until you find the optimal path.I don't think most people will have the patience to conquer Vlad the Impaler more than once, but then again I don't think they really need to. The excellent writing and presentation will carry the game for a few adventures at least, and those intrigued by the mechanics of the game will stick with it longer. I would appreciate it more if it were more forgiving of novices, but there's still plenty to appreciate even if you can't best it.			"

												A well-written visual novel with rpg elements. It plays like the old choose you own adventure books from the 90's, except here your choices influence the stats you gain as you progress towards a final battle against Dracula. With its dark story and gothic art, this is a nice choice for those looking for something a little different than the typical anime-inspired VN.			"

Posted: July 29, 2014
												I'm going to recommend this one...but only JUST.  And believe me when I say this is not a game ""for everyone"".  If you're only into action-packed games which show off your ""mad skillz"" at mashing buttons...definitely not for you.  If you're the kind of person who complains about game length, and associated ""value for money""...also definitely not for you (unless on sale for, say, a good 80% or 90% off).  And if you're the kind of person who finds themselves frequently questioning whether a game even IS ""a game""...yeah, you may wanna avoid this one like the plague.  Vlad the Impaler requires an open mind and a perhaps vested interest in the ""experimental"" possibilities of contemporary video gaming to even HUMOUR buying it.  So I suspect that's 95% of you counted out already, and probably fair enough.   So what does one actually DO in Vlad the Impaler?  I'll try to explain.  Um...it's mostly a text-based adventure game where, at least until the final confrontation with good ol' Drac himself, you only ever get TWO choices to make per scenario you encounter; the end result of which is more text (some of which is actually very interesting and imaginative...and definitely not for the squeamish) and in all probability some minor adjustment to your Stats, which only have any bearing (as far as I can deduce) on the final confrontation.  The scenarios themselves are instigated by choosing one of a very limited number of locations in the city of Istanbul, and after fifteen such stand-alone encounters, or ""turns"" (which gradually unveil an overall plot of sorts...kinda...sorta...up to a point), events shift up to Castle Dracula, which seems to only consist of only a few areas - which play out exactly the same every time - before you enter the throne room of Vlad himself, where you make one of a handful of decisions as to how to handle him, and sit back and read the results.  Oddly enough, I managed to defeat him twice by choosing to ""Charm"" him (don't ask me...in real life, I have only marginally more charm than the dude from Zero Charisma, so I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I know how this♥♥♥♥♥♥works).  And that's about it really, and I managed to play it through three times in 90 minutes, apparently...though certain encounters being randomly (?) repeated on subsequent plays did help me to speed through it all the quicker on successive play-throughs (so maybe an hour per game, at best).  And there's only three character classes, and having played them all I can't honestly say that there seems to be a HUGE amount of difference between how they affect the game...   So why in Beelzebub's good name would I be RECOMMENDING this, you ask?  Well, firstly because Steam reviews don't allow me to hit a button precisely half-way between a yay or a nay, so given that this is essentially a ""quality"" product in as much as what it aims to achieve, my conscience dictates that I must vote in the positive.  Some of the writing is actually very nice, the hand-drawn artwork and music are both quite exquisite and suitably atmospheric, and some of the events are impressively gruesome (not visually, just in concept...mayhem involving children seeming a particularly recurring theme for some odd reason, so if that kind of thing easily offends you, there's yet another reason to steer clear of this product).  Honestly, if it was free or had a preposterously low RRP (say, two or three dollars at most), I'd be singing its praises at least slightly louder...but $9.99 is taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥just a little, I gotta say.  Wait for a really, really good sale price, or just avoid completely if it doesn't ""sound like you"".  Me, I'm the curious type, so I don't tend to get too bitter about these things.  It is what it is.  And what it is ain't all that much, when all is said and done.  A free copy of the soundtrack would certainly add a tiny bit more value to something which I can't otherwise see anyone getting more than a few hours' worth of entertainment out of, even with replays.  The decision is yours, on your head be it...Verdict: 5.5/10 (and even then, only on sale).			"

												Interesting game with a great style.  Pick one of three classes, then make choices about where to explore and what to do.  Each choice will affect your stats and sometimes your morality.  I made around 10 runs through the game in 6 hours.The worst thing about the game is the editing.  There are extremely blatant typos throughout.  ""Draw if you wish, talk to the artists enjoy some food, rest culture before continuing with your investigation of the city's horrors.""  They could pay a college kid to proofread it for a few hours or just crowdsource the locations of all the mistakes and could make it a lot better.  For a story conveyed primarily through words, many people will find this annoying.If you think you can look past typos and would enjoy a dark, interactive VN, give it a try. 5/10			"

												I originally rated this game down, but due to updates in the game and the pricing, I am revising my review.  This is a “choose your own adventure” type game that has a rapid progression, so it is a bit short for each play through.  However, the development system is done through a clever character class system, the graphics are nice and the story has been cleaned up a bit.  The addition of steam achievements was a final nice touch.Now that the game has been dropped to a more appropriate price I can recommend it fully to those who enjoy this genre. "

												6.3/10 - A Dark & Gritty Visual Novel and Passive RPG Combat!I love visual novels so I knew what I was getting into prior to purchasing the game. There will be some reading; you are forewarned. The art is pretty good, it’s dark and there are a plethora of locations to explore in an effort to prepare yourself to square off against Vlad. The only thing that proves frustrating is the autosave feature; after each ‘event’ it will save preventing you from going back and making better decisions.There are 3 classes to choose from; this will impact the playthrough but doesn’t prove any more or less effective than the others. Each character has assigned stats such as intellect and strength. Based on the decisions you make your stats will be impacted making you stronger or weaker. The goal is to explore the world for a specified amount of turns until you are finally ready to confront the king of darkness.Overall, this is a really good value for only $1; if you don’t like visual novels you won’t like this. I did though. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												I bought this game for the art.  I do not regret it.  I love the art.  I wish there was a convenient way to just browse it without playing.The prose is serviceable.  It has minor spelling and grammar errors here and there, but is otherwise well written.However, as a game, this is terrible.You have several days to wander the map.  There is so little guidance that all you can hope to do is wander aimlessly.During this time random events will happen.  These events often refer to other events that never happened in your playthrough.  These events are truly random.  They never seem to have any bearing on the overall plot.Over time you will be ‘forced’ into different parts of the map, closer to Vlad.  There is no in-game explanation for this.I personally beat the game by picking things I thought would get me killed when I arrived at Vlad's castle, hoping that it was not simply ignoring my choices.  It seems it was.			"

												What could have been an interesting alternative to the typically anime saturated visual novel genre is unfortunately kneecapped by the mechanics and system itself. While there are skill checks for certain decisions, the proficiency in them is determined by two separate attribute scores which can be increase or decrease depending on your choices during events. The decreases are incredibly obnoxious, especially if your choices are being influenced by whether you need to aim for a high or low morality.Most disappointingly there is something a class system which unfortunately seems to only influence your initial attribute scores: there is no change in dialogue or choices for each class which severely hampers potential replayability. The same goes for the storyline, in that you are free to do as much discovery and side-questing for the fifteen turns, but eventually you are dragged into the main storyline and have a limited palette of options to make to determine the ending.Tough to recommend as there just isn't quite enough here and after a few playthroughs, successful or otherwise, you will find yourself tired of the game and cycling through the same dialogue repeatedly. The lack of a mid-game save function does not help either.			"

												So first off let me state this reccomendation is based on what this game is, not what people might THINK it is. It's your typical ""choose your own adventure"" text based game. The graphics are phenominal and the story is pretty solid to boot. Worth a few play throughs but ultimately unless you are achievement hunting it will get repetitive very fast and lose some of it's glimmer. Worth it if you have three friends to split the four-pack with. Otherwise I might wait until it goes on sale.			"

												A neat little ""choose your own adventure"" of sorts, it's more story than game. Not a bad story, though. There are a few grammatical errors here and there but it's not a big deal. Overall, if you like this kind of ""read then make a choice"" kind of game, you'll like this. Will it keep you entertained for many hours? Probably not, which is why it's only five dollars.

												Not as badly written as most adventure games, but, that said, it's still not great and I found the ending to be rather lacklustre (though this could be a result of it's coming so quickly). The concept is interesting, as is the execution. There's a decent variety to be found in events in subsequent play throughs, but, that said, they don't really seem to influence much of anything, and there is little to no connection between them. Unfortunately, each play through will take ten minutes at most so the game really isn't worth getting, even at it's relatively low price.The art style is actually quite nice, but the greyscale colour scheme gets boring after about the first two minutes.Normally with ten dollar games I'd say give anything that surpasses, or even sits flat in the centre of, mediocrity a shot. But with this game...the length of play is just too big a factor to ignore. Don't get it unless it's on sale for a dollar or two at most.2/10 (Taking into account length)**4/10 (Ignoring length)**If you really want a CYOA style game pick up the Heroes Rise series, which is, though less pretty, cheaper, far longer, and simply better .**These scores are not an IGN system where a 7 is average.**			"

												Overall Vlad the Impaler is a great interactive graphic-novel with fantastic art and an intriguing dark story. However it does suffer from a few drawbacks, the main one being that the developers have tried encouraging players to replay the game dozens of times with the choice of multiple classes, outcomes and weapon choices. The problem with this is that the game lacks variety, mainly with not offering enough different scenarios to keep each play through unique. After the third or fourth time you've easily done every possible scenario at least once with very little varied difference.  Even if there was the same amount of scenarios but more than one piece of art and choice was given each time I think the game would have defiantly benefited. Another drawback is that the game contains quite a few spelling and grammar errors that were never fixed. Makes me wonder how the game wasn’t proof-read?  I can only assume the game wasn’t originally English. While this isn’t a huge deal it is distracting and completely breaks the immersion of the story. Finally the game has an issue where it displays a black screen upon launch, this is fixed by verifying the game cache but is pretty irritating and really should have been fixed by now. For its current price of $0.99 I would defiantly recommend still giving this game a chance, while it’s far from perfect and disappointingly shallow, it’s still worth the price and sinking a few hours into.

												Vlad the Impaler is a text-based RPG game.  There are 3 classes to choose from which are explorer, warrior, and mage.  There is a karma level which will change your main class into one of two subclasses.   For example, if you are a warrior and did mainly good karma choices in the game, you will become a paladin.   On the other hand, if chose mainly evil karma choices,  you will become an assassin.   The impact on the game becoming one of two subclasses seem to be none.  The choices, good to evil or neutral, seem to have their own unique rewards/penalties which will add, for example, stat to your strength.  There are 6 chapters with 3 ""missions"" (each where you will make a choice) per chapter.  In the very end,  finally,  you get to make choices on how to fight Vlad the Impaler.  Seemingly the only combat you will do in this text-based RPG game.  At first walkthrough, it was very interesting experience but on the second and third walkthroughs,  I was going through exact same missions (You can't pick all the same missions due to limit of missions per chapter but nevertheless, the missions do not change) and thus I found a significant hinderance to replayability value of the game.  For anyone who are looking into this game, you are likely to lose all the value in playing after 4th or 5th walkthrough.  As I have started skipping dialogues because I have already done the missions, some more than twice, before.   Due to lack of replayability value,  I am not recommending this game.   If this game is heavily discounted and you are looking for a few hours of valuable experience, then this game becomes barely recommendable.   Expect more than few hours of valueable experience, just walk away from this game.			"

												Evaluation: Really creative game, but some of the dots don't quite connect.  Summary: If you haven't gathered from the description and other reviews, it's a graphic interactive.  You are presented with places to ""search"" (or go, fight, investigate, etc)  where you're given one or more options.  Your choice determines the derived experience -- meaning what you learn about the state of the city (corruption, undercurrents, what evil abounds), or you just get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked along the way.  Unfortunately, it's not airtight.Key Plus factors:+ Outstanding writing.  Best aspect of the game. Potentially overwhelming with the amount of information you gather, the descriptions and language read well.+ Understated graphics. Black/white impressionistic at start/finish of chapters.+ The atmospheric and authentic element is successful.  Key Minus factors:-- Extensive discontinuity.   Conceptually, consider multiple doors that lead to different rooms along different paths.  Great theory, especially for replayability, right?  BUT  ...You may go from point A to C without the critical knowledge one gets at B.  (or you're later rewarded/penalized for a decision you never made).  This is especially true for the subtle cluegathering as you solve the mystery, but such a game would be way to ambitious from a small studio.  -- That said, replayability is compromised because you can only make an either/or decision two ways.-- Your attributes are raised/lowered based on your choices.  Unclear how attributes even make a difference.  A manual would be really helpful here.  Sometimes impacts are unpredictable.  Sometimes, you may need to compromise attributes to gain information.  What's ""charm"" anyway?-- Enjoyable music, but after a couple of hours, it might grow tiresome. Neutral:-- Permadeath.  Dying in later chapters means you completely start over.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  Clean up the discontinuity and you'd have a nice $15 game.  For now, consider it bundle padding.			"

												The text based has a unique sense. There is also a morality to the game of the things you can pick in each situation which as well does this game justice. I could not see this game in any other form this type of game is literally made for text base gameplay. Do i recommend it? yes, it has an interesting story line and very vivid imagery.			"

												While the concept art and music are appealing to me (I love the gamebook concept, which dated back into the days where the Lone Wolf series were popular). However, this game does not offer much flexibility in deciding how my character can become. There are few 'battles' where I can hone my skills and leveled up, which will prepare me for epic boss fights. I am expecting all these in an rpg graphic novel. Given very little control over the battle mechanics, I find it more constrained when the characters I choose have skills that I didn't know of, and activated in story options that I have no clue of. While some choices unlocked other beneficial options (eg killing the kidnapper allows the father of the rescued boy to give you some stats boosting potion, and grant access to the sultan's kitchen for more stats boosting concoction), the whole game didn't appear clear to me. In fact, the choices seems as chaotic as the game's opening indicated. I was hoping to get more satisfaction over the weekend with this game. It could really have been better.  "

												Vlad The Impaler is a great game for anyone who enjoys the ""choose your own adventure"" books you would find in the fantasy aisle in Books A Million or such. Even though it has only a few soundtracks, the soundtracks are very good and give a nice European atmosphere to the game. If you don't like to read and make quality decisions though, the game isnt for you. Except for some fights, (i.e. against Vlad) you can make some choice on where to hit him or what to do in the fight. There isn't any 3D movement, it's laid out in a page format kind of like a book, and you can choose where to go in parts of the city to find tips or clues on the storyline. You may also have characters you meet such as old ladies in graveyards, and you have no idea what they might do, so choose your decision wisely, leave her alone or see what she's up to! It has a branching storyline so it can affect yoru outcome in many ways. It's worth the ten bucks i bought it for, but barely. I probably won't get more than ten ganeplays in before it bores me. But I definitely recommend it to anyone!			"

												This is an amazing point and click adventure/interactive visual novel. It offers a lot of choices that lead to original and unique storytelling. The game is very well made for the most part. The game offers actually spooks and scares as in hauntingly creepy imagery that's truly beautifully (I think hand drawn) drawn and pieced together. The game is like most Nosferatu and Dracula film adaptions but offers more realistic scenarios that aren't too unreal, and the game really has a great pace at surprising you with great direction. However the game does have it's flaws the main one is simply this: THE GAME IS TOO DAMN SHORT. Once you complete the story you can do the other two and do quite a few different run thoughs but it gets old. And the game could have been much longer but it's not so on a critical scale I'd give it a 8.5/10 and personal scale 9.5/10. I reccomend this to anyone who just wants a game with not much dedication to beat, a stop motion comic like experience and to almost anybody especially to anyone who loves Tim Burton films, or gothic films in general.

												This is a glorified text based adventure where you choose a location to go then sometimes get to choose one of two options. Your character appears to have attribute stats that go up or down depending on what action you take but it doesnt seem to do anything. You get '15 days' or 15 actions to play the game but then it gives the impression there should still be gameplay after the 15 days but the screen just awkwardly went grey with the stat bar visible.

												So I was pretty impressed with this little text adventure / visual novel. I really enjoyed the art style of the game, the hand drawn feel makes it feel much more gloomy and dark. I also really enjoy the story telling and writing of the game, what it lacks in gameplay it makes up for in writing. The writing isnt perfect, but going to Istanbul to find a conspiracy and looking into things for your old friend Vlad was really interesting and it was cool to see how they end up making Vlad the bad guy. I also really like that you can pick multiple classes and get different stats, but eventually it just turns into picking certain options depending on what class you want to be. As for the ending, its really really hard to actually kill Vlad, which kinda kills the fun. The only way I have  been able to beat him was by going the peaceful way and convincing him to give up. All in all, this game is only one dollar, so even with a few flaws, I think its still a cool game to check out. You can also check out my video review of it here

												While the game has its flaws, from disjointed storytelling to completely unexplained mechanics, they weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the art and writing style. It's best to not overthink your choices and just try different things to see what happens. And to the reviewer who wrote ""if you go to the same area over and over in each playthrough you'll get the exact same story each time"" what exactly did you expect to get from doing the same things repeatedly?? It's probably not going to convert anyone to enjoying visual novels, but if you like the genre and want something with a dark, horror-ish story, Vlad will satisfy you.			"

												It's an interesting game ... for it's genre. After enjoying it for several playthroughs, I understood that I actually don't like this genre. I mean, it's okay to play it once or twice (max 10 minutes each), but is there really a replay value? I rather buy a novel on the subject and enjoy that instead ^^ getting the achievements is easy in this one.

			Vlad the Impaler is a Story choice driven RPG available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/295850/?snr=1_4_4__tab-NewReleasesFilteredDLC_1 Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your...		

	Vlad the Impaler is a choose your own Adventure-style, text basedRPG game.  Graphically the game is fair and the music does a good job ofconveying the atmosphere.  One thing that makes this game different is thelack of physical combat;  game moves are based on the strength of the players stat points.  	The game is broken up into chapters.  While the story is well done,the results of your actions break down directly into how many ability pointsyou have and where.  As I played the game, I found myself choosing missionsnot by what looked interesting, but by which ones I could win based on what stats I could gain.  It took away from immersion in the game.  You gain or lose stats based upon your decisions in the missions, and while you play to earn stats,  unfortunately your stats play no part in the smaller missions.  	If you enjoy a text based game and aren't interested in a combat element, this game may be one you enjoy, but if you are looking for a game where yourskills are integrated into the game and have an impact on the missions, I would avoid this one.	Overall for me, this game came really close to really being a great game,but sadly they missed the mark.  The story is good enough, but everything elsewas sub-par.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.

												Yes, I've only had just under an hour of gameplay however I've done two playthroughs of this game.I had my hopes sent on this game. After watching the two videos on the Store Page I was sold. Unique art style, great voice acting in the video, curious/interesting storyline which is unique and not often seen in many games... However the end product was all together bland; just very oridinary.There is only one piece of voice over in the game which is right at the very beginning. I felt as if that voice in particular added something special to the experience of this game but alas, wasn't meant to be.You are thrown into this game with nothing. No manual, no form of a tutorial, no helpful information. Especially for those who have no knowledge or of lack the history of Vlad the Impaler, this game will be confusing. There is a lot of reading/information in text form (this is where at least some voice over would have been divine) and a lot to process. Yet it feels even with all this information being given to you, you don't really know what is happening. In multiple cases the dialog ran along the lines of 'It had been 3 days since...' yet I had only just arrived in the city and there is a counter in the middle of the screen of how many days you have been in game. Rather confusing.There are a number of ways to complete the game but all end with the almost the exact same result. I've done two playthroughs in less than an hour, not a long game at all, I am sure there are a few more but...-sighs- The ending was a bit lack lustre. I really don't know how else to put it.Overall, unique style (think graphic novel), interesting topic and quite nice graphical format but just seems rushed and poorly put together.			"

Product received for free
												A text-adventure game with mediocre texts which have clearly never even got a basic proofreading in the couple years since release. Here's just one of the typical sentences:""You've never seen its like anywhere before at the far end is a strange contraption with a person sitting at it.""And, I guess, that's about everything one needs to know about it. But if you still want more - ok...It also has a bland story that lives its own life, completely detached from the things you actually do. The only real consequences to your actions seem to be some arbitrary changes to your stats (which are never explained, but can easily kill you outright if you lack something). You can also randomly die in a number of unexpected ways. The dumbest one I've seen was after asking a child about the evil in Istanbul. Yes, you've read this correct: I asked a child about the evil in Istanbul, and for some reason that immediately lead to a horrible death. Which would not happen if I picked a slightly different question.Well, at least it's short...			"

												It's with games like Vlad the Impaler all the subtle semantic nuances of what it means to recommend something to someone suddenly become relevant. If you just innocently asked me if the game is worth checking out, I'd go ""yeah, probably, it's kinda cute"". But if you cornered me in an elevator while holding an axe covered in blood and guts and said ""Would you stand by your endorsement of this game? Can you promise me a good time?"" I probably wouldn't.Another reason I went with the thumbs down is this is simply not a good game by a whole set of standards, some of which can be considered subjective and some objective.The nice things about the game are mainly the graphics, the music and the atmosphere. The visual consistency of the game and the overall presentation are flawless. The writing is average but it's not too detracting. It does suffer a bit from being too grimdark and edgy all the time but that was somewhat obvious from the get go. In case it wasn't for you: this game is grimdark and edgy all the time. It works though, in the context. It's kinda what we came for. It's not the game's main failing at least, if you ask me.Another thing that should be made clear: the meat of the game is atmospheric random encounters with more thematic connection than actual interconnectedness or impact on the overall story. If you can't enjoy essentially a bunch of separate short stories set in the same super mega dark spooky place with one choice to make in each, this definitely will disappoint you regardless of other considerations.The main problem of Vlad the Impaler is it's stuck in the dangerous and foolish halfway between a casual and a more complex game. The way it works is you get into random encounters that give you stat boosts. Which encounters and which decisions within encounters will give you which boost isn't obvious to say the least. But the stats you have are critical for the main story encounters. So if you don't get the right stats to go with the right choice in a main plot encounter, you're done. And this game somehow has permadeath. Frankly, having permadeath in a game without actually mechanically deep gameplay to show for it is just dumb.See, permadeath is only fun when it's really your fault. Losing in Vlad the Impaler is more like Russian Roulette: your only fault is that you agreed to play the game.So if you do decide to give it a shot, don't be upset with me, because I didn't recommend you this. See that thumbs down icon right there? Yup.It's all a shame though because the aesthetics of the game are really nice and while it's not good, it's not worthless crap either. You can get enjoyment out of it. I know I did. Hell if I know when I finish it though, nothing takes away the fun and atmosphere quite like having to mechanically memorize and redo the same predefined choices over and over again.			"

												A text adventure game with a few grammatical errors...a text adventure should be completly free of these.Has technical issues, like I tried to alt tab out and it messed up my resolution where I could restore it (because the menu went off the screen) also would load into just a black screen unless I verified the steam files before launching.But the biggest offense is...the world doesn't seem to respond to any of your actions. I helped someone out and they granted me access to a library, but I never got an option to use this library to investigate or study. One situation caused me to seemily fall under a curse and maybe kill someone, but I proceed with no mention of it and no effect except stat reductions...which I think serve a purpose in the final battle, but I failed before I could get there so I have no idea what their uses were (just like my dodge and throw dagger skill). Everything seems so arbitrary. I had the option, 10 days in, to look for a translator of symbols I found on the first day. Why couldn't I have done that sooner? One chapter opens with me on a rooftop sword fighting someone, with no introduction to how things escalated to this event and no explantion afterwards. There are choices that I see no reason why I would ever pick them. There is an abundance of things for me to choose so why would I choose things like ""wander aimlessly"" or ""grab a falafel""?The art is decent enough. Certainly not enough to save it though.			"

												Let's start with this: I really really wanted to like this game. It seemed like perfection in theory: you make decisions, you can be good or evil, Vlad, nice graphics, you can be a mage/rogue/soldier (cookies for the devs that the female character is the soldier not the mage and there is functional armor), you are a badass, vampire and monster lore, what else could a girl want?There are some interesting quests, some horrifying, some witty and sassy lines, some awesome art and some of the endings I saw so far were pretty surprising, but sadly none of these can balance that this game is seriously repetitive and irritating the more you play it. It can be maddeningly unhelpful and buggy. I played through several times already, yet I still don't understand how certain quests activate or what stat is required for what. You can ask about something on Steam community (as this is about the only place where someone actually answers), but you will probably only get a ""find out for yourself"" answer from others, so you have to try making other decisions and decision combinations which certainly will try your patience when the number of your playthroughs is in the double digits.You only get 2 options every decision: most of the time one of them gives good karma, the other evil karma. Your karma decides what specialization you get around Chapter 3. You can die between the chapters, if your 'relevant' stat(s) aren't high enough (and sometimes the stat you need isn't the one you think it is), so you don't really have too much choice over your build. Fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't matter much what specialization you got, because everything is pretty uniform in the end.There are 3+6 achievements which are the most aggravating thing in this game. You have to choose the eight weapons of every class (meaning: 3*(3 light weapons+3 dark weapons+1 light legendary+1 dark legendary)). Add to this that the legendary weapons sometimes won't spawn even if your 'relevant' stat is in the 20s range. So yeah. That probably means around 24 or more playthroughs, if you don't forget to write down what weapon you already chose and you are lucky enough to have the 3*2 legendary weapons to spawn.And let's not talk about the last fight, because that can be one of the most colossal ♥♥♥♥ups in the history of gaming and you pretty much only have a chance to win  without charming (which has its own stat too)  if you either had high enough stats or you got the specialized legendary weapon (which only happens if you had high enough stats at the end of Chapter 5). But sometimes the whole sequence gets buggy and you can't go back or forward so you are stuck and you have to start the whole game again, because the save feature is just... I don't know? Let's go with totally useless and let's say that it has room for improvement (but it won't probably get improved because I'm pretty sure that it was intended to be like this, so you are 'encouraged' to play the game over and over again).So you can roleplay and die a lot, but if you actually want to win sometime then you are practically back to only doing those quests which give you the needed stats AND good or evil karma. You actually don't have much freedom while playing.All in all:I will collect all of the achievements in the end, but after that I'll never replay this game and it'll probably gather dust in my Library, because I certainly don't want a nervous breakdown over any of this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I like this game, i think it is a excellent tale of Dracula, and who doesn't like a good vampire story.The game feel unfinished:The stories in chapters feel very disjointed and jump as do the progressing of the chapters.Some glitches in dialogue in the Basilica.And the weapons and stats don't seem to play a great deal in the end.All that being said i beleive it to be a visual novel game with great promise.The graphics are greatThe music is awesome and really sets the mood Each story leaves you wanting moreIts underlining story is very good too.I think if the individual stories were fleshed out more, the mini characters would be able to take on more depth and there by become more relevant in regards to their lifes and deaths.Some well placed sound effect would really help the horror factor, not many, just a splash to give the gamer those unexpected jump moments.This game is very much left up to the imagination of the gamer to define what some of the games characters look like, maybe some overlay graphics of characters that are in conversations or scene can give the game that extra level of interactiveness.Some smaller battle where or weapons and stats come into play would be good as would more oppotunity to use charm in the game.Maybe some filler information between the stories so the jumps are not so jarring.I can see i am rambling a bit, but i seriously cant wait to see what kind of updates the developers come out with.All in all, a good game with the potential to be an awesome game.

												The game isn't difficult to figure out, but there is no explanation of character attributes or any real story to be found. Though there are some OK images shown and the storytelling itself somewhat engrossing, the entire package is fairly lacklustre and uninspired.The entire game boils down to a randomized choose-your-own-adventure novel; each randomly generated story path has 2 outcomes, some bad, some good, some neutral. Your stats and previous choices seem to have zero impact on future events. Bugs and unfinished portions of the game appear frequently. Needs polish.Overall: horrendously overpriced, low content, low replayability, unfinished. Don't bother.			"

I would highly recomend because I'm a nerd and like these sort of things. I won't get board replaying the game over and over. There's three different people you can be as well as two different morals that you can choose to follow between each character. There's also multiple ways to finish off Vlad. So, it will be interesting to play through multiple times. :)			"

												An interesting graphic novel because of the setting which is pulled off quite well with some characters that i just wanted to pursue and find out more about, the sound track is nice and fitting for investigating a city that may be suffering a multitude of curses. Very fun to give your own voices to the characters.The settings menu didnt work very well, the volume sliders slid, but did not affect volume levels and then returned to full volume position when returning to the menu.Some choices did not highlight when selected while they were selectable.Some spelling errors, which I know I stuggle with but in a game where reading is everything, it took me a few double takes to realise what was being said.Font looks pixelated at the resolution I did my first attempt on, (windowed, 1600x900) but was readable.OverallVery interesting setting, characters and themes.Excelent styling on font, graphics and art.Some funtional issues, that are easy to correct or ignoreWill play through several times with all the characters.

												My opinion on this game is kind of mixed. The story is good, the way that you can make your ""own adventure in every gameplay"" gives a little extra with the decisions that you need to make to gain specific points for the class that you choose.I wish that the game could be a little longer than maybe half an hour to enjoy it a bit more deeply, since all of the drawings are pretty good, and the story is fine, but i wish i could know a bit better of what happens, and maybe... to see myself die a few times before i could end this game, to think of the decision i took and to make a new one.Overall, give this game a chance when its on a sale.

												First things first, is this game worth 10 dollars? Absolutely not. It lasts an hour and a half at most, and that's only if you do a seperate play through for each character class. However, if you've got a lot of money to spend and don't mind the relative lack of content, there are certainly worse ways you could spend it. For the short time I played this game I was at least reasonably entertained by it. If you like choose your own adventure books or visual novels, you might actually like this game. Just don't come into it with grand expectations.			"

												Really good  'Chose your own adventure' type game. You play one of 3 characters and your states change based on the choises you make during the adventure which can change your class. With each play though you gain more knowledge on how the encounters work so you're able to shape your character to better suit you or the final outcome. This game is fun with very high replayability.			"

												I like this game, i think it is a excellent tale of Dracula, and who doesn't like a good vampire story.The game feel unfinished:The stories in chapters feel very disjointed and jump as do the progressing of the chapters.Some glitches in dialogue in the Basilica.And the weapons and stats don't seem to play a great deal in the end.All that being said i beleive it to be a visual novel game with great promise.The graphics are greatThe music is awesome and really sets the mood Each story leaves you wanting moreIts underlining story is very good too.I think if the individual stories were fleshed out more, the mini characters would be able to take on more depth and there by become more relevant in regards to their lifes and deaths.Some well placed sound effect would really help the horror factor, not many, just a splash to give the gamer those unexpected jump moments.This game is very much left up to the imagination of the gamer to define what some of the games characters look like, maybe some overlay graphics of characters that are in conversations or scene can give the game that extra level of interactiveness.Some smaller battle where or weapons and stats come into play would be good as would more oppotunity to use charm in the game.Maybe some filler information between the stories so the jumps are not so jarring.I can see i am rambling a bit, but i seriously cant wait to see what kind of updates the developers come out with.All in all, a good game with the potential to be an awesome game.

You can be either an Explorer, Soldier or Mage seeking to put an end to Vlad's mischief. The atmosphere is creepy and convincingly brought to life with the absolutely stellar writing.

												Ok, Vlad is awesome. It's a great ambiance, visual novel text based game. It's very short (a good hour or so, if you take your time reading), but like all ""visual novels"", the interest is replaying it and seeing all the many small changes, check all options, leave no stones unturned.Each of the archetypes then specializes into two possible promotions. You are also very limited in what you can do in a given chapter, so this limit enhances replayability as you need to make ""the most"" out of the actions and places you can visit. Each chapter offers different places and actions, as if you go to the market in chapter 1 you won't see the same people that you would in chapter 2.It's a great, great game worth your one buck.

												Overall, it needs some polishing. There are a lot of grammatical errors which can make the story very confusing. Also, your choices can sometimes conflict with one another timeline wise. For example, one of your various actions in one day may be ""sneak around at night"", but then you go on to do other things. It can all be very confusing. However, the art style and music are very nice, in my opinion. I enjoy the black and white art. Sadly, after a couple playthroughs it gets quite dull due to the repetition. It's also less of a choice adventure as much as a visual novel where you choose what to visit, but the illusion is there. 6/10: Average Score.			"

Posted: July 3, 2016
												Recommended - but only if you like interactive novels or if you are willing to play something just to enjoy the atmosphere and art, like I do. I wish I could give this game a ""mixed"" recommendation, since it has a lot of great points and I found it overally enjoyable, but at the same time it has a load of problems. Starting with the good: The atmosphere is absolutely amazing! Both music and illustrations blend in perfectly, creating an unsettling, morbid and mysterious feeling, mixing it with exotic strangeness of arabic culture, not often associated with gothic tales of vampires. And there's definitely much more than these creatures - they seem to be the main theme, but player encounters many more creatures and situations, often much more gruesome, disturbing or creative. Every corner of Istanbul seems to harbor some dark secrets: strange cults, ritualistic murders, abductions... yet, it doesn't seem exaggerated or repetitive. Main character searches the city for darkness, and finds it in many forms. Each event is really well-written, the language is pretty good too. They all work great separately as short, atmospheric stories with one choice between two options. And while it would be easy to write just a ""good"" or ""bad"" choices, many are much more questionable or difficult, especially when one remembers, that the character's main goal is investigation of the evil that plagues the whole city, not acting as a hero towards everybody. Unfortunately, the problems which I faced during gameplay seem to overshadow the good sides of the game. First of all, it's really confusing. Player choses from three characters, about which we know nothing, except for their main stats. Later narration quite often makes references to their past, about which player doesn't know a thing. After taunting the preacher I learned that the spy/emissary studied religious texsts. In orphanage. Okay... well, good to know. But seriously, a short biography for each character wouldn't hurt, especially in a game, which is all about the story. But in the beginning we know only the statistics of each character. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stats... they are mess. While there are some which are pretty clear about that they are and when one can find them useful - like magic or strength - most aren't. They seem to be important only in fighting sequences, which happen... perhaps 3-4 times in the whole game. And when they do... oh boy, then the outcome still sometimes seems to be random, or broken. In the same situation I managed to cast a spell with a spy with pretty mediocre magic and intelligence, and other time I failed to do so with a mage with epic magic and intelligence. I never defeated the final boss, I actually reached him only three times. Usually I died either during the *SPOILER* assault on sultan or during the rooftop fight with a knight* END OF SPOILER*. And I tried many, many times, since the game is pretty short, especially when you already know most events and don't have to read all the descriptions all over again. I swear, I saw the ""you died"" screen more times than I did in Dark Souls. Also, not all of the stats ar really clear about what they are used for. Intelligence for example - since outcome of decisions in the normal events are the same regardless your stats, the only time it could be used is in the battle. And there options seem to be based on strength, magic, charm or... agility/dexterity. Why on earth are the last two separated, or what is the actual in-game difference between them - I have no idea. The storytelling is also confusing from time to time, since some events seem to be connected to others, which either didn't happen yet, or they don't happen at all in certain gameplay. Sometimes main character is looking for somebody he learns about few chapters later (the king of the catacombs for example), or does something which seems rather random (search for somebody who can translate runes... what runes?!). Also, for a game where the story if focused on investigating the whole investigation has surprisongly no meaning. It doesn't matter whether you manage to learn something, how much information you gather, and so on - you can learn nothing at all and in the sequences at the end of every chapter your character will still know surprisongly a lot about everything... and in the right moment they will know the source of evil in Istanbul, even if they failed at every attempt to learn something in the normal events. Perhaps replacing one of the statistics with ""knowledge"" and making it important in some events would be better. I'd feel better dying besause I failed at gathering information about something, than because my dexterity is too low. Overally, I liked the game, but it has a lot of problems and is definitely flawed, even as a interactive novel. Artwork is amazing, atmosphere is great, writing is really good, especially if we look at each event separately... but at the same time the story is all over the place, statistics mechanic seem to be broken and it's annoying how often the game just randomly kills the character, leaving you to start over.

												A very good, if a little short, visual novel\choose your own adventure style game.The music and artwork are awesome. Both help to convey the dark atmosphere of the narrative. The story is also quite interesting, if a little cliche (Dracula being a vampire) but it has multiple endings - which is always good. Your journey through this dark story can be cut short if you don't think before you act, and don't play to the strengths of your character. You also can't reload after making decisions, so if a decision leads to your death (due to not having good enough stats) then you have to start the game all over again; luckily chapters are short, so it's not much of a set back when you do die.I highly recommend this game. It's short, sweet, and has a dark and immersive enough story\world to keep you occupied.			"

I like the story - it jumps a bit here and there and i would have loved for it to be longer than it were. But there is still more for me to see here. I don't think it's a bad game at all.

												""Vlad is an interactive graphic-novel with RPG elements where your decisions shape the outcome of your story. Each playthrough offers a different experience and immersive story totalling two hours of content.""This is entirely true. The story that the novel tells is quite short: In 80 minutes I have been able to make one playthrough each with the three classes available and there's still room for more runs.The game offers little in the way of instructions and throws you to the hub-screen immediately. The story progresses by selecting one of the locations (starting with Port, Square, and Bazaar, with Catacombs and Basilica added in a later chapter, and Palace last of all) and then deciding how to proceed in the provided scenario. Your choices alter your stats and might have some influence on later scenarios. After finishing three scenarios the story advances to the next chapter, with the climax after the 15th scenario. The stats aren't used until the very end of the climax when you encounter the Great Evil.All in all I found the game and its story to be interesting. Even though its fairly short I find the possibilties for several playthroughs to make it worthy of the 9.99 euro pricetag.			"

												This game is tideous. Let me make it clear: I love horror genre, adventure games and this dark theme. But this game is very superficial and not authentic at all. full of cliches. But this is not the main problem. The game play is very boring. The music is super monotonous. There is no logical line between events, they are like randomly scattered events. Even this super tedious gameplay is buggy! for instance, in one encounter, 2 out of 3 possible options were exactly the same! In less than one hour, I reached to the Sultan's chamber or hall or anything in which the sultan lives, although I have no clue how I could end up there because at the first scene it is said that Sultan was to somehow quarantined. Then I lost very stupidly. Just to mentioning it again, The music is specially bad. It is phenomenally bad! Moreover, on my retina display, the game runs awfully. The texts are hardly readable, and you know, the game has nothing more than text! Spare your money and seek for a better game!			"

												This game is like opening a beautifully wrapped gift on Christmas morning and finding socks inside. Not even good socks, but mismatched ones with holes in the toes.Wrapping paper: The art, GUI and music are all utterly gorgeous. Holey socks: The game mechanics and story are a complete wreck.Vlad the Impaler takes place over the course of fifteen turns, broken up over six chapters. Each turn allows you to take a single action, which gives you a little snippet of story and presents a moral dilemma, and your decision affects your stats. For example: you can go ""Buy a Falafal"" where you run into a fugitive, then choose to help or condemn him, which results in a plus or minus to certain character attributes. After three of these events, the chapter ends, and you get new information about the plot.The trouble is, there is no guarantee that the three actions you take will be related, and there is no indication anywhere which ones are most important to the main plot. Some events seem totally random, and the story appears to be unaffected by your choices to the point that it moves on without you. Because you can only take three actions in each act, and thus only get three little vignettes of plot that may or may not be directly related to each other, you will never have all the information necessary to make real sense of the events that come later, unless you play through the game several times to read everything, which is an extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to tell a story. Entire chunks of plot just end up missing; and when each chapter ends, characters you've never met before may pop up and allude to events that haven't happened because you didn't play through them.In most visual novels or other games with choice based gameplay, events you play through are flagged by the system and ONLY storylines pertaining to the actions you've actually taken play out. That's not the case here, and it makes for a frustrating experience.There's also the fact that, while choice is a selling point in games of this type, there is a lot of God Modding in this one that make your choices seem arbitrary and worthless. Free will is mostly an illusion in Vlad the Impaler, and the plot moves you where it wants you to go without your say so. Suppose you choose to follow a mysterious woman who catches your eye and end up back at her home; when she tries to seduce you, you kill her and slice her head clean off--and the only part of this that was your choice was following her. You aren't given the option to coax information out of her before beheading her, or let her carry on with her seduction, or anything else, because God Modding is in play: you WILL do what the plot decrees whether you like it or not.It doesn't help that the prose leaves a lot to be desired. It's sufficiently atmospheric, but the grammar is terrible, a lot of punctuation and whole words are missing and many of the events are cliche. I might be more forgiving to those if the rest of the game's problems were less annoying, but as it is they're just salt in the wound.If the devs ever do an update that allows for more events or choices each turn or at least fixes some of the grammar and punctuation issues, I would reccommend this in a heartbeat. (With the usual provisos about its content--it's violent, and falls into many of the usual tropes that are pretty boring at this point.) As it is, I'm going to have to say: give it a pass unless you can get it for at least 50% off.			"

												Im very mixed about this game. The gameplay is confusing as to what each stat does, and it seems that it doesnt except for the end game.The story, writing and artwork is superb. But that too is confusing - how does the character discover the things in the chapter transition story? And one annoying thing is that the events are disconnected from each other. For example at one event I was thanked for a thing I had not done and I was a bit confused, and on the next playthrough the event I was thanked for actually happened. Very immersion breaking.After one play-through, had to go back and check if this game is early-access. It is not.All in all I really like this game even with its many flaws. But for 10€ in its current state I am not sure if it is entirely worth it. I hope more content will be added and the events changed to feel more connected. Being a choose-you-own-adventure game there aren't really that much replay-value. I still recommend this though.			"

The story tends to feel disjointed  as well and rather simplistic.What's worse is that I see many grammatical mistakes in this game while the texts are all there is in this game.The only positive thing about this game is its artistic drawings that make up for what's sorely lacking in other areas of this interactive novel.I bought the game for about US$ 1.50 and I'm still not recommending anyone to buy the game.I guess we'll have to wait to see a much more meaty interactive novel that perhaps could be procedurally generated.

												A text adventure of Gothic horror and investigaion. The art alone is worth the price of admission. A single run through took about an hour, but I would imagine there are at least 10 to 20 distinctly different possible paths through the adventure, if not hundreds.			"

												I can, at best, say that I enjoy this game in an ironic way. It's a CYOA with some light RPG elements (though good luck ever figuring that out from the available screenshots and videos) but that would be giving it more credit than it arguably deserves. You have a choice of three main characters to start with, but the only differences between them are a slight difference in starting stats. Once you're in the game proper, it's divided into five ""Chapters"" of three days each, and on each day you can go to one of six or so places and see an event (it was originally random which event you got, but has since been patched to allow you to choose). Each event has two different outcomes - sometimes you get nothing for your trouble, sometimes you learn information or get an item, and regardless of your choice you usually get a small stat boost/penalty.Ostensibly, this is meant to be a setup where you can learn different information and do different actions along the way to make each playthrough unique, but the plot doesn't follow through with that at all. At the beginning and end of each chapter, you will always be in the correct spot for the game to continue, regardless of what you actually did over those three days. In fact, the only difference between playthroughs (aside from the events themselves) is your stat spread, and which options that opens and closes to you. There are more stat checks now than there were at launch, but the number of times that your strength or magic score actually matters can still be counted on both hands if we're being generous. There is also a morality system, though as far as I can tell the only thing it does is determine which of the two ""promoted"" classes you become.Forgetting the game and its structure for now, the actual writing is laughably bad. The developers were going for ""dark"" (which is in-and-of-itself not a bad thing, considering the subject matter), but went straight past it into grimdark-trying-too-hard territory. I mean, for god's sake just read the ""About the Game"" section of the store page to see what I mean. To the game's credit, there are a couple points where it all comes together and actually works, but those moments are few and far between (and mostly in the second ""half"" of the game). For the most part, the writing is dull and grimdark for the sake of being edgy.The one thing I will say that I like about the game is the decision to go with the all-greyscale artwork. There are times when it makes it kind of difficult to tell exactly what's going on, but on the whole it works. The music is entirely forgettable, all five or so tracks of it.			"

												I recommend this game for someone more interested in interesting events and happenings rather than the actual story, which continues on no matter what you do.The Art style is incredible, the escalation of problems is excellent, and the events are incredibly detailed. However, the events seem to be incredibly disconnected from one another, with no issue or resolution playing a role in your story later aside from morality. I also believe the game isn't actually finished yet. Spoiler below:Upon reaching reaching the throne room and running through the dialouge, the Prince's transformation was described, but not shown. Instead, a blue screen with the logo on the bottom appeared. I quit, reloaded, and the new, transformed image was up. But then, three turns into the fight, it jumped to another blue screen with the writing ""insult_throneroom_3"" or something along those lines, then ended my game.			"

												A pretty fun and atmospheric read at first, but way too linear for a 'choose-your-own-adventure book'-thing.The events at the end of each chapter always seem to be the same, regardless of what you did in each chapter. Choosing a different class also doesn't seem to change anything, besides a sentence or two.It puzzles me to see how many people were involved in creating this 'game'.It's a decent way to spend an hour or two, but don't expect much interactivity.

												Well that was disappointing.It's your basic choose your own adventure - like those books you used to read as a kid. You occasionally get to make a decision that...doesn't really have any bearing on the story. I was bored by chapter 3.It's a great premise even though it could use a bit of fleshing out.

												This is one of those choose your own adventure type games. You read text, you make choices, those choices affect your stats. The art reminds me of Gustave Dore's art for Paradise Lost (which is actually kind of fitting given the subject matter) and is mostly black and white with a bit of brown thrown in. You can choose one of three characters. Your choice doesn't really impact the game that much, although they appear to get different events. There's some great writing and atmosphere in this game, from cannibal priests to ritual murders to attending swanky parties at the Sultan's Palace, you'll find all that here and more. The game reminds me very much of the Yawhg (also a text-based horror game( but unlike the Yawgh, it seems to lack any random elements. Events seem to play out the same way for each character regardless of stats, your stats only really seem to have an effect during the final battle and that.....is very disappointing..... it's also really short, my first playthrough maybe took me twenty minutes because I was carefully reading everything, subsequent playthroughs took about five minutes. Despite being disappointing in a number of ways, I'm giving it a tentative recommendation because I love text-based games like this one, and if you liked The Yawhg you should definitely check this one out. If the game were a bit more random I'd certainly recommend it, but as it is now, I like it, I think it definitely has potential, but the execution is....not as great as I'd hoped. I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale at this time.			"

												This is an interesting little game that combines a choose-your-own-adventure type of story with RPG elements. The idea is pretty freaking cool, as well as the setting and atmosphere. However, I have a few problems with this game.1) The RPG elements are not explained at all. The stats are self explanatory for the most part, but it still would have have been nice to know what each stat did for you specifically. 2) The class and morality system, while cool in concept, don't feel too distinguished. Outside of a few choices that offer different flavor text and some different stats, it is entirely possible to build your stats in such a way as to transform yourself into a different class completely. The classes just didn't feel too different in the end. I also didn't understand what the consequences were to being entirely good or evil. 3) I kept running into a specific bug that froze my game on multiple occasions. This only occurred when I was quickly moving through the exposition, but it made it annoying because I wanted to move through text I had already read as fast as possible and this bug prevented that. Also, it seemed some words were missing or misplaced in certain parts of the game.The saving grace of this game was seeing all the different consequences of the actions you take. Trying to complete this game gave me a newfound determination. I would love to see this style of gameplay more refined and fleshed out. There is a good concept in here. I was gifted this and it would totally worth being free. It might be worth 5 bucks, more worth it on sale. "

												The good things about this game were the art and the music. The elements create a good mood and impression of deeper subplots, even if they can't maintain that. I stuck with the game because the things I saw seemed like they had promise, despite agreeing with everyone who didn't like the boss fight and the save deletion. Then I hit the ""red harem"" scenario. It's jarring, it's atrocious instead of horrific, I doesn't fit with anything I liked about the game, and I'm not sure why it's there. I don't know why, but after spending a while thinking about it, having an achievement for it makes me want my money back. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone I'm friends with, and I wouldn't want to be friends with anyone who would be my friend if I recommended it.			"

												Does not worth the 8.99$ (CA) I paid for it.Don't get me wrong, it's a nice concept of game. But I finished the whole game in 38 minutes and the stories are written without any logical following. There's a lot of improvement to do to make this game a success, which to my point of view, is not at this moment.For the developer:- Try to make the stats worth something. Give us a feeling that the stats are useful at something.- Make each fragment logical, that follow a main investigation. Not just 30 story written by 30 different writer in a random context.- Make more action, not just two choice at every step.- Add sound effect. When in the bazaar, it would be nice the ear behing the crowd and the merchants. That would make your story more immersive.So, overrall, the concept remind me of my youth (You're the hero books) but, unfortunately, I would not recommand this game as it does not bring enough value for its cost.

												It definitely is a CYOA, and having beaten it is quite fun. The intro is abit...difficult as you first stumble to figure out it's style, but in the end I definitely enjoyed it, and found the final fight to be interesting as well.If it was longer or had more fights like that it'd be a definitely amazing game, as it is it's quite good a solid 8/10 or 7/10 if you're less action orientated.to expand on my review, the final fight is very difficult, and descriptive and indeed quite rewarding, but unfortunately very easy to lose so becareful. For it's price this game is definitely not a regretful purchase for me as 8.69 got me at least another 8 hours of entertainment so it's definitely better than renting a movie, and ontop of that It's a rare sort of adventure so it's particularly savorable.What is so rare about it? well it's dark, and grim, and definitely european, yet most of the gameplay takes place within the middle east and it shows as the people, and events reflect the location, yet also the characters identity. This is the sort of story you rarely read or see especially in a video game most especially in a choose your own adventure so for those whom enjoy Middle Eastern set games it's particularly nice, and for those whom enjoy dark, grim or even eldritch/lovecraftian settings it definitely will have some appeal.Still realize there is only one true fight with others being merely one decision or so, and it is rather short for each playthrough being roughly 1-2 hours of gameplay depending on reading speed, and choices. Prepare to lose the first play through as well.So TLDR, CYOA gameplay, only one 'real fight' and roughly 1-2 hour playthroughs a total of 6-12 hours to get 100% completion, and an interesting less often used arabic setting combined with a european horror/adventure theme it meshes well. Is it worth the money? perhaps so, perhaps not, and finally I rate it 7-8 out of 10.Edit: The only thing I truly wish to critique is both it's shortness, and the fact that there are areas which easily could have had more, such as the later journey, and connecting events between choices (choosing where to go) to reflect what you did the game isn't put together well, but has great quality.

												I don't recommend buying this at all, it costs too much for what it's worth.The gameplay works like this, there are several chapters, each of which you visit a location to investigate. However, the game does the investigating for you, all you pretty much need to do is click and read away, and whatever choice you make or wherever you choose to visit, is absolutely inconsequential, except for receiving different text. This game has interesting events, but it is not a fun one to play. It's very linear. Don't buy it at what it's currently worth.			"

												Vlad is an interesting beast, though not nearly for the best reasons. Having the benefit of knowing exactly what this game was, prior to the eventual retooling of its originally more misleading store page description, I was not taken aback by what it proved to be: a choose-your-own-adventure literary experience, and little else. But oddly enough, despite some decently written miniature tales and absolutely superb artistic direction, it’s soon evident that the writers behind Vlad had absolutely no idea how to connect the individual pieces into a single, coherent storyline, and it leads to an utter mess of a tale.Despite previously calling it so, Vlad should barely even be considered a CYOA. Calling it as such would imply that that there is some reasoning behind your decisions and actions, and that the overall narrative follows a distinct path of your choosing. Rather, you’re given a series of locations in which you can randomly choose to visit. Choose, and you’re given a several paragraph snippet of some unique occurrence, where you’ll be given a single option that will usually reward or detract skill points from any number of your available stats. These events have no relevance to overall narrative, and serve only to manipulate your stats, which themselves are completely irrelevant until the very end. The actual narrative is only touched on at specific points after a certain number of “turns” have passed. Only, these points, while not necessarily “jumping around”, speak of events that never happened, of people and groups that you, the player, likely never have heard of prior, and attempts to piece together a story using only the beginning, several middle points, and end, without ever offering what happens in between. It’s evident from the store page and individual stories present in the game that there are some very talented writers behind Vlad, the problem is that there’s never any attempt to combine the different pieces into a single, or several, branching narratives, like a real CYOA. In retrospect, it’s really no different than Telltale’s more popular efforts, like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, but unlike in those, Vlad’s narrative never truly becomes coherent, nor even attempts to hide the fact that your “choices” amount to nothing more than a statistic. More so, the “game” lasts no more than a half hour, provided you calmly read through each piece. The gall of such developers to try and charge $10 for this is laughable and naïve on their part, assuming they believed that word wouldn’t quickly get around to avoid like the plague. But even so, while I would certainly call Vlad’s narrative broken, I wouldn’t designate the entire experience as a wholly negative one. The art is absolutely fantastic, and is the highest contributor to Vlad’s quality, and the individual stories, short as they are, are a joy to read. While the overall narrative is poorly meshed together, the “lite” RPG elements barely tacked on, and the asking price positively ridiculous, despite my negative grade, I would recommend that once this is bundled, to give it a run through, or even several. There are more unique events than you can visit in a single playthough, and they are fun, very short reads. As a CYOA, this “game” is a veritable failure, but as a brief and unique diversion from the more common experiences on steam, Vlad can entertain for the very short while it lasts.			"

												I bought this game I think around the end of last year and there has not been a fix to Any of the grammatical/syntax errors in the game. I've played this game through several times and noticed that a Lot of times the word ""and"" is missing. I mean, as far as I can tell that's the only problem. Every Time there should be an and connecting two parts of a sentence it's just not there and it's confusing unless you realize that. Example from not the game: ""His knees were weak his arms were heavy."" instead of ""His knees were weak and his arms were heavy.""Besides that though everything is fine I guess the game just seems off. The game gives you 15 days to make choices and boost your stats with interludes between every three days. I have Never been able to get past a certain point after the 15 days are up because my stats just aren't right I guess and I've even died during the interludes because my stats aren't right. If anything the game just needs a good polish and I have a really good feeling that's never gonna happen. The game's been out since July of 2014. If this game was going to be polished and made better it would of happened by now.I mean you can buy this game if you want it's okay, but it could be way better. It's only five bucks so hey whatever. The only reason you'd want this game besides if you're into these kind of games is if you want to play it with a group of people. Besides that though the game is alright I guess.TL;DRGame's okay and playable, really needs a clean-up patch that's never coming.			"

												Looks great, but the gameplay is lacking. It is less an RPG and more a visual novel with stats, like Long Live the Queen. Of the two though, I would recommend Vlad over LLtQ. The art is great and the story is engaging, at leat the first time you play, though somewhat simplistic. I would recommend it to fans of visual novels that are looking for something darker and more realistic than usual, and a lot more involved in terms of gameplay.			"

												It's an alright game. It's not long, you can finish all three classes with either being the epitome of good or evil within three hours. It's not bad, it's got some cool voice acting, but it's not quite as in depth as I expected it. It's predictable and doesn't really advertise difficulty after a while of playing. If you're looking for a game where you have to back track multiple times and wonder where you built a stat wrong, this is not the game. This game even if it poses a problem is easily conquered. It had some cool story telling elements, but overall I was really underwhelmed by this game. I expected more and did not meet it.			"

												The best thing about this game was the artwork. Then it was nearly the atmosphere but that was ruined one glitche that transported me, mid dialoge, to a different dialoge scene entirley.That only happened once, the worst thing was how the game intercepts your dialoge again, but this time transports you to the chapter ending ""scenes"", to places i've never been, skipping past the whole lead up to the chapter ending scene itself and leaving me totally confused!I'd ask for a refund if it wasn't so cheap and i got this as a steam noob.Cannot recomend this game for anyone for any reason, the artwork alone isn't enough			"

												Excellent game! A lot of people complain about the randomness of the game, but I truly believe there is a lot of depth that escapes some folks in their search for instant gratification and fairness. Indeed, this game is unfair and imbalanced and volatile. Those things only add to its charm, for me at least. Life isn't as cut and dry as many video games attempt to label it within their isolated universes. In Vlad the Impaler you have your standard RPG stats, but those stats influence events so deeply in the background that when they affect the outcome of an encounter they do so quite enigmatically. This allowed me to focus more on the events and the atmosphere of the game, but apparently many people found it jarring. Rather than speaking to the ""randomness"" of the game, I would say the numbers that drive the encounters to their unpredictable conclusions are simply obscured, leaving the player isolated from the usual control they have in many games. The player is simply forced to rely on their wits and to be guided by their moral compass. 9/10. Excellent music, graphics, and story elements. Takes me back to the choose-your-own adventure books of my middle school youth in the 90s. Only the grammatical errors and clear mathematical miscalculations make this game not earn a 10/10. For me, it was pretty easy to let even these rampant minor annoyances slide and be immersed in the incredible atmosphere this game generates. Warning: This game is dark and twisted, which may not appeal to all players.			"

												Vlad the Impaler is a text-based game with some RPG elements, set in 15th century Istanbul (or Constantinople/Byzantium).You're sent to the city by none other than Vlad III (the Impaler), to investigate and annihilate the darkness involving it.   Do NOT expect an historically accurate narrative. It deals a lot with religious and supernatural themes (not in a very serious manner, but more to set the tone), and it represents Vlad more as the Dracula we're familiar with than the historical character.Some of the events may resemble actual history/culture, but use it as a stepping stone to investigate yourself and nothing else.   I'm mentioning this because of some Community Hub discussions that arose from this confusion. These discussions are great, with people researching for something and exchanging ideas, but please, don't take it completely out of context!   A good comparation for this game would be, I believe, The Yawhg. It's not quite the same, but close enough to be mentioned.Even less, is FTL or Weird Worlds (some aspects). All of these are designed to be highly replayable, with several branching paths (mini-archs) and some overall goal and story that you learn about as you play more and more. The 2 latter games have far deeper mechanics, while this is almost exclusively text-based (each encounter has a binary choice), with different stats that will define your fate against the final ""Boss"".   I have enjoyed the game during my 2 first playthroughs, and I was initially going to give it a recommendation... However, the more I played, the more problems I've found with it, and how flawed the game design actually is. In these 4 hours I've done 5 or 6 runs through the game.   Take into account that the first was significantly lengthier, since I was reading every piece of text carefuly. The more I played, the more repetition there was, and shorter the runs got. It's not a long game, by any stretch, but you can experiment more than it seems at first.   Here are my in-depth thoughts.   Starting with presentation, its visual style has probably grabbed your attention. If you know what you're getting into, it's very, very good. Expect still images, mostly textural, to give some more atmosphere to the writing.    It achieves that purpose with ease! Everything is in grayscale and seems to have been hand-drawn (with a lot of texture added), and it really sets the oppressive and gothic tone of this game.I have no complaints here, I really enjoyed just looking at some of the scenes.   The music was both great, and very limited, to be honest. Sound design was almost inexistent. There's one song (maybe 2) in the whole game. And while those songs do add to the mood, they're also very short, and often lead to silence for a few seconds, when you take longer to read. It was very atmospheric, sticking to the background.   A cool thing that could have been done was similar to the Bit Trip series, or even FTL, and it could be done with a single theme as well. Just make several layers or it. Using the same structure and melody, you can use several different instruments, with different intensities, etc., and switch them up to fit a particular scene. (In FTL, for example, the battle theme was the same as the travelling one, but with added percussion, and more aggressive in general) This is great for immersion and atmosphere, since it doesn't break the flow by switching songs, but it can also affect the atmosphere.  This is would have just been a nice addition, nothing worry-some!   Now, onto the game itself!   It has a very simple structure. You have 15 turns to explore the city of Istanbul. After those 15 turns, you'll go back to Vlad's castle. Each place you explore (event) takes one turn. The game is divided into 6 chapters. 5 of them in the city, and then the final one.   When you first begin, you can only explore 3 places in the city, with another 3 added in later chapters.   And that's basically it. You have 3 classes (each with different focal stats), with some events playing out different depending on it. The first 5 chapters, mechanically, are for you to increase the right stats as a result of your choices in those events. Some will go well, some will not. In the last chapter, your performance will highly depend on those.    One problem that comes with it, is that those events are more or less random (each area has different events, more likely to occur in different times of the game/turns). This makes it very hard to control how it will all turn out in the end, being almost a dice-roll, unfortunately. After several playthroughs, you'll get an idea of which choices are more favorable, but at the same time, it's not very fun at that point, as you can imagine. And the events may also be the ones you didn't want.   This may not have hurt the game very much, seeing that defeating the Boss is not the focus, but the journey there, and exploring the city's mysteries. However, there narrative design is probably the biggest issue here. You see, while there is an overarching story (with exposition at the end of each chapter) the actual ""meat"" of the game, in my eyes, is the other chained events that happen. Some of the events are self contained, but other are supposedly part of a chain. Maybe you find a clue early on, and you'll follow it later... This could lead to some really interesting paths. You wouldn't choose the place to go randomly, but in reaction to what you found out previously. Unfortunately, your actions have absolutely 0 impact, and makes for a very confusing world, since you'll find out what happened at the wrong points... There's no need to actually encounter the first event of a chain to encounter the last. And encountering the first does not help you to get to the others either. Which means that I've ""followed"" the events in different playthroughs. Maybe I'd find the 3rd on my first run, and on my second run I'd find the 2nd event, etc... Its design is all screwed up, from this perspective. There's no cause and effect. And once you realize what's going on, the game loses a lot of its appeal and becomes a confusing mess.   Now that I've explained the problem, here's a possible cause/solution. Each chapter has only 3 turns. That's very short for the player to leave an impact with each one. So, by making these longer, you could give the player a chance to follow and finish these chains, while having other random encounters as well. As it stands, there's just no room for everything, and it's not good at all. It just feels... incohesive? The exposition happens as if you were following a lead for a while, when you're actually encountering the situation for the first time. It's like reading a book while choosing chapters randomly, over the course of multiple playthroughs.   This is why I was going to recommend the game. In the first playthrough, I didn't understand everything, but I didn't see anything too wrong. The problems come when you're actually unveiling the mystery; you then see how flawed that is.   That's basically all that I have to say about Vlad the Impaler. Amazing art direction, for sure, and I really like the concept of the game. The mechanics, however, were not designed very correctly, from both a gameplay and narrative standpoint. I haven't played The Yawhg before, but it seems a better take on the concept, overall. Also, FTL and Weird Worlds are two games that use similar concepts, so you might want to try those before Vlad.   Here's hoping that the developers manage to solve all of these problems, learning from mistakes and eventually focus all the talent into a much better experience!			"

												The artwork is good, music also. Everything in relation to the ambiance of the game. It's really really bad on every other aspect. I finished the game in 1.7hr, there is litteraly a single image for every discussion, no matter how long it is, and no matter how it turns out. There is no illustration of an action going on, just a single image for the conversation. Really boring and bad. And this is coming from a extreme Dracula fan.			"

												I wish I could recommend it but I can't, even on sale. It's a shame since it seems to have a lot of promise but ends up being a bit of an exercise in frustration and confusion. I've only played through once and it's short. There's no guidance given in what to do, you basically wander around the city choosing things to do. Unfortunately you can only do 15 things which would be acceptable except the story seems to jump around randomly and confusingly. References are frequently made to things I know nothing about or the story jumps suddenly with no explanation. ie: I understand what's happening because I have translated some ruins. What ruins? I don't know about any ruins, let alone have had them translated. Another person names me as their savior for past deeds that I have no idea about. My bow gets referred to at one point, I'm guessing they mean it's the staff I was carrying and the coding hasn't been changed. Apparently I know someone called Yaszmeen and go looking for her, even though I've never met her or her father. I'm warned about something by a fortune teller but randomly get transported to the exact situation she told me to avoid a few turns earlier with no choice in the matter and no idea how I even got there. I suddenly end up beside the saltan as he's about to be attacked at one point with no idea of how I got there either. And I pick up some roses somewhere as well without knowing about it as well. These are just a few discrepancies from a single play through that make the game almost unplayable. Incidentally I also died at the end and am not sure what I needed to change to fix that either. It's hard to work out how your stats are affecting most of the attacks.It's a shame because the writing is generally ok and the imagery and music are atmospheric and fit well. If the bugs could be ironed out so that you can't select things out of order, as well as a bit of an explanation about the stats etc, it'd be much better. As it is, I may not even try to play it again, and if I did, it'd be to try and find missing story pieces rather than to enjoy a new adventure which is a shame.			"

(and all they do is give you different rewards).There does not seem to be a way to lose this game. Just keep on clicking untill you finish the game. Wouldn't recommend you buy this game.

""Shadow rains upon the city above cursed be the soil of this earth, for a dark power rises.""I was trying to beat the game by playing soldier. What I've got? At first, I killed a man by words ""I'm an atheist"". Then, I saved children and mice and go to church, where I pawed dead man. Some time later, I was talking with the ghost of old woman, and after that, at night, I watched bats, whom were trying to end their lifes. I get bored, so I decided to walk go aboard a ship of slavers and liberate the slaves. Probably, I was beaten and thrown out of the ship into cold water. After that my adventures haven't ended. I went into the crypt, where a skeleton put me in a coffin and began gently whisper in my ear a prophecy. I got out coffin and ran, screaming, to the inn. Only then I realised that I've lost two points of strength. Later on, I tried to save the sultan, but NO! assassin ran away and guards found me near the dead body of sultan, with a sword in my arm. So, they accused me of murder and hacked to death with their swords. I didn't even get to the boss and, for the whole game, I met only one vampire and one demon. I LOVE THAT GAME, FCKNG 11/10 "

												Ambiance is well set, but it lacks in gameplay and graphics. More a textual adventure than an I'll break the features, from my point of view:""Three different classes to choose from."" -> This only give a little plus to two characteristics and some ""options""? I think I understand why the characterics are used for, but the ""class specific options""... when are they usefull?""A morality system that unlocks special classes based on your decisions."" -> Simply makes each classes have two alternative forms, and those alternatives gives another special option... again, when is it usefull?""The choices you make will make or break your stats, effecting how your story ends."" -> Only two options for each little stories is too poor! Even ""Monsters loves YOU!"" gives MORE options than this!""An engrossing, gritty art style that immerses you in the world of Vlad the Impaler."" -> Point given, art is nice. But too few for a supposedly ""visual novel"".""Music by Kevin Riepl, composer for Gears of War and many other titles."" -> Was nice for half an hour... nice for giving the ambiance, but not to hear in repetition.""Over 50 unique illustrated stories."" -> If there's only one illustration for each story and nothing moving...""Over 100 unique illustrations including weapons, characters, stories and more."" -> ...""Collectable Trading cards, badges and achievements."" -> NOOOO! This musn't be a f***ing feature to put if you are proud of your own game! This is simply bonus for players!And some other texts:""action packed adventure"" -> It's only writen, and it's not real action... more detective-style with one ""great"" battle in the end.I don't know how much time and people this game as taken to come out, but it was worth only the ambiance. For the achievements, it's meant to be replayed many times, but games are too short and packed in half an hour the first time, then ten minutes!Intrigued by a story around Vlad the Impaler?

												I recently bought this game when a friend had reccomended it to me after he had seen me play alot of choose your own adventure type games. I had some money in my account and decided to give this game a go, after playing for a while i loved the backstories of each character, the artwork is absolutely goregus and the way that each area is portrayed and how your choice really matter is just great.But theres the elephant in the room that i have to address before he decides to crush me. Its the fact that you make one wrong move and ALL your progress is erased and the game makes you start from the very beginning. I find this very unfair, why would you put save games on the main menu only for the saves not to matter at all?. Most of the time it takes more than one try to get anywhere, it took me five characters to even get past the first part no matter what Stats i had, And finally when i got to the last boss i was killed very quickly. I would reccomend this game for the beautiful artwork, lovely narration, personalities, and great music, But at the same time not reccomend it because of its unfair erasing of your saves and how hard the game is to get used to or even get far in the choose your own adventure.This review will change if the saving thing either gets changed or an ability to save before a choice is added.

												The game is prone to crashes on Mac. During the endgame fight every time I would choose an action the game would freeze and close. When I'd start it back up again, the action choice would be gone, but nothing had changed for anyone's health. The only option that actually did anything was to mock the guy... And that ends in brutal death. Too buggy for a choose your own adventure-esque game. 1/5			"

												When I first played this game back in September, it was buggy and the achievements would not unlock. Shortly thereafter the game was patched and some achievements would unlock. Now, months later, I have picked it up again and it is a fun and seemingly unbroken game... except I can't get saves to work. Given that the game can be beaten in a reasonable amount of time, the lack of save functionality is really only an annoyance if pressed for time.Not a game-breaking problem considering the virtual novel style gameplay.All in all, a much better game than when I first played it months ago.

												Vlad is hardly a game, it is more of a genre of it´s own, a turn based visual novel RPG. The focus lies on the story and is well written, that for it is actually one of the very few RPG´s worth playing. After a decade of exaggerating magical themed games with evil against good and orcs attacking human bla bla bla its refreshing to read and play thourgh a gruesome layered world. The pencil drawings  suites the dark ambient the writer want to put you in, without distracting you from the important moments. Moments your life depend on. The desicions you make will influence your progess and can cost you, your life. The consequenz is a start from the beginning. Once dead there is no continue only a restart. Yet it is a chance to try new ways, increasing other skillsets so the same choice that caused death might ends different in a new attempt.			"

												 Personally, I love the game. And strongly recomend it. You should take it genre in consideration though, because it is a text-based game. As such, there isn't much ""gameplay"" or game-mechanics and it's quite random and you might spend a lot of time, getting the end you want. The game itself is interesting, nonetheles, if you are into mediaval age and mystic stuff, like vampires and undead. On the bright side, there is interesting story, which does not easily repeat itself over and over, atmospheric music and art. Also, its replayability is quite high and since average playthrough time is rather short, you can spend all evening playing.On the other hand, though, it is quite random and you might spend a little too much time getting the ending you'd want. As far as text-based game go - I'd prefer this game over a dozen of others...			"

												I figured this would be a game that played like the Lone Wolf book series, that I enjoyed in my teens. While it is text based, the events are only loosely related to one another. It almost feels like you are reading a book while skipping several pages at a time. This makes it hard to figure out what exactly is going on in the story. I don't know why the characters have stats, as there is no combat system. You are presented with a choice of a handful of places to go. After you make this choice you will be presented with a story segment where you will have to make another choice. That is the extent of your input in this ""game"". The look and feel of the game is nice as is the soundtrack, but the actual game elements feel rushed and incomplete.  If you are looking for this kind of experience and don't want to feel cheated, go to a used book store or scour the internet for the Lone Wolf books or any of the Dungeons and Dragons Endless Adventure series.

												The mixture between graphic novel and RPG elements is what forst attracted me as I had been a great fan of choose your  adventure books.The game can be a bit frustrating if your goal is to make it to the end of the story, as your choice of character will require you to get a minimu stats in order to survove long enough as to get to the secon dpart of the game. Whether you get these stats or not is determined by your choice of action, and these may not always fit the character you originally chose.When this happens, the game may become a bit repetitive as there is no way to recover a past save for the line you were playing. You have to start from zero, and you may be reading the same options over and over. The options do not change  depending on your choice of character either.But the story is very interesting and the artwork is very fitting, reminding of Gustav Doré´s engravings. I come back to this game intermitently, so I am hoping it will take a while to get tired of it. Maybe because I had been warned by others about the apparent storyline continuity drawback, I didn´t really experience it as such. I just assumed I was following the highlights of a characters story, and that some things may have happened ""off-screen"". A more complex version of this game wold be trully fatastic.

												There is no real gameplay to speak of here; this is basically an interactive novel, where once in a while you can pick one of two choices. The stats don't seem to actually mean anything until the final (and only) battle, where you likely won't have them high enough to be of any help, because you raise them randomly by arbitrarily picking a place to search for clues every turn. I would avoid this even if it's on sale. I got this looking for a CYOA type story after getting hooked on the Heroes Rise trilogy, and was extremely disappointed.			"

												I recently bought this game when a friend had reccomended it to me after he had seen me play alot of choose your own adventure type games. I had some money in my account and decided to give this game a go, after playing for a while i loved the backstories of each character, the artwork is absolutely goregus and the way that each area is portrayed and how your choice really matter is just great.But theres the elephant in the room that i have to address before he decides to crush me. Its the fact that you make one wrong move and ALL your progress is erased and the game makes you start from the very beginning. I find this very unfair, why would you put save games on the main menu only for the saves not to matter at all?. Most of the time it takes more than one try to get anywhere, it took me five characters to even get past the first part no matter what Stats i had, And finally when i got to the last boss i was killed very quickly. I would reccomend this game for the beautiful artwork, lovely narration, personalities, and great music, But at the same time not reccomend it because of its unfair erasing of your saves and how hard the game is to get used to or even get far in the choose your own adventure.This review will change if the saving thing either gets changed or an ability to save before a choice is added.

												Ambiance is well set, but it lacks in gameplay and graphics. More a textual adventure than an I'll break the features, from my point of view:""Three different classes to choose from."" -> This only give a little plus to two characteristics and some ""options""? I think I understand why the characterics are used for, but the ""class specific options""... when are they usefull?""A morality system that unlocks special classes based on your decisions."" -> Simply makes each classes have two alternative forms, and those alternatives gives another special option... again, when is it usefull?""The choices you make will make or break your stats, effecting how your story ends."" -> Only two options for each little stories is too poor! Even ""Monsters loves YOU!"" gives MORE options than this!""An engrossing, gritty art style that immerses you in the world of Vlad the Impaler."" -> Point given, art is nice. But too few for a supposedly ""visual novel"".""Music by Kevin Riepl, composer for Gears of War and many other titles."" -> Was nice for half an hour... nice for giving the ambiance, but not to hear in repetition.""Over 50 unique illustrated stories."" -> If there's only one illustration for each story and nothing moving...""Over 100 unique illustrations including weapons, characters, stories and more."" -> ...""Collectable Trading cards, badges and achievements."" -> NOOOO! This musn't be a f***ing feature to put if you are proud of your own game! This is simply bonus for players!And some other texts:""action packed adventure"" -> It's only writen, and it's not real action... more detective-style with one ""great"" battle in the end.I don't know how much time and people this game as taken to come out, but it was worth only the ambiance. For the achievements, it's meant to be replayed many times, but games are too short and packed in half an hour the first time, then ten minutes!Intrigued by a story around Vlad the Impaler? Go ahead and take it when it's on sale.You want real visual action? It won't be this.You want many options? Not in this one.Intrigued in a RPG? Role-playing feeling isn't here.			"

Consequences of your actions can sometimes be predicted, but many times a choice made hoping for one outcome results in a very different result. The problem with playing a game as life :D - rather unscripted so to speak, except for some major plot points along the story - is that if you actually strive to reach a certain objective and fail - as I have - even after using all the guides available so far, it can be a bit frustrating. I am sure the secret is just around the corner, but so far I have not figured it out. (minor spoiler warning) I never managed to win in combat so... :DLovely graphics and mood.			"

												THE UPSHOT: This is the only gothic horror visual novel I’ve ever encountered, and I could almost recommend it solely on that basis. I have many gripes with its implementation, but given its low price and short playthrough time, there’s no real reason for other gamebook and visual novel fans to not give it a try.DETAILED OPINIONS:Vlad the Impaler is a horror-genre visual novel with RPG elements that features awesome gothic art and honestly disturbing writing—which I consider a plus in a horror story. Overall, my feelings about this game are pretty conflicted: there’s a lot done right, but there are a couple significant issues with it that are difficult to overlook.The most immediately obvious issue is the seemingly un-proofread text: there are blatant errors, such as missing words, in just about every paragraph. I honestly find this bizarre: the content of all of the writing (the situations, word choice, overall tone, etc.) is quite good, and presumably required some care to write, so how can it possibly have so many errors?Another annoyance is that there is no continuity in the overall story. Some late-game storylets refer back to earlier storylets that you may or may not have seen, and the chapter transitions are extremely jarring (how the heck did I go from exploring the sewers to on a rooftop with an assassin?!).Finally, the RPG elements seem really pointless. There’s no real control over which stats are boosted/penalized, so clearing the mandatory skill challenges seems very random. I’ve seen visual novel/RPG hybrids done well before (such as Long Live the Queen), but they were poorly implemented here.If this were a longer or more expensive game, I couldn’t recommend it, but I think the quality of the art and writing is good enough to justify spending $1 and 30 minutes on the experience.

												So, first I will say that this game (and it *is* a game, despite at first appearing to be more like an interactive novel) did well in grabbing me with its dark, gothic atmosphere.  I was propelled forward, from one macabre and disturbing moment to the next, my character stumbling through some poor choices, but mostly making progress.And then I got to an encounter which I failed and resulted in my death.  Okay, I think... I'll do it a little different this time.  I pick a new class, other encounters, avoid the ones that turned out badly.  I do better, I think, and then... I fail again.  At the same place.  I try again.  And again.  Every time, in spite of what I try, I fail at the same place.  I recognize right away that the game is just a little too obtuse in its delivery to create a cohesive narrative and method of approach.  I realize that in order to ""get"" this game, I would have to chart all the encounters, or at least a lot of them, and then figure out the best way of traversing the game.But that sounds like too much work for a game that was already started to anger me more than entertain, so I just looked up someone else's guide on Steam and finally, after one more try, got through the obstacle that had held me up.  After that, the final chapter unfolded and I reached a successful conclusion.My conclusion:  At this price, its worth the play, especially if the macabre is your thing.  The game has great atmosphere.  But its opaque.  There are simple mistakes, like misspelled words and poor grammer.  The game doesn't explain itself, which is fine, but you really don't feel like you are building a narrative, and you aren't.  You are having a series of semi-related encounters that either buff or nerf your character, which at some point results in death or the final chapter, which could also result in death.  But the conclusion was satisfying enough, and its very inexpensive, so I don't think you'll feel too badly if your opinion is less than mine.			"

It positively leaks atmosphere with its gloomy visuals/acoustics and I found the writing to be interesting enough. *gothThere's not much ""game"" here, however. So you're either in for the artistic value or you will not find much to enjoy here. Since it's cheaper than a can of hipster drink, you probably won't regret the purchase either way.+Style: Like a good RPG-Sourcebook+Setting: Istanbul by night.-Exclusivity: Pretty tight focus group.

												I found Vlad the Impaler to be a very enjoyable (albeit fairly gruesome and dark) game that was more than worth the asking price. I was initially put off by the mixed reviews wondering if I should give it a chance or not, and for those of you in a like scenario the answer is a resounding ""yes."" The art is a Gothic dream with its monochromatic shading perfectly depicting the battle between light and dark taking place on the streets of Istanbul, and the music blends seamlessly into the background. Keep in mind that this is s stat-raising game, and a fairly challenging one at that: my recorded playtime (2 hrs) is how long it took me to get to the end with my cleric. Despite the numerous typos (mainly just missing words like ""and"" that are easily filled in by the player) this is overall a beautifully crafted game and I can't wait to finish it with all the other classes.

												I will repeat what many others have already pointed out: the artwork in this game is worth the price of admission.			"

												This is one of the small games I love to give as gift during holidays because it's challenging and fun, with great atmosphere and writing.This is basically a true path gamebook, not unlike the Fighting Fantasy series created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone in the eighties, where only certain sequences of choices lead to success, while others lead eventually to death and defeat. And the mechanism through which this is achieved is a karma system, where you need to have a certain score in the right abilities to overcome the obstacle.You start with a set of abilities, and each choice you make through the story alters them. At chapter 3 and 4 you need to overcome obstacles by having the sufficient ability scores and making the right choices. It can be very difficult and requires a lot of trial and errors, but you are constantly rewarded by great scenes that unfold as you progress, and the game even has multiple possible endings, making it even more interesting.I definitely recommend it!

												First off I need to say that the game has a very engaging story and it's well written. But it's replayability is limited, even though it has many achiviements it gets tiring after the fourth playthrough. If this was a normal length game then that would be just perfect but it is only 20-40 minutes long. But that doesn't mean it isn't an excellent game. With two choices in each encounter and a lot of different encounters, it fails to bore you. How you get stat modifications through the choices you make is something new to me that I enjoyed a lot. The story is totally captivating and I couldn't get enough of the game at my first two playthroughs. Although, as stated above, it gets tiring after the 4th one I still can't stop playing. Only for five dollars it's a game that story addicted gamers will cetainly enjoy. And if you aren't a gamer that likes a good storyline this game will make you one. 9/10			"

												I would only recommend this game under 2 circumstances: it's on sale and if you like visual novels. And maybe if you like dark gritty descriptions of crime... Otherwise, I say don't bother buying it.			"

												It's a fun take on the Dracula Storyline.When I played it, it was definately not the greatest with some bugs destroying the game. I played it for the achievements. And turned out it was a thourghly interesting game in the end.			"

												An intriguing game and cool concept, but it is sadly riddled with problems, predominantly and most disasterously of all, in the storytelling itself. The chapter breaks will easily bear no relation to what you have done prior to them and the turn counter system does not work for what is essentially a choose your own adventure book. Definitely a worthwhile experiment that will hopefully be improved upon, but as it stands, the 79p I paid for it seems about right.			"

												  Yeah, this is not an RPG, it's a novel. I recommend this game to people that can resist looking at brutal, bloody (macabre) things like dead people, sacrificed for rituals, people who are dead on long spikes, mutilated bodies etc. I like that the main antagonist is Vlad the Impaler, the voivod of Wallachia (Romania). Three classes, many dialogues, choices.. It's a little bit short but it's a cool novel.			"

												Oh this was so good. The story is amazing, and it's fairly hard too. Choices you made way back will affect you way in, and even get you killed if you're not careful. You really need to consider things before you decide what to do, because nothing is worse than death when you stand by the throne of the one and only.			"

												Vlad is really great text story game. Love the artwork and music. It's choice matter game and it's really great if you are a fan of reading. This could be a great mobile game, but for it's price it's even good for PC. So if you're a fan of dungeons and dragons, I do recommend this for you.			"

												This game is entertaining, regardless of how unfair it seems at first. There is some memorization involved in order to progress, which makes the experience a bit repetitive. Overall it's an interesting game with some cool music and nice drawings. It's definitely worth its price.			"

												You know.. Looking back on it, it really is one of my favourite games, its just a shame it doesn't have a continuous replayability value but games based on text and story are often like that anyway.The main story is nice, but it is the side stories the game is littered with that makes it so fun. In each ""Chapter"" There are a few areas you can go to, the further you progress in the story, the more areas are unlocked. You can visit the same area more than once and it'll often give a new story or areas unlocked by previous chapters, but you can only visit so many. There are far too many areas and 'stories' that you'll never manage to visit them all in one game.. Or two.. Or three, let alone all the individual choices, but if you want to set aside a day just to do that, its definitely worth it for their enthralling tales and unusual, wonderful descriptions.Truthfully, its not got the best gameplay mechanics, but if you want to go into it and make the most of it, treat it as one of those Choose Your Own Adventure books you read as a kid rather than anything else, because thats what it is, a book, a pretty book of many tales with a beautiful art style and wonderously inspired connections to real world history and myths. Its Romanian, its gothy, its strange, thought provoking, mysterious and its written ♥♥♥♥ing perfectly, as far as games go, I love it to pieces and I'll keep it my mind. Theres quite simply nothing like it.. I honestly wish for more.			"
