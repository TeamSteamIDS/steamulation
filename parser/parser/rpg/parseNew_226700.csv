												From someone who has over 500 hours in this game, I can tell you that this game is not worth $1, not anymore atleast.It used to be fun in alpha, before they started tweaking everything, and giving streamers special treatment, and hiring people who bashed the game constantly.There's bugs everywhere, there's always been bugs, and there will always be bugs because the developers are either clueless or were only trying to make a quick buck. Also, they didn't take one small thing from all the other MMO's.. A Public Testing Server.. As obvious as it might seem, that's something these money hungry developer's either didn't consider or just plain over looked due to costs / labor.There's been a cheating problem since the beginning and there will always be a cheater problem because instead of investing in an actual anti-cheat (Their current one is FairFight and it records statistics, all in-game bans are done by hand.) I seriously recommend you not play this unless you plan on cheating yourself because that is the only way you'll ever survive, unless you're actually somewhat decent at FPS's, which,  in that case, be prepared to be banned at random times because a streamer or someone well known in the community said you cheated.In the beginning, the developers stole their terms of service from League of Legends, banned people at random times to scare off cheaters (their version of an anti-cheat), and used fake screenshots which resulted in the game originally being pulled from steam. (Seriously.) It's for some reason been allowed back onto steam, and I believe everyone should know of this games terrible past and know that it's not changed one bit. Sergey Titov ""OP Productions, LLC. CEO"" (Previously known as Hammerpoint Productions) even went as far as to lie in interviews about this game, and delete any comments or reviews that said otherwise. Players who requested a refund originally were reported and blacklisted from the website which then caused them to have international troubles making any further purchases for anything, even things not involved with online games, I.E. General online shopping..Taken directly from a mod who previously worked for Hammerpoint / OP Productionshttp://leviathyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/t6F9c.jpg (Source - http://www.leviathyn.com/news/2012/11/29/the-warz-team-blacklists-customers-asking-for-refunds-and-gets-blasted-by-ex-mod/ )Avoid this game at all costs.

Sure, some people have fun. But the majority despises it. The only time I remember enjoying myself in it, was upon release, hence the 200+ hours I have in game from forever ago. In the beginning it had a lot of hope, but it's nothing but a deathmatch game now. Score20/100(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

Their solution BANN ALL PLAYERS WHO SUPPORT THE GAME ""just to be safe"". Yhea me and another hundred other innocent players got randomly banned for just playing the game this tells u just what lame♥♥♥♥♥cheat program they implement that dosen't even ban hackers just random players. In rage I wrote a polite ticket to the devs after a month or something the replied just saying they wont take anymore tickets from me or all the others in this situation so yhea I just wasted my money too some ♥♥♥♥ing scammer poser dev. ♥♥♥♥ YOU DEVS NEVER GONNA BUY ANY GAMES FROM THIS COMPANY ANYMORE AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THESAME !(And btw the game wasn't that great anyways)Peace			"

												Honest Review:The less than 2 hours of my gameplay was riddled with Hackers using no clip, aimbot, superjump, super strength, unlimited health, no detection etc etc.I died countless times in 30 Minutes from hackers shooting more than 2.5 KM / 3 Miles away, through walls.The mechanics in the game are poor, as well as the melee.I want a refund please!This game should be put under review or removed from Steam!The developers don't care, as they have not bothered to patch it since a year ago!Credit the buyers of this game with vouchers or other!

												Unfortunately I had very bad experiences with this game in its entirety. There is an enormous amount of cheating going on, and the ban waves regularly ban non-cheaters. If I had to guess my Kill to Death ratio was somewhere around 1 to 10, if not worse- but I was scooped up in a ban wave as well. It uses an automated ban system, and they do not use any active moderation for banning. The notorious aimbot sites like artificial are still selling functional cheats that cannot be detected, so their only solution to this was banning anyone who has been reported.I was playing on a stream where it was visible I was not cheating and was still banned. Let that be a warning to other people looking to play this...... ""game"". I submitted a request to have my ban investigated, three months later I still had not received any word back.Unfortunately I was stupid enough to pay 5$ for the in game currency to purchase one of the survivors. Several friends who also paid for in game content were ""caught"" in the ban waves. No way to fight it, no refunds. Let that speak for itself.As you can see I had over 155~ hours in the game, and I tried very hard to give it a fair chance. There were a lot of good core ideas, but in the end it's a very poor attempt to cash in on DayZ popularity with no respect for the player base.			"

												How to create a bad game ? It's pretty simple. At first you have to get an inspiration. To find it, you will need a popular game. Cool ! You have selected Day Z ! Now, create a badly detailed terrain and add some villages which look almost exactly the same. Ok, now take all of the bugs that exist in Day Z and add them to the game. Well, we already have a bad looking glitched map ! Now it's time for some gameplay. Create a typical american character, put some badass clothes on him, make him muscular, add a cool face expression and steal all the animations from Fallout 3 just to make it look like cowshit. Don't forget that you have to let this guy shoot and wear some armor ! You just have to place deadly military weapons all over the map. Especially in supermarkets ! Everyone knows that a real supermarket should offer a good shotgun next to BBQ accesories. Now, when your character is able to run around with a submachine gun you have to place some targets. Exactly ! Spawn thousands of zombies which must be as glitched as the map is (it has to create a perfect composition) and make their corpses bulletproof. Good job ! Now your map is filled with supernatural people living after death who can't get killed after 2000 shots in the torso but they die after a punch in the face by a flashlight ! Now it's the time for the final spice, a cherry at the top of a cake ! It's time for a Pay 2 Win model. There is no such a thing that would make this game even worse, than a Pay 2 Win model. A market with dozens of overpowered weapons which you are able to buy for real money ! That's what we need ! Congratulations ! You've just made an another useless game ! Keep on going with such projects ! Community will appreciate the effort that you've put into this project !			"

												I want to be fair to this game but so far my experiences with it have been really bad.You start by getting thrown into the wild miles from everything with no idea what to do, when you finally make it to somewhere you're forced to sneak about in near useless fashion to collect supplies and HOPE you get a decent weapon- which doesn't matter if it's melee because the combat in this game is just dreadful.Having to run for 40 minutes through nothing is also dreadful.Oh and the stupid zombie movement and that delightly lag thing when enemies hit you where you were rather than where you are.I cannot in a clear mind recommend this game in it's current state because so far I've yet to find anything positive to say and I truly regret buying this game. I hope it gets better and become worth the time but right now, it's not worth it.			"

												One of the worst game experiences I've ever had.Game crashes, bugs everywhere and they charge real money to revive your character or you have to wait to play again. The dev's are always trying to change minor things but never fix what it has to be fixed: crashes, server kicks and include a decent anti cheat to ban 50% of the players that are all cheaters.Almost every week they launch a new patch to ""fix the bugs"" and it brings tons of new bugs on what it was working fine before.The game is clearly unfinished and they ask money for it. Do not buy it!Now they added a hotkey that you can instantly access marketplace and buy items anytime on the game (with real money of course). So if you got hit by a zombie, just press F10 and buy a vaccine. If you're dying of hunger or thirst, just buy some food and meds. You don't need to loot anymore. If you are on an insane PVP and you're out of ammo, just hit F10 and buy some clips for your guns.This is ridiculous pay to win. This game is a complete joke.Please rename the game again to Infestation: Shopping Stories.			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories ( better known as The WarZ ) is a zombie survival sim. It's absolutely horrible, though. The devs took a great idea that had so much potential and... well, turned it to crap basically. Let's start our review off with the Graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't special or anything. They're just your average everyday video game graphics. Next up, the gameplay. Well, like I said, great idea turned to crap. You can explore a large open-world (if you don't crash within the first 5 minutes of joining a server), which has a wide array of locations from cities to abandoned shacks in the forest. You can explore these areas in hope of finding basic supplies, such as food, water, and health. Once you have the basics covered, you can begin looking for more things that aren't nessecary, but make the game alot easier, such as weapons and armor. Of course, being a zombie survival game, the thing contains zombies. In my short time playing the game, I found zombies teleporting around, spotting you from miles away, and attacking you when they weren't even near you. With the help of microtransactions, you can buy points to use in an in-game store (which kinda ruins the whole survival aspect). I don't know if this was fixed from the time I played, but if you bought points and your character dies, the points ""die"" with the character. Just imagine buying 15 dollars worth of digital credits, only for a zombie to bite you a second after the purchase- 15 dollars down the drain. The replayability would be high, considering you have an urge to play everytime you die and improve. But, because of the state of the game, this factor is significantly lowered. The soundtrack isn't that good. It feels like it was rushed and stuffed into the game, and sometimes tracks play when they're not supposed to. For example, I killed a zombie, and the battle theme kept playing. I checked the area and about 10 minutes later, the track kept playing. Then, of course, it stopped playing right as I entered a real battle.Overall, I would just say don't get it and save your money for something better. I apologize for being repetitive, but, again, great idea turned into crap.hey wow ok super post-publish edit you should probably not get this game thanks			"

												No.EDIT: People were commenting ""Why would you play this game for so long?""The only reason why i played this game is because my computer was so garbage, i couldn't run the dayz mod (at the time dayz standalone wasn't out) so i just played this instead, all on low, 600x800, 15-20 FPS, as with the dayz mod i got about 2 fps. And i have to admit, i did enjoy this game. but, you never really get anywhere in this game, its extremely hard to meet up with friends, they make the zombies extremely powerful just so your forced to buy the ingame purchases, this is truely a pay to win game.  just play dayz. the price difference is really worth it.EDIT 2: I no longer have the garbage laptop i used to have, i have an Acer aspire v5 with a nvidia geforce 720m card, and i can run it all on high. still wouldn't play it.

												This game was super terrbile in the beggining, so bad that it forced me to uninstall. I delt with hackers, glitching zombies and horrible graphics. Finally after half a year of wondering if they've lifted their game, I decide to reinstall. Well, I can't even get into servers and when I do I get a message saying I'm banned for a Multihack. I decide to head onto the forums to request for my account to be reviewed but then it hits me. I really can't be bothered, this game isn't worth my effort. I'm going to take my ban as a blessing and finally leave this festering mess behind. Good work Sergy, you are a foreskin and you need to be circumsized from the gaming world, I hope you get cancer.

												You guys should seriously sit on your asses and work on this game.First of all we payed for it. After Purchasing this game you have to use real money to buy guns and equiptment to surive. If not you have to go through a town of 1000 zombies that kill you instantly while it takes you 1 million hits to kill them.This game is a real cheap version of DayZ and it bugs the f**** out of me of what more they could of done to improve this game. First of all don't make us buy a game where you have to pay real money to♥♥♥♥♥♥a zombie up the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Make it more realistic and fix the bloody combat because its worse than Elder Scrolls Morrowind. Make it 12 hits to kill a zombie instead of 1 million7 Hits with a Melee weapon1-4 shots depending what type of gun you haveAnd Bingo at least its a little more better than what you have at the moment.The game is set out alright and the atmosphere isn't to bad but still cheap.Its what you would expect from a game made in 2005. The pictures of the game through steam look so epic but trust me it isn't that great. Buy this game right now if you want but I warn you its garbage.If you really want us spending money for this so called game fix it up and update it every bloody week. If not, continue being scammers and using our money to watch your HD p*** EITHER WORK ON THIS MOREOR DELETE IT CAUSE ALMOST EVERYONE HATES IT SO FAR! "

												I myself as a player that has played since Alpha would not recommend this game due to the fact that all this company really wants is your money. There for a while it was definitely a pay to win game. Wait what am i saying it is still a P2W game!! You buy GC which tansfers into zombie cash to buy armor/ammo/meds/attachments and in the end instead of spending hours of looting you can spend 5 minutes and $50.00 to get all the loot you want instead of actually looting. I'd put money on it that sooner or later HP will make guns able to be bought for GC/ZC.They said they wouldn’t do that but it  will happen. They don’t hold their word on anything and they constantly allow their game to go on sale and that feeds the hackers and hackers feed on our hard earned loot. Hackers right now run the game. They patch every two weeks and their patches consists of fixes for the previous patch they put out at the last minute! So in the end they screw one thing up that took them two weeks to make and the next patch actually fixes the previous weeks patch. The Devs in the game only care about theirselves. No I didn’t get banned so you can’t say that im salty becasue of a ban i do still play the game just not as much. i used to play at least 8 hours a day and spent hundreds of dollars on this game. I’m just letting people know that it’s not worth their $15.00. BUT if the game goes on sale for 4.00 again which I’m sure it will here soon as they are probably running low on cash then you guys should buy it then and only then. LIke i said i do still play but it gets old when the devs screw their oldest supporters!!			"

So I went and looked at the Terms of Service and On one of the sections (section 5a) it says that the company can ban/suspend accounts at any time for any reason or no reason whenever they want. Also, it states that customer support will not help with your account because they THOUGHT I was cheating so thats cool. So you are just buying the game and if you play legit you get banned and you cant talk to customer supportDont buy this piece of s***. It has a lot of little bugs but they get to your nerves after a while. Too many hackers. ToS says they can ban you anytime without a reason.

												DISCLAIMER: I PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED TO STEAM AND EVERYONE GOT A SPECIAL KEY!!!!! DON'T COMMENT IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE!Infestation: Survivor Stories; original The War Z, the worst game created currently.GraphicsThe graphics are terribly made, the animation is worse than Diablo 1 back then and they run like in Diablo 1. My i7-3770k 4,0 GHz CPU can't handle this game, my GPU is a GeForce GTX670 4GB Tri-Force, and i have FPS drops. Even Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag is running better.SoundThe gunweapons sound like recorded with a phone instead of something better out there. Zero atmosphere, i feel like a zombie, not a survivor. The steps are giving me issues.Gameplay Infestation: Hacker Stories is a better term for this game. The weapons are poor and unbalanced and it's the worst of all Zombiesurvivals. If i run around, from place to place over miles, without a car or anything, i could go AFK run and cry myself into a pillow why i actually bought the game. DayZ had good places around, but this is hilarious. But if you got something, nope, you die.Oh, if you jump 2 feet down, you lose half of your health points, for no reason. CommunityI rather play Call of Duty on XBoX and i don't own one. People tend to kill each other, which is allowed, but they run braindead around and spawncamp with snipers. No fun allowed guys!EndYeah, 10/10 would not buy. I wasted 27 US-Dollar back in the day and got my money back, because it's a simple fraud. But to warn you guys, it is the worst game around, the Metascore is a bloodier red than a menstruation. Please guys, don't support trash.			"

												This game is the evolution of gaming, so many splitting edge game mechanics such as dying from a zombie that is 10 metres away from you, absolutely incredible devs that really listen to the community and constantly improve this masterpiece of a game and not to mention the incredibley original idea of an open world zombie survival mmo. Graphics that make Crysis 3 look like Mario Bros, really smooth gameplay and animations. What really makes this magnificent is the concept of microtransactions, even though I already payed for the game, I feel as though the devs need to be rewarded even further by giving them more of my hard earned money for really useful stuff such as hats. What also really improves gameplay is that it is pay to win, greatly improves the overall experience. Worst game I have ever had the misfortune of playing 10/10. WARNING: Playing this game will most likely diagnose you with leukemia.			"

												This is one masterpiece you can NOT pass up. This game might have the power to cure cancer, HIV, and possibly amputated limbs. This game also possesses a euphoric effect. If you don't get this game, your chances of getting brain cancer are de-, increased by 99.9% and there is a 0% chance that you will be unsatisfied. This game should be the 8th Wonder of the World. I have 4 780 tis in my computer as well as 2 I7 4770s and 64GB of Ram, 50 Terabytes of hard drive space, and custom liquid nitrogen cooling, but since this game is so well made, and so much effort was put into this game, that I only run it at 20 fps. This game's graphics are so amazing, the scenery so breathtaking, that I had a heart attack 27 times in a row. This game's combat is fast-paced and exhilarating. The combat is also realistic and rewarding. I hit a zombie with my metal flashlight in it's face repeatedly for 5 minutes, and when it died I got a fun-sized Milky Way candy bar. It's almost like the apocalypse is really happening! I explored the entire map for 6 hours and I found a slingshot in a police department! This game isn't Game of the Year, this game is Game of the Century. It's amazing combat, beautiful scenery, and realistic loot system, make this the best game I have ever played. I will never play any other game ever again. 10/10			"

												The only reason I didn't uninstall this crap is to be able to give it a negative review!I got this on sale with a coupon for under $4 and I still feel ripped off!Basically, they just made a terrain and some controllable characters... and that's it. I would like to discuss game mechanics or game play, but there isn't any. You get a character with horrible and in some cases barely responsive controls, so you can glitch around a horrible world design. I was in  situation where I couldn't jump over 1 foot fence, but I had no problem walking over and on top of people. Fight mechanics... HA! You will spend hours just watching what seems to be a 2 frame motion of your character moving his hand up and down.... up and down... up and down ... until you or the attacker drop. There really is no game here. They use the term ""Open World"" to hide the fact that they didn't ( or couldn't) make such a broken world work for anything else. It really feels like a failed project that original programmer abandon and gave to someone with less skill to develop. I have seen school kids make a better game then this using a free game maker in ONE DAY!But wait, THERE IS MORE! Act now and you will get their version of Punk Buster Service added to your computer. It takes up room, it's always on using up your bandwidth and overheating your CPU and.... you can't uninstall it even if you run as an administrator! TRUE! Strangely enough this awful blight they required me to install on my system so I can play this horrible game, DOES NOT WORK! I've seen people spawn weapons, ammo, unlimited health and such with no problem. But if server you are playing on is updating you will get booted and logged as a cheater. Also, if your time on the server is different or daylight saving time comes on, or your ping shoots up, or you run another program, or you try to listen to music, or windows update, or you don't have the new windows update, or you receive an e-mail on your open browser, or any other random reason you will get booted and sent message that Punk Buster caught you cheating. Oh, did I mention you can't uninstall it? This is not a game. This is just a money grab for this company. They hope they will get enough people to build a community so the game keeps going due to people, because they know they got nothing. That's why they invested more effort in marketing of this game instead of developing it. It came out in 2012 and still has the same issues!We should all start a petition to include this game on Norton or Kaspersky virus lists, so before you can download it your computer stops you from making this mistake and erase it for you. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! EVER! Your money would be better spent on getting a tattoo on a side of bleeding haemorrhoid!DO NOT INSTALL EVEN IF IT'S FREE!MOVE ALONG! NOTHING TO SEE HERE! "

												WARNING DISCLAIMER: VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED - THIS GAME HAS ZOMBIES! ABOUT THE GAME: * A Huge Persistent World: This is an (non)linear open world game, where everything looks absolutely the same!  * Explore trees, Scavenge really useless stuff, try to KILL (!!!) Zombies, and die really often! * In-game money - if you want good stuff you will have to pay silly amounts of money for it! * You are one of the few survivors and must navigate the desolate and poorly animated countryside exploring cities and scavenging for items that you will never have any use for! * Group with a surprisingly big number of other players to increase your non-existent chances of survival - experience trees together! KEY FEATURES: * Combination of First-Person and Third Person Perspectives - you can choose in which camera angle you want to look at trees and get killed in! * Meld of PVE (Player versus Environment) and PVP (Player versus Player) - get killed by Zombies or even OTHER players! * Safe Settlements where Players can access their global inventory - practical for storing your useless loot! * Trees! * Create your own Clans - you will possibly avoid boredom even longer! * Adrenaline pumping activities - run, walk, jump! * Swimming - animations that would make a senile robot jealous! * Reputation system – choose to become a lawman or bandit; there is no difference! * Leave Messages for friends in the game world with a time capsule - tell other players about the trees YOU have seen! * Immersive environment with unique and spine ch(k)illing sound effects - they will actually scare you with their poor quality! * Huge variation of melee and firearm weapon types - finding them is impossible! (Never ever even consider to buy this compilation of low-budget robot animations, pixilated textures, unrealistic moaning sounds and invincible walking corpses - not even on sale! Seriously, your eyes wil burn, your brain will rot and your ears will bleed by experiencing this kind of low quality.)  "

												The devs are trolls that can't be taken serious. If the devs were actually professional, fixed it and not d1cking around then the game would be 10/10. But because the devs have the IQ of a sandwich it's 1/10. 1 being for 5% effort they put in. Worse game. Don't buy even on sale, don't play even if it's gifted to you.

												I owe my life to this game, i was morbidly obese, about to die from obesity, but when i laid eyes on this game, i emptied my stomach contents on to my keyboard, and lost ten pounds. later that night i sh*t myself, because i was dreaming of the amazing graphics of the game. i then decided to take drastic measures, i went to the bank, pulled off a heist, and got away with the $5 needed for the spectacular game that is infestation: survivor stories, i went home to insert the five dollar bill into my disk drive, for some reason, my computer didnt buy the game, so i had to go back to the bank i robbed, in order to refund my five dollars. once i got home the second time, it worked. i bought the game and started to play it, I instantly started masturbating to the female character and male character that you start with. once i implanted my seed into my computer, i spawned into the game, i then realized how spooky the game was, and i was like ""woah"". i proceeded into the game, and i found that there is microtransactions. after i discovered this, i went to the developers, and r*ped every one of them repeatedly whispering in their ears ""this is my swamp..."" they were terrified of my green skinned 210 lb body. they're dead now.UPDATE: The cops are on to me, it never occured to them that an outcast such as me would live in the swamp... until now, i only have a couple of minutes to write this before the angry mob of Warz fanboys break down my corroded and decayed cypress tree door. i can already hear the moldy wood breaking, but my friends do not fear, for when i am gone, my little furry donkey will hold the fort and make waffles for everyone. do not fear the terrors of the world with out me. do not fear farquaad, for he is short, stout, and a little b*tch. go on to live my legacy, my children, for i am the one you praise                                               Love,                                                     Shrek224/10 best game in the world			"

												The idea of a game like that is perfect. but the fact that people play it like any FPS ruins the game. When U first spawn, start looking for items, but you see a player and he kills you without thinking. So the game is hard to play alone, and you fear humans not zombies.Another thing is that the support is horrible. they take too long to answer, when they answer sometimes they dont say what they said they would do. for example, i was banned unfairly, one of the banned accouns for no reason. they told me that in 1 week they would unban me after looking for the log and seeing i was a regular player. 1 week later account still banned and they told me they couldnt unban, thatit was permanent.i spent 60 bucks on the game to get the legendary pack, played since alpha, and then suddenly im banned. hate the support.

												Saw this on sale, got rather excited....and than I played it.  I payed just over 3$ for this game and honestly it would not be worth it even if it were free.  This is completely a pay-to-win game hands down.  The servers are filled to bursting with hackers (shocking on the internet right?)  The ""fair fight"" system is honestly a crock of♥♥♥♥♥♥  The loot table needs a serious over haul, the zombie AI needs some dusting off.  Over all if you are looking for a great way to♥♥♥♥♥♥away your hard earned money this is for you.  For the majority of you out there that would actually like to be entertained, RUN! RUN FAR AND RUN FAST!  Normally I would hold off on writting such a horrible review but I can not even begin to fathom why steam would even allow this farce.  Research this games past and it is hard to believe the devs. (aspiring to be actual devs. more like) are not serving jail time.  This game used to be called WarZ, it has been taken down from steam before.  Sadly this game has SOOOOOO much potential, but this is what happens when dev. teams only want to make a quick buck.  I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone...ever.  Thanks for reading! Any questions feel free to msg/add me!			"

												Last I played it was 6/10/2013. The game at that time was very buggy and filled with hackers. I am going to base this review/recommendation on that. The game is fun but hard to make friends and easy to find enemys. Looters are more annoying then zombies, and respawning is a, well ♥♥♥♥♥. They have people camped up on ridges in glitch rocks or trees with aimbot and hud player markers. They even have people who find ways under the map to ""troll"" you. I for one never, ever cheat. So when I see this I intantly write the game off as a failed project. Don't buy this, its just a sleezy version of DayZ.			"

Now believe me I tried to enjoy this game I really did, but the dull boring lazy work really throws it into a pit of fire shot up a million times beaten up to the fullest and out comes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

												I've played this game since Alpha.. had around 4,000 hours (non-steam) and let me say a few things:This game is a good game when it comes to surviving, maybe not one of the best... but when it comes to handling guns, I like it. Then all the rest of the things about this game is awful. You see hackers even in PRIVATE SERVERS.The worst part of this game is the Anti-Cheat, got banned because the map glitched and started teleporting me upwards and I hit the skybox, and got disconnected. The next day I got banned for potential nocliping because the map in the middle of nowhere was giving my bugs. I was going under the map (dying from that) and also glitching up the skybox (disconnecting from that)This game is gone downhill since Alpha, and is even taking a bigger step to becoming one of the shitiest games on Steam.Extremely dissapointed with the Anti-Cheat system, fix that up if you want to have a chance of getting some proper reviews.

												""One of the worst games of all time"" ""An absolute joke""""Worst game on Steam""These were the things I heard when people talked about Infestation: Survivor Stories. This game became centered with controversay back in 2012 because of the developers threatening consumers and consumers revealing that the developers had lied to them and also having one of the worst launches on Steam when it was first released. As well as the developers banning people from the forums of anyone requesting a refund.I've stayed clear of this game for a while but, curiosity killed me and I decided to pick it up during the summer sale.I want to make things clear, this isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, this game doesn't deserve the title ""worst game of all time"" it isn't even the worst game on Steam. Is it bad? yes, it is definately bad, no question or debate about that, but it's not as bad as others are making it out to be, either that or I had my expectations set way too low when I was playing this.In case you hyadn't figured it out from the trailer, Infestation: Survivor Stories was a game that tried to capitalise on the popularity of DayZ (Infestation used to be named ""The War Z"" however due to the bad behaviour of the devs being revelaed, it was removed, then came up again as Infestation: Survivor Stories) Like most DayZ rip offs, Infestation takes everything that people enjoyed about DayZ and then makes them worse, connections, graphics, community all of these things are worse than DayZ.One thing that is included in Infestation, which is kind of a cool idea, is that depending on which server you choose to play on, you will play on a different map, I say that what I really mean is that out of the 8 servers, there are 2 different maps. If you have 8 servers, why not add in a different map for each server? Was there something limiting you from doing that, some sort of restriction?The maps themselves, however, are really big, around a 74km2 mile map, There is also alot of unique areas around the map that you can encounter and are used frequently to make sure there's always something to see and something that you will want to check out, which is more than I can say for the other DayZ clone that this company made (Aftermath).One thing that you'll realise quickly however, is that the devs purposefully make the good equipment hard to find, when I say hard to find, I mean really hard to find, as in there's a 1/1000 chance in finding it, that's where the f*cking microtransactions come into play. Obviously if you're going to rip off a popular gam, charging £20 as it's base price and then half a*sing everything, you need to make sure you get even more money from it as well by putting in microtransactions for outfits, armour and weapons.The community on this is mostly horrific. You might find the odd good player that is willing to team up with you, but it's primarily hackers, cheating and the devs doing little about it, however, now that there's barely anyone playing it, it's hard to come by these guys anymore, however they're still present throughout the game.The zombie AI is also terrible, all you need to do to beat them is walk backwards and mash the LMB and you're guaranteed a win, they only become a big problem if you have zombies coming from different directions. Zombies don't even appear to be a huge problem when they're in hoardes, whereas zombies would usually be. There is also no way you can sneak by a zombie, once you enter their proximity (even if you're behind them) they will come after you regardless.The graphics are mostly bad. If you're looking at a view, surveying the area or something along those lines, the graphics look quite decent, however, as soon  as you get closer to something, you will notice how badly textured they are.I will agree that this is a bad game, but I wouldn't stress out that it's one of the worst game on Steam, as I can easily see more games that I've covered before that can fill that hole, like Day One: Garry's Incident, Second Warfare or The Slaughtering Grounds. I will agree on the fact that this is nonetheless a bad game with minimal effort put in and it's only use was to be a cash grab and try and piggy back on the popularity of DayZPros+ Decent graphics from afar+ Huge map+ Can be fun exploringCons- Bad textures-Bad AI-Hackers-Microtransactions-RipoffFinal verdict: 4/10My Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												Incredibly good game.Played for 10 minutes, crashed on attempting to join a server.Restarted, waited to join a server again. Success! I've gotten in. It's dark, for some reason my character is glowing yellow and looks like lava.I have no idea how to get this damn flashlight out of my hands.I see a house in front of me, I slowly make my way there.Zombies are spotted. I run into the house. Empty. I try to run out but the zombies are blocking the doorway and apparently it's impossible to run past them.I'm dead. Zombies are eating me alive.Able to respond in 90 seconds. Waits 90 seconds.I'm taken back to the character screen. You can respond again in 18 minutes. Wow I only have to wait 18 minutes to relive that thrilling 1 minute in the game again? Sweet deal, bro!!But wait, if I don't want to wait to jump back into the excitement then there is an option to pay to re spawn. Incredible.Exited the game. Best waste of $1.50 I ever spent. 10/10 Way better than Day-Z.			"

The worst milk. 4) Old people. 4.5) Old people who think they can drive, who enter the motorway the wrong way drive at 30mph southbound up the northbound carriage and hit a van full of disabled children head on, leaving them more disabled.5) Dayz 5.5) H1Z1 5.7) Rust5.9) Anything developed by EA6) Counter-Strike Global Offencive. 7) Cheaters, Hackers, or anyone who claims to have obtained my IP address through omegle. 8) Sauce on beans on toast, because it ruins the structural integrity of the bread. 9) Warm drinks. 10) Hugh JackmanI would really rather sit staring deep in my monitor while it was turned off, waiting for the girl from ""The Ring"" to come out and drag me into her well than ever play this again.

(Artimis is a admin and personally bans cheaters on stream)Told him that I was a hacker and wanted to know when I was getting a bad.He told me ""all hackers get banned"".I explained that I have been hacking in this game and getting unfair kills for a month.He said ""you should be banned soon"".Month later I came back to his stream to tell him that I wasn't banned yet.He told me ""then you aren't a cheater, we have a really good cheat and hacking detection system"".I then gave him screenshots of me hacking.He said it was fake and if it was real I would be banned.I followed him on a stream and killed players next to him on the map and server he was on. I used blatant hacks with another hack subscription.He thought it was funny.I asked where my ban was.He still thinks I am not a cheater.Point is, hacking system is flawed and Artimis is autistic as ♥♥♥♥. This story took place months ago and to this day I am not banned.Buy this game.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												A very bad game. I think the worst thing is players killing players for no reason. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Unless you got hacks, cause you're gonna get mad, and wonder why people are so stupid. Or unless you played with your buddies who you know won't kill you and will help you to survive. It's a type of game that can go really good, and in one minute you can lose everything.			"

I buy a car for a lot of money , i was riding for 10 minutes then i exited the car and i try to pick up it  but the car exploded and i was kicked from the server , reason - SPEEDHACK .

												This game has to be the worst of the worst when it comes to an all around experience. I totalled about 10 hours of ( at times forced) gameplay.(Graphics) - It has a beautiful landscape I give it that, but is also a FORCED beauty on your machine. The recent updates took away almost all controls over your video/hardware settings and forced all players to run at what the Developers want you to run.  The outcome is an even more terribly optimized experience rendering all low-end pc's ( fps 30 before update, ran great) unoperable. Fps even for high-end users is a 10 fps experience due to lack of extended work.(Gameplay) - The gameplay varies but is generally just as terrible. The difference from the critically acclaimed DayZ and this { turd taped to a radiator} is that this is heavily influenced by the cash shop. Everything required for long term survival is bought on the cash shop i.e powerful guns/equipment/ammo EVERYTHING. Safe zones are camped, item spawns are not randomized and are also camped. Game time can consist of short survival times due to cashshoppers and the frequent HACKER.(UI/Community/Support) The maps are big enough, but are suffocating when the server is full. Aside from a couple small settlements and a handful of cities there is NOTHING outside of those areas. Lots of space and very barren unless you love seeing trees. The zombie mechanics are horrible, they run twice as fast as you and apparently have a 10ft reach. The game has glitches left and right and have not been addressed at all. The Developer support is almost nonexistent with little to no cooperation with the community. The weekly updates consist of no major update fixes to glitches and consist of Dev's either ""saying"" they will be doing an update or going on little breaks. There is no major support from the Game Dev's and have not been any in a long time.I give it a Charlie Brown rating of meh/10. Move along people, nothing to see here			"

												I'm not going to lie. This game is a blatant rip-off of DayZ. Yes, it has tried to change. Yes, it does have a lot going for it. In fact, it isn't a bad game - what makes it almost unplayable is the business model set by the game developers.I'm used to Pay2Win mechanics in F2P games, but Infestation actually is a bought game - yet it requires microtransactions for almost every bit amount of fun in it. Due to this, very few people play it.In fact, I only encountered one other player and only I could see him. We agreed over the public chat to go our seperate ways and then I never saw a person since.This game could be good, but only if the developers stop being stupidly greedy.			"

But hey, I'm playing it on Steam, I don't have any password to access the game.

												If Aids and Ebola grew arms and legs, became sentient, and adopted the Bubonic plague as their child.... Then this game would be the ravenous plague dog that they find in a back alley and allow into the family.The only good thing they did was stop calling it WarZ, because it's much less a war and more of what would happen if 95% of americas population were taliban spies and the outbreak was their judgement day in which they decide to kill everything they see that's larger than about a centimeter in width.Coop is out the window,Anarchy is in,Laggers are sighted,Welcome to C.A.L.F-10/10 ~FU M8I think i'm done here, now back to 7 Days to die....Edit: if you're taliban I'm sorry, I did not mean to offend you, my views are still warped by 9/11, please do not break into my house and crucify me.Edit Edit: I was wrong about 9/11, however actually am not sorry..

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

												For a game you buy and pay money I didn't expect a system where you have to pay for stuff with real money to get some advantage. The way you get guns is to make a server ( and you have to pay for that ) and or join a clan and pay them to be on the server , then everyone just waits for weapons to spawn and when they get their stuff they switch server and kill newbies. This is no fun and I regret buying this game.Plus you dont have easy/fast deslocation from a point to another to play with friends and there is no friend system at all so you have to pick the same server and pray to god to spawn close to each other. I give this game a 3.5/10.			"

												- no PVE option- Pay to winI've given it a serious try but time and time again I came to the same conclusion.For instance, I was doing not to bad. Got (finally) a backpack, a decent club and some supplies to keep me going.I walk thru a airbase, there were to much zombies in front of me so I turned around. I see someone with an AK and was dead.People who are very proud of themselves for killing someone who had only a flashlight.And being instantly killed by other people, who did sunk money into the game to buy decent gear.All in all it has potential but as long as there is no PVE option I can not recommend this game.Burning the money paid for this game gives more satisfaction!

												Being able to express the disapointment in a games company in the handling of it's consumer, let alone the targets it promised yet failed to reach, is now shrouded in fear of being banned, cautioned or even having legal material on your YouTube channel flagged for Copyright Infringement. Presumably on the sole reason for it highlighting the frustration a dedicated customer of the game (since day1) felt after having so much faith in the title to then feel rather let down and bemused as to why they still don't deliver what they set out to in the beginning Hammerpoint Interactive aren't strangers to controversy and to this day continue to be the most unprofessional games company i have ever witnessed, in context of dealing with customers as well as the media them selves. I wrote an article on my ordeal with Hammerpoint Interactive and this game in particular that managed to go viral, thanks to the Steam and gaming community in general and also bumped the traffic and support towards the YouTube channel my self and my friends started. Hammerpoint Interactive created a streisand effect trying to silence a small YouTube channel, that had 11 followers and instead AGAIN expressed to the general public how childish they can be when it comes to criticism of their below par, fraudulent product...the history of them selve's with Steam is enough to example that.If they left my video alone and had it sit there in it's purely legal state that it was, i'd recommend this game, but because they don't take criticism of their product in a proffesional manner and don't act like a serious company towards their consumers even when the DEV's of the company are caught explotiting the game on live streams, destroying their customers enjoyment of the game to which they then ban the users on forums for outing them (as they rightly should), then i wouldn't...ever.

												The money would have been better spent buying drugs for homeless men.  This game is a perfect representation of why game designers should focus more on the player then on themselves.  This has been in the works for years with little progress to show for it, and little support for players who suffer actcual monetary loss at the expence of the design.  Do yourself a favor and buy one of the many great titles actually backed by steam rather then a group of ametur programmers who will never put in the work to make this game anything more then a half baked money moaking scheme.  Instead spend your money one of the many othe Steam games that doesn't coerce you to pay more for so called ""Premium Benifits"" where other gamers who have learned the exploits of the game over years of time will show you just how far your money can get you.

												This is one masterpiece you can NOT pass up. This game might have the power to cure cancer, HIV, and possibly amputated limbs. This game also possesses a euphoric effect. If you don't get this game, your chances of getting brain cancer are de- increased by 99.9% and there is a 0% chance that you will be unsatisfied. This game should be the 8th Wonder of the World. I have 4 780 Titans in my computer as well as 2 I7 4770s and 64GB of Ram, 50 Terabytes of hard drive space, and custom liquid nitrogen cooling, but since this game is so well made, and so much effort was put into this game, that I only run it at 20 fps. This game's graphics are so amazing, the scenery so breathtaking, that I had a heart attack 27 times in a row. This game's combat is fast-paced and exilharating. The combat is also realistic and rewarding. I hit a zombie with my metal flashlight in it's face repeatedly for 5 minutes, and when it died I got a fun-sized Milky Way candy bar. It's almost like the apocalypse is really happening! I explored the entire map for 6 hours and I found a slingshot in a police department! This game isn't Game of the Year, this game is Game of the Century. It's amazing combat, beautiful scenery, and realistic loot system, make this the best game I have ever played.

												Worst game so far ive played, not only is this a ripoff, of you know what, but at the same time they dare lure us to spend even MORE money after the game purchase. this should be a free to play, with ingame purchase able items. not both purchaseable, its a complete ripoff, and i can only reccomend you stay away from this. last time i reccomended this i got alot of trash talk so heres something to make them shut uphttp://dayzdev.tumblr.com/THIS GAME IS NOT DayZ STANDALONE!

Please note: I was a pre-Alpha tester who played this game from day #1 My gametime exceeds 500 hours of non-steam gameplay.This is currently one of the worst ""Zombie Survival MMO's"" on the market. The developers of this game decided to not go the ""good"" route but spend their time soley on implementing more and more ways to spend more money inside the game (aka a cash shop) and to boost the PvP. Both things were not a problem when the game started in early alpha. Yes, i am serious. The early alpha was a very good, yet unstable game. You could freely roam a small world full on zombies, rare of supplies and weapons and occasionly meet other players and either fight or ignore them. The devs expanded the map, greatly expanded the weapon & ammo drop rate, made zombies nearly no threat and decided to implement various ways of unfair advantages. Packages full of weapons and supplies which you could buy for real money.A cash shop which you could access from anywher ein the world (later changed).Death cooldown timers, only resettable via cash. [...]Nowadays this game mostly only features PvP fights full of cashers & / or hackers. There always was a hackerproblem and they were sadly never able to fix it. Instead they focussed on developing a new zombie survival game which is just an advanced, yet still bad version of this one. Do not buy this game. It is neither worth your money nor do the devs deserve it!			"

												I started playing a few weeks back, and it was OK but I don't know if it was worth all the trouble it brought about. I had a good time killing zombies and hunting players. The game was challenging, but really the hardest part about playing this game has to have been telling my parents I am gay. I mean I really thought I was straight going into this whole thing, but boy was I wrong. I had to leave my parents house and am currently living in a mens shelter downtown.

												This game, (even though I bought it on sale) was a complete waste of money.Not only did it ban me for roughly 2 weeks for using aimbot when I don't even have stuff like that installed, sending in a ticket for support didn't get me anywhere either. They just don't bother replying.This game has terrible support and what sucks so much is that this game has so much potential, but yet it's so broken. If they would actually work on fixing this game, and actually care about their customers by actually replying to questions I'll give it another try, for now this game is in my ""♥♥♥♥♥♥games ""  pile.

												I got this game back in 2012, i was one of the few who actually pre-ordered it. I never stopped playing it since back then. I loved this game. I loved how it fused PVP & survival together. No survival game was able to create such great PVP, not even DayZ. However since the original developers left the game back in january the game left with them. The new company has released 1 patch since then and they're working on a new ""Infestation"" that will probably be a dissapointment aswell. It really sucks that i can't have back the awesome times back i had in 2013 with this game. Now only campers & hackers play this game. It's horrible. Most of my friends also left this game. So if you want a good Survival game, choose DayZ. If you want a good survival-pvp game, Wait for H1Z1. If you simply want Infestation. Wait for the ""new"" version. The developers are milking as much money as they can right now before they're gonna move on to make other games. I will use up my Global Inventory then uninstall this game and just let it rest.R.I.P The War Z (Oct, 2012- Dec, 2013) You will be missed.			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. "

DO NOT PLAY!!!Here are just a few reasons from a long, long list-Mircotransactions in a SURVIAL GAME-Severs have to get their own spawn protection the regular game doesn't have any and their are spawn campers-Small world and most of it on the map is blocked by rocks-Zombies have way to much health i can sit there and hit it for 3 minutes before it dies-empty world so little to do it's boring most of the timeNot to mention horrible graphics (the ground and trees are the worst), hackers aplenty, no point: there is no reason to come back to the game			"

												This game is a total mess. You start with s*itty flashlight in a s*itty world with s*itty graphics and everything overall is s*itty. But wait! You can get all you want for an easy payment of 9999,99$ of microtransactions! Ignore the fact that this game actually costs money in the first place. So you decide to play this sh*t? All right! Good luck spawning in a bu*thole somewhere in the forest with a trillion zombies around you, and when you finally get to a city after... 15-20 minutes of running, someone with aimbot is most likely to shoot you down. Have fun waiting 20 minutes to respawn. Oh wait! You can buy the respawn for the real money too! How convenient! This is as far the WORST game I ever layed my hands on. Developers of this s*itty DayZ rip-off should jump off a cliff.NOTE: This review is based on my experience in the game.07/03/2016: Uninstalling this game always puts a smile on my face.			"

												So I'll write this review while being a little irked at this game.  I bought this game during the 2013 Steam Summer sales, and installed it and ran around for maybe 10 - 15 minutes in the game.  It was night so I exited and didn't bother to play it cause couldn't really do much in the dark.  Ended up having to uninstall for hard drive space. So today, 12/1/2013, I download it cause I'm bored and decided to try it out.  Get it installed, go to login to my account and can't remember the password, so I requested a password reset and did it.  Go to login to my account with my newly changed password, only to have the message ""You are permanently banned"" pop up.  Somehow I got banned while playing 15 minutes of the game ever.  GG, thanks for the aweseome experience developer.			"

												Nah guys, what you say is not right, no no no!I and a friend, have been camped in a PTE server at the motel roof in caliwood near the beach. We have been on the lookout for players until all of a sudden he died after 3 hits to the head from a player whose nick was about enough insulting. Then, I jumped up behind a barricade, and almost immediately I received few hits to the head and also died instantly, even though we both had full stuff gear and snipers on us, we died easy peasy. My friend then logged in on another character and also died instantly. In a while, we joined again, geared fully with snipers to hunt that player down. We went up on that roof and saw that player somewhat 200-300 meters in front of us and I stuck my head out to aim him with my magnum, and then I received 3 hits from him and died before I even noticed my health going down which was a surprise because I had a full skill tree. My friend, also died the same way have I. Later, whilst consistently checking the I:SS game blocks twitter bans, I have not seen the nickname of that player, it was clarified that this game is f. up and all of it's systems. What's even better though, is that I as a normal, legit player with over 250 kills have been banned by ""FairFight"". That guy, still hadn't been banned. That guy, used ESP, aimbot, no recoil and no clip whatever else he used; yet I the legit player have been banned FOR NOTHING.Thank you HP and OP, you are amazing. You cannot fix your bugs, and you cannot develop a game. All of yous are a bunch of useless clowns who just await the stupid players who are like ""take my moneys men"". I don't care this post isn't productive or constructive whatever the mods may call it, I will probably get banned for this post but believe me, this game isn't worth playing a minute. Worst management, and worst problem solving. ""FairFight"" keep it up! Make the game fair where the cheaters walk away free and legit players get banned, statistically!0/10 for this game. Wouldn't buy had I known it would be like this.			"

Presents no distinctive feature to the zombie theme, just control hunger and thirst, and some improvements by level of each character. Basically, what you can do in the game is: find weapons and equipment and kill other players to pick up their equipment and weapons, while trying to avoid being killed by zombies.PS: The vast map does NOT decreases the chances of you finding other players .... believe me.

The graphics are average and the gameplay isn't bad, but not good either. I will give the developers some credit, they are trying to get this game good and are adding stuff like vehicles and a California map which is 6x larger than the original Colorado map but due to their greed and the prices to buy simple items rather than find them in the game is outrageous and the fact you can't rent servers off normal providers, only through them using their expensive in-game currency which is ridiculous! I will keep dipping in and out every couple of patches to keep you guys in the loop on what's going on with this game but for now, don't bother.			"

												I was permanently banned from this game for no reason, just like 100s of other customers.  I didn't expect much from this game, but I figured I'd give it a try anyway.  After playing less than a minute when I purchased and closing it, I decided to have a go at it today after about 2 months and was informed by the launcher I was permanently banned.I'm currently waiting on their canned customer support ticket reponse that they've found evidence of multiple cheats used in game but they cannot tell me what, why or when and not to contact them again about the matter.I have absolutely NO idea why Steam continues to sell this game, expecially after forcing it off the marketplace for over a month after the developers deliberately lied and misled their customers at that time.Save yourself the headache and just buy DayZ Standalone.  A game that actually deserves your money, not this garbage which charges you to buy items in game after you've already purchased it.			"

												This game is nothing what you're expecting it to be. It's just a cheap attempt to re-create DayZ with terrible graphics and gameplay. The WarZ was first taken down from Steam because it claimed to have in-game stuff that was never actually added. The game itself is terrible. The zombies AI is terrible , along with the fighting animations and all other mechanics in it.			"

												What was once a great game, has fallen prey to lackluster development and more recently, despite this having been an issue from the get-go, it's horrendously monitored servers see a laughable number of user injected mods; giving cheating players a cruel and gamebreaking unfair advantage.Oh right, and literally everyone is a♥♥♥♥♥♥[Still, not as bad as the Day-Z], It's almost comically PTW - Ammunition is 400% [probably not exaggerating] easier to obtain via in-game microtransactions than it is to loot in-game. Decent armours and guns are a must-have, and although these can be obtained in-game, you are unlikely to survive as far as obtaining some unless you've already paid for the equivilant via microtransactions.Loved this game with friends, long before i returned alone; to log on with each of my characters and get instantly killed by cheating players injecting the ♥♥♥♥ out of the servers.Do i recommend this game? Not anymore... and any enjoyment i received from this game was from playing with friends when realistically we could all have better spent our time elsewhere.♥♥♥♥ing awful game, i feel the dev's owe me not only 108 hours of my life; but any money i poured into this to have wasted by cheating players on their god awful ♥♥♥♥♥torms of servers.My Rating -12 / 1 000 000.

												Worst game with the worst support ever. Do not buy this crap, developers removed the support page and are ignoring players that need help.Stay away from this and Aftermath its by the same developers.-Game has lots of map glitches you get stuck in places.-Hackers that are using aim and wall.-Broken hitbox.-Terrible optimization. (I have 39 FPS when im fighting zombies) -No more updates on the perks.-They closed half of the servers and most people lost their lockers (a safe witch you can store your items, if the server gets shut down you lose it for good and they do not give it back or get a refund.)-They remove stuff or increase the price in their in-game market for example the Personal Locker witch was 7$ is now 14$.My advise ignore this ca$h in, and find a better game.

												Greetings,First of all, I'd like to say that I enjoyed playing the game a lot during its prime time. I have had great time with my friends exploring and fighting the zombie hordes for the first time. I wish I could say the same for the rest of my experience, the game had great potential, I can say had because it is beyond repair, the game is run by Hammerpoint Interactive, just about the worst company in existance.Examples, crashes every 5 minutes, just an array of graphical issues, pc compatibility issues... what can I say, Alienware pc's can't run the game above 20 fps.... for todays standards ugly graphics, and oh, the cream on top, an absolute swarm of hackers, just about the only game where every single server is swarmed by hackers, I'm not talking about 1 or 2, 90% of servers current population is hacking, this is a fact.Anti cheat system there is simply for looks and that's pretty much that. To keep the story short, the game's head developer at the current time, the community manager, calls players doorknobs for trying to prevent the game becoming pay2win, one of the more polite words we have heard from the community manager.Absolute 0 communication with the player base, 0 bug fixes, there are bugs that first appeared in alpha that haven't been fixed, a whole year and some months ago gone by, company cares only about money. 0 customer support, people bought  in game currency for real money and never got what they paid for.In short, the absolute worst game of my life, sure it had some bright moments, but if you want to avoid getting cancer, don't buy this game ever.If this game was free to play I wouldn't recommend it.

												Good stuff:- Uninstalling! Now that's a thing that works without any problem in this game!- End of service as of November 2016!Bad stuff:- Terrible performance. I can run most games at their FPS limit with high graphics and stuff, but this? 5-10 FPS with low graphics and resolution. Damn.- When I first got the game, I played it for like one hour. Then I wanted to check my map to see where I was. Guess what? The game crashed when I tried to access it, and I couldn't restart it at all without reinstalling. Quality game dev.- Bugs and glitches everywhere. EVERYWHERE.- Man, I sure thought that the popular thing about zombies is that you should shoot them in the head to kill them. But I didn't know you needed an entire assault rifle mag for this.- Anti-cheat? Pretty much ""Let's place a gun here, where no one could possibly reach it! Anyone who grabs it gets banned, even if they're perfectly legit!"" and that's it. I mean really? What about actual hackers, eh?- This game was removed from Steam at some point. Why the ♥♥♥♥ is it back?- This game's past... Let's just not talk about it.- [AUGUST 13, 2015] Reinstalled this game to have a good laugh. Launcher said my Steam account doesn't own the game. GG.- Do I have to say more?- End of service as of November 2016, but they made a new one?!			"

Product received for free
												This is one of the worst survival games I have ever played and on top it's one of the worst games I've played ever.Infestation: Survivor Stories has a long history. It first was known as War Z a game which was infamous for steam users where the developers lied about a bunch of the games features and it actually caused Valve to remove the game from the store. Then World War Z caused the game to be renamed to Infestation: Survivor Stories. So you can say that this game had quite a bumpy road, but in the end does it even have any redeeming things about it ?The short answer is no. This game is bad and everything bad you heard about it is pretty much true.So this game is a very close rip off of Day Z. You are spawned into a zombie infested world and you fight to survive. When you meet someone you are given the choice to be a raider or a friendly. But the thing is the game is dead, so when you join a server you either play against 2 people or no one at all. The maps are pretty big so meeting another players before you die is next to impossible. Graphically the game looks abysmal. The range rendering is so bad it makes PS2 games look like anything from this gen. Gameplay wise the game is a survival game so you have to find weapons and find supplies to survive, but fighting zombies is so useless it's better to just avoid combat in general.This game is also really poorly optimised. It crashes constantly and it has massive frame drops when stuff goes down.Also the servers for this version of the game are being shut down, but there's a fan remake of this game again called Infestation, but it also looks identical.In general this game is poorly made, it's buggy, not fun and in general I feel sorry for people who wasted money on this garbage.Pros:N/ACons:- Buggy as hell- Dead community (with the exception of a few players, but it won't matter in a few days)- Absolutely horrible optimisation Final Rating:1/10			"

												I reckon this game could possibly be Satan incarnate. I thought at the sight of the sale 'Oh it's only £1, It'll be funny to pay little for a TOTALLY GREAT game' So I bought it and for the first twenty minutes it physically would not launch. But I persisted, I installed the game after a TOTALLY SHORT amount of time and began to play...Wait - wait no that didn't happen. I didn't play. I spent another REALLY SHORT amount of time installing the game again and then it finally launched. I just had enough time to play the game for about 30 minutes and submit this review before I clawed my eyes out and shot myself in the face with a 12 gauge Double Barreled shotgun, WHICH ACCORDING TO THIS GAME ONLY HAS ONE BULLET. Get DayZ. DayZ won't give you mental Herpes. All in all honesty I think Hammerpoint should pay you to install the game.			"

												My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."". Tears appeared in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family throught what yuor grandfather put us through."" I agreed. Until this very day, I have never touched a cigarettee. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anywaysaka filled with cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories Classic, formerly Infestation: Survivor Stories, formerly The War Z is a total joke. I really regret buying this game. I fell for the hype of this game when it was first released as The War Z, often called one of the worst games ever. The game promised many things and failed to deliver upon them.One major promise they broke was the multiple worlds or maps. As far as I know there are two right now, the second map took at least a year to finish after the games release. The map was also completely broken and suffered from major performance problems. The War Z (as it was originally named) runs terribly. The game is not optimized and is very laggy. I recently tried playing this game and my antivirus marked it as a threat.This game is also plagued with cheaters and hackers. You will be killed many times by the hundreds of people who cheat in this game. You’re not going to have a good time with this game. The game is full of micro transactions and anything you buy with real money is going to be lost and stolen by cheaters. Say goodbye to your money.Seriously stay away from this game. I would never recommend anyone buy it. I only clocked 22 hours in it to try and get my money’s worth. Every minute was awful.			"

												I really didnt want to write this. I gave this game a second chance, i just tried to log in, mistyped my password 2 times and got banned for 1 hour? So here i come. It's a bit late for this review but... Nevermind.I still cannot believe that i was so hyped for this game. Me and my friends bought this♥♥♥♥♥♥for playing together.  We wanted to have fun. WRONG! Everything went wrong. First of all, for the creators of this game, nice job, really ♥♥♥♥ing nice. THEY PROMISED FOR LOTS OF THINGS AND NONE CAME TO REALITY! I started playing this game when it was still in Alpha. I bought the second package for it. The game wasnt so bad in the first days. Except the ghost zombie bug, that was awful. Me and 4 friends of mine were searching for supplies and weapons for days. What? WOW WE FOUND A SHOTGUN!!! But the game creators didnt want us to have some ammo.  Oh, now we are starving? Doesnt matter, we will just go and die slowly. Alright enough with the Alpha and Beta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.And the game was released. I wanted do try this game again. I entered the game and... Nothing changed? Oh okay, let me wander a little bit and BAM, a big hole in my head. This is normal.Months later me and my friends wanted to play this again. We found a low populated server and joined it. We found some equipment and wanted to wander together. Somehow everyone left the server. There were 2 people in the server except us. And what happened? When we were raiding the city, someguy flied near us, and ""quickscoped"" everyone in 2 seconds. Well flying + killing 4 people in 2 seconds, totally not a cheater.Anyway, dont buy it,  Steam has enough mercy to give this game 20/100I would give didiwritethisreviewforthis♥♥♥♥♥♥game/100Edit 1 : It seems my account is hacked by a Russian IP. Have fun mate, i won't try to get it back.Edit 2 : Servers are shutting down, thank the maker, we are saved from this cancer.			"

												You know, at first. This really isn't a bad game. But once you spend 50+ dollars trying too support the game and help development you get banned for NO REASON. I was banned twice. The first time we wroked things out and I was back to playing the game, then they banned me a second time. I sent a ticket in and waited for a response.... 2 months later I finally recieve a response, they say they have proof of hacking on my account but they cannot provide it... I even gave them permission too search my computer for any hacks. It's sad really, the moderators and admins they PAY don't do their job on the forum, which is why I spent THREE HOURS A DAY helping people with bug fixes, unlike the ""Professional"" Admin and mod team. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to be backstabbed by hammerpoint.			"

												I bought this game for the 50 dollars or whatever it was when it first came out and everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ed about how it was a ripoff of Day-Z. I first thought it was pretty fun; the concepts were cool, and so was the environment - albeit the game was still mostly under construction back then. I didn't play the game for about a year and just decided to do so now. Nothing has changed except the main screen. New maps? No. The same good old ""Colorado"".New weapons? Not really.Vehicles, or anything like that? Yeah, no.Ability to actually find a player and not run around by yourself the whole game like in Arma 3? Nope.New zombies? Nope.Ability to go into more buildings? Nope.Should you buy this game? Nope.I also have a Velocity Micro gaming PC, and even when running the game on Ultra uber graphics mode it still doesn't even come close to the graphics shown in the Steam preview pics. My guess is they are touched up lies.I'm actually pretty offended that I bought it for 50 dollars and now its only 5 dollars. I want my 45 dollar refund damn it. It's my money and I want it now.			"

												Ok, i am going to offer and honest view in this review and make sure everyone is completley aware of the positives and negatives. Firstly, i think the game is amazing, fun to play and the best of its kind out at the moment. Gameplay is awesome, the shere anxiety you fell in sintuations as amazing. There is nothing like it. Picture this:You are approaching a town through a grassy forest at night. You can hear an owl from the tree above and lonelyness sets in. All you have is your flashlight and a few scraps of food. You are wounded and bleeding from a previous encounter with an infected and need to scavange a bandage as fast as you can or you are going to bleed to death. In the near distance, you can see the small town. The moonlight shimmers a slight reflection on the town roads allowing you to barely make out dark figures scattered around. You notice an ambulance led on its side. An aftermath caused by the sudden panic upon outbreak. You move toward it steadily, checking your surroundings for threats. Suddenly ahead of you, a flash of light and the sound of a gunshot follows. You hit the deck, concealed by the long grass listening, wondering if that shot was meant for you. HOWEVER, yes, i know. My reccomendation is a NO. This is why. When the game was released it was released titled WARZ and during the early stages, there were no anti-cheat software. Bearing in mind that you could BUY items from the in game store for REAL MONEY. Anyone who bought items with their hard earned cash was quickly robbed of it buy cheaters. At one point i read that there was a FREE cheat software available for the game. IU liked the site in the forum to the developers. Nothing came of it. Cheaters accounts were banned. So all that they had to do to play again was buy the game, create a new account and they were back on their way to stealing items. The devs could have issued an IP ban, but that has never happened.  Constant crash issues, files miraculousy go missing. PB failiures, random kicks from PB communication errors. DEVS are money grabbers, There was once a time when loot was fairly balanced, fair ammount of guns/backpacks/meds etc. Before the trading was available, they severly nerfed the loot spawns, forcing players to spend money in their store. A lot of items in the store were only available for purchase with GC (in game money purchased with real money). So the more you spent the more you won (unless a hacker got you first) This game has been avaiable a very long time. And only recently have they added vehicles. again, i kept crashing at one point upon entry. There is 1 map and 1 map only. the new map has been in development for 6 months. You can play in a PTE. The map has a city and 4 TINY towns. The rest of the gigantic map is baron lands which has no actual use.THis is only a tiny portion of why you should NEVER buy this game. I could write PAGES and PAGES of negatives. In a nutshell, if this game was ran by devs who actually gave a crap about the community and were not trying to bleed them dry i would have been one of the best games of all time. Shame on you DEVS. You facked it up. Good on you "

												This game doesn't even work...Well, it didn't for me. When I ran it, it tried 'updating' and crashed repeatedly in the process, blaming my firewall for the deed. I turned my firewall off and tried again and the same thing happened...I looked up the error and the bottom line is that if you get this error, you're far passed ♥♥♥♥ed. But there were a few tutorials on youtube that should help fix it, sadly, none of them did.I bought this game to review on my youtube channel, I was hoping to get a laugh out of it's ineptitude but it couldn't even give me that. This leads me to the conclusion that is the most worthless product in human existence, it's a con, not only should it be free but you should be paid to have it installed on your computer.It's an ungodly abomination that begs for apocalypse and you can't even get a cheap laugh out of it. Bottom line, I wouldn't even recommend buying this garbage for a bit of superficial fun, it's just♥♥♥♥♥♥After reading this review, just go to another game on the store page. You'd be better off buying Kane and Lynch than this garbage.Yes, I said that.(Edit: The only way that I could get the MINIMUM 5 minutes needed to write a review for this game was to cheat by leaving an error message up whilst the game was running.Top quality game this is, couldn't even get 5 minutes out of it!)

												I do not recommend the game.  Paid for weapons, killed by another player in one shot, that player took my weapon and I am out real world money.  Don't play game supports crimes, and tries to say it in the sprit of the game.  If play don't buy weapons ad-ins etc you be rob and won't get your money back or add-ins.			"

												This game is probably the worst and most frustrating game I have ever played. It has so many problems, hackers end your fun and take your hard earned gear. I have a graphics card that can run high detailed games fine, but the graphics on this game are so terrible and can cause FPS issues. What really makes me dislike the game is that players can simply buy their way into surviving and have all this gear they never even found. But no, it gets worse. Ammo is appearently very rare in the game, being 3x harder to find than actual guns! The guns seem to deal low damage to both zombies and players, which in this case, need more ammo. Where can you get this ammo? You can get it via purchase. I didn't realize that it takes 3 shots with a shotgun to kill a SINGLE zombie. The delevopers pretty much made the guns weak so that they would need more ammo, more ammo that people have to buy in order to get enough to for 1 emergency. This game has an endless amount of problems and issues that im not going to get started on. The only thing I like about this game is how the loot is placed around the map (hat on a dresser, gun in a gun rack, etc.) and more of the buildings are enterable. But aside from only 2 things I thought was well done, I don't recommend this game. I recommend titles such as DayZ, Rust, and State of Decay if your looking for a good zombie apocolyptic survival game.			"

I paid my money, waited for the DL to happen and the install. I double click to open only to find I was dooped. I can't play the game unless I give more money. more than I already paid. :/Maybe it should be listed honestly.  I realy feel like I was lied to and bought an absolute lemon.

												This is a great example of what could have been. Post apocalyptic zombie survival mmo sounds hard to mess up but nearly every one does and this game takes the cake and eats the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. When first released on steam as War It had pictures of the game looking fun, playable, and looking polished with features. Sadly they were all fake all these features were not even included and still are not. They stole pictures and loading screens from other games and was forced to take them down along with the whole game its self for awhile on steam. It doesn't stop there the developers made acounts went in game and banned people talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game. About the only thing worse then the developers is the actual community its self. Camping outside one of the 3 safe zones with wepons killing new players that only have flashlights for no reason. I guess I should mention the gameplay as well. Gun combat is shakey, inaccurate, and almost useless unless you have a scope. Most of you would be lucky to even get far enough to find a gun. Cause once you get killed by an other player for no reason you get to waitover an hour of real life to respawn! That is unless you pay to them real life money to respawn faster of course!. Melee combat is almost useless as hits do not register. Most items are locked behind a pay 2 win wall. I could go on for hours about just my horror stories in this game. Maybe I will write more just to keep you from buying this game from these greedy lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Final Score3/10			"

												Honestly this is the worst zombie MMO I have played. At first it looked very interesting, but it was just a terrible copy of DayZ and other similar games. I'm quite sure there was a reason this game was about 1$ during a Steam sale, and yet even though it was only a dollar I still wish to refund it. When I first bought the game, downloaded it, then played it, I was suddenly thrown into the main menu having no idea what to do. There is no tutorial whatsoever, and you're not going to recieve any help from other players. When I first entered a server I spawned right next to a man with an AK-47. Instantly I tried to ask for some assistance and tips. Same goes for all the other servers. It's always shoot first then talk for some reason. This game is certainly not friendly to new players, nor is the community very friendly either. To finish off, I HIGHLY dislike this game and hope that no one else will buy it.			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories (aka The WarZ) got a lot of bugs / crashes / lags / random disconnection which could be really annoying and in most of the cases your character dies because of that and you lose all the items you had on it.In my opinion, Infestation: Survivor Stories can be fun when you get into the game and play without having disconnection , but in its current statement , the game is just not playable and even though I played around 57 hours , I could say a large part from that was in the joinning screen for like ten minutes and after that to see your player for a second , and after that you just return to the lobby with the well known message ""Disconnected from server"" ,When I bought the game I did have like a month where I did have like disconnection in a day which was fine , but now I can't even play the game. I've tried all the things I could try , updating PunkBuster , reinstalling the game and so on , but nothing worked.In conclustion , DO NOT buy this game right now , wait for the developers to fix the game first , if you want to try this game , go ahead and play the trial , and if the game goes on 75% off , and you really enjoyed the trial , you can consider buying the full game because if the game works fine for you , 3.74$ is nice price for hours of fun.But again , this game can work fine for you and suddenly you couldn't join servers anymore , so think carefully before buying this game.Final score : 4/10 After they will fix the crashes / disconnections / annoying drop fps , I'll rate this game 9/10 , because I had a lot of fun playing it with my friends while I could			"

												Infestaion Survivor Stories tries to capture the new Zombie MMO genre but fails due to many flaws with the game. The most notable flaw is the microtransactions which takes away the whole ""survival"" from the game knowing that you can buy food and medical supplies that does give an unfair advantage to players who chose not to pay for virtual items, You also have to pay to revive your characters Now this wouldn't really be a problem if it were a free to play game but its not it's £11 waste of money.Another problem with the game are the bugs and they can be game breaking, Zombies can seem to hit you when they are not very close to you and it doesn't take long for them to kill you. If you try to stand on hard to reach places the zombies sometimes stack on each other and can eventually hit you.A big flaw in the game is how the zombies match your running speed, This matched with the fact you walk slower the more damaged you are, But the zombies seem to keep jogging on so it becomes very hard to outrun them this matched with their hit range makes the game too hard and almost unplayable.All this negativity doesn't mean the game doesn't have some positve atributes, One thing I liked was the time capsule feature   which allowed players to write a message in a tube can leave it for other players to find so this added ""Role playing"" if you're into that. Also you cannot buy guns on the store which doesn't make it purely pay to winThe game still is in alpha so this could all change but it's has not had any major updates since release which makes me think the developers have abandoned the game.

												Honestly I played this game for a long time, and for many hours a day, and while I can honestly say I enjoyed playing it for a while, my final conclusion is that this genre of gaming is the next big thing in MMO, and this idea for a game is fantastic.That being said this particular game is a case of what could potentially be an absolutely outstanding game, being held back by it's lazy and carefree developers. The game as you will find is riddled with glitches, bugs, poor balancing issues, and not to mention least of all hackers.Know in any other gamers hackers a real nuisciance but in this there level of annoyance and anger they inflict upon you is so much worse, because you loose all your hard earned guns and items and have to just start from scratch yet again and after being killed 15 times in a row from 500 + metres by an aimbot the game becomes infuiriating. All I can say is I hope a game along this genre line is launched soon that is properly handled and produced by the developers.			"

												I tried really hard to like this game and it was fun at first playing with several friends (there were 9 of us...we've all quit). However, as many others have stated...... cheaters, p2w, broken promises, expensive servers, preferencial treatments, dumb♥♥♥♥♥changes, bugs, performance issues and waiting for updates / features to bring it to level of awesomeness everyone was expecting. This is the biggest let down I've ever experienced from a video game. (Including waiting FIFTEEN YEARS for Duke Nukem Forever just for it to be the garbage that it is). Buy Something else....anything else....this game is the equivalent of paying $15 for a turd.....then having to engage in a microtransaction \ expensive rental for something to block the smell. I wish I could remove it from my library completely.			"

												I would not recommend this game to ANYBODY. Its full of glitches, God  KNOWS its full of hackers galore (like a rediculous amount), the gameplay is meh, and on top of all the game was an over-hyped cash grab.  I bought this game a little length of time after its release on Steam and put MORE than enough hours into this piece o'♥♥♥♥♥♥game to know what it is. They constantly ban anyone on their forums who even remotely calls them out on ANYTHING theyre doing wrong (me included) and random bans in game for people because of a terrible anti-hack system. I even had a *brief* conversation with a mod who had said how much he hates his job and all he sees when he goes on the forums was ""negativity and despair""....Great mod crew theyve got there to accompany their less-than-medeocre developing team.2/10 would not bang.p.s. Kewk is gone? 1 step in the right direction but it wont ever save this game..			"

There's a HUGE cheating/hacking issue and it's impossible for someone new to start the game again. The developers dont even speak to the community, but when they do its to removed the anti cheat....PLEASE do yourself a favour, save your money and do not buy this game, the devs are ALL money hungry.

												The game itself I've heard very bad things about, and even didn't realize it was WarZ just renamed. The controls are choppy and the damage you can do vs the zombiesis disheartening. However gameplay problems aside thats not the reason why I don't recomend this game, its the customer support and the way they deal with players. Given that games through steam, especially ones that require an account, can't be changed once initialy set. This makes it impossible to play the game if anything happens.  If you look on my record, you can see that I have barely any time on this game, that is due to the way the game works. If you die, theres a 24 hour cooldown before you can play again. Its fine I'll play a little bit, and if I die turn the game off. After getting the 7 or so hours of total play time, I was tired of playing. I uninstalled it and went on to play other games. Months later, I see the new update and decide to play it again to see if anything was made better. And to my surprise I find that my account is banned. Why was it banned? I haven't played the game at all. I decide to contact customer support about the problem, perhaps they can shed some light on what happened or what they mistakenly think happened in game. January 10th was when I sent them a support ticket to repeal the ban, they only just got back to me today saying there was detected uses of exploits or programs to basically cheat the game. And that because this so called detection was against their agreement they won't unban the account. Now remember I haven't played the game at all in this entire time they say something happened. So how could I have suposedly done any of this? Their answer? ""We are unable to provide any further detail regarding the results of our investigations due to its sensitive nature."" So the information about my account is sensitive and unable to be shared with me, the account owner. They won't overturn the decision cuz it aparently is against their terms even if it may be their mistake in the first place, and I can't make a new account cuz its perminately tied with steam, making it a useless game stuck in my library. I can deal with crappy gameplay mechanics and annoying texture glitches and such. I can deal with boring gameplay and whatnot. I can ignore all that, but when a company doesn't want to help its players in their own game. That is where I draw the line, and this is the reason why I do not ever recomend this game or any of their future products.			"

Poor mentallity, poor game, poor graphics, I do not recomend this game to anyone to play, hope people read this before buying the game. The game might look good from the pics and the video, but being in game is going to change your mind. The second I saw the in game store, I knew I made a bad choice. You shouldn't add an in-game store into a survival game, it allows people to get the best gear right away, and just kill anyone they please without the care of anyone else because they know they have the best gear. It is cheating anyone not willing to pay money into the game out of a good time. DO NOT BUY. I am ashamed to have bought this game.			"

If you buy this, you DESERVE all the bad things this game will bring to you.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, even to my worst enemy. I wouldn't recommend this game to Lucifer in person.[/b] - Last words from Hater Guy, after being shot by hackers aimbotters at market entrance. Infestation: Hacker Stories is the WORST game I've ever played in my entire life. I tried, I tried sooo freaking hard to like this game, alone, with friends, 2, 3, 10 friends, 100 times!!!. It was a 50 dollar investment back then, but I never had fun with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVER. This game is worst than E.T from Atari. It should be buried deep down in the desert along with this shameful companyI've been playing videogames since I was 7, I'm 27 now. I've played more than 3000 titles so far and THIS, this very game is an example to not be followed - either by its flawed design or by its company and developers. I regret the day when I bought this piece of trash at pre-alpha, when it still called ""WarZ"", before being legally forced to change its name due copyright infringement from World War Z movie. The community on this game is sick, the developers sucks, game itself sucks hard. Full of bugs, glitches, hacks and absent staffers that wouldn't give you a ♥♥♥♥ even if your life depended on it. No to mention all the random banhammer rage who banned innocent people and leave hackers unpunished. Months ago, it got worse. There was a data corruption or something on their forums and servers and the guys showed us that they simply couldn't handle it. All data erased and, again, no one give us a single ♥♥♥♥ to make it better. I wouldn't trust my credit card information to these leechers again! I wouldn't do if I were you.The only reason for this game have been released was the huge zombie hype brought by The Walking Dead and World War Z. I wish I could delete this game from my list.WAR Z WORLD WAR Z INFESTATION FEATURES:- Laughable IA- More hackers per m² than Crossfire, Combat Arms and similar  games- GMs who don't give a dame.- TONS of microtransations. It's a pay-to-win out there, fellows.- Hacks!- Delayed updates, delayed fixed, delayed maps, delayed everything.- No respect for you, customer, at all. I mean, REALLY, visit their forums and check it out.- No security for your billing information.- Get T-bagged all day long, by hackers, by zombies, by GMs, by life.Want a better survival horror game?Day Z on the way. I didn't played the new standalone yet, but the Arma 2 mod gave me SO MUCH more fun than Infestation could ever possibly give.			"

												War Z, or Infestation: Survivor Stories as it has been forcibly renamed (not the devs fault but the new name just isn't catchy), had the potential to be an excellent survival game, it just needed a few major issues such as its cheat protection and banning system ironed out. However, the developers made a mess of it, instead focusing on adding more and more content and complicating things by constantly changing loot spawning rates and postions, making it impossible to actually set up with a group of friends in one location. By failing to address the needs and requests of the community, they allowed this game to flop and become a sore point for any self-respecting survival player. Anyone looking to purchase a survival game, avoid this one, if you're set on a zombie survival game get Day-Z or, for an interesting twist, Nether, though as for the latter there is again the worry that it could also follow the same path as ISS did.EDIT 19/06/2016Do not fall for the new developing Infestation World game currently underway, a huge number of previous ISS players who cheated in ISS, have already moved over to IW and continued cheating, the GC redemption that has been offered is, frankly, a joke, and a pathetic attempt at buying previous players, who will be thoroughly dissappointed, as you will only recieve compensation for GC present in your account currently, and only if purchased within the last year or so. If you're going to remake an already bad game, nearly just as badly, don't then also be utter cheapskates to not transfer more GC that plyers have purchased. I know players who (albeit foolishly) have bought at least 40,000 GC, and yet are only compensated with a trivial 1000 or even less since that's all they currently have in their ISS accounts. Bare faced robbery at this point.			"

												Is this game good? No. Do I reccomend it? No. Is it fun to play and screw around and play with friends? Yes. You can occasionaly find weapons and ammo around the map which is fun to do. You can explore the crappy looking terraign, you can walk into every single town/airport and die instantly by invisible zombies, or hordes of hundreds of them in a two house town. If you have a big group of people, you can really♥♥♥♥♥♥other people off. Only get this game if its Free-To-Play. Don't pay your precious money. There are much better, cheaper games than this. If you're going to invest money in a zombie open-world survival game, buy the standalone DayZ. It's in alpha(I am writing this December 30th of 2013) and it is very buggy, but with a game that made 5.1 million dollars in one day, the developers have no choice but to shell it out, take their time, and make it good. I got this game for free though, so I didn't spend a cent. Don't get this game unless you just pooped out 500 million dollars. Even then, buy the game with caution.			"

												Trash. Plain and simple. I have stuck with this game since the beginning but was not fortunate enough to own Arma 2 to be able to play the wonderful Day Z.The previously known as ""War Z"" was promising at the start but eventually proved to lead no where.. Don't be fooled by the polished ""screenshots"" of gameplay. This game mays as well be an out right scam.. They refuse to focus on any of the major problems with the game and instead focus on completely cosmetic aspects of it..Play this game and you're going to be doomed to wasting buckets of cash on their cash shop.They deserve the meta score of 20.. I'd give them even lower than that.			"

K, I get it, game has to validate files. Secondly, ""game has to install cheat prevention programme"". K, but couldn't you install it with game? Game launched, ""loading game data"" for 5 mins.  Closed the game process. Launched again. K, I see menu, created character, clicked big button PLAY, chose server. Loading got about 5% within 5 mins. Closed the game process. Launched again. Game wants user email and password, I type it. Wrong. K, maybe i spelled something wrong. Typed again. Wrong. ""Your IP has been blocked due to multiple trying of login"". Deleted the game.			"

												Don't buy this s***ty game it is the worse game ever, it will literally haunt your dreams and f**k you up so many times you will want to destroy your computer. Masturbating with a wrench is more fun than this, hell even sticking your C**k in a blender and watching the blades cut it is more fun than this piece of s**t. If I was able to rate this game I would give it 0/100 No jokes it's awful it would give you aids. So please don't buy it I hate it so F***ing much it's fine with friends but that's rare it still annoys the s**t out of me also the zombies take 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 hits to die and the players on there are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Also if you bought a premium edition for this game you only get 9 mins before your character can respawn. But if you don't have premium it's 20 minutes when you die. If you leave the game you will have to wait slightly longer, it sucks and takes ages to load. It's has so much problems it's awful and why would you want to pay if your character died just respawn straight off but far away or something. It's so freaking bad. They have made some updates with this game so now you don't have to wait to respawn, but it still runs like a piece of crap filled with hackers and billions of hits to kill a bloody zombie so gg to the ♥♥♥♥♥ who made this.

												I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy. It's terribly optimised, incredibly buggy, and was made solely to rip people off. It was removed from Steam twice and had to be renamed to avoid being associated with itself(it was formerly known as ""The War Z""). I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this, I was given it by a friend who wasn't aware of what the developers were doing and how bad the game was. If I had to choose between playing this game and watching Birdemic, I'd watch Birdemic. Both movies. Please do yourself a favour and don't get this game.			"

												Before I say how horrible this game is, let me provide the source of my anger in this game. I decided to go into a zombie infested military base in hopes of finding at the very least a pistol. I had plenty of ammunition. Without realizing it, I spent 2 hours searching that enitre base, hacking my way through an endless amount of zombies, with way too many close calls only to realize that there is no gun in that base. Of all places to find a gun, you would think a military base would have it. But nope. I even searched Police stations, nothing. Now to stop myself from rambeling, I am just going to list what is wrong with this game.-Zombies run like they have some sort of strange disease that doesn't just bring them back to life.-Guns are almost impossible to find, yet some people have them by what seems to be a miracle.-You cannot trust anyone, if you group with someone you can expect 9 times out of 10, they will kill you.- You will spend hours just searching ONE military base, thankfully I called it quits after realizing I had just spent 2 hours.- Animation horrible- Server Crashes- the ressurection system is unfair- insufficient customization options- lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag oh did i mention? LAG- NOT EVEN A DEAD ZOMBIE SOLDIER HAD A DAMN PISTOL- ammo everywhere, no gun in sight.- you lose everything when you die.... including the points you just bought with REAL money.- Flare gun..... What is the point if everyone is going to kill you.- There needs to be a better friend/foe system.- Better travel system needed- It is the 21st century in this game SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE A DAMN GUN.My Rant is over.....

												I wouldn't recommend to play this game to be honest. It's not a Zombie Survival game! It's more a Bug survival game. Zombies get bugged, could hit you through walls, so called ""phantom hits"" from the said Zombies can screw up an entire hour of searching for good stuff, IF YOU DON'T GET SHOT by one of those players who pay for this pile of bugs. To be honest if you enter a 5/100 populated server, you can be almost 90-100% sure that you get shot. It doesn't matter if its a PvE server.If there would be an option for PvE servers to turn the PvP hitbox COMPLETLY off it would be better. Otherwise I would never recommend this game to any of my friends or strangers who ask me about this game.			"

												This game is a walking simulator. Hackers every where aimbotting, OBS, jumping into the sky and killing everyone. When they update the game the only thing they change are ways to make you buy GC, make you spend more in-game dollars, and make the maps bigger. It takes them forever to fix issues. You walk around, get shot, loose all your items you just paid for with real $. If you are crippled, and have always wondered what walking feels like, play this game. You will learn how much walking sucks a$$. It takes 20 minutes just to get to 1 looting area. They added cars but guess what.. you need GAS and REPAIR KITS that you need to PAY for EACH ONE just so the cars will work (They are buggy as HELL). AND they made it so there is only 3 cars per server. Forcing you to pay to get it running. When you play this game, you take a chance of Fairfight banning you for no reason what-so-ever and there goes your money with the game ;D God forbid they ever fix their damn game performance or do anything for the players. Want more proof? Look at the tags people put on the game AND the meta score. #Garbage #Scam #Pay To Win #Cheaters #Worse Than Super Cancer Aids""Do you reccomend this game?""

												I use to play this game alot aand I loved it, joke was on me. At my peak I had about 950$ worth of stuff in my GI and I was quite     proud of myself for it, but about a week after I reached that peak I got random banned; I was destroyed, but it helped me realize this game is a mess, there are too damn many hackers and the developers are all incompatent rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no social skills what-so-ever.

												Usually when I see a low score and there's a lot of people trashing a game, I try to give it the benefit of the doubt until I've played it for myself. I went into Infestation thinking ""Ah ok, maybe this game isn't going to be horrible."" - I was so ♥♥♥♥ing wrong...This is one of the rare cases where the worst review on the page still was being too nice. I thought ""This is a zombie survival game, how can it be bad?"" - This may very well be the worst game on Steam, and I'd go as far to say this is probably the worst game I've ever played.The list of things that were good about this game is GREATLY shorter than the list of♥♥♥♥♥♥that is ♥♥♥♥ed up.

Still tempting at times, but hackers, bad devs, and glitchy zombie combat keep me away. To the survivors still playing, I hope you guys keep having fun and that these problems don't work you over too bad. For everyone else, don't let this game give you the promise of a zombie survival game and then break your spirit with bad...well, everything else, really.			"

												This game has horrible textures. The walking animation is very basic and the map is very buggy. You can't even swim in the river ; it's just an invisible wall. There are some terrains that are so buggy that will randomly kill you due to ""fall damage."" It is essentially a pay-to-win game since one can buy weapons and food to get a better advantage. The whole concept of survival and working with other people does not exist since everyone will most likely shoot you on sight without a warning. It is only decently good if you have friends to play with but it is still a horrible experience.			"

												I won’t go into detail about the bad gameplay animation, the textures or the horrible player interaction that most people tend to talk about in this renamed pile of something that makes even worst crap look as clean as a new polished mirror. It’s really how the trading system works that bothers me even after taking my £13.00 purchasing the game it dares have the option to put more money if I wanted better starting item’s  to only have the possibility of losing them if I die, I could understand if the item’s stayed in there storage permanently like an infinite number since access to them is only available in traders or when creating a new character, but because it doesn’t it’s like taking a gamble with no real payoff (put it simply an actual real waste of money).There’s also the fact you can’t sell off any of the loot you find like weapons or armour meaning the only way to get in game currency is to just continuously kill zombies which leads to endless grinding due to it being fairly rare that they drop only 10-50 dollars.If anything I’m the Idiot for buying this, I don’t know why I didn’t take the advice from half the reviews demoting this low rated game.

It sucks for the creators because from now on, they'll be known as ""The People who brought you Infestation: Survivor Stories"".

												The producer of Big Rigs Sergey Titov, also made this beauty, WarZ... I mean, Infestion: Survivor Stories... Wait, Infestion: Survivor Stories ""Classic"" ... From my knowledge this game was awful all the way through, along with all of the other projects Titov has produced. Their whole forums die, have robots and use their own staff to reply to their own threads, no support, change the prices of their games consistently, Steam wouldn't allow me to remove it from my games list after being unfairly banned and no support forums.I hated this game to begin with but really tried to give it a chance, it was more of a sandbox with hackers, endless unpatched exploits to gain easy gear, noclip zombies, terrible animations, then added pay-to-win features such as quicker revival time [limted time to play a day if you died too much, to player slots and gear slots, etc. Oh and did I mention their own ""anti-cheat"" before they used FairFight, was used to monitor your screen while you played, yeah, totally not fishy at all...I haven't installed this game in years, never was going to re-install either, but I laugh as I see the game hasn't been removed from steam, and do enjoy reading the endless comments. Do no bother playing any of these games, as if you do some background checks, the same thing happens with most, if not all of his unsuccessful games, did I say games? I meant demos... Over priced demos...Oh yes before I pulbish I see a ""Shattered Skies"" promo underneath, took a quick glance, wouldn't bother buying that either.

												WarZ, otherwise known as ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" was by far the most catastrophic failure of a game released in 2012. It's one of the lowest scoring games in the history of Metacritic.com with a 20/100 critic score and a 1.7 of 10 user score. These scores don't lie, it really is as bad as people say it is. Extremely bad optimization, resource hogging, horrible texture's & distance lod, terrible animations, glitchy mechanics, and broken weapons. This game is the single worst purchase I've ever made on Steam, and I even bought it during a sale.The game was marketed using entirely misrepresenting screenshots, it's a wonder that it hasn't entirely been pulled from Steam.

												I still can't believe I wasted my time on the piece of crap game....   The devs do not listen to their community at all and have it set in their minds that this game is good. Hacker's paradise, gltiches all over the place, unfinished skill tree, zombies can kill you from far away when they only melee. I can go on forever with the list of bad things that are bad with this game.... The fact that DakotaZ (who is a streamer of this game and is basically the mascot) is sick of all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the devs are saying and will switch to H1Z1 shows how bad this game is. "

												Long time i dont touch this game, and i know there have been plenty of updates, but its really hard to say something positive about this title. By the time i played with my friends,in 2013, the game had already been oficially launched, and it was a buggy mess. It was sad. The gameplay was incredible boring, the graphics were unfinished, the amount of bugs we found in just a little time playing were huge. And also, a lot of microtransitions. Terrible game, i hope the developers are working hard to fix this, people are telling me that this game is still broken. And this change of name(the game was called War Z before, if im not wrong) was also sad. Infestation - Survivor Stories.....lol, that's a bad name, sorry. It should be Bugstation - Disappointing Stories			"

												This was probably the worst game i ever purchased on steam and would like my money back. The games advertisement looks awsome and all the features seem pretty cool, however it didnt take long for me to go limp after a little while of gameplay. first off it is a pay to win game. if you are lucky enough to even find a weapon before a hacker kills you from mid-air and takes all your loot, then you have to buy the ammo after the first magazine. good lck finding more ammo. With this game you either suffer from hackers ruining the game, being charged real money to buy emulated weapons and ammo. Once you die you loose it all and have to buy it again, or you can become a hacker and just be that guy why people rate this game sh_t. Also not to mention in the avertisement it shows crowds of intense zombies, that is not how it is, it is way more slow paced and dry. I could deal with slower paced if it wasnt for my real money and hackers. If I think ammo for my real guns are expensive why would I buy fake ammo for fake guns with real  cash.			"

												A paid walking simulator with a ""free-to-play-mmo- System. Even if this is in a promotion you should avoid it, there is no fun in walking in a huge map with not much to do, or be almost obligated to pay real money to have simple things in the game. Expensive in-game items too. OOOOH i almost forgot, you can't host your own server to play with friends, you have to pay for that(this is no so strange in nowdays games but it shoudn't be like that). MAYBE with friends this could be a little fun, but i don't know.			"

												Most bugged, laggy, useless piece of junk that calls itself zombie survival. The features are non existent, all ""going to be features"" are wishfull thinking of totally underqualified developers.Gameplay can be summed up as: You start the game on laggy servers, either get rick-rolled by laggy zombies while you wonder why you can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥or get killed by well equipped other players who go ""Noob hunting"". Since there is NO real game content whatsoever this seems to be the only real thing you can do after getting some weapons.If you want to have ammo for ANY firearm, you need to buy it for ""ingame dollars"" which can be acquired by killing zombies ... a lot of zombies. Like 40 zombies for a mag of 6 rounds anaconda revolver ammo. You did not get it yet? You have to ♥♥♥♥ing buy ANY kind of ammo for REAL money. The game sucks and it should be removed from steam for not actually publicating the fact that it can not be called more than a public alpha crap version that charges money.			"

												Contrary to what many others have said, I confirm that you can still indeed login to Infestation, and that its various official servers are still online. I'm not sure why people are saying they're down. I just tested this myself and was playing on their US servers with no issues, and there were at least 12 of them online. As terrible as the game became (what a waste, considering it had so much potential), I just want to make it clear to everyone that their servers are still online.Still though, no way I'd recommend this game ever since they dropped the ball on it in late 2013.

												do not even consider buying this game if you do not have half a dozen reliable players on a private chat to play with you because you will get absolutely nothing but grief from this game if you don't.if there are four or five players on a server coordinating their efforts in a private voice chat, you will never make a move on that server without being shot down or gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ these games are nothing but the lowest form of online predators, basically games like this breed the equivalent of online street gangs waiting for the opportunity to mug people in a dark alley.a single player in this game will have absolutley no fun unless they are admining their own server and that's how they getcha, that is what the publisher relies on to make their money besisdes peoples' natural gullibility and willingness to gamble five dollars because they own all the servers and they rent them for an exorbitant fee! do you see how that works?if you are a person who took the advertisement at face value and only bought the game with the belief that it was a real game and didn't have intentions of renting your own server or being an online thug in a virtual street gang then you will be nothing but cannon fodder for the people who did do one or the other or both of those two things.now you know the truth, this game, most definitely, is a scam! don't throw five bucks away! it may not seem like much but it's still money and it's still makes the publisher/developer a.k.a. scammers wealthy men while you lose money and recieve nothing but anal daterape in return for it.

												So I decided to make a review for Infestation: Survivor Stories after I opened up the game for the first time in a week and got a message that said ""You have been banned permanetly by fairfight"". Now I dont remember me hacking or anything but I do remember right now that im about to give a horrible review for this copy of ""war inc""♥♥♥♥♥♥ I guess they could tell the future to know that I am about to write a long, honest review. And believe, to the devs, HONEST isn't the word they're looking for about this game.So where do I start? Well I will just start from the beginning.So here I am loading into the world of colorado for the first time. My DayZ expectations up and my Call Of Duty expectations down to the minimum but let me tell you....I should have flipped those two around. I ran for 10 minutes until I met this little base. I checked my map and it said...""Norad Military Base"". So I ran in there and I saw a zombie. I had courage with my flashlight gripped in my hand and immedatly walked towards the zombie...All of the sudden I heard ♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio moaning from all directions. I sprinted down into the middle of the base and then I heard a huge BANG...""You are dead"" it said as it played sad music. That wasn't the first time I got shot out of the blue at will NEVER be its last. After 100 hours of pain and suffering I got a good inventory. I found a clan and we PvP'd all day. We got loads of loot..LOADS OF IT. But then later something stranged happened....at blue ridge safe zone I saw 2 guys doing something with guns. There were only 10 people on the server including me so I ran to get closer and they looked like they were dooping snipers. At first I though that was dumb and stupid but I look now at it and see that hacking was everywhere. 80% off all infestation players are Hackers. So the zombie AI is rigged, no player is friendly, frame rate sucks, guns suck, hacker's always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥new spawns, constant kicking by fairfight, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev's like Artimes Knives. What else......Oh yeah...Everything you see in the screenshot's of this game on steam store is false. They also bring you in to spend alot of money on ingame GC. So never and I say NEVER reach for your wallet for this♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Looks like this is the end of my review...I let I:SS off easy on this one.....Thanks for reading...DONT GET GAME			"

												Usually, the Metascore of a game isn't accurate. I can say the same for this time aswell.The fact that this game has a 20 in the Metascore is giving the developers too much credit.This game was not even remotely worth the $1.49 it was on sale for. They should pay YOU to play this game. This game is garbage and a half. I would get into more detail, but after 30 minutes of this game, I can tell you that the AI might aswell had been by the developers of Big Rigs. The only reason this game was ever scraped together from Hammerpoint Interactive was to vampire off of the success of DayZ, and they did perfectly at just that. They made their game War Inc, except with different models and added zombies, they couldn't even make their own ToS. They deliberately took League of Legend's ToS and made it their own, just finding and replacing Riot's name to their own. The only thing this game and the developers did well, was steal the money of zombie game enthusiasts and bite the hand that feeds these low-life cretins.The load times and the amount of cheaters on the game are nothing compared to any other game I've played, including World at War on console.

												Ok, where to start. After all this hype and everything they promised us about this game ( I´m talking about Warz ) , I got it at release date and well...not even 40% of the content was avaible. Ok so after maaaany hours of gameplay I just couldnt stand it anymore so I stopped playing this game. After few month I saw that they upgraded the graphics and added new features so I wanted to give it a try again. And gues what, I install the game then I enter my profile information to login aaaaaaaanddd........Your account was banned due to susspicious activity....,.....   T_T So I send them an email ofcourse asking about why the ♥♥♥♥ the banned my account I wasnt even playing. And gues what,they didnt even bothered to answer me. I tried this few times and still with the same result.This company and this game is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The ripped me off and I saw on the internet that I am not the only one. Now they made another game with all the missing features from Infestation: Survivor stories but from what I saw Its EXACLY the same, they only added a new map and they want to make us pay again for that crap. ♥♥♥♥ YOU and good bye			"

												I was kicked for no reason 3 times in 1 hour! You dont have a binoculars making it very difficult to distinguish zombies for other players. And you are killed at sight for other players camping in the cities. Ho! almost forget, in this game the zombies run as fast as you, it is impossible to escape runing, and you wil die if anyone note you and you dont have a gun and lots of ammo, any weapon other than a gun is quite useless, it takes several zilion hits to kill a zombie, you have to wait 30 min. to play again if you die, and you die a lot in this game. the worst thing is the lack of cooperation between the players, camping all day in a building waiting for other players to pass, and kill every player for the sake of f@#% the game of someone is not my ideia of fun. separate areas for PvP would solve the problem, but the developers don't demonstrate interest in this ideia, and the game is PAY TO WIN.

												You know that feeling you get when you purchase a game, and it turns out to be one of the best decisions you've ever made. The combat is great, and the mechanics are cool, you play it with your friends; and you all laugh out loud ""HAHAHAHA"" and you say ""I'm so glad we bought this game!""This game is the opposite of that... This game is probably the worst thing to ever happen to anyone....EVER, literally it's like a really really really fat guy that walks onto the train you and your friends are on, and he sits right next to you, and he smiles at you, it's a bit disconcerting, but you smile back. And then you hear it, the loudest, longest fart you've ever heard, you try to ignore it  and put your shirt over your mouth. But it doesn't help, the smell penetrates your nostrils, and seeps into your eye sockets. Your eyes start to water and your heart starts beating out of your chest, you just have to get out of there. You look back to the man sitting beside you, He's just smiling at you, his grin penetrating you skin and burrowing into your soul. Your friends start to convulse, Issac your friend since early child hood, projectile vomits across the train carriage, you are now covered im vomit. you begin to cry, the man starts to laugh. the sound like a wet towel slapping against a tiled floor, tears streak down your face and in your mind you can't help but think to yourself.....why did i buy this terrible game			"

												Alright, I decided to review this after owning it for months now.  I know Steam says I only have roughly 1 hour played on this game, but I originally bought it from their website after it was released.  So, here's my review for 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' (Originally known as 'WarZ'). Performance : Most of my friends on Steam know that I have a superb gaming PC, which I bought for roughly $2,000. It's GPU (graphics processing unit) is amazing, and etc. Despite my PC's specs, I somehow average at roughly 15 frames per second on  low  settings. Did they create the game so it works better for specific graphics cards or something? If they did, that's really idiotic on the developer's part. Graphics : Personally, I don't judge a game by it's graphics... but there are some people out there who do. The game's graphics looks like a game out of 2008, and isn't detailed that well.  Combat & AI: The combat of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' has always given me a huge headache, even when I have a superb weapon. Whether I'm using a combat knife or an axe, I find it taking absolutely  forever  to kill one zombie... while hitting it's head. The combat is really buggy as well, from my experiences playing the game. The AI of the zombies is less than decent as well, but they're zombies... so it's not like they're  supposed  to be smart. Community : The community of the game is fairly nice, although there is one thing to be aware of before buying this game.  Do not trust anyone.  Usually that's the case for most zombie MMO's out there, but there are friendly people... right? Not in 'Infestation: Survival Stories'! Any player I've come across in this game has either killed me or attempted to kill me and died in the process. I'm sure there may be a few people playing a hero here and there, but none that I've come across so far. Another problem of this game is that  alot  of people hack in this game. So, if you're going to fight someone... it may not always be a fair fight. Servers : I personally haven't had many connection issues with the servers in 'Infestation: Survival Stories', but like most game there are a few connections issues here and there.  Although, you should expect to be banned on servers in this game... alot.  Even if you aren't doing anything, you could possibly get banned from the server you're playing on. I've been banned constantly off of servers for hacking when I've done nothing. Is this game 'P2W'? : When people say this game is P2W (pay to win), they are completely right. This game is extremely P2W, as you can buy almost any item from the game with real money, instead of finding it in the game. My overall rating of the game is 4/10.  It has it's moments, but it can be frustrating as all hell.So, this concludes my review of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' ('WarZ'). I hope you found this review helpful, and if you didn't, feel free to comment why! And lastly, thanks for reading my review. =)			"

												This game is amazing, I have never had something stir such hatred in me before, it looks like a sega genisis puked on my gfx card, when I run I look and feel like a robot.  if you want to play this game without paying just draw a buch of crap on some paper trust me it's a better frame rate.I ran forever just to reach a hill that was right in front of me, I guess thats the trick to make a small map feel big, I'll have to remind my girl of that tonight, just go really slow it won't feel good and will be really frustrating but it will feel bigger.remember folks if you get stuck you can always buy your way out, thats right spend your money on items, to be shot in the face and have them stolen. it's like being robbed in in the bank and the teller just stares blankly at you yelling ""next please""0/10 would rather stab forks in my eyeyes I know I only played 2 hours but thats all it took, I bought Dayz about 2-3 weeks after I finished those 2 hours and played 2 hours of that, now I've played 90+ hours of it (no I didn't play the mod I was playing FFXIV before that) before you rage I left this review because it's my honest opnion.

												I was kicked for no reason 3 times in 1 hour! You dont have a binoculars making it very difficult to distinguish zombies for other players. And you are killed at sight for other players camping in the cities. Ho! almost forget, in this game the zombies run as fast as you, it is impossible to escape runing, and you wil die if anyone note you and you dont have a gun and lots of ammo, any weapon other than a gun is quite useless, it takes several zilion hits to kill a zombie, you have to wait 30 min. to play again if you die, and you die a lot in this game. the worst thing is the lack of cooperation between the players, camping all day in a building waiting for other players to pass, and kill every player for the sake of f@#% the game of someone is not my ideia of fun. separate areas for PvP would solve the problem, but the developers don't demonstrate interest in this ideia, and the game is PAY TO WIN. RUN FROM THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥LIKE YOU ARE RUNNING FROM A ZOMBIE. CRAP GAME. Exist other games ( Good games) to invest your spare time.			"

												One of my Favorite games, I got this the first day it came out! Pure Nostalgia! 2 years past and it was still amazing! I have put more then 1000 hours (before it was on steam) and i have not regreted any second of it. Then, the hackers came in... The game was still playable but it was now descending quickly. Now it is at a point that each server you enter you will meet a hacker. If the Hackers were to be eliminated i believe this game could once again thrive.			"

												Okay.... Seriously, do not deal with this studio ever. Been ages ago, I've been playing this with my girlfriend and my bestfriend when we all got slaughtered by a hacker. Recently, there's a new game which is free for owners of this game and when I tried to log in this game : ""This account has been permanently banned by FairFight. Do not appeal, you won't receive a reply. See support."" and what support has to say ""You beleive your account is compromised. Account security is your responsibility."" I'm someone who uses password generator and is careful where he navigates, so I doubt the security breach is on my end.I did get account blocked on various games due to hackers, god knows how they get password (I don't even know them myself since they are random), and I've been able to gain back access. This is the first time I'm told ""Sucks to be you, thanks for your money.""I thought the game was OK, but chances are you'll get hacked and you'll get perma-ban too. So skip wasting 15$+ on this game.N.B. You might think it isn't that bad since it has mixed reviews. Read the positive, you'll  notice how peoples are jerks and flawed that ""Recommend"" system is.

												If you can pick up this game on sale for a dollar, it might be worth checking out, if you ever wanted to check out the 'zombie survival MMO experience' for cheap.(Better choice over Day-Z - along with the empty and broken promises of Day-Z devs - and H1Z1, which does not say much at all).Despite being likely the best zombie survival MMO to date, I'm going to recommend against this game, as it is plagued by lame cheaters (always has been) and the developers really do not care.Having said that, this game would be solid and damn good fun, if they only had some effective anti-cheat.* If you do decide to pick up this title *watch out for the Brazilians* and tread carfully.* Zombies are the least of your concern in a post apocalypic world where resources are limited.

												with over 300 hundred hours in this game I will go ahead and review it. I have been an avid supporter of this game taking up for it around every corner and telling everyone about all of the good things this game has to offer. Well listen people when I tell you that there are no good aspects to this game anymore. This game is a scam and buyer beware because if you do happen to purchase this game you better be on the look out for hackers in every server and the game devs around every corner. Also just know that when you are facing an enemy during a pvp battle that he has the chance to hit one key that takes him straight to the games marketplace where he can buy healing items or even armor while you engage in a shoot out. The game thrives on hackers because thats how they still make revenue.			"

												I wake up a foot or two above the ground. As I land, the world around me starts to become clear. Trees have taken over the world. I wander throughout the day with my flashlight on, until I come across what appears to be a large amount of zombies surrounding a random spot in the road where everyone has decided to park their cars and leave. I approach with caution. I run up and jump onto the back of a truck. That's when I find myself a delicious candy bar. I enjoy this sweet piece of tastiness. Then the zombies learn to climb. I bash their skulls in with my flashlight with ease. I pick up a rifle to pick off the rest. Little did I know, it had no bullets. Gun is useless. Zombies are now entirely surrounding me. I spend the next half hour breaking the heads of the zombies with my extremely durable flashlight until the coast is clear. I make a run for it. I find a farm, but unfortunately, it is filled with nothing but duct tape. I also found a glow stick, but alas, my small kindergarden backpack could not carry any more, as it was filled with tape. That's when I set out to find a home for the night. I search effortlessly, when I finally see a city. It is very close, I start to run. Suddenly, zombies start teleporting to my location. What do I do? Kill them with my flashlight. Oh no! My flashlight no longer hits where I tell it to! I swing but no matter how many times the light makes contact with the zombie, it continues to brush right through it! I am forced to run. I run to the city, finally safe. I find a revolver on the ground, good. Now I can survive better. Wait! No I can't! Sniped. My journey had ended. As I die, all of my duct tape falls out onto the ground. Then... Oh man... Then I was forced... To... Wait around 20 minutes. OR PAY TO REVIVE NOW! :DI recommend this game to anyone who loves crying and spending $20 on digital glow sticks!			"

												Myself and a few of my mates love this game...but we are forced to play on a private server cuz of the ridiculous PvP side of the 'game'.its a shame the PvP is such a massive asspect of a so called survival game that expects you to survive a ZOMBIE appocolyps, not an onslaught of 5 year old hackers with micro transaction fever and rucksacks full of ammo.... BTW, this mite be an old rant for some of you (if it is, dont troll a sarcy reply, youll just show how much of a nub you are) but i cant understand why a game with such huge potential cant give an option to be or not to be part of the mindelss PvP side. spawn...dead....another flashlight looted (awesome fun -_- ), i understand for some players thats all they can cope with...but if thats what their mental capacity wants, then why dont they go and kick some in Planet side 2 or something designed around full PvP. forcing it into a survival game and allowing sooo much of the game to be ignored, must be either be a brilliant idea building up to something gamechanging by the devs or else they realy dont give a damn and are just in it for the money from these gankers who micro trans shed loads of ammo (like i said earlier)....either way. GIVE US A CHANCE TO PLAY THE GAME BY OPTING OUT OF THE PVP is the main shout about this game.It is a good game, and a private server deffinatly pays of if PvP is not your thang. Does need alot of work still as a game. but stick with it. Im sure the Devs will listn to what the people want soon enough.And Hackers..those souless, friendless, idiotic mindless sad celler dwelling game wreking ♥♥♥♥♥s need to get out more and stop making other people suffer for their own insufferable empty lives.*takes a bow and thanks you all :)			"

												Hey I am Black Lotus from the WarZ forum (ISS) now Yes I have over 8500 post there. I was recent ip banned from forum now with my new find freedom. I can finally express my true thought without restriction. After a year of playing this game, I feel I would like to express my through for the game.First off I love this game. This game could be so much fun if the developer would actually listen to me. I truly wanted this game to success. I truly do love this game. I personally spend over 100 dollar in this game. I have brought over 6 accounts and I have no regret what so ever in buying this game. This is game can exciting and rage inducing game. This game has a high risk factor which can make or break you. I personally find that there are a lot good people who play this game. I also know some of them will can also stab you in the back. One of my most negative experiences was that I find out that the dev and mods were talk crap about other player. Yes some of the people in the community are annoying but it not needs to talk crap about them. The incident with Mad Max aka Striker Cade and a new developer Artemis knives is a fine example of this. I have heard of from a ex Moderator that the dev were talking negative thing about their playerbase and daily too. It a shame this company lack of professionism to it playerbase. I have keep silent about many incident. However now that I have nothing else left. I am going to say this. They clearly didn't expect for the game to do so well. The dev have no faith in it fanbase on it forum community. I even find out that both Kewk and Zombert have talk crap about me too. ( i know you read my personal PMs too) However my love for this game have kept me silent and I do wish this game to be as big as League of Legend or even DOTA. However the dev lack of respect and faith on their community will be it downfall.I have seen multiple their fans actually tired to help make this game better. However the direction of the developer of OP production was very misleading. They have promise multiple time they will fix the issue and many time they never even try to fix the problem. Look at unstable server continue disconnection from server. There are many bugs and buggy zombie. I understand you have a small team but it over a year. we have waited over for a year for stronghold. It nothing but a death arena. I have remain positive this whole time however I am not going to sit by and watch something I care about died with a fight . I even play legit all this time. I never even cheated once in this game and I will never cheat in this game. I have been kill so many time that by hacker and I stop caring about it. I have stop caring about them now as this is a never ending battle. Yeah the dev have step up their anti cheat. Yeah Fairfight is a good anti cheat system . However this undermine by the cheap account situation. i know dev you are in need of money. This revolving door policy is not good in the long run. I know they have HWID ip banned. I have seen it in action . It can be very effective however they do not use it. Yeah it a revolving door policy.I know it long but bear with me. Support I know support is nonexistence until this year . Yeah I have sent ticket too. None were answer until this year by a real person. They close all my ticket from last year and never solve any of them. However I admit support now is a alot better and there is no more automated closed response and it a good start from there. Yes if you hacked they know and they do check ip too. So you cannot send a ticket for your friend.I even got a warning point for reporting a duper who was c-mag and was streaming it too. Yes Kewk give a warning point and I never report a duper until he quited. I give public posting about them and warn you about them. I personally took that too heart. Do you know why now there is a black market and why you are losing money now. I have warned you that duper existed. They are even showing it the public and it so easy to find it too. You can hide on your forum but not the internet. This reward of new duping method for 1000000Gc is a joke and no one will report it now. You have made people in fear of report their finding. I personally know of only one method right now . However it not worth duping anymore. As sniper rifle were duped like it was in style and people have over 100 sniper in their legit account lockbox. I can say one thing was it worth silenting your loyal fanbase. The forum was a treasure of info. Even hacker announce their attack against you daliy. I have over 8500 post and I read the forum and never forget them. They would make spam site and hack login and many other thing. Almost half of the trader there was a hacker or is hacker. I know them by their name. I personally feel that you should bring back gc trading at least then you can make money from that. Instead of them using the black market. I have many thing I wish to tell you however I want to leave it one positive note. Dev and staff of OP Production this game is wonderful and it even could have been a great success However you just keep making the same mistake over and over again. I have tell you the flaw of them. If you choose to listen or don't. I personally hope do success but I believe your flaws will caught up to you. Love you lot Black Lotus			"

I played it from launch and If you like useless Devs that promise stuff and never do it, That love milking your money, changing there company name and doing the same again under a new banner and love playing games that the gameplay is so unbelievably boring, repetative and unplayable. This is the game for you!!!! If you like Zombie survival simulation, Good games, where the developers actualy care and provide for their customers, Spend a little more and get Dayz. Dayz is really good. Why am I reviewing this game.			"

												I had fun playing this game but I like to grind and survive. Don't trust the pictures where you see a  lot of people laying out zombies with rifles and such. Ammo, for guns, are weapon specific and incredibly rare and not worth using on zombies. You'll have better luck finding duplicate weapons and emptying it than you will finding a loose magazine.You will spend your first part of the game finding remote spawn points for food, water, and loot and server hopping to other almost empty servers to empty that same spot over and over.Then you'll spend time trying to not get killed by other people as you loot more dangerous areas(airport) where the somewhat good drops are and about 10 million zombies are found...Not a long term game to play, I wouldn't recommend it or expect a friend to play it with me.

												Great idea, TERRIBLE! execution.This game is truely terrible... It needs to be burned with fire asap.It is/was nothing more then a simple cash grab game... it came out over-hyped, didnt diliver what it promised (had alot of false advertisement, and was removed from steam twice lol).Its a terrible game cashing in on the ""zombie"" phase that everyone is on atm.I was an original backer of this game and played during early alpha testing, and back then they had an excuse to have a less then good game since its in alpha. It looked promosing.But not much has changed since alpha for the better...-Graphics are nothing to talk about. Looks like some crappy game from 2004 when on max settings.-Audio is terrible.-The physics/game engine is just poor...-Hackers/cheaters galore.-From what i hear, A LOT of legit players are being banned becuase of their crappy ban system (i think a 5yo can find a better way to stop cheaters... Want to know how they stop cheaters? they place items in areas which are impossible to get to, and if you pick up that item you get banned. But its so poorly done, that these items can be picked up through walls or the celing of building if u jump)-Terrible devs, terrible customer supportTo give you mroe insight on this company.I payed $25 for a game in aplha. It was released for $15 on release... (who knew aplha costs more then release!)On top of that, i literally had to fight for WEEKS to get a free copy of the steam version, since i wanted the game on steam...Trying to get a $10 refund was beating a dead horse though...To give you a little more information (btw the game used to be called WarZ)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation:_Survivor_Stories#Reception""In October 2012 executive producer Sergey Titov referred to spawn campers in The War Z as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" in a forum post""their PR team teird to cover for him and say, o he isnt against homosexuality... but he couldnt come out and say it >.>Remember that is the EXECUTIVE PRODUCER! not just some lowely low wage employee or forum mod or something...That would be like the CEO of walmart calling african americans the N word... how much would u respect them if they did something like that?....The list goes on, and im sure there is WAY more not being listed on this wiki.Also know ""PCPowerplay gave the game a zero (out of ten), the only zero in the magazine's history""the game is only $15, maybe less if on sale. ya its not much money, and im sure you may get a few dollars worth of cheap fun from the game.BUT i would NOT suggest supporting these kind of developers or companies with even a SINGLE PENNY!

Posted: March 18, 2014
												Damn.... where do I begin?I think ill start off by saying that this game has seen countless scandals, hacking controversies, and simply careless developers throughout it's development. When it had first came out, the devs thought that lying about the game and it's features would get it to sell better. It worked, but then people realised that said features never existed, and the devs were profiteering off of an unfinished game. As it stood in Alpha when this was going on, the game was barebones and was still clearly, very unfinished. Since then, there have been random account bans and hackers who broke through the game's coding and transaction info to get lists of players, along with their personal details. Although it got fixed, the damage had already been done. There was even a case where the game's original name, 'The WarZ', was changed because of copyright infringement issues with the upcoming film 'World War Z'. Hell, even people are seeing comments and reviews being deleted because they have noted the game's shortcomings!From that point on, Infestation has seen a lot of new features and patches, making the game that little bit more bearable. But it still isnt enough to stop armies of no-clippers and ESP users who ruin the game for everyone else. The game still isnt finished, and many bugs are still prominent, after being out for over a full year on Steam. Don't get me wrong, the game has seen times where it has been enjoyable to play, but then patches and such will fix a few bugs, but change other features, worsening the gameplay further. The micro-transactions are also ludicrous, and spending some cash really isnt going to make the game any more fun than it is.To summarise and emphasise my point, Infestation: Survivor Stories is a tale of what might have been. Had the producers taken more time to listen to their customers and never scammed them silly, it wouldn't be such a broken game. Personally I believe money is better spent on something else, and not this absolute pile of crap. 2/10.Edit : As of 15/12/16 (15th December, 2016) the servers for this game have been shut permanently. Those who still own the game seemingly won't be compensated for it, and a F2P version has been added to the Steam Store, known as Infestation - The NewZ. An incredibly underhanded move by the developers, the game is a few years old and many people bought it, only to face an early shutdown. The NewZ has a different development team but they've pushed the game in an entirely different direction - loot is extremely abundant and you can fully gear yourself within minutes of spawning. It puts a lot more emphasis on PVP instead of Survival, which may or may not be something you'll want. I've encountered no hackers within just short of 30 hrs of gameplay and the anti-cheat is different. If you are curious to try it feel free, there have been a lot of changes for the better.			"

												Game is no longer being developed.  They got sued and it's just like War Inc - abandoned.  The game had much potential, but the company was more interested in money grabbing from the very forgiving community.  There are many things that went wrong with this game.  #disappointmentThe Thai version of this game is free to play, but you'll need a VPN and a translating service to sign up for an account.  There are also free emulators maintained by devs who listen to their playerbase and give their respective playerbases what they want in the game.  However, these emulators may not be 'legal'.  Good luck.			"

												To be honest, I dont really know how it's possible for this game to be still alive.Yea I know I can found max. 200 players playing on official servers (In Europe) and that number tells something (players dont like it) - Why players and I dont like this game?1.) This game has anti-cheat? - WTF??? Where??? Turned off???2.) Marketplace - Yea I love to buy the game and after it just ""pay to win"" and spend more money like♥♥♥♥♥got3.) Zombies = Terminators - Smashing zombies with baseball bat 11times? (head and upper part) - How can they survive so long? -> Cause they're made of f*ckin steel man!!!4.) Houses interior - Yea  some empty houses with nothing (no chairs, table or some sh!t) - ???5.) Damage of some guns - I dont know but how the f*ck it is possible to shoot someone right into head and not kill (when he's/she's not wearing helmet)6.) Hackers - This game shouts ""Buy me to meet some hackers bro!"" (No thx I dont need to meet some hackers)7.) Bans - Looks like cheaters are getting banned in like 1year or some bigger delay8.) PTE servers - I like them for stuff farming but you know 99,99% hackers and 0.01% campers and noobs => anti-cheat POWA cant be found here9.) Many bugs, glitches and failed textures - Playing for 2 minutes on PTE server and I found 2+ failed textures and some other fails from developer side10.) Developers - developers say ""Everything we need from you is to give us your money and we wont care about game"" - Thats said from me cause they arent able to have solid anti-cheat, ban hackers faster, making stupid textures with no collision, they dont care about community.11.) PVP/PVE - please just make 1 ♥♥♥♥in PVE server for people who dont like spraying people with guns like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for flashlight...My reason why I play this game ""Cause Im laughing how terrible it is and how many cheaters, bugs, exploits, failed textures you can find and also dont forget ""There's no anti-cheat in-game"" (Or Im just blind and anti-cheat is invisible for my account)But still - just ""♥♥♥♥IN NOOOOOOOOO"" - if you want zombie game buy yourself something better (this game is not worth of 1 dollar or more - I got it for 50cents f*ck yea)			"

												So after 500 hours of playing this game.....For the first week it was awesome to play cause it was a new genre for me I really liked the game. Killing Zombies and stuff you know ^^? But later it is just very boring to play. You will find an easy way to kill Zombies(jumping on something). Everyone is trying to kill you. I loved farming in the world of COLORADO(map) but they added a SUPERZOMBIE which is very hard to kill and you just need more of your farmed ammo and weopens. It is PAY TO WIN. To many HACKERS.Weopenspread is♥♥♥♥♥♥...So pls COMMUNITY don't buy this game! It's not worth your money!			"

												This game was very fun for me for a while then i realized how many people actually do have hacks and esp's. The servers are not well kept and are filled with snipers with aimbots or speed hacks. There is not much to do except collect gear and run through the world and get mad ever time a hacker walks through the wall and kills you. Its only 5 dollars though so if you looking for a cheap way to get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off very quickly then ISS is the game for you. The only up side to all this NOTHING there is no upside. I have a good bit of time on this game and ton's of gear but still its really not all worth it even with a new map there is still nothing to do. The developers really need to get there Sh$$ togeather and fix the real problems before they add things into the game. The Devs are not very nice either. They are very money hungry they took the survival away from the game when they put an in game store into the mix. So if your a hacker or just have money to spare you can just gear up and get all the ammo and armor/meds that you want and never loose. My conclusion to all this ramble is if you want to get a cheap survival game for 5 bucks please please please dont buy this one i can assure you it is a huge waist of your time.			"

												The trailers make this game look amazing, however when you first spawn with just a torch for a weapon you'll soon realise that this is less all action and more of a game made to appeal to people who look through bins for a hobby.You'll see teamwork in the trailer, but the sad fact is you'll finally find a gun (most likely with no ammo) and before you even get a chance to fire off one shot, someone will stroll along and kill you.

												I had fun playing this game but I like to grind and survive. Don't trust the pictures where you see a  lot of people laying out zombies with rifles and such. Ammo, for guns, are weapon specific and incredibly rare and not worth using on zombies. You'll have better luck finding duplicate weapons and emptying it than you will finding a loose magazine.You will spend your first part of the game finding remote spawn points for food, water, and loot and server hopping to other almost empty servers to empty that same spot over and over.Then you'll spend time trying to not get killed by other people as you loot more dangerous areas(airport) where the somewhat good drops are and about 10 million zombies are found...Not a long term game to play, I wouldn't recommend it or expect a friend to play it with me.

												Great idea, TERRIBLE! execution.This game is truely terrible... It needs to be burned with fire asap.It is/was nothing more then a simple cash grab game... it came out over-hyped, didnt diliver what it promised (had alot of false advertisement, and was removed from steam twice lol).Its a terrible game cashing in on the ""zombie"" phase that everyone is on atm.I was an original backer of this game and played during early alpha testing, and back then they had an excuse to have a less then good game since its in alpha. It looked promosing.But not much has changed since alpha for the better...-Graphics are nothing to talk about. Looks like some crappy game from 2004 when on max settings.-Audio is terrible.-The physics/game engine is just poor...-Hackers/cheaters galore.-From what i hear, A LOT of legit players are being banned becuase of their crappy ban system (i think a 5yo can find a better way to stop cheaters... Want to know how they stop cheaters? they place items in areas which are impossible to get to, and if you pick up that item you get banned. But its so poorly done, that these items can be picked up through walls or the celing of building if u jump)-Terrible devs, terrible customer supportTo give you mroe insight on this company.I payed $25 for a game in aplha. It was released for $15 on release... (who knew aplha costs more then release!)On top of that, i literally had to fight for WEEKS to get a free copy of the steam version, since i wanted the game on steam...Trying to get a $10 refund was beating a dead horse though...To give you a little more information (btw the game used to be called WarZ)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation:_Survivor_Stories#Reception""In October 2012 executive producer Sergey Titov referred to spawn campers in The War Z as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" in a forum post""their PR team teird to cover for him and say, o he isnt against homosexuality... but he couldnt come out and say it >.>Remember that is the EXECUTIVE PRODUCER! not just some lowely low wage employee or forum mod or something...That would be like the CEO of walmart calling african americans the N word... how much would u respect them if they did something like that?....The list goes on, and im sure there is WAY more not being listed on this wiki.Also know ""PCPowerplay gave the game a zero (out of ten), the only zero in the magazine's history""the game is only $15, maybe less if on sale. ya its not much money, and im sure you may get a few dollars worth of cheap fun from the game.BUT i would NOT suggest supporting these kind of developers or companies with even a SINGLE PENNY!

												Terrible.  A string of broken promises from the developer.  Small map.  Micro transaction. Questionable vehicle physics.  Zombies respawn behind you minutes after you kill them. I didn't realize this was War Z when my friends convinced me to buy it (impulse).  I feel dirty for accidentally supporting this developer.			"

												This game.. I really have no words to explain.. I'm speechless on how to explain this game so I'll just let it out.1. Ban Waves are terrible.. had to pay for the game about 3 other times and permanetly banned my other accounts when they weren't even hacking. 2. They use an Automated Support System.3. They use an Automated Ban system which triggers if you go higher then the values they have set, Example - You snipe someone at 400 Meters but the Value is 350.. You're flagged.4. Constant deaths.. TO many hackers.5. Pay to win game, You can pay to get weapons you can pay to revive your character after death and you can pay for some of the rare things that take hours to find.- Overall..♥♥♥♥♥♥game. They just want your ♥♥♥♥ing money they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about you. "

												Infestation: Survivor Stories, previous name WarZ. Because the new film ""World War Z"", the game must rename, so I:SS Is new name, but is same bulls*it like WarZ. Let me tell you why not buy this game.Gameplay:You are going to spawn somewhere, u got few choices, random spawn points, but its only few of them... Some town, mostly PvP town, some forest or near the safe zone.You are going to loot something, like towns, military bases and more. But u got enemies! 1.) Retar*ed zombies and retar*ed players.Players in this game.... thats a worst community in games history! If u play DayZ, u will see reality of apocalypse, helping each other, making a new friends, not like in I:SS.... u will meet someone, *bam* u are dead.... Zombies.. #hahaha      -► Zombies are so retar*ed, if u are in the house, they will searching for the main entrance of the building for over then 10 mins! My score - 2/10 - Very, VERY BAD GAMEPositives/negatives+Positive:If u are playing the zombie game for the 1st time, u like Deathmatches, this game is for you.Not bad items, in game its lot of items, some cool stuff!-Negative:- Retar*ed Zombies- retar*ed players- Pay 2 win!!!- PVP, no communication- Kill on sight- Graphic - Gameplay- Combat system- Updates of the game... they are almost more retartded then the zombies in the game!- It cost 13 Euro! !WARNING!

												First off, the makers of this monster should be tortured and kept alive for the rest of their lives. If I had to compare how bad this game is to an everyday occurence, i'd compare it to waking up to have your divorced wife cutting off your♥♥♥♥♥♥with a pair of safety scissors. Then, taking all of your money and house then ♥♥♥♥ing a new man in your bed and turning your own children on you. After that, you get in your car. You realize your tires have been stolen and a blackman is in the back seat. He force ♥♥♥♥s you and then breaks your legs. After he gives you aids and breaks your jaw, he leaves allowing you to change your tires and go to work. When you get to work there are jewish men standing there with their big noses and paper work. They then ask you if you are you and you say yes. Your boss walks out and slugs you in the face and twists your nipples and rips them off. You scream in agony as you fall to the floor as all of the jews whip out their♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and beat you with them until your cheek bones are shattered and you're deaf in one ear. Your boss then fires you and tortures you for the rest of the day. After all of this you get home, go upstairs, get on your computer and see that your new game has finished downloading. You say to yourself, atleast I can still play this new game called ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"". and ""What could be worse?""			"

I was absolutely wrong. Or better yet, i wasn't, the game's wrong. Awful animations, zombies killing you from 5 meters, 60 mins to respawn your character after dying. Funny is they offer buying stuff with real currency, who would want that... Even if you buy everything to make your way easier, some PVP maggot kills you on sight, GR8!

												Complete garbage,  CONSTANT crashing/bugs, incompentant developers and with the chance of this game causing your ENTIRE system to crash...STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS. It was a waste of money at launch (when it was called WAR Z) and it's a waste of money now. Pretty sure this ""recommendation"" will be deleted by the devs at somepoint but still. Avoid this like the plague...or an infestation...A few months after writing this warning, my account has been permanently banned. I checked both of my emails and found no explaination from the developers as to why this has transpired. I can only assume this is because they saw my warning and ""punished"" me for attempting to save people from the tragedy that is this game. If you see this, please warn your friends and tell them to tell their friends. This game should not be allowed on steam.			"

												My wife and I have spend hours on this game, several hundred dollars only to be let down over and over. This game has the potential to be so much more but with poor management this game has sunk beyond what any words could really say. The pvp aspect of the game sucks because you might end up being ganked and drop all of your hard earned gear yet at the same time if you want a PVE area you end up having to pay an outrageous price for the ""Private"" server of theirs then that fully kills the entire MMO part of the game. Seems to me they could do as many MMO's have done and made a pvp system where the game has spots that are contested or something or have PVE servers that allow you to enjoy the game. I am now holding off on putting any more life into this game and waiting on H1Z1 from Sony. ISS had great potential yet they let it fail....			"

Cons:1.) They lie on the recomended system requirements, I run a machine slightly better than those and no, 1-5 FPS is not acceptable2.) The options menu is absolutly terrible, Terraria has a better options menu and It's a 2D sidescroller3.) The zombies are ridiculously overpowered, they run faster, they do insane amounts of damage and infect you, and unless you have quite a bit of money on you, you have to pay to cure your character4.) I paid for the title and now you want me to go ""Premium"" for no extra content, only free weapons and lower teir currency... money grabbing slimeballs5.) The game's absolutly full of hackers, I mean, ridiculously full of hackers.6.) The doesn't allow you to customize a render distance7.) The game boasts features it doesn't even have yet8.)

Though, I wouldn't waste your money on this game for anything in game. Once you die -- poof, all the equipment you bought? Gone. Being looted.

Seems to me they could do as many MMO's have done and made a pvp system where the game has spots that are contested or something or have PVE servers that allow you to enjoy the game. I am now holding off on putting any more life into this game and waiting on H1Z1 from Sony. ISS had great potential yet they let it fail....			"

												The WarZ or... ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" (Renamed because WarZ are infamous for some of the stupid and wrong things they have done so they're tricking you by changing the title.)I picked it up for a buck, still not worth it. The devs for this game are just downright sickening in their treatment of players, they have thretened to blacklist their credit cards, they have thretened lawsuits against people who critisized the game, they're pathedic and I feel terrible for supporting them, even if it is just with one dollar, but that's another dollar that's lining these greedy, lying scumbags' pockets. Cons:1.) They lie on the recomended system requirements, I run a machine slightly better than those and no, 1-5 FPS is not acceptable2.) The options menu is absolutly terrible, Terraria has a better options menu and It's a 2D sidescroller3.) The zombies are ridiculously overpowered, they run faster, they do insane amounts of damage and infect you, and unless you have quite a bit of money on you, you have to pay to cure your character4.) I paid for the title and now you want me to go ""Premium"" for no extra content, only free weapons and lower teir currency... money grabbing slimeballs5.) The game's absolutly full of hackers, I mean, ridiculously full of hackers.6.) The doesn't allow you to customize a render distance7.) The game boasts features it doesn't even have yet8.) The game changed their name to ""infestation: survivor stories"" But the devs were too lazy to rename the gamefiles so it's listed as ""The War Z"" 9.) Instead of giving us a large map they gave us a decant sized map and made the player slow as all hell, lazy, lazy devs.Pros:1.) They have quite a few resolutions however, if you have one of the larger moniters (IE that 2000x???? resolution) You're fresh out of luck.2.) When it isn't spazzing out, flickering, clipping through objects and dropping your framerate to downright ridiculous numbers some of the effects look like a moderately pretty PS2 title... (oh that's not what they were going for?)3.)...That's about it... yea, To wrap it up:The devs are corrupt, sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and don't get me wrong, I usually have the upmost respect for the devs however this? No... Your title is unfit for purpose, this game is a scam, they lie about quite a few features of the game, most of those aren't even implimented while others are just downright broken when they are in, the gameplay is tedious and frustrating and it's just a downright terrible title. Save yourselves the trouble and go buy the Arma II collection or the DayZ standalone if you're looking for a zombie survival horror post apocalyptic-y game. This is not worth your time and certainly not worth mine.			"

												Wow, dont you hate this game? I'm so glad that I only paid 1.99 dollars....I wouldn't invest in this game, based on so many things. I know after reading the reviews I should not have bought it. I mean first time playing, hit by a zombie like maybe 3 time at night, and I was dead. Then I thought well let me just jump back in I won't make the same mistake. Oh you can get back in... about 8 minutes or pay to revive him. EIGHT FRIGGEN MINUTES!?!?! WTF IS THAT? Ok now I get back in, I decided that I would find at least a melee weapon, and I find a barn, run inside, find a golf club, grab it, and three zombies from all the open doors corner me. I killed two trying to get out, and as I exit , one zombie kills me with one swipe. Do you think I wait for another eight minutes....F*#@k no!!Come on guys(developers) are you sure this was your goal to create a game? I think this is a make the money off as many gamers as possible and run (abandon) it. I feel like I've been lied to. This is not even an early release..this is a rip off!!!!!!!Do not waste one single penny!!!!!!!!! Its worthless..worst game I've ever played. I repeat DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY AWAY TO PEOPLE THAT NO NOTHING ABOUT GAMING!!			"

												I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale for $3.74 and to be honest that was the worst waste of money in my life. This game is really horrid. They try to make fixes but don't fix the main issues. They charge real money to get ammo or anything of the sort. Sure some stuff is easy enough to obtain if you don't get randomly skull crushed by a flash light. The only good thing that I thought this game did was they actually made the zombies slow. That was it! The controls are clunky the weapon collsion with the zombies is horrible. I mean when I hit a zombie with a hammer or with a boat oar their head should♥♥♥♥♥♥back a little. Personally the Walking Dead Survival Instinct is a better game than this one. Their both garbage, but at least the WD has a little bit of a story and the controls are slightly better. Really this game should just be a free to play; then maybe they could get more customers and make improvements.			"

It was ♥♥♥♥ING BORING AS HELL.You lure around for hours and hours to find decent stuff but all u can find is like the same♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time.Bottles of water and some snacks to eat and that's it . Ammunition was so rare at this time that pvp wasn't possible to do if u don't get some out of the cash shop (never used it tho)Went pretty mad that I bought this game and stopped playing it forever.I highly recommend that u start thinking about killing yourself if u really think about buying this game.0/10 this game sucks hairy balls.BTW since the day I played with this friend this game .

So now the servers cost as much if not more as an EA sever. And its a hackers paradise. If you were looking at buying this game do yourself a favor and buy something else. It is not worth the rage of getting killed over and over by peopel who ""pay to play/pay to win"". If you dont believe me read the forums on this game. It is sad how bad this game is now.

												I can honestly say that I've spent enough time with this game to know that this was definitley some straight up BS. I was there when they called this game a cash grab. I was there when the hacking started. For a while, I defended this game hoping it would get better with time. NOPE. Not only did this steamy pile get worse, but the Devs never showed any kind of concern or attempts to even try to correct any of the the issues that made this game THE WORSE game that I have ever played in my entire life. The only reason I got up to over 100 hours in this game was because I had a few buddies to help me ""make"" it fun. Youll have more fun playing tetris with no fingers. The zombies were horrible and bugged tf out, the map (s) horrible and bugged tf out. I remember a few times I died because I walked down a mountain the wrong angle. Didnt fall, just died out of nowhere. Had a couple of ok shootouts but those only happend once every blue moon. All the other times were aimbotters. You know who won those fights. People that can see you from half way across the map and probably further just lock on to. I just dont even understand how this game is still allowed on Steam at all. I remeber when it was taken off but how tf did it get back? I would rather see Pong take its place on here. Not even an updated version the original one witha square ball and all.This game should have been canned when the head dev fled the some what failed project. I say somewhat because atleast he got away with a lot of peoples money. The only thing I can say positive about this game is that its 4.99. I feel thats even too much for this. If you're truly considering buying this. Wait until it goes free to play. I can no longer play it and not even by choice. I was also one of the many hopeful suckers who purchased the early access, so that should tell you something. I feel like this sorry excuse for a game was made by my local drug dealers in crack house with an IBM running Windows 90 or something. Dont waist you money on this...youll be happy you didnt. Even if your curious like me and decide to purchase it anyway atleast your not buying it for the original price///			"

Why would you even play this when there is an amazing game called 'DayZ' which is 100% better than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game. To be honest, I wouldn't even call this a game, because it is truly pathetic. It gave me motion sickness as I could not change head bobbing which is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.

												Infestation, better known as WarZ was from my point of view, a really good game, but once they started to create new maps and patches, the game started to go towards its end. Hackers are a huge problem in this game, but if you can get your copy of the game cheap, then you should play it with time, and explore the whole map.			"

												Wow, dont you hate this game? I'm so glad that I only paid 1.99 dollars....I wouldn't invest in this game, based on so many things. I know after reading the reviews I should not have bought it. I mean first time playing, hit by a zombie like maybe 3 time at night, and I was dead. Then I thought well let me just jump back in I won't make the same mistake. Oh you can get back in... about 8 minutes or pay to revive him. EIGHT FRIGGEN MINUTES!?!?! WTF IS THAT? Ok now I get back in, I decided that I would find at least a melee weapon, and I find a barn, run inside, find a golf club, grab it, and three zombies from all the open doors corner me. I killed two trying to get out, and as I exit , one zombie kills me with one swipe. Do you think I wait for another eight minutes....F*#@k no!!Come on guys(developers) are you sure this was your goal to create a game? I think this is a make the money off as many gamers as possible and run (abandon) it. I feel like I've been lied to. This is not even an early release..this is a rip off!!!!!!!Do not waste one single penny!!!!!!!!! Its worthless..worst game I've ever played.

												I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale for $3.74 and to be honest that was the worst waste of money in my life. This game is really horrid. They try to make fixes but don't fix the main issues. They charge real money to get ammo or anything of the sort. Sure some stuff is easy enough to obtain if you don't get randomly skull crushed by a flash light. The only good thing that I thought this game did was they actually made the zombies slow. That was it! The controls are clunky the weapon collsion with the zombies is horrible. I mean when I hit a zombie with a hammer or with a boat oar their head should♥♥♥♥♥♥back a little. Personally the Walking Dead Survival Instinct is a better game than this one. Their both garbage, but at least the WD has a little bit of a story and the controls are slightly better. Really this game should just be a free to play; then maybe they could get more customers and make improvements.			"

												Edit: On a serious note..Stay the hell away from this game, it's horrible. Let me explain.You spawn. You spawn in the middle of nowhere. You run with a flashlight, finally, you found a place. Bam! Headshot. Dead. That was it. Wait 20 minutes to respawn or pay to revive now. So you end up having to make a new survivor if you want to continue (There's 5 slots).Hackers everywhere. Game looks bad. Freezes alot. I wish I could get a refund on this garbage, but I can't. Don't get it at any discount, just stay away from it. Worst game I have /ever/ played.Words cannot describe how terrible this game is. How awful it is. You might be so tempted just by looking at it at first sight, then the price of a 1$. Well don't. Just please, don't.

You have to pay if you want to be able to survive agaisnt bandits, as the best guns are very rare in the game and must be bought through the store. Also, the zombies are only there to annoy players. The real danger are your fellow players, which usualy kill you immediately, thus causing you to lose all your loot that you spend real money on.I can see why it has a metascore of 20, and why it was pulled from steam 2 times.

												Could be a brilliant game, however devs seem more interested in milking money and deceiving the community instead of fixing game breaking bugs. Servers are terribly unreliable, and you may get disconnected (and killed by zombies while waiting to get back into the game) at random.The only infestation in this game is from hackers, and this has been amplified by the removal of punkbuster (and unbanning) of tens of thousands of previously banned accounts, who are now able to download free cheats and exploit the game.

												Don't bother wasting your time. I literally bought this game just so show support for an up and coming developer. Bought it, installed it, ran it to go through all the settings (wanted to make sure I can get this running at 5760 x 1080 normally)...... didn't get around to actually trying to get into a game for a few weeks. When I finally got the time to play it, I log into my account and it tells me my account has been banned. I emailed the developer to inquire as to why, and the response I got was appalling. It said my account was caught using hacks, and/or third party software while playing, and that the decision to ban my account was final and not reversible.With ZERO MINUTES OF ACTUALLY GAMEPLAY!			"

They charge you for EVERYTHING, you can even buy some things with the money you get for free, but it takes a life time to gather money to buy anything. This is not even close to finished. And the worst part is: If you spend real money buying items and you die.. The item just dissapears. No story, no soundtrack, just a LOT of bugs, crashes, lags and god damn hackers. DO NOT BUY IT!

Good concept.Cons:1. Really crappy developers that does what THEY think is best for the game, not listening to the community at all.2. Low resolution graphics, pixels are showing really well at most points.3. The ambient sounds are the worst I've ever heard, mostly annoying and adds nothing to the game.4. The game is FILLED with hackers. (Better now than before)Conclusion: Bad game overall, pretty much everything is useless, except for the PVP, which is fun at times but has alot of flaws aswell.

												Infestation: Survivor Stories is a good game for 30 minutes then it becomes a bad looking game ! The textures off most objects are smudged/blurred. This feels like a cheap, low budget, copy of DayZ.There are 1st and 3rd person views. The zombies are fast and it is nearly impossible to run away from, they can take you out in 2-3 hits, then you die, which then makes you have to wait a long time for your player to respawn.There are players who play this game and will always win in fights unless you have the right equipment.The game is alot of money and is best to get when on a deal.

												This game makes my balls shoot back into my body. I bought this game during the giant ""Open World Zombie Survival"" hype but this game has proven many things to me. If zombies are real, they have the ability to walk faster then a human being running at 20 miles per hour. Cars don't even exist. Guns are more common then food and water. Zombies are god and can fly to you and kill you by giving you 3 love taps. Did I mention that the game uses the Crisis Engine? No thats cause it doesnt. The graphics look like a small 3 year old threw up on his/her's finger painting. Oh and walking on non-steep hills killed you before it was patched. Also the devs are the biggest liars about the games content.Also the head creator of this game made the worst game known to man. Big Rigs.0.1/10  (Hey atleast they took art from The Walking Dead)PSI think this is the second son of Bad Rats			"

Forget the screenies and everything, it's nothing like that. it does look as the graphics imply, but the experience, the long term players and the mechanics; it all sucks. I've got nothing positive about this game to report. It's just a we ""want your money and we don't give a damn'about hackers"" experience. Stay away from this and play something like ""7 Days to Die"" or ""Project Zomboid"".			"

Zombies are there just like trees and rocks and don't matter much to all the KOS (kill on sight) players. There are no PVE servers nor is there anyway to turn off PVP. There is zero ability to play this cooperatively with you friends in order to survive in a persistent world (aka no RPG, PVE).			"

												I will keep this review brief, though i feel for this game it is a public service that needs to be done. Stay away from this game, you dont want it. Most people are aware of the terribly scammy practices Hammerpoint Interactive has engaged in, but for everyone one who knows there may very well be 100 who dont know.So, i'm gonna just run down the list in no particular order: Dedicated servers were promised, and that promise was not delivered upon. Enforcement of game rules and punishment of cheaters was also promised, yet there are plenty of people who use wallhacks/ aimbot (and I'm far from trigger-happy when it comes to accusing people of such things, because I fully realize that there are people who are better than me at videogames).A significantly larger amount of player slots per server was promised, compared to the less-than-128player-servers we currently have.And the real big one that grinds my gears? The game was originally advertised as being totally free to play with the purchasable items being cosmetic. this is something that they refuse to enact in practice, as you can buy all sorts of spiffy backpacks, guns, and blades (rentals too, of course) and some of these weapons can never be found in game, as well as being vastly stronger than their non cash-shop weapons.in short, a scam by any other name is still a scam.

												There are no ordinary zombies... Instead of throwing themselves at you with tooth and claw, these mean sum'♥♥♥♥♥es fly into an epilectic fit of rage and use their telekinetic mastery to end you without even touching.There are no ordinary players... Instead of A-holes holding you up or killing you for your goods, many of these guys don only the finest invisibilty cloaks, making nothing but their backpack and flashlight visible before beating you mercilessly with it (The torch, not the backpack. I think). These are no ordinary micro-transactions... Instead of being the alternative of infinite-houred grinding, the MT's make you pay for pointless misc's that you'll use or lose within moments (Ah, Capitalism).These are no ordinary physics... Instead of fall damage happening after large drops, or being able to climb up onto cars for protection, or... just... just ♥♥♥♥ all that. Die from jumping down a stair, let the telekinetic zombies just kill you through anything, just anything that makes things more frustrating.WarZ (Oops, sorry Dev's), all jokes aside, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.

I had a lot of fun with one aspect, I really love the looting system in this game. I love walking around the town in ISS and look hours to find a rare item and hoard lots of items.

So thank you for making me waste my money on this game and I hope your wife leaves you, then you get deppressed and kill yourself by drinking draino!

												So, I do not understand this game, I have no clue why it exists, if I could at least play the game it would be great! However I cannot run it because I get the terrain 3 error and yet games like DayZ standalone run smoothly on my PC and yet this game says my GPU does not support terrain 3. After looking on the internet many people had the same problem but its not been fixed, and before I could run it on a much worse rig! How is this even possible that the devs are so useless? (excluding a few).Please this game hd potential but it was ruined by the in game shop where you can buy ammo and food and all other stuff, this defeats the whole point of this being a survival game!

												This game was always bad in general, badly optimised, cheaters and updates once every half a year. The game has new developers now, I played for about a week and the updates are small and almost non-existent after research on the games' main website. I had a lot of fun with one aspect, I really love the looting system in this game. I love walking around the town in ISS and look hours to find a rare item and hoard lots of items. This is only reason I played this game over 1k of hours.			"

												I brought Infestation: Survival Stories back when it was known as The Warz i got the pleasure of taking part in the alpha stage of the game which was freaking awesome there was always that surprise of coming across another player and having the choice of if you should partner up or take him/her down and scavange for the loot they drop but as time went on the game suddenly started to loose its way due to the fact that theres still only 2 maps and even with the Fairfight Anti-Hack System theres still tons and i mean TONS of hackers still in this game using aimbots and esp which takes all the fun out of this game pretty much 90% of this game has hackers on every server and even if they get banned they just buy a new account as the price of the game is dirt cheap. Pros+ Hours Spent Playing+ Zombies+ PVP+ Clans / Groups+ Map SizesCons- Anti Hack System (Need a Better One)- Aimbot & ESP- No New Maps- Devs Shouldnt Have Left Alpha EarlyOverall Score: 2 / 10			"

They said during the next two weeks (November 2012) there would be cars, strongholds, etc - but what they really meant is '...in a years time we will add so and so'.Avoid this game.

Instead of A-holes holding you up or killing you for your goods, many of these guys don only the finest invisibilty cloaks, making nothing but their backpack and flashlight visible before beating you mercilessly with it (The torch, not the backpack. I think). These are no ordinary micro-transactions... Instead of being the alternative of infinite-houred grinding, the MT's make you pay for pointless misc's that you'll use or lose within moments (Ah, Capitalism).These are no ordinary physics... Instead of fall damage happening after large drops, or being able to climb up onto cars for protection, or... just... just ♥♥♥♥ all that. Die from jumping down a stair, let the telekinetic zombies just kill you through anything, just anything that makes things more frustrating.WarZ (Oops, sorry Dev's), all jokes aside, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.

Why?- crappy servers with laggs- crappy gameplay (if you are looking for zombie survival game then turn around and run away- this is a PVP game- there are no friends, zombies are the weakest enemy- the real enemy is EVERYONE controlled by humans)- constant FairFight/Punkbuster kicks out of the game (i don't use any modifications/hacks/whatnot)- laggs which kill you and make you loose all your items- 60 minutes death penalty (you can pay real $$ to remedy this.... sic!)- if you are looking for a definition of ""money grabbing devs"" look no further- Devs of this game are the masters in this (to the point of making the (not a free game) game unplayable without real money microtransactions.what else.... oh yeah- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.BTW, I believe this is the first and only game i haven't found any +++, just ---.Ooooh, it has zombies... there you go, one + in the whole game.

												I bought this game with high expectations, from the cool screenshots and trailer, little did I know that those were all taken in high settings. I play on an average computer on medium settings and still this game looked no way closer to those pictures on the market... Every single time you spawn in you get rekt by the zombies or get spawn killed because the spawns are terrible. If you are reading this review to see if you should buy this I tell you HELL NO YOU SHOULDN'T GET THIS GAME!! It is so terrible that you should probably lick a cactus, if you have bought this game please gauge your eyes  out because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics. I'm almost positive that the most fun part of this game is watching it be refunded because it is terrible on so many levels. The community is filled with little 3 year-old fanboys that think this is the best thing since sliced bread. I recommend that no one should get this game EVER, but what I do recommend doing over playing this COMPLETE AND UTTER♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME is rubbing your balls against a cactus...			"

												This game is terrible. I spent 30 dollars on it originally and now it's only 15. But I guess understandable because I cannot even get into a server for 3 seconds anymore without the game booting me. So many bugs and I've found myself more frustrated with it than enjoying the experience. DO NOT buy this game. There are so many other zombie survival games that are 1000x more enjoyable			"

												Absolute garbage. I can't believe I believed my friends when they picked this up. Glitchy, poor animations, and much slower and incomplete than DayZ. Zombies are difficult to kill, and not because of their abilities, amount of health, or movement - but because of poor hit detection, hit radius, and other aspects that were poorly programmed (The animations and hit registration don't match up aesthetically) You clip on objects that you shouldn't clip on, and don't clip through things you would think would stop you. Don't waste your money, even if it's $2.67. Edit: Furthermore, I recently went back to try and give it a second chance, since I had already given the developer my money, and found out that I was permabanned for this comment. Now they have my money and have technically robbed me of the experience (or lack-there-of) that I paid for.They've refused to respond to my tickets. Spiteful, poor development, etc. I honestly don't wish negative things on people or businesses often, but their product and business practices have convinced me that these people don't deserve jobs in product development and I hope reading this will deter as many purchasers as possible to prevent this developer from getting any further. They already believe they're immune to proper practices, clearly, and if they gather enough money they'll just be in the position they want to be in: too big to fail. Vote with your money, and put your vote somewhere that it will count (Which is definitely not in infestation survivor stories)			"

Posted: December 6, 2013
												So I had put off buying this game due to all the horrible reviews, metacritic rating, and the fact the developers basically p*ssed all over loyal players/paying supports of previous games(War Inc) but I desided to give it a shot anyway since it was on sale for $3. Let me start by saying most of the horrible reviews are true.-Graphics?Low quality and poorly optimzied. That means it's not super pretty but still runs slowly.-Sound?Your own SFX(footsteps, splashing,etc..) are way too loud if you have SFX set to a level so they actually help you detect threats. Sound also doesn't seem to be optimized properlly. Locating something by sound is hit or miss.-World?The map is very large. With lots of locations to explore. It would probably take near an hour to walk from one corner to the other. That's great but it can be VERY inconvient is there is no quick travel or selective spawning. But ultimatly there is still only one map. There also aren't that many building models and you will see things reused a lot.-GamePlayExploring, avoiding zombies, collecting supplies. All fun. Ranged combat is fairly tuned as it was ported directly from War Inc. Melee combat is horribly simple and poorly done on top. Zombie AI is horrible. They get stuck. Can't climb anything over 2ft.-Community?The game has a fairly large community that usually fills a couple of the 100 player servers constantly with lots of smaller servers as well. However, the majority of those players have a kill on sight attitude. Youre not likely to make many friends you didn't bring with you.-Grouping?There is a basic group system which allows group chat and disables ""friendly fire."" There is no easy way to simply join and play with your friends. Due to the prementioned huge map and random spawning it's very likely that you will join a server and be near the people you actually want ro play with.-Pay to Win?Yes. The game is Buy to Play and Pay to Win. Supplies(food, water,bullets) are not easy to come by in game but for a couple of dollars you can easily stock up on what would other wise take several hours to gather if youre lucky.-Fun?Strange but Yes. The game is FAR from polished but if the stars align and you manage to meet up with your friend(s) on an low-medium populated server there is much fun to be had from the sandbox elements combined with lite PvP. -Recommend?I would recommend buying this game. On sale. Don't spend over $5. Sure it can be fun but it's the type of fun you would expect from a low budget indie game, which Infestation is not. There are just to many things wrong and the developers can not be trusted to give the game longevity or proper support(see War Inc.)			"

												This game after buying does a terrible job at trying to be something it isn't. I never have written a negative review before but this is a first. The mechanics themselves seem shoddy, appearences are bad, and the overall system is much to be desired. Respawn times on death (1 hr apart) and a microshop that promotes using it to survive make things only worse.			"

But the incompetence of the makers, or the lack of interest, leaves us an mediocre game, that has much PVP action, very little PVE (if at all), alot of bugs, a falty game mechanics to rage at and a reason to wish, that there would be a better zombie survival game someday.Nevertheless, the game gives a mild entertainment and can be enjoyable, when your playing it with your friends in a low population server.

												Ehmmmmmmm. How about just NO. I have spend about 2.5 hours just trying to connect to any server to play. After that i actually got in a server and played about 20 mins. First of all Im in Europe but the game decides I should connect to a US server in quick join. After I spawn in, I ran around in the woods for about 5 mins but there was not 1 zombie to be seen. As far as my experience goes, zombies are only in the towns. As I ran into a town, I encountered a zombie. The only thing they start you with is a flashlight and some food and banage. I spend about 2-3 mins punching the same zombie just to kill it. I have picked up a gun and tried to use it. There was no animation what so ever when you shoot it, it only bounds your screen up a little. This is the point when i decided to quit the game and say...... just NO. I would recommend staying as far away from this game as possible. But if you looking for the worst game I strongly recommend this.			"

												I played this before it came to steam and then a little after it released to steam. I CAN NOT recommend this game to anyone. I payed 20 bucks for their ""pioneer"" pack back when they were still in beta. I would suggest you stay away from this game and/or anything this company/developers make. The whole things feels like a cash grab. I was banned early on during the beta for no reason, I was using a tree for cover when someone killed me and said I was cheating.... I was banned shortly after. either way, there are MUCH better survivals out with DayZ and all the others that came out in 2016.To my knowledge no other survival game charges you to revive so you can play again after you die. I completely understand the microtransactions for cosmetics but if you're going to charge me to play after I died... no thanks.. feels like something from a mobile game (pay for energy to continue playing)just spend your money on something else, there are plenty of other survivals that are MUCH better			"

												Best experience ever! I approached the supermarket, starving and willing to devour any scrap leftover. I noticed a granola bar, and I became filled with joy and relief. Suddenly, a floating construction hat came into view at the end of the aisle. I stared, wondering if I was going insane, or if my hunger was really this bad. The strange emptiness was holding something, a flashlight. It approached me, raised the flashlight, and brought it down on my head with titan- force, leaving nothing but bloody, bruised, and mushy flesh. I collapsed, embracing death's cold grip. The last thing I saw was that thing eating MY granola bar. 10/2 wuld bang.			"

I once saw a developer pop into our private server, ban my buddy from the game just for saying ""wtf?"" and then type ""Lolz scrubs."" and then leave. That accound was never unbanned by support because they ""don't have the authority to remove bans from devs.""			"

												After a year or so of not playing I decided to take it upon myself and see how the game has changed in the many months of  not playing, despite the other reviews and flack this game has been getting I decided to power through it and go with ""Oh, hey it's probably not that bad."" you know, the stages of denial, sadly though I probably should have listened, it took me two hours to download the game cause of my internet being crappy (sorry), but finally it had finished, and I could play with my friend on Infestation, only to find out that in the year and a half of not touching the game that I had been permanently banned by fairfight, now, I have experience with fairfight, and it's instability, but to my knowledge it also runs Punkbuster an anti-hack I am quite familiar with, sadly though it seems I am hacking or cheating for not even doing anything, quite literally, so, sadly I cannot make a second review however I will say this, no one had gotten back to me, or even was able to answer my questions pertaining to the ban instead that it was ""justified"", now for all you I must say that you should listen to the other reviewers, and heed their words carefully, cause this problem has been there supposedly for QUITE A LONG TIME...I mean if you are to get banned or suspended due to suspicious activity for playing the game fairly while there are legitimate hackers still playing obviously the developers prefer their sales more then their community or declining fanbase, also hammerpoint if you actually care to read for a change, that is a horrible business model, just saying, I mean lest I remember the game had functioning zombies so that was okay I guess and they had a working detection radius besides DayZ, so yeah, but that's not giving it any real credit, I mean, the graphics are to be desired, I played Morrowind again after a LONG TIME and that looked better graphically ((I'm not even joking)), and mechanics wise it handles like any other static third person shooter, heavens Syphon Filter Omega Strain was better mechanically and control wise in comparison and that is an OLD PS2 game, ouch, too the root of the point, there are many other games, even ORIGINAL NINTENDO games that were better in comparison, so I guess that's a wrap -sighs- this game was far better when it FIRST came out, like it's early alpha days, but bugs that also sucked the fun out but hey it was ALPHA, so that was excusable, but yeah, I will say this here and now, save yourself the impending migrane, and DO NOT, I say it again DO NOT buy this game, or play it, if you want a game that functions well enough, and has developers whom care more about the game and it's community rather than it's money, than look no further than DayZ, the Standalone.::EDIT::Recently found out my friend had been banned too from out of the blue as well and he just bought a fresh copy... Okay I've been composed about this but not anymore, f**k this game, f**k the company that runs it, f**k the broken anti-hack they supposedly have, and f**k the developers and moderators, like seriously play the game fairly you get banned, hack and you stay on, honestly this has to be the worst game developement team, right beside LJN, you know the company that made those crappy Atari games back in the 1980's? yeah, right beside them... f**k them both...Steam, for good god, do EVERYONE a large favor, remove this game from your shelves, I mean from what I see this game has a HORRIBLE, I mean absolutely atrocious meta score, and the reviews are spot on about how much it sucks, even it's positive reviews are even negative in it's rite to be funny which quite a few of them are, but seriously remove Infestation again, and keep it that way, no need to infect your servers with this bile...

The graphics take so much memory I barely run the lowest setting with 6gb RAM and a 1GB graphics card. I run many games on the highest graphics setting with no problems. I spent three hours trying to get it just to run and managed maybe, *maybe* 5 minutes of game time.

People going through walls, zombies killing you far far away from you. It just doesn't worth the money and the time. At some point I was really excited to play it and I did it for a couple of months, while still in beta. We were a group of 3 friends, trying to survive zombie apocalypse, but soon we realize that wasn't zombies the great danger.... no sir.... oh no..... was hackers. People killing you from god knows where. My account was even banned from the game! Oh, by the way: even if you decide to play it, just don't waste your money buying in game money. You'll lose it.

												Everyone should buy this game. Not to necessarily install and play, but to own the worst mmo in the history of gaming. It would be safe to say this will remain the worst mmo in my entire life. The time and effort spent to make this game would have been better spent playing games to understand what might make one fun. It is a great concept, a mmo based around zombies, raiding other players for supplies. I believe if they reduced the respawn time,  and balance weapons such that anyone might have some kind of chance, the game could possibly be a little fun anyhow. graphic arent great, but would serve their purpose. It just comes down to promising to take your kids you disney world, but instead taking them mcdonalds playland. I am not even sure you would like it if it was the first and only game you have played. There are hugely epic mmos and great zombie games, and this is neither. I hope the two come together, forming survival parties, going through ruins looking for supplies and avoiding, or killing zombies would be lots of fun.			"

												I feel it's a bit early to write a review since I haven't spent too much time with this game.  But, I will update the review as I play ( hopefully ).The pros so far :The maps are huge.  And they are full of buildings, houses, etc, all enterable.Zombies seem to work both from sound and line or sight, which makes them feel threatening.Zombies aren't easy to kill.  Zombies have to be shot/axed/etc to the head, otherwise they just keep coming, I like this.Skill based system that allows for advancement as you survive and do things like kill zombies.The game looks very good ( graphics ).The cons:When you die, you lose everything you had in your backpack.When you do die, if you have nothing in your global vault, it can be EXTREMELY difficult to survive.Areas that allows for global storage are much to far apart, making it EXTREMELY boring to have to run back and forth just to store things so you don't lose everything when you die.If they ever removed the mechanic which makes you lose EVERYTHING when you die, this would be a GREAT game.  Otherwise it feels like a game that sort of tricks players into buying cash shop items through the player vs player mechanics.The pvp aspect of this game, and losing all looted items, is really just a cash shop trick to get players to spend real money.  The cash shop offers safes to put items in, so players can hide away items from being looted when they are killed.  It's unfortunate that the pvp is in place to get players to spend real money.			"

The zombie's don't take hit registry's at all , even if you hit a zombie 20 times with an axe it doesn't die, it just kills you.

												Infestation Survivor Stories or AKA Warz. The popular game that has driven many dayz fans crazy but in the bad way because of its many uses of copyright kinda of shiz and blah blah blah. Okay on to the point, Warz as i like to call it , is a seriously bad game to play alone. Not only will u DIE alone but the fact that u bring items from ur GI( Global Inventory ) is being wasted every single time u bring it out but its even more painful to see it being robbed from u , also raging. This game is not recommended at a price of $15 but when a sale comes out, now that is worth because its only $3 and hopefully this game might actually go free but hey it might happen when the developers go desperate. The mechanics of this ""wonderful"" game is seriously easy. I am not kidding it really is easier then dayz. So i would only say that if you want a easier game other then dayz then feel free to get this cause it really is easy. All u ever do in this game is just roam around, kill zombies , kill people, get their loot and run. Thats it and that just pretty much summarised the game. Playing this with friends well unless your truly commited to a clan game like this where you have to be in groups in other to win most fights is really fun. Yes of course the raging and the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and all that kind of things will happen but it really is fun when u are actually suffering this with ur friends. So on that note, ISS or WarZ not really recommended because of alot of bugs, hackers and more experienced players but it is fun with friends and its kinda cheap.			"

What kind of company makes you buy a game then insults you with micro transactions and to top it all off the items you buy with real money are lost if you die WTF. Game is glichy, graphics are horrable, and it takes 20 swings with a katana to kill one zombie> STAY AWAY from this game if you value your sanity at all. This is the worst excuss for a game I have ever seen and the fact that Valve allows this garbage and downright theft from the gaming comunity is unexcusable. I mean common Valve do atleast a little investigating into the games you allow on Steam.			"

												This game is...genocide! This is my review of this ""game"".-----GOOD STUPH-----* The map is quite detailed, even though some pieces of grass or moss clip through the walls at some places. The spawn points for weapons are well placed.* There are...hats?-----BAD STUPH-----* The graphics are hideous, the textures are blurry and the trees look like fuzzed up, green pine cones. The animations are bad and the performance is THE worst I've ever seen in a videogame.* Vehicles are badly made and are almost useless. They break easily and can get blocked by zombies unless you are moving at a high speeds.* (Almost) Forced Player Versus Player, there are no people in this game that will let you live. If you see someone, you must either shoot that person or run away unless you want to get killed and lose all your items.-----FINAL THOUGHS-----The game is freaking terrible, as it is obviously a big cashgrab. You should stay away from this game unless you want to get a glitchy game to make funny gameplay montage from it.Simply, don't buy this game. Don't do it. STOP IT!!! Too late...//Max Game - Zombie food			"

												This game was palgued with so many problems since its release.  I could write a book about the problems but it would be easier to refer you to the steam forums.  Get a snack and a beverge of your choice you will be reading for a while.  All I can really say about it is, without going into a raving bender, don't buy it, you will end up throwing your computer against the wall in frustration if you do.  There are way better survivor games out there than this.  Seven Days to Die is still in its alpha stage and is head and tails way better than this grouping of crappy code.			"

This game is NOT a survival game anymore, its a Pay-To-Win in nearly all scenarios. After a while you will buy your first GC and then you will be addicted to the shortcuts this will give you.

												After a year or so of not playing I decided to take it upon myself and see how the game has changed in the many months of  not playing, despite the other reviews and flack this game has been getting I decided to power through it and go with ""Oh, hey it's probably not that bad."" you know, the stages of denial, sadly though I probably should have listened, it took me two hours to download the game cause of my internet being crappy (sorry), but finally it had finished, and I could play with my friend on Infestation, only to find out that in the year and a half of not touching the game that I had been permanently banned by fairfight, now, I have experience with fairfight, and it's instability, but to my knowledge it also runs Punkbuster an anti-hack I am quite familiar with, sadly though it seems I am hacking or cheating for not even doing anything, quite literally, so, sadly I cannot make a second review however I will say this, no one had gotten back to me, or even was able to answer my questions pertaining to the ban instead that it was ""justified"", now for all you I must say that you should listen to the other reviewers, and heed their words carefully, cause this problem has been there supposedly for QUITE A LONG TIME...I mean if you are to get banned or suspended due to suspicious activity for playing the game fairly while there are legitimate hackers still playing obviously the developers prefer their sales more then their community or declining fanbase, also hammerpoint if you actually care to read for a change, that is a horrible business model, just saying, I mean lest I remember the game had functioning zombies so that was okay I guess and they had a working detection radius besides DayZ, so yeah, but that's not giving it any real credit, I mean, the graphics are to be desired, I played Morrowind again after a LONG TIME and that looked better graphically ((I'm not even joking)), and mechanics wise it handles like any other static third person shooter, heavens Syphon Filter Omega Strain was better mechanically and control wise in comparison and that is an OLD PS2 game, ouch, too the root of the point, there are many other games, even ORIGINAL NINTENDO games that were better in comparison, so I guess that's a wrap -sighs- this game was far better when it FIRST came out, like it's early alpha days, but bugs that also sucked the fun out but hey it was ALPHA, so that was excusable, but yeah, I will say this here and now, save yourself the impending migrane, and DO NOT, I say it again DO NOT buy this game, or play it, if you want a game that functions well enough, and has developers whom care more about the game and it's community rather than it's money, than look no further than DayZ, the Standalone.::EDIT::Recently found out my friend had been banned too from out of the blue as well and he just bought a fresh copy... Okay I've been composed about this but not anymore, f**k this game, f**k the company that runs it, f**k the broken anti-hack they supposedly have, and f**k the developers and moderators, like seriously play the game fairly you get banned, hack and you stay on, honestly this has to be the worst game developement team, right beside LJN, you know the company that made those crappy Atari games back in the 1980's? yeah, right beside them... f**k them both...Steam, for good god, do EVERYONE a large favor, remove this game from your shelves, I mean from what I see this game has a HORRIBLE, I mean absolutely atrocious meta score, and the reviews are spot on about how much it sucks, even it's positive reviews are even negative in it's rite to be funny which quite a few of them are, but seriously remove Infestation again, and keep it that way, no need to infect your servers with this bile...

												Hmmmmmm what can I say that's good.Well nothing really bought this game for my son and I to run around and kill zombies.Well zombies are no problem,all the hackers are the problem.The best part I would say was getting banned and not knowing why.Send a email to support to be told they can't tell me why I was banned because it's a privacy issue.What is so private it's my dam account.So enough said save your money and time go get a better game.Also once again they change the name of the game for the third or forth time and think we are going to buy it for a new name.Yeah free aftermath unless you were banned from the previous game.! big joke after another			"

												Best experience ever! I approached the supermarket, starving and willing to devour any scrap leftover. I noticed a granola bar, and I became filled with joy and relief. Suddenly, a floating construction hat came into view at the end of the aisle. I stared, wondering if I was going insane, or if my hunger was really this bad. The strange emptiness was holding something, a flashlight. It approached me, raised the flashlight, and brought it down on my head with titan- force, leaving nothing but bloody, bruised, and mushy flesh. I collapsed, embracing death's cold grip. The last thing I saw was that thing eating MY granola bar. 10/2 wuld bang.			"

												This game was so painfully bad, at one point the de velopers were basically paying you to play. The developers HATE the players. I don't mean that as in they made a bad game (though they did). I mean they literally hate the players. I once saw a developer pop into our private server, ban my buddy from the game just for saying ""wtf?"" and then type ""Lolz scrubs."" and then leave. That accound was never unbanned by support because they ""don't have the authority to remove bans from devs.""			"

Similar to reasons that I try to avoid eating things like ""KD"" or fast food,  just doesn't seem very apetizing to me and I find it really boring.			"

												Used to be one of the better survival games, had a good story in it. Yet another game was infested by hackers and the game was completely destroyed because the developers kept on argueing about how to get rid of the hackers instead of actually doing something about it. Is this game worth to buy it? No not anymore by far. In all honesty this game shouldn't be on Steam anymore.			"

												I don't see how anyone could hate this game... here are some pros:- The game only crashes every two hours- The game is a pay to win (gotta pay if you want to respawn, or you'll have to wait an hour)- The chances of you getting banned are totally random so there isn't much risk if you're a hacker- Almost half of your deaths can be from hackers- Your fps might drop if you go into cities, but who cares? the risk is worth finding a chemlight- With real money, you can buy any item you want from the in-game store- The loading screen is only 5-10 minutes long.- Last time i played, the hunger and thirst meters didn't even work, so don't worry about keeping them up.- ps hit me up if you want me to update the list with anymore information.

												OK, so I started watching a few vid of Frankie on a Dayz mod of Arma 2.  Thought it was cool and bought the game, it was really hard to get on a server.  Then I found out about WARZ.  This was good because you could actually melee a zombie.  Then I found weapons and ammo and other goodies.  It was hard to find these items and everyone seemed to be paying before I did.  Ran into a few players and learned the hard way, not to trust people.  Later on I gave the benefit of a doubt and trust and got killed for it.  New maps vehicles added. and now Caliwood.  Over all, I like this game, it soothes my zombie craving.  I have to learn to be a better PVP player.  So used to console games not used to the PC style and controls.  I give this gamea  8 or of 10 .  With hackers on, I would give this game a 4 out of 10.   Get ride of these guys.  What's the point in aimbot?  where's the challenge?  I suck at PVP, but I don't cheat.			"

												Totally NOT worth the $3.74 price tag, it's not even worthy of the $1.99 Daily deal that had passed. Infestation: Survivor Stories, or WarZ is a cheap recreation of DayZ that had been done in-order to try and leech off the successful sales of it's competitors. The game features very poorly worked on codes and excessive and frustrating, sometimes game-breaking glitches/bugs.Pros:1. Is a great way to work up a rage-enducing therapy.2. Can be gifted to someone you absolutely despise3. Relatively cheap, and can be used to farm some Steam XPCons:1. Excessive number of upseting, and game-breaking bugs/glitches2. Greedy Microtransaction system that requires you to either wait 20 minutes to play, or pay $5.00 to play then.3. Coding is poorly done, making it easily manipulated, and therefore a Security Risk.4. A developer whom worked on this game, also developed Big Rigs: Off the Road racing, google it.5. The entire game itself is a Scam.But don't just take my word for it, read the many other reviews for this game and look into this game, perhaps it may just pique your interest, although I greatly doubt that this game has a long life-span left.

												I don't see how anyone could hate this game... here are some pros:- The game only crashes every two hours- The game is a pay to win (gotta pay if you want to respawn, or you'll have to wait an hour)- The chances of you getting banned are totally random so there isn't much risk if you're a hacker- Almost half of your deaths can be from hackers- Your fps might drop if you go into cities, but who cares? the risk is worth finding a chemlight- With real money, you can buy any item you want from the in-game store- The loading screen is only 5-10 minutes long.- Last time i played, the hunger and thirst meters didn't even work, so don't worry about keeping them up.- ps hit me up if you want me to update the list with anymore information.

Product received for free
WarningI rewrote this after my intial review was missing. Prob due to the game changing names again. This game comes in many foul flavors such as WarZ, Infestation Surviver Stories (now classic wtf?), Romero's Aftermath (because WarZ/ISS was so bad lets do it again with less microtransactions), Infestation World (we couldn't even this this on Steam), Infestation The New Z (same game with improved business model), Shattered Skies (same game but in a space theme and no micro transactions), Last Man Standing (poor copy H1Z1 KotK and The Culling). All of these unfinished games use many of the same assets, and are on the same graphically handicapped engine. Some of the titles are almost exactly the same game.  Expect game breaking bugs, hackers, bad graphics, and poor performance. Pay MeThe game has the absolute worst micro transactions I have ever seen in a game. Pay real money to respawn... F*%@ no! Buy cosmetic items with real money just to be looted and taken by other players... WTF? Buy weapons and ammo with real money to kill the spawn camper when you pay me real money to respawn... Get the picture?  The last two titles (Shattered Skies and Last Man Standing) at least have done away with the micro transactions for the moment. ConclusionBe cautious of anything these guys develope/produce: OP Productions and Free Reign Entertainment, both companies founded by Sergey Titov, a man credited for making one of the worst games ever, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003).

			This is a video of Romero's Aftermath. The successor to Infestation: Survivor Stories formally known as WarZ. ISS had the worst business model I have ever seen in a game but Aftermath didn't fall too far from the tree.

												Infestation is an ok game, all the reviews are pretty old and do not make much sense (Just like this review). Anyway this game is acually not too bad it has it's ""Ups and Downs"" but overall pretty fun and scary, the AI'S are pretty good too and the map size is BIG! As i was playing the game i got really into it and played for atleast 8 hours ( about 2-3 hours a day) and found it very interesting. The staff also bans a lot of hackers as i have saw it happen on big servers... If i was you i would buy it, it's not a bad game and it's very fun!			"

No single player mode like promised when the game was first advertised. I never encountered any zombies even after playing several hours.Until more is added to this game, promises are met by the publisher, the performance is optimized and all the glitches are fix I'd hold off. For what this game costs even on sale it's a ripout.			"

Product received for free
WarningI rewrote this after my intial review was missing. Prob due to the game changing names again. This game comes in many foul flavors such as WarZ, Infestation Surviver Stories (now classic wtf?), Romero's Aftermath (because WarZ/ISS was so bad lets do it again with less microtransactions), Infestation World (we couldn't even this this on Steam), Infestation The New Z (same game with improved business model), Shattered Skies (same game but in a space theme and no micro transactions), Last Man Standing (poor copy H1Z1 KotK and The Culling). All of these unfinished games use many of the same assets, and are on the same graphically handicapped engine. Some of the titles are almost exactly the same game.  Expect game breaking bugs, hackers, bad graphics, and poor performance. Pay MeThe game has the absolute worst micro transactions I have ever seen in a game. Pay real money to respawn... F*%@ no! Buy cosmetic items with real money just to be looted and taken by other players... WTF? Buy weapons and ammo with real money to kill the spawn camper when you pay me real money to respawn... Get the picture?  The last two titles (Shattered Skies and Last Man Standing) at least have done away with the micro transactions for the moment. ConclusionBe cautious of anything these guys develope/produce: OP Productions and Free Reign Entertainment, both companies founded by Sergey Titov, a man credited for making one of the worst games ever, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003). 


Infestation: First Thoughts 
A Video of Infestation: Survivor Stories Classic

			This is my first thoughts on Infestation after receiving it as a gift from Turtlemaw on Twitch TV. Thanks for the game. I just hope they make some very needed improvements.		





Aftermath - After I$$ (WarZ) 
A Video of Aftermath
By: Volt

			This is a video of Romero's Aftermath. The successor to Infestation: Survivor Stories formally known as WarZ. ISS had the worst business model I have ever seen in a game but Aftermath didn't fall too far from the tree.

												The base game is solid if a little over-run with heavy weaponary and equipment. This could be a very smooth and enjoyable game but it is let down by the developers decisions. Eventually they will turn you off the game and cause you regret putting any money into it.I enjoyed the game then I was banned because fairfight said I was a hacker. They would not unban me, I went to other independent bodies and I was unbanned but all my stuff was removed as a last act of spite. This is not a rare story it is the norm for the game and seems to be a case of ""If we ban them they'll buy another account"". That being said the game is full of hackers so you'll die a lot. The developers have been known to give out the best weapons to their favourites, they ban people who kill their characters in fair fights(see the youtube videos on this. They are in short corrupt and unwilling to do anything other than bleed players dry.They will change the map, make items you purchased and placed on the map unreachable(that you paid money for) and then not give you the items or refund the cost.In short go buy the DayZ standalone and save yourself the hassle. You might get some good gametime out of this game but you will have to be very lucky.			"

												Infestation Survivor Stories or AKA Warz. The popular game that has driven many dayz fans crazy but in the bad way because of its many uses of copyright kinda of shiz and blah blah blah. Okay on to the point, Warz as i like to call it , is a seriously bad game to play alone. Not only will u DIE alone but the fact that u bring items from ur GI( Global Inventory ) is being wasted every single time u bring it out but its even more painful to see it being robbed from u , also raging. This game is not recommended at a price of $15 but when a sale comes out, now that is worth because its only $3 and hopefully this game might actually go free but hey it might happen when the developers go desperate. The mechanics of this ""wonderful"" game is seriously easy. I am not kidding it really is easier then dayz. So i would only say that if you want a easier game other then dayz then feel free to get this cause it really is easy. All u ever do in this game is just roam around, kill zombies , kill people, get their loot and run. Thats it and that just pretty much summarised the game. Playing this with friends well unless your truly commited to a clan game like this where you have to be in groups in other to win most fights is really fun. Yes of course the raging and the ♥♥♥♥♥ing and all that kind of things will happen but it really is fun when u are actually suffering this with ur friends. So on that note, ISS or WarZ not really recommended because of alot of bugs, hackers and more experienced players but it is fun with friends and its kinda cheap.			"

What kind of company makes you buy a game then insults you with micro transactions and to top it all off the items you buy with real money are lost if you die WTF. Game is glichy, graphics are horrable, and it takes 20 swings with a katana to kill one zombie> STAY AWAY from this game if you value your sanity at all. This is the worst excuss for a game I have ever seen and the fact that Valve allows this garbage and downright theft from the gaming comunity is unexcusable. I mean common Valve do atleast a little investigating into the games you allow on Steam.			"

												Pros: You can play the game.Cons: You don't want to.This is a REALLY, REALLY, CRAP game. Don't buy it, it is a total RIP OFF of DayZ but a hell load WORSE! (Because DayZ is actually a good game, unlike this pile of rubbish.)This is a disgrace to my library... It doesn't belong there... And it get's worse... The developers have the nerve to try and create another game (""Romero's Aftermath"") if my facts are correct.			"

												This game is...genocide! This is my review of this ""game"".-----GOOD STUPH-----* The map is quite detailed, even though some pieces of grass or moss clip through the walls at some places. The spawn points for weapons are well placed.* There are...hats?-----BAD STUPH-----* The graphics are hideous, the textures are blurry and the trees look like fuzzed up, green pine cones. The animations are bad and the performance is THE worst I've ever seen in a videogame.* Vehicles are badly made and are almost useless. They break easily and can get blocked by zombies unless you are moving at a high speeds.* (Almost) Forced Player Versus Player, there are no people in this game that will let you live. If you see someone, you must either shoot that person or run away unless you want to get killed and lose all your items.-----FINAL THOUGHS-----The game is freaking terrible, as it is obviously a big cashgrab. You should stay away from this game unless you want to get a glitchy game to make funny gameplay montage from it.Simply, don't buy this game. Don't do it. STOP IT!!! Too late...//Max Game - Zombie food			"

												This game was palgued with so many problems since its release.  I could write a book about the problems but it would be easier to refer you to the steam forums.  Get a snack and a beverge of your choice you will be reading for a while.  All I can really say about it is, without going into a raving bender, don't buy it, you will end up throwing your computer against the wall in frustration if you do.  There are way better survivor games out there than this.  Seven Days to Die is still in its alpha stage and is head and tails way better than this grouping of crappy code.			"

												I really do not like this game. This game still has alot of bugs. It is almost impossible to meele a zombie with any weapon because it takes ages! It's almost impossible to get into a town because zombie's are every where around it, but when you do get into a town you will either be stuck because of the zombies, or scared to leave because you found a gun with small amount of ammo, or you get player killed. This game makes you buy in game money!!! Not only is it a buy to play, but it's technically a buy to win as well. I truely do NOT recommend this game. Please if you could give me a refund!!!			"

This game is NOT a survival game anymore, its a Pay-To-Win in nearly all scenarios. After a while you will buy your first GC and then you will be addicted to the shortcuts this will give you. NEVER buy GC, DONT even think about it. Watch some gameplay before even thinking about buying this game.			"

												This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Now that is off of my chest I can review this game. Yes, it deserves the controversy. It shamelessly steals ideas from DayZ without trying to reinvent them. Ai is dumb, there is an outrageous number of hackers on this game, ammo is impossible to find, and stealth is broken. This game has it's scarce 1 of a kind moments when youre with friends, but you can have a better time by playing other games. So when you want to play a survival game, DO NOT think of this game. This is the bane of me. Also the amount of glitches are CRAZY. There are too many for me to point out. Just don't get this and wait for DayZ Standalone. Just awful. 2/10.Edit: They changed it's name to Infestation: Survivor Stories to make it seem like a different game. A very shady technique indeed. Because of their dishonesty I shall give it a new rating! 1/10.			"

												After a few characters and couple of hours played this game is clearly an example of saying a game is finished, though countless bugs and lazy graphical errors occur. Yes, the game is fun with friends for a while. It becomes a farm-fest by stacking multiple characters in one spot so that when someone kills you, you switch and kill them back... I tried playing a bit solo. I had a hard time trying to put my finger on a word to describe the experience. -Abandoned.Not as in ""apocalypse abandoned"" but as in the developers cares so little of our experience. We wander the forest without finding a single resource nor zombie but as for a camp or base; 15 zombies and you have no weapons, food or medicine.-Goodluck.			"

												Honestly this is one of the worst games i've played in my life.  I have played facebook games better than this!  If you get killed it makes you wait 20 minutes for your survivor to be revived, ok now it is a facebook game.  This is supposed to be a zombie survival sim, instead there is an store that you can buy ammo, food and other stuff from.  So lets say you spend $20.00 that's on a visa, mastercard, paypal, etc. and you go get killed, your out $20.00. The zombies can see from miles away and you cant even out run them.  It's so boring its not like Dayz where there is alot of scavenge areas, it's mostly forest and mountains.  The graphics are all right, but the games is just so bad. Don't waste your money on it unless you want to buy this facebook game.  They had a great idea, but the whole game seems rushed. This game may as well be in alpha.			"

												I purchased this game during a Steam Summer Sale since I couldn't get the DayZ mod to work on ARMA. Had over 200+ hours of play with this game and had a respectable cache of guns ammo backpacks rare items ect. Then my account was hacked and everything was stolen. Went through proper steps to contact support and hoping support could see my account was accessed from a different IP or something and possibly get my items restored. After 2 MONTHS of waiting on my ""pending"" ticket, I was told they wouldn't restore my items and was told something to the effect of ""all the items that were stolen from you are still available in-game for me to start over and restore what was stolen."" SO I'M SUPPOSED TO SPEND ANOTHER 200+ HOURS TO GET MY CACHE BACK??? ♥♥♥♥ THAT AND ♥♥♥♥ YOU customer support. I'm glad Reddit.com and Metecritic.com ripped you apart with their reviews. The game is fun and can be frustrating since it's a PvP which means everyone will KOS you even if you have no gear just to be a prick but dont expect any help from support if something goes wrong.

It just says my valid key isn't valid or my steam account doesn't have ownership of the game (which obviously it does). So buggy and poorly optimized. Heats up my gfx card to 75 C just idling in the main menu. I get better fps on BF4 on high settings that on this game at all low settings.			"

												A bad game yet addictive, the game is in essence very fun but it is filled with hackers that just ruin it, on top of that the DEV's do not care about the customers and always make excuses to why they are not helpful. If you wish to buy the game buy at your own risk.			"

												- Very weak graphics support barely playable GeForce GT 650M i7 3630QM 8GB RAM even with lowest graphics settings- They have wasted 2 years with no anti-hack , lost 90% of their players , still dont have a 100% successful anti-hack- No stability on nothing. In game resources change everyday , dinamics are the same , today you are playing something tomorrow something else , they change it everyday but they cant find the  balance, so you cant get to anywhere in the game , every next day you get back to zero point , so no  point in playing. So , play a multiplayer fps instead , you will get better graphics and fair challange...			"

												Total garbage.  It's been in development forever and has NEVER been updated to what was initially advertised and/or promised as far as features including security.  The absolute MOST HACKED GAMEPLAY of any game I've ever encountered.  Hammerpoint Software is a lame bunch of rip off artists.  This game is very lucky to received a metacritic score of 20.  It should be a 1.  The 1 rating would only be because the game exists.  Worst POS every made and sold.  The Bernie Madoff of games.  Can I possibly rag on it any more?  Probably but if you don't get it thus far... you never will.			"

Graphics are poor by todays standard, controls are rubbish, gameplay sucks, community stinks, etc etc.....in fact just read the other reviews i cant even be bothered to waste any more time on this game.

												I hate this game! Even when you run this game at it's max, the graphics still look like a**. It looks like the game developers took the cd and wipe their a** with this game because thats what it looks like. I got this game on a sale and its still not worth picking up. Even if the game is free don't bother picking this game up it sucks. First of all it was supposed to be ""WarZ"" but they changed the name so it makes it seem like this would be a totally new game. In the end it has failed miserably. The gameplay sucks, The graphics looks like a**, it lags way too much and has bugs all over the place.. it has more bugs than zombies. Sooner or later noone will play this game and the game developers will shut this game down so dont pick this up. If you want a Zombie MMO game, pick up DayZ, Or State of decay, or Project Zomboid because those games are really good. I highly recommend that you avoid this game at all cost!!			"

												I have 287 games in my Steam library as of the moment I'm writing this. Most of them I love, like or just plain enjoy, while others are what you would concider ""mishap purchases"". There has been only one time, however, when I've felt so disgusted, and betrayed by my, albeit a bit naïve, purchase of this game. Zombie survival games where the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Everyone and their grandmothers were playing DayZ! Let's make a game that capitalizes on that! Let's lie to our audience. Let's turn  guns and ammo into micro-transactions. Let's create no-kill zones with only on entry/exit point that people can camp outside of, killing people as the go outside.I'm proud to say that this game no longer tarnishes my Steam library with it's filth, as I personally contacted Steam support to have them permanently remove this game without a refund.These games are cancer.

												I never write reviews, but this time how can I not?I was pretty hyped about this game. Looked fun as hell.Me and my team mate get on to play and honestly if done right, it would be a very fun game.BUTIt is a load of caca instead.The game was made so poorly that even on low settings it will freeze and crash a good computer that can runall other games just fine.When you can get a computer to run it, the servers boot you off without warning every 2-5 minutes. Both of which make the game totally unplayable.Oh and if this game was every fixed, and made into the game it had potential to be, they need a better/more realistic looting system. & the weapons need to be more accurate especially the scopesand my fps ranged from 0 - 20 only! & the item descriptions need to be detailed properly (such as one backpack tells you how many slots it has, while another does not. all items are like that). so that needs to be worked on. Also the griefers are a bit ridiculous.but with all its really bad issues, thats the least of your worries!!!The Devs have obviously said a big F U to the players and I dont see this game ever being fixed. Thats really sad.So many games go this way these days. It has become so bad I am about to stop supporting indie games! How sad is that?			"

												Would be good if there were also PvE servers where you can just explore the world, fight zombies, collect loot etc. But it's just Call of Duty with zombies in the background. A lot of cheaters, scumbags who just shoot you in sight even if you have only small backpack and wrench, annoying crashes, and many other issues. It has a nice ambience and some potential though. I would recommend it only to those who seek another FPS and ruthless psychos who are satisfied by killing weaker players than them.6/10			"

												I bought this game a couple of years ago, it was then released as ""WarZ"".I was being a fool to myself, having too much hope and expectations for this game, don't blame me - the pictures looked great! It's quite a long time ago since I played this ""game"", and I wouldn't expect it to change much. As soon as the game was released and started getting bad reviews, the developers thought that it was a good call to change the name into something else, just to keep milking people's wallets... The game sucks and the developers are a disgrace. Do not buy this game!After getting the launcher up, I tried resetting my password, which I couldn't manage. The reasoning of this was the message I got when I entered the mail address that I knew as the correct one, but only got ""Message delivery failed..."" as a response.The folder that gets created when you install the game does still have the same old name: ""The War Z""TL;DR: I just bought this game, only to warn you not to. I didn't want to actually start the game, but I had to... Only to make this review... :(			"

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Pros:-Graphically the game looks good.-Decent Loot in the game is fairly easy to achieve if you know where those spawns are.-The Dynamic Lighting looks great. (SweetFX makes it greater)-Fairly Decent sized open world. (but could use some more fillers to block out the dreaded walking)-Character Customization is neat. (but requires you to have to pay either GC or GD to unlock some which this serves as both a con and pro)-Finding a rare item can be exhilarating at times.-Loot Hoarding is always great. (This is one Key feature why I like Infestation most about)-Having your very own Unlimited GI .(Global Inventory)Cons:-Game has a lot of potential, Devs refuse to maximize that potential.-No matter what the devs tell you about this being a PVE based game is a lie and focuses towards PVP, very hard to keep the loot you find without some Jacka** killing you on sight.-Large FPS drops in certain areas as well as FPS hickups (This happens even on high end computers). Large cities that require a lot of rendering have a lot of FPS drops Campos on v2 being one.-Leveling is fairly slow-This game is pretty hard to play without some sort of GC start up fund as a new player to Infestation. Which I recommend getting at least one of the GC packs otherwise you'll have a hard time with no items in your GI. (Overall isn't fair to have to purchase more to the game to actually enjoy it)-Little options to lower resolution on lower end PC's.-Lots of bugs the community constantly complains about, but never get fixed in patches until far later.-Loads of Punkbuster issues with this game, Some Kicks, Some Temperary false bans, Others like myself getting Computer freezes/Lockups where a hard reset will only work.-People Being Falsely banned. (Supposidly, which really I think is because they have Keyloggers on their PC's)-Development in this game is pretty slow.-Things being promised, but never happen.-Customer Support is god awefully slow.-Developers make up pity excuses, whether it's based on your ban, features, implementations, etc.-False Advertising.-Very limited Zombie Models. (After a while of seeing the same NPC's they get stale real quick)-Animations are very limited and lack (Melee weapons Especially, Same animation over and over)-Lot of Hackers in this game that  have one goal, to kill you unfairly and steal your items and sell their account with your items and many other peoples items for a real profit.Overall:This game has a lot of potential, why the devs hold back, will never know. This game is getting better, but very slowly. The biggest issue in this game are the FPS problems. Owning an Nvidia Geforce GTX 470 GPU and an i7 CPU I should not be getting 5-10 FPS in Large cities, something isn't right. I can't say the devs are a scam, otherwise they'd stop further development of this game, but still doesnt make up the excuse why it's so slow in development. So would I recommend to buy this game? No, however it is enjoyable at times, but with the bugs and issues this game has as well as in the company, a lot needs to be changed before I can give a better review. So I'd wait for a better outcome on this game to be honest, if it gets that far. Don't get me wrong I play this a lot based on hours as you can see, it's just those enjoyable moments as I was saying is why I still play, and the Loot hoarding which is a special feature to have a GI while no other game has done (Besides Nether, but Nether is just as worse as this game don't know why people recommend it over this game I've seen Youtube reviews of the game that were just, bad).

Posted: February 28, 2014
												Well after months of playing the game and almost 1,600 cumulative hours (spanned over six accounts), and being very patient with the development of it - the last draw for me was the in-game lockboxes. Lockboxes are part of an integral part of the game in my opinion, especially if you're playing the game in PVE style, which is how I was playing the game with my family - hence the six accounts. The game has much potential for both PVP and PVE styles, and if you've followed the author's customer service track record, you'll find that they have no regard for their fan base - they claim otherwise. I submitted a ticket explaining my situation regarding a particular item (lockbox) that I've placed on my personal rented server ($50 month) of which I play the game in PVE with my friends and family. I personally stopped playing the game for a few weeks, but my wife and some friends have been playing on my private server continuously. Well, I came back in to find a wonderful surprise as I was looking for my 16 lockboxes I had left around the map weeks earlier. I could not find one single lockbox! I thought maybe because of my inactivity, the lockboxes might have been returned to my Global Inventory… nope, not the case.  Lockboxes can cost (at the author’s discretion), between 150 game credits up to (what I’ve seen) 750 game credits and I’ve got (had) a total of 21. My problem with the game is in the following; the authors can do changes to the game with little or no notice to the players, and if you try to look for help (as in their ingame experience) there is virtually none! You’ll find this a continuous problem with other players in their own forum. I’ll give you my own example: When you go and buy the lockboxes in their marketplace, there is no mention anywhere that the lockbox you are about to purchase can disappear if you place it in the map and leave it unattended for a period of time. Mind you, this information IS buried somewhere in their forum and you’re supposed to know that, because they make it a point when you first spawn in to figure these things out, and you’re an idiot for not doing so – as ArtemisKnives will let you know on his twitch.After 1,600 hours of ingame experience, I discovered that placed lockboxes do indeed disappear if you don’t access them in three weeks. You can be playing the game during that period, but if you don’t get your character to actually go to the place where you placed your lockbox and access the lockbox, it will disappear. Their reasoning behind this, so the map won’t be littered with lockboxes; makes very much sense in public servers, but remember I had these on my own private server, 6-10 people max. Anyhow, I found this out the hard way, not through ingame instructions or easily found on their forum, but after 1600 ingame hours later.I submitted the following ticket to get some help (I just about laughed myself to tears when I got their answer three days later) can anyone say automated?:My request ticket Feb 15 23:15""I came back into the game today after a months hiatus, I checked my private server's expiration time and I had 11 days left. So I just dropped another $50 to renew for another month in fear that I would lose my lockboxes and so that my wife could continue playing as well (we only PVE on this game).Anyhow, my heart dropped when I found all my lockboxes gone filled with my gear and survival items I've gathered over time for RPG'ng with my family (yes they have accounts and we play together on private). I really don't know what to do with this game, I had over 21 lockboxes distributed with my wife's, and rpg accounts. I only have two left. I have spent some considerable money on these and I don't care about the items in them, but I would like the boxes back, please help!""Their answerScarlet (Infestation Survivor Support)Feb 18 17:01""Hello Survivor,Thank you for contacting Infestation customer support!For lockbox issues, please ensure that you are on the correct server and location that you have placed your lockbox. When a lockbox is placed, it can only be accessed from the specific server it is placed on. We recommend always writing a note for yourself detailing the server and location you have placed a lockbox, as well as the password, as it is the responsibility of each player to keep track of their lockbox and password. Additionally, please keep in mind that lockboxes will despawn after three weeks if items are not taken from or added to the lockbox.Please also be aware that recently particularly crafty players have taken up safe-cracking to get at the loot stored inside, so you will want to make sure to select more difficult passwords and transport your favorite items to your GI for safe keeping!While you will not be receiving any reimbursement regarding this issue, we do apologize for the inconvenience and want to let you know that fortunately all items can be found in-game.Also, you can check out our forums (http://forums.infestationmmo.com/) for tips on finding items you may have lost, as well as our Twitter Page (https://twitter.com/infestationmmo) and our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Infestationmmo) for future promotions and giveaways.We hope you have found this helpful and if you have any additional questions, please feel free to submit a new ticket and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Sincerely,Infestation Customer Support""In conclusion, if you want to throw your money at someone with terrible customer service, I totally recommend this game!

												Do not buy this game. The game mechanics are horrible at best, most of the servers are full of hackers and not to mention the dev's have not supplied many of the features promised. This game is a sham and this should not be allowed on steam.			"

												I had bought and played this before it's commercial release. I played it some more after that and it really still feels like it's in beta, unfinished. Not an enjoyable experience, many other games out there that are well worth your time. Save yourself time and money and skip this one. -Poorly optimized game engine (will run questionably even on the beefiest gamer rigs)-Rigid animations that lack refinement.-Uninspired level design-PVP at it's worst (good luck making any friends, might as well play COD)-No real depth to the survival mechanic, shoot or be shot.

												Not a good game.A good idea, but the developers used it as a cash grab. I played it in alpha, and not much has changed, no working features are interesting, and a combination of bugs and high priced free-to-play model server renting and item buys makes the game only worth a dollar just for interests sake.

The game seems to swing heavily to the pvp side. most people seem to want to play against others instead of cooperatively. Expect to die, alot. Expect to be on your own. Not worth the money!!!			"

												Poor game, worst development team I have ever encountered, even worse PR and a hell of a lot of lies. Pulled from Steam the same day it came to Steam. The hasn't been a lot of change to the game. Still feels like a mod of War Inc.Sergey Titov had a hand in this game who was also invovled in Big Rigs. So that say a lot about Infestation. If you don't know Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. Look it up.The first time I heard about this game I was given the impression of a watered down DayZ.But even now through all the trouble the team is still slacking. I heard about a server in this game which was moded to bring some of the things that Hammerpoint promised such as cars. That was about a year ago now and Hammerpoint have only got around to testing cars now.This game maybe only £5.49 but you will get more value you out of burning your money I'd hate to say. It doesn't stop there the is also Microtransactions.Hackers, poor community, awful support and generally they want to take your money.Microtransaction are pretty much needed since you will quickly die by zombies. Although they shamble you sprint at a walking pace and jog at a snails pace. If you plan to fight the zombies you will either die of laughter by the horrible animations of when you hit them with your flashlight or die of boredom due to it taking so long.I won't lie it took me about 5-8 minutes of hitting a zombie over and over again.I suggest you save your money and look else where. The are other better games that do a similar job to Infestation.DayZState of DecayProject ZomboidThe Dead LingerI'm sure if you look around you will find something that will do the job.			"

The game is possible to play for fun, and lacks many things that it ''could'' be a good game. Within recent updates, they introduced ""Hardcore"" mode where you get permanent death on that character if you die, only first person mode, and no global inventory.Overall, it can be a good game for a few hours.

												I actually enjoyed the game a long time ago. But since the developers abandoned the game and the game goes on sale literally every month. This makes even more hackers! The game now is just infested with hackers and the game just never gets updated at all now.. The new developers claim they are redoing this game but its set clearly they want nothing to do with it.

												This game is only recommended if you are willing to demote time to it, if not don't bother buying it. It's not the worse game, but certainly not the best. I recommend learning from youtube and experienced players on Twitch.tv as this game doesn't have a tutorial for new players which is one of the worse things I've found. Hackers are not much of an issue as hacks are getting detected faster, compared to earlier versions. The developers are still adding more stuff to this game and modifying it every few weeks to provide a better experience for players which varies from stat changing of items and adding new things in such as Super Zombies (beware) that are a lot stronger but drop loot such as rare assault rifles and sniper rifles. Due to the recent price change, it's more reasonable to get this decent quality game at such a low price. This game is mainly PvP based aswell, very few private servers provide PvE with enforcement of the rule, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but makes somethings a lot easier and more fun so it's best to travel in a group (only with friends, as randoms will just get your location and kill you)Pros:-Multiple spawn points to prevent risk of spawn killing along with spawn protection-Looting for meds, food, or weapons is easier than before-Vehicles have been added for faster transportation-Large map to get loot and stay away from players-Variety of servers for players who perfer small servers or very populated ones-Safe zones are found throughout the map to allow players to store items and prevent loss of them-Zombies can drop up to $10,000 (very rare) but they drop $25-$50 almost every drop, which can be used in the store at safe zones and can be farmed very easily-Developers have made a youtube page to help out players with tips (players have some too)Cons:-Hackers are commonly found on official servers-Good weapons are found at places with super zombies or cities with mass pvp-Super Zombies are nearly impossible to kill if you're new (they die easily from semi-auto shotguns)-Vehicles are destroyed easily as physics don't include a form of suspension (roads lead to cities but none of them can be drove through as vehicles and other debris that prevent you from going through them)-Players have a 95 percent chance of killing you if you encounter them (there are ways of getting out of these situations)-It's very hard to start from scratch if you're new to this game (recommend playing in a group)-Players in vehicles can instantly kill you if you're not in a safezone7/10			"

												Zombie survival games, to be realistic and for it to work in some way, has to exist in either a single player story mode like crysis1 or at most some sort of co-op. It needs to have an end and a beginning. It doesn't need a scripted story. Just tell the players that the goal is somewhere way yonder and how they get to it, is the story.The openworld can be like in this game, you can have bandits or npc turned bandit randomly depending on your circumstances. Foodstuff should be finite and so should other supllies. You can't have bandits waiting at edges of your spawn point or areas where you can or cannot shoot. You cannot have 15 people coming back to the same place for the same loot that respawns after a given time, that's not realistic.For this openworld zombie game thing to work, everything in it has to be finite. Because that's how you see it in all the movies and that's how people want to play it. Rick doesn't shoot Glen the first time they meet, normal people trying to survive don't do that. Zombies themselves should be finite since they once were people. Remember Dawn of the dead? Stuck in a mall but in the end things run out, so you gotta leave anyway. Imagine a game that you can play like in the movie I am Legend. You'd never finish the game though but would have to go further to find supplies everyday. You could play it for a month and not finish.That's why mmo zombie games will never work. Just make a game that takes 120 hours to complete on easy. Like GTA but zombified. The people who make such a game would become legends.			"

												The game in itself is not horrible, but it's still pretty bad. The trailers and screenshots are edited to make the game look nice. Half the time the game is glitched or broken, and the world is full of hackers and spawncampers. The game is full of microtransactions which can all be lost seconds after outfitting your character to some random person who found a gun. There hasn't been a real update since the games release, and the developers are obviously just taking what money they can from a broken game and running away with it. Overall, the only good thing about this game is that the few times it does work, it's like a seriously downgraded DayZ. 2/10, would not reccomend to anyone.			"

												A definite, DO NOT BUY! (IMO)It's ""The WarZ"" (Not the Movie) under a different name.It's faster paced than DayZ-Mod for sure,but a lot smaller, world wise, amount of zombies (/1) and players per server.It also got the silly 3rd Person (/3rd) camera and most zombies can be avoidedby crawling around like in the DayZ-Mod.The game being smaller, also enables most combat being in close or medium range,which isn't necesseraly bad.Additionaly you can only get knee deep into the water and then there is a invisible wall which won't let you swim.Then there is the ambience noise and music, as soon you get closer to buildings/settlements or just at random, horrormovie ambience comes out of nowhere (/A), the normal ingame-music contains zombie moans(WHY?) the regular music can be disabled in the settings.It's pretty much a FFA/DM (/2) with zombies and a bit of survival (/3) and rpg (/4) elements,other survivors are the biggest and most occuring threat.Zombies ain't much of a threat to the player unless you let them to close, great thing about the zombies is that you can Outrun them, but watch out, they don't tire, unlike you...For killing zombies silenced firearms or a sturdy melee weapons is adviseable, aim high to hit the head.Then there is an online shop, where you can buy everything from water and painkillers over backpacks and clothes to firearms and ammunition, for actual money and ingame currency, you also can lose these items when you get killed or you drop (DUH!) them.Some firearms can be modified with various attachments, which also can be bought or found.This software also has a big issue with ""hackers"" (/H), like the DayZ-Mod due to the communication architecture in between client and server, most things are calculated and rendered by the client, the server is pretty much just there to synchronize the data send by the clients, which makes games very prone to be manipulated.########### Bottom Notes ###########(1) The screenshots with hundreds of zombies are fake in the aspect that just for the sole purpose of the screenshot, additional zombies were spawned in by admins, you'll never encounter that many zombies.(3rd) In my honest opinion, third-person doesn't belong in games like this, it's silly to me.        You either design a game in fhird(Good example, Warframe) or first person, if you do both,        server should enforce one of those perspectives, third-person is just usable to look around        corners and covers, it's not really feasable in combat in this game unlike DayZ-Mod where        third-person combat is very feasable and still annoying to me.(A)    Random piano strokes, this eery intensifying noise when something bad is about to happen,        like the murderer sneaks up to the victim, and that ""whom""noise that occurs in movies when a         character suddenly has the monster in his/hers very face.(2)    FFA (Free for All) and DM (Death Match) which are identical. (3)    Food, Drinks, Bandages, First-Aid-Kits, etc.(4)    Skills like longer sprint time, faster reload, faster bandaging, damage reduction, etc.(H)    This is just here to not name those who use script/hack-tools in a game, hackers.        You don't call criminals, Gun-Knive-Weapon_Smithers-Manufacturers-Maker.        The people using the hacks are just using tools and scripts,        made by real hackes who actually put a lot of effort in their products, their motivation,        ranges from boredom over to challange and then to sabotage the product or/and community,        some do it just because they can or maybe even profit.

												Its seriously not as bad as people make it out to be. The only reason this game gets a bad rep is because total biscuit made a negative review about it during the ALPHA stage and his fanbois must spread his opinion as if it is their own. I almost didnt buy the game because of negative reviews but i am glad it didnt stop me. The game is really quite fun and very populated. Yes it does have an ingame cash shop but its kind of ironic in that people go spend a bunch of money and you kill them with a pistol you found and take it all.This was the first DayZ clone (that i know of) The first clone games always get a bad rep, and with a popular negative video review on top of that it just makes people get off on putting down on this game. Its stupid really.Overall, if you like zombie survival, open world pvp, and full loot type games, this is up your alley.			"

												Pros -1) Huge open world2) The Metascore doesn't lie, it really is worth 20/100Cons -1) Because the world is so big, it takes you hours to travel from one side of the map to the other...2) DayZ rip-off3) Hackers4) You have to pay to revive your character if they die, or you have to wait 24 hours to start playing again..5) You'll likely get killed within 20 minutes. Whether it be laggy zombies killing you, or other players who shoot on sight6) Doesn't look anything like in the screenshots7) You have to pay for literally everything, because you can't fight for sh*t with the flashlight you get, and finding a good weapon is very hard.

												Don't waste your money. This game used to be called The War Z, and recieved such bad reviews and bad press that the developers changed the name and went back to steam. For some reason Valve hasn't removed these scammers from their storefront, and refused to give me a refund despite the blatant false advertisementes all over there store page. Don't waste your money.			"

												This game is complete trash, do not even consider it.  And the metacritic score is 20, which is the lowest I have seen for any game ever.  I cant even get into a server, and when I do, the game feels like Team Deathmatch instead of trying to survive.  The zombie animations are also really really bad and they sound terrible.			"
