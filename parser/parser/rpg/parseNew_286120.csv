There is no quest.I didn't get to run.Now, I know a game's title shouldn't necessarily be the best descriptor of a game, but if your name is this generic you expect it to be justified. It is not.QuestRun is a good looking level-based turn based combat action game where you control up to 3 heroes as they fight through a series of waves of enemies. Combat is automatic except for unit positioning (there are 3 lanes, each lane can hold 1 hero and switching can be done at any time) and special abilities that charge up based on hits landed (1 per hero).So far so good (or... So far so ""I guess this is alright"").It starts falling apart when you realize that this is all there is.There are 4 dungeons, which just boil down to a series of combat waves. No exploration of any kind in between.Beyond that there are a number of optional quests that you use to unlock alternate forms of your heroes... which boil down to combat waves where your hero roster is predefined.Successfully finishing a level awards you with gold, crowns and crystals (the last one only if it was a dungeon) which are used to buy things in the store, passively unlock dungeons and quests and buy special things in the store respectively.If this sounds like a cash-store model that could support in-app purchases then you would be correct. Even though these features are (fortunately) not present in the Steam version the original Mobile app definitely had it.Finishing a level also resets ALL character progress, which within a level takes the form of equipment and a simplistic experience system.This means that, assuming you win, your hard work (levels can take well up to half an hour and allows no mid-level saving) will reward you with a measly bag of gold which will net you very little in the game shop.To give an example, dungeon gold gain is 200-300 per victory and a new hero class can easily cost 5000 gold.The currency rate appears to still be on ""cash shop"" mode, meaning what progress there is is very slow.Other than the combat there is NOTHING there.No semblance of a plot. No exploration. No backstory for the heroes, the world, the dungeon, the enemies, the quest.I was sorely disappointed by this game and do not recommend it.			"

												""I've never been so disappointed with a purchase, I'd rather play FIFA, and I HATE football/soccer""Oh boy this is going to be a long one...There is quite a lot wrong with this game, that simply makes it boring to play.My largest issue with this game is how it plays. Combat plays automatically while you do the strats (position your party, equip items, use items and skills), and thats the extent of your control aside for a few more minor things. At first that doesn't sound so bad, you might need to do certain things a certain way due to abilities your enemies might have. But this game has dumbed down everything that could potentially be challenging outside of direct combat:- Each character has a single skill. one. ONE!!!!!!! (I found that each actually has a team buff/debuff, but all of them weren't thought out very well, 2 classes even had the exact same one as well, which is a little bit silly).- Your characters are selected for you. WHY? Whats worse you need to pay in-game currency for the ability to select your characters? I don't understand what purpose it serves. You could say that it is to ease the player into the game, but that is BS since the game throws a full party of 3 people and those people are randomly selected out of the ones you can use, that doesn't sound like easing in.- Items stats are boring as f**k. Its a very simple add to damage, and any class can equip any weapon and shield and have it deal more damage than a weapon they would typically hold (I had a mage holding a sword that added 5 to damage. better than his staff).- A inventory system that I wish never exsisted. When your party picks up an item (which isn't notified very well to the player) it is added to the rather small inventory space, items are queued from the top and once you fill your inventory and find another item, the oldest item in your inventory is removed. What if I wanted to keep a potion? How can I stratergise if you don't give me the means to do so? You can't even remove an item from your inventory to bump a potion back to the top in order to keep. Why can't I do that? Seriously? It just seems a little bit stupid that I have to get rid of a useful potion for a god-awful weapon.Due to the lack of control the player has and the lack of information about how some of the game's simple game mechanics work during the tutorial, all combined with the simplicity of class and equipment stats and abilities... *sigh*I can't really say much about this game in its favour other than the visuals are pretty solid and the music isn't too bad, but the game keeps looping the same tracks over and over, so theres that.This game is bad, really bad. It's a bore to play and recommend none of you pick this up.			"

												Let's make a list of Pros and Cons, shall we?Pros:-Semi-challenging gameplay that feels rewarding-A varied roster of characters with some unique abilities-Fast paced combat that is definitely different from games I've played (Could be a con if you don't like fast games)-Some replay value in the Lost Treasure randomized mode-Random events that can help or hurt your dungeon runsCons:-As of right now there is NO options menu.-Game was clearly made for 720p and when the window is increased to 1080p there is a drop in quality.-Feels and plays kind of like a mini-game/flash game. Not that there's too much wrong with that, I just thought I'd throw it out thereOverall, this game is worth your time if the idea of it interests you. It's fast paced, semi-randomized, and quite a bit of fun. I would recommend that you look up some gameplay on it to see if you are really interested in this sort of game. Right now it's on sale until April 25th, so I highly recommend buying it sooner rather than later.First Impressions Video:

QuestRun has no main plot, no overarching goal and no real point. It contains no storyline, it contains no character motives, it has nothing engaging about it. Sadly, my impression of the game is that it’s a hollow mess. It has several good ideas on the surface and it seems set up to be a solid and fun game, but instead it falls short containing no depth and no particular reason to play.While arguably generic, I really liked the sprite artwork of this game. The backgrounds are particularly appealing although they felt empty at times. The character design is nice too, having influence from many japanese style games, as well as european history and mythology.The game looks bright, cheery and fun, but I really can’t find that anywhere in the actual game.In summary, this game aims high to try show off some good ideas in practice and otherwise attempts to do something very basic in the sense of its mechanics, and potentially have a  really fun game on their hands. But instead this feels as if it just got out of bed minutes before a final assignment is due.			"

BasicsQuestRun: a lite-RPG game with turn-based elements.Featuring bright, colorful visuals with appropriate music, QuestRun boasts to be a ""Challenging and fast-paced"" game that ""is unlike anything you have played before."" Does it really deliver on that promise? Let's find out.Gameplay is simple, offering only a small handful of attack types (Melee, Ranged, Magic). Both the Melee and Magic weapons attack the enemy directly in front of the user, with Ranged weapons allowing the character to assist an ally when no enemy is in front of them. A simple, but interesting mechanic.Characters also get a Special ability which can directly affect combat via team Heals, charming enemies, cast fire spells, or other abilities. Most also get access to a combat Stance, which can toggled on and off to grant a variety of bonus stats (usually at the cost of others).Little strategy is really needed due to the game's simple mechanics, with character placement generally being the most important choice you can make. Fortunately, slow combat allows plenty of time to make adjustments during a fight (with an option of 3x game speed for the bored). There are a variety of stats that can be utilized to improve your combat experiance; primaries such as Health, Defense, Magic Defense, Attack - and others such as Luck, Speed, Special, and Charisma. After bashing faces in, you can use that hard earned gold in the Meta Shop for stuff such as new characters, pets, and other features.Done Well Great Visuals - Clean, colorful graphics make this game visually appealing. Gameplay - Simple, but fun and enjoyable. Achievements - Uninspired kill X or do Y, but something realistic to work towards and easy to understand. Good for completionists. Music - Nothing amazing, but it fits the game's atmosphere and repetative listening from playing the game won't get irritating. Always a plus for a game. Cards - Despite the store page not being updated, QuestRun does support Steam Trading Cards. A nice addition for those that enjoy them.Where it Went WrongHere is where the otherwise pleasent experience breaks down and ultimately sways the recommendation into a negative rating. No Cloud Saves - QuestRun makes use of Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, but failed to include an important feature such as Cloud Saves, which becomes important when trying to play on multiple devices or preventing data loss. Optionless - Complete lack of game options such as sound volume, game resolution, or even fullscreen/window modes (no fullscreen support). Missing such basic functionality makes QuestRun feel like it was ported from a mobile platform, which is surprisingly inaccurate since the game is NOT available on android or iOS. Poor Performance - The game suffers from performance issues, often causing severe studdering, slowdowns, frequent freezes, and even memory leaks (that result in crashes) MORE Bugs - A handful of other prevelent bugs exist: waves not progressing, characters not attacking, stats not saving, progress being lost, game not installing, game not launching, among others.BottomlineQuestRun is a simple, yet interesting game that suffers from a lot of game disruptive bugs which detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.Unless the plethora of problems get addressed, I recommend users avoid QuestRun.

												QuestRun is a very simple looking game with so much potential in the tactics and strategies. So they game is pretty much about being lucky, smart and fast. Sometimes the game just takes a dire turn right on the 1st round because you couldnt think the situation through fast enough. On the other hand if you had, you will end up completing the dungeon really easy. There is a lot of different strategies you can think of. The monsters are different too, even if they look alike they might have different stats. Getting your pets and items is very important as well. Since choosing your crew and everything else is random, you will have to figure out how to make it work. Graphics are very simple and just really enjoyable to see for such simple game. Music fits perfectly too.

There's not much else to talk about once it comes to QuestRun. Mostly its the strats and your own luck that matters. The game may not be balanced very well, but once you get into it you will realize that it doesnt really matter. There are a lot of combos to try out, plus this game is an easy 100% achievement game! 


The best thing that I had going.

Once you finish the game, its probably over for you. It will be time to move on. It doesnt mean the game is bad, look at the price - super cheap and quit long, I d say about 10 hours is pretty good. To conclude, this game deserves the price. If there's no sale then just buy it. It will be hard at the beginning but you will get a hang of it quickly enough. Mostly recomended to people who like RPG and Turn-based Strategies genres.			"

												This is cute, but ultimately unsatisfying to play.In short, there are not enough player choices, and they don't matter as much as the whims of the Random Number Generator.Once a dungeon starts, your basic actions are limited to:_ Choosing which hero goes in which lane: Combat system is an ATB variant where 1-to-1 fights happen in each lane, with a few exceptions (if the RNG blesses you with the rare ranged weapon drop, for one). So you can manipulate combat and EXP gains by pulling the ol' switcheroo._ Activate character specials: Very often you'll want to click that ASAP, so not much of a choice._ Use potions/equip new loot: Again, little actual freedom here. Pick the bigger number and heal when health is low._ Pick your Level Up bonus once in a while.Compare/contrast with what the RNG determines:_ The loot you get: Get nothing but 10 +1 swords in a row, fail dungeon. Retry with the same party and stats (and basically the same strategy, since there's little leeway for that), get proper weapons, shields and potions and breeze through the level._ The random events you get: You could get a real good weapon drop from the gnome! Or have to choose between losing 1/3 of your party or all your inventory. Five times in a row._ The stat increases you can pick, out of 3, at level-up time. Need more health, or a stronger special? Why not have more charisma instead, or maybe some magic attack for that knight guy!So what you do, what you actually have influence on, matters way too little compared to sheer luck (not the stat, you, the player's luck -- well, maybe if you're into that Quantified Self thing you think of it as a stat) (which is pretty grating, FYI, you NERD).UI's a bit clumsy too (for instance: only the highest charisma in the party matters, so you have to memorize who that is or pause when you have the option of a charisma increase), and it feels somewhat grind-heavy / free-to-play-ish (you can get pets/merchants to mitigate the RNG, but 1. it's not nearly enough and 2. they cost a looot, and heeey is that a second type of currency?).Anyway, skip.

												The graphics are cute/cartoony. The music is not terrible, but not great either. Pretty much standard fare. Thing I'd take issue is, theres nothing Ive seen so far for this game to have the tag of ""RPG"". Theres no story to speak of (that Ive found yet anyway, granted I've only done 3 missions). Basically, theres a map with different missions you can choose. Choosing a mission gives you a brief description of it. Such as ""Protect the princess"" or what have you. Then it goes right to the battle.It looks like your typical JRPG, with your PCs on one side, enemies on the other. Each PC can only attack the enemy in front of it, except for certain items or abilities allow you to attack others. Each PC has a special ability that it can use based on the type of class it is. Attacks are in real time and keep going whether you want them to or not, as soon as a time bar is filled, the attack is made). Items are randomly dropped into a 4 slot thing at the left, when a new one drops you lose the one in the 4th slot. They are anything from weapons and armor, to scrolls that raise your level (NOT as big of a deal as in a real RPG) and potions with various effects.So enemies come in waves, with up to 3 on screen at different time. The final wave is a boss and there is a couple points in each mission where either you get to choose something good (healing, a good random item) or bad (cant gain exp, slowed down ect)Its an ok tablet-style casual game, but besides the fact that the classes are traditional D&D classes and you gain EXP which makes your characters better, theres *nothing* about this game that could be considered an RPG.I'd call it casual, maybe strategy. Based on the fact that the fun lies in switching your characters places to take hits and knowing when to use your special skill and who to put items on. But definitely not an RPG at all.RPG =/= fantasy setting.			"

												Well... That's a disappointing game. Unless I did things the wrong way, there's no ending to it. After an interesting few minutes learning how to play the game and the 'intricacies' of its system, you just grind and grind and grind, everything seems to be badly balanced, and in the end you get nothing. You just finish the last dungeon, and there's no more content.That's too bad. I usually try to support French developers, but this here was a completely pointless experience. I even forgot to write a review for it, which tends to prove my point...PS: if there IS a way to trigger an ending, please tell me!			"

I actually liked the concept alot, i love JRPGs with a really deep battle system where a boss fight can last half hour or more.This game is not that, despite the marketing. The battle system is shallow, automated and dull, offering little strategy and none of the satisfaction of issuing direct orders to characters each turn. You feel extremely detached from the ""action"" and i was bored with this game in an astonishingly short amount of time, in fact i will admit that i have not given the game a fair playtime i was that annoyed with what i did play.there is no story.I also could not find an options menu anywhere in the game, meaning u have no control at all over visual settings or audio levels. Unacceptable, this is Steam, not the AppStore.I will say that the games presentation is well done although the character and monster designs are a little uninspired.			"

												Quest Run is a mobile game and like a lot of these games, it's a PC port of a game created with a microtransaction system in though.Which means a tremendous difficulty and a progression more based on luck than skills. Besides, there're not real skills, you quickly understand some mecanics, errors not to du in caracter progression etc,  but 95% of the game is luck, luck and luck. When a ""side quest"" supposed to be a preparation for the main dungeon is unfinishable, and in the end you manage better the main dungeon (after several tries of course), something is wrong.I got this game for free and I almost want to get a refund.

												This game is really boring. Not much strategy to it, all you do is watch your guys attack enemies. The battles are really uber boring.There's barely any animations, which makes watching your guys even more boring.This feels like a flash game, and it's barely worth the time to download. if it was free I would still tell you to avoid it. Steer clear of this piece of crap at all costs.To sum it up, quoting another reviewer: "" The battle system is shallow, automated and dull, offering little strategy and none of the satisfaction of issuing direct orders to characters each turn.

												It’s hard for me to give QuestRun a bad recommendation but it would be hard for me to give this a good recommendation as well. The mechanics are fun, but it’s a tiresome game if you have little to no patience. You have three heroes chosen at random and can switch their places. They take whacks at enemies and you chose when you activate their special powers. It sounds fun on paper, but this game is difficult. It takes a bit to get around the difficulty and strategy of this game. If you have patience and enjoy strategy games, then go for it, but if you lack patience then skip it. No dialogue, no storyline, just tosses you in to figure it out. Cute artwork, but as far as I can tell, no options to turn down the sound? Bummer. Have fun! 5/10			"

												I have plenty of other fitting names for this game and one of them would be ""Unfair run"". This game is not balanced well and in some runs you will die faster than you can yell ""Where are the good upgrades?!"". If you will have a good run is mostly dependant on luck, as some runs you just don't get upgrades that will help you survive until the very end. It gets  tedious to be near the end and then have one monster literally oneshotting all your characters because none of them got any magical defense. Still, as frustrating as it is, I have had fun with it. So if you don't like infuriating games due to bad mechanics, then I'd advice you to stay away from this game.Good StuffColorful graphics Even though the characters move as if they are stuck in a constant lag, I still liked the character design and artwork. It's cute with enough detail. Randomized funGames will hardly feel the same as there are different upgrades per run, making you either superpowerful or struggling to stay alive. It's rewarding when you're strong, and intense when you are on the weak side. There is also a random event where you migt get a bonus or you get something bad happening. This also adds to the game feeling fresh and different on each run.Bad stuffFrustration overloadThis game has wanted me to smash my keyboard more than a thousand times. It's infuriating when you're having a semi good run and BAM! All monsters oneshots you in three seconds and it's game over. There's no possible ways to win certain runs unless you get the exact upgrades you need. Wonky combat systemWhile hitting the monsters is automatically handled by the characters, you have to rearrange them on the field to make weak characters stay out of powerful enemies way and make casters be able to attack the correct monster. Even though you can slow down the combat to a certain point, it doesn't eliminate the fact that sometimes you have just a few seconds to swap out your characters before they're literally oneshotted by the enemy. Some characters can't survive well against certain monsters, so you literally have to move them within 2 seconds that the monster appears on the screen. Sometimes this happens at the very start of the game. There are so many times where my characters are taking massive hits because I am struggling to manage spellcasting and moving them to the right spot. I wish there had been a setting to turn off the automated system and let you select a choice without a time limit. Most fights, I find myself constantly hitting the heal button and tossing potions around, because the characters are taking so massive amount of damage. Sometimes my characters are near death and I just barely manage to get them back up in health. Other times, I miss by half a second and they die. This is my least favorite part of the game.			"

												Good casual Flash game, nothing more.  I don't recommend this game as a purchase, but if you can get it for free, it's definitely a challenge to play and has a decent presentation. The game offers very little permanent progression, but that adds to the challenge of seeing how far you can get into a quest with the default items or slightly upgraded items from the unlockable shop.  You can also unlock a few extra character choices and a few bonus 'pets' which further enhance the gameplay with many strategy elements.  I personally like the rogue character because he can get tons of items from the enemies.  Keep the rogue at a low damage rating and get a shield character to protect him and you can rack up near endless items for leveling up your characters.Now, there are some bad points to this game.  The first you'll notice is the lack of an exit button.  Of course, that's no big deal, because you can click the window's close button.  That made me think about full-screen, but it turns out that the game does not allow full-screen mode.  Beyond the technical flaws already mentioned, the gameplay elements aren't as explained as they should be.  Some of the unlockables required a currency that I was not gaining from anything I did in the game, and I had to look up guides to figure out what was required to get that currency.  I quit the game after several hours of repetitively killing the same monsters trying to get characters through the first dungeon and admittedly failing close to the end.  I found it a little frustrating that there was no continue option to start with the same characters at the moment before the level they died on.  It took a lot of experimentation to figure out a strategy to get through the bulk of the first level and I still could not keep my characters alive, so I decided to quit and play something that has more entertainment value rather than keep playing only to grind through the same level over and over again.  That said, I found the game fun for maybe 2 hours, and I would play it again if I didn't have so many other games I want to play which could be a lot more fun.If you can get this game for less than $2, it may be worth that price, but otherwise, I suggest you find something more worthwhile.

I'd advise you to stay away, it is basically a glorified phone game where you just kinda watch little dudes fight. Read my review and decide for yourself.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR ""I was fortunate to get this for $2, and I can't even say it's worth that.""Although it looks charming, I can't recommend this to anyone. And I thoroughly enjoy Gauntlet and Dynasty Warrior, other often mindless, near objectiveless games.Sure, I don't have much time played, but as is with phone games, you know if you actually want to play something within the first few minutes of playing.Upon starting the game, I was met with no direction and ""Play"" and ""Shop"" buttons. I immediately expected a Cash Shop but luckily it was no such thing. Just an ingame shop to offer the illusion of open endedness and customization.So about the ""gameplay"", if you wanna call it that. The characters are set on an auto attack but you can move them from top to mid to bottom lanes to say, protect them or continue the fight in another lane after one has died. Every so often there is a little event when you hit a milestone in a quest. You level up, you get new gear and you get ♥♥♥♥ on by RNGesus. That is pretty much the game in a nutshell.At the top of this page, it says;""Challenging and fast-paced with a modern twist on old school RPG battle systems, QuestRun is unlike anything you have played before.""There is no challenge to a game that plays itself and fast-paced is if you have it on fast foward. If by modern they meant ""Plays like a cheap cellphone game!"" then yeah, I could see that. As far as ""old school RPG battle systems"" goes, I remember actually getting to choose what my characters did. And that last line? Oh trust me, I have played bad games before.I was fortunate to get this for $2, and I can't even say it's worth that.			"

												Where do I start.. This game doesn't even deserve to be reviewed but its necessary for future potential buyers.Quest Run has a terrible scaling.I assure you that the first two levels which are labeled as tutorial will be too easy that you think you got the gist of the game and then, here comes the newly unlocked map after tutorial and things go bizarre.  Enemies HP are too high and you'll be sh*tting your pants before you even understand the other features of the game.Quest Run has no story.Nope. No story/plot. No character backgrounds. You basically control different types of warriors god knows where they came from and what are they doing in this 'unknown' world and what are they fighting. nope.. nothing.Quest Run is a bit confusing at start to many.Tutorial is just one easy level. It's not really a tutorial. I basically guess everything on how things work in the game since I couldn't read the hints during loading screen. (My PC loads too fast) I'm not sure if they are actually helpful.Lack of features.No options, There's basically nothing in the game except the map where you choose levels from and a shop that doesnt even have descriptions on what purpose they serve in the game.Full of frustrationsOh look a shop! Where's the description? oh there it is! oh, what a helpful description. *sarcasm* ok I'll earn for this and see what it does. *grinds gold* *bought* oh wow, how do I use it..? *discovers dungeon mode* oh there goes the stuff I bought funny how I spent time earning it and its literally irrelevant to the story game progression since ever level is a different kind of party.

												I've had some fun with the game, but it has too many flaws for me to recommend it in good conscience. Not only is it difficult, it is unfair, luck-based and has obscure mechanics, making the difficulty a drawback rather than a draw (I love difficult games). The mouse controls are awkward and the keyboard controls are insufficient and insufficiently configurable. Then the gameplay is repetitive and it hardly ever feel like you're making progress.On the other hand, the art is cute and the system is original. So it might be the game for you if you don't mind bashing your head against a wall repeatedly until you're lucky enough for the thing to break, or if you don't mind regularly getting wiped through no fault of your own (I don't). You also have to enjoy repetitive micro-management (I do).If that's the case, and if you like puzzling out how things work over many failed runs, you should get this. It was carefully crafted and definitely plays differently than most game of Steam (you're more likely to find similar while looking through flash games).			"

												I was dissatisfied with the lack of game in it. I dislike the combat system and that is the only interactive part to an otherwise contentless game, unless there is something to be had by completing all the levels, but I'm finding it difficult to find motivation to finangle the game to that point.

												Skating the edge of unfairly hard and well balanced.   Making it through the main missions and side quests is a balance of getting lucky with level up effects, and making the most of hero powers.  With some help from the guides, and a combo of assassin and blacksmith, I was able to make a little progress.   After that it felt like there was a 'right' way to progress, which kind of made me lose interest.  Bad, lazy reviewer.Positives: interesting and simple mechanics - swap characters to balance damage, activate powers, and level up.  Complete missions for bonus powers, and to buy characters and other advantages.  The side quests are tightly balanced, so you won't succeed on the first try or ten, but by the skin of your teeth when you do.Negatives: feels padded and a bit grindy, for those simple mechanisms.  Not all characters and abilities are useful.  Significant random element in leveling, and party make-up.			"

												QuestRun is a semi-turn-based rpg battle game. Basically it's like playing Final Fantasy VII's battles only, without the plot and materia managing etc. You assign items, potions and skills on the fly while new enemies appear in waves. Your random classed characters can be revived with a health potion and their places may be switched to choose which enemy they fight against. There is no feeling of progression since you get new heroes for each level.After few ""dungeons"" I already felt that I've seen everything that this game can offer to me. Sure there are some unlockables and pets, classes and such but the amount that those affect the gameplay is insignificant in my books. By the time I purchased this game it didn't have options menu at all and no way to go full screen which was a terrible flaw in ""finished product"". My biggest problem was that this game feels like a mobile game, shallow and meant for very short gameplay sessions. If you're in search for something deep, this is definitely not it.			"

												While the game is fun for a while, the insane difficulty makes everything except the tutorial levels a chore. It's basically a game of chance balanced so that you only have the slimest of chances of beating a level if you make all the right choices. It's not so much a matter of getting better at the game, as it is getting lucky with random events. For example, each time one of your characters levels up, it randomly selects three (out of about ten) skills you can choose from to increase. For each character there are about 2 skills that are vitally important and another 3 that are useful. So you HAVE to get lucky in the skill selections to succeed. You also need to get lucky in item drops.Even once you know what you are doing, you have at best about a 5% chance of beating a level. If this were closer to 25% it would be tolerable, but as it is it's just terrible.A Small Revision:After I found out that you can farm the blue crystals by replaying the first dungeon over and over, the game does become fun. Still there's definately a failure of design if it only becomes fun after you unlock everything.Except for the last dungeon, which starts your non-leveled heros up against three final bosses, I guess as a joke?

												Despite having a mobile feel, the game is actually fun to play and it offers challenging gameplay mechanics.Pros:- Mechanics: the developer tried to make a good unique mechanics. I think this is why we play indie games.- Involves lots of planning when it comes to character levelling, have to figure out the best strategy stat-wise if you want to win.- Difficulty. It is hard to play, but it is also very rewarding.Cons:- No settings, resizing game windows makes game blurry- Some stats feel useless (Charisma? Only to get a chance for better look @ one random game event?)- ... Difficulty. I loved it, but it might be too much for someI'd say wait for sale, but definitely grab it if goes at 50%+ off.My brief game review:

												Broken in a lot of ways.  1) Automated actions kill the enjoyment of what's pretending to be a turn-based RPG.  2) the lack of an options screen is a sin to PC gaming itself, no matter fidelity, a user should have the option to control volume.  3) There is no real direction.  Yeah there are pop-ups telling you what what different buttons do during the first level.  However, all the while, the timer is ticking by, not leaving the player time to understand all that is being thrown at them.  A failed attempt at conveyance if I' ever saw one.This is a ""game"" in the loosest sense of the word, but it is definitely not worth your hard earned money.  Rather than a game, this is an iPhone app a mom distracts her kid with while she drags them shopping.			"

												First of all, the game is quite hard and it takes a relatively long time to master it. Once you get familiar with the QuestRun, you can't stop playing - unless the art style bothers you. It's really important to check all the stats of your characters and when you're in the fight, alter their positions. Luck is also a very important factor which leads to the victory. If you'll get a nice, powerful item early in the game, most likely you'll win the level. Alter the position of your chars, use special powers often and watch your luck. QuestRun is a nice, casual game which helps me to relax. Congratulations to the creators for making such a nice little gem!			"

												Only about a dozen levels and it randomizes the hero selection and pet selection you get (forces you to pay for rerolls), which means you get to try out new combinations but waste a lot of time with bad combinations. I regret buying extra pets which just worsen my chance at winning. The game difficulty is such that you need certain combinations to have a better chance at clearing the level so it's annoying you can't pick and choose. However, if they did let you choose, the game would be a lot shorter. This isn't really a full game, just an extended mini-game around a decent concept. As released, it doesn't have $9 of content. Maybe worth it for mobile prices (~$2-3)			"

												THIS GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!! Everything unlocked is randomly assigned. Be careful what you unlock, because once you unlock an item or character or helper, it gets added to the rotation, which increases the randomness of any particular mage-fighter-helper combinations.The enemies level up faster than your characters. Your charcter gains don't carry over from level to level.2 characters - the priest and bard - are too weak to make it past the first fight 50%. Even if you devote all your resources to keeping them alive and leveled-up, they won't level up as fast as the enemies. And the vampire loses 2 hp/sec. He won't last past the third round. (There are about 50 rounds per level.)The only way to regain characters is to get potions, but getting positions is unlikely, and even then only brings them up to 25% health or so. There's no point in wasting a potion on a weaker character, and no point contnuing once a party is at less than full strength. On top of losing characters during battles, there are between-round ""fortunes/misfortunes. You could get an inventory full of potions, or you could lose one of your characters between rounds.This game really sets the gamer up to fail.I've played this			"

												I wish this game did a better job of advertising its difficulty level.  I thought I was buying a casual game, but that's not what I got.Quest Run is a cute game that doesn't try to be anything grand, and it succeeds at what it does.  You have several different classes of adventurers with limited equipment slots and skills, some ability to maneuver them, and a couple of random events - and that's about it.  The art style is pleasing, and it's easy to pick up in a short time.However, the game is punishing.  I was shocked when, in the middle of a tutorial, my entire party was slaughtered.  That was a taste of things to come: I soon found that trying to go beyond the two tutorial dungeons meant losing every single time - hardly a lot of fun, or what I expected.  You did gain some gold from each attempt, fail or succeed, but that's it - nothing else stayed with you.  There was no sense of levelling up your characters or equipment - in fact, you were assigned different characters in each dungeon, meaning that you didn't really get to know their strengths and weaknesses without replaying the raid.  A lot.And you have to replay a lot: there are some upgrades you can buy, like pets with abilities or additional classes, but they cost thousands of gold pieces - and you get around 150 for finishing a quest.  If you need an upgrade to seize victory, then you're going to have to replay the same raid dozens of times to save up enough - and then hope that it was worth it, since the descriptions are vague at best.I get the impression that QuestRun is a lot like FTL or Rogue Legacy, both roguelike games in which there is a steep learning curve, and you're not expected to survive to the end of the game until you've put dozens of hours into it.  There certainly is a skill to playing QuestRun, as you come to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each class and try out different strategies.  I just with the game held your hand a little more, or that you had the chance to play through a quest or two that wasn't a tutorial without having your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by the game.  Otherwise, you end up feeling like the developer is laughing at your feeble efforts, and that's hard to enjoy.  In the end, QuestRun is a good game, but not a game I can enjoy.  I wanted something that would be fun from the beginning, and instead I got a game that requires a lot of time and effort.  A lot of people will enjoy that, but I have other games I play when I want that.  I don't feel ripped off, but I wish I'd read the forums before buying.   "

												Questrun is advertised as a J-RPG inspired tactical game with rogue-like elements and deep engaging gameplay. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver on both sides. At the first look the game looks very simplistic when you start it up with less than 15 missions. The problem with the game is that it tries too hard to look like a mobile gameIn the same time, the game has massive issues when it comes to customization. You can move units around, have less than 5 types of weapons and shields and three types of potions. The game is essentially move your strongest guy from a position to another and hope he does not miss. The problem with the game is that your characters will miss a lot, and there is no stat to counter this issue.Another issue with the game is the shop they have in-game. Essentially before the mission you can buy items and roll characters with the gold bought. The shop itself has a very poor selection and the only way to get better items is basically to grind missions in order to earn more gold to upgrade the shop and get better items before starting another mission.The biggest issue this game has is unbalance. The monsters you fight are essentially too strong and they will destroy your heroes even when you have a tank and two supports. The difficulty is even worse since they can dodge your attacks and there is no way to negate the dodge. The enemy mages are also extremely strong and coupled with a couple of events which happen randomly (good or bad, though mostly bad events) taking your potions away, and you will fail the mission.Overall, I would not recommend the game to anyone, no matter how cheap it is due to all the problems the game has.For our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/To begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group "

												Simply put... this game is boring. The problem is a lack of options, and there really nothing to do. There is not many things that you can do to change the tides of battle, and the things you can do don't really seem worth the effort. All you do in this game is watch as your randomly set up party wails on enemys. You can change their equipment and use special abilities, but in the end it really doesn't do that much. I honestly had a bit of fun with this game at the beginning, but the lack of options and crippling lack of a real ""Party"" really detriments it. It's just annoying having characters level up and not being able to use them later. It's just boring.			"

												Im actually starting to enjoy the game. Its a tough game with really some balance and some not. You may get lucky or not. Its a tough game that if you lose 1 person it might be hard to get him up again during combat. You have to focus on each person literally every second, if not you may just cost yourself the battleProsItem shop UpgradesMusicNice conceptcons			"

												I tried 3 seperate times to get into QuestRun, but found the level of difficulty in the 3-5th levels to be too high for the lack of enjoyment I was having. It may be an awesome game, but be aware there is a large commitment for entry. I personally did not feel as though the random elements were implemented correctly. Unlike skill-based combat roguelikes, such as Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy, this game is more of a strategy-focused combat roguelike. In skill-based combat, an entire run of bad luck feels as though it is partially the player's fault, for not being good enough. However, in strategy-focused combat, an entire run of bad luck feels out of the player's control. Even if a player does everything right, the bad luck can force a failure. (For the record, I do not count quick movement of the mouse to manage party members to be skill, as the core of this game is to use the correct strategies to approach situations.)As such, I feel as though this game could use a little normalizing of the RNG. Also, it feels very unforgiving of mistakes, which considering it is a roguelike, are not always apparent until after they are made. But I digress, I am bad at the game, so all of these complaints could be unfair or unjust.			"

												Hi everyone.First of all - I want to tell that I am a fan of RPG, especially tactical turn-based RPG. Questrun - is a tactical RPG with non direct control with your heroes.All gameplay can be desribed just in some sentences - you choose your team, when you play main quest, or you play with a team, that was given to you in sidequest. All heroes in you team have stats - health, physical/magical attack, attack speed, physical/magical defend, luck, charisma and etc. Also all of them have special skills - heal, fireball, icewall, stun, etc. The game starts and waves of foes become to attack you team. The power of you attack depends on your stats - better them - more damage you do,better defense - less damage make your foes. And it's all.All game is built on a simple mechanics, but it works perfect. It's really interesting to find strategy vs your foes. This game is realy HARD. Sometimes it seemed that there is no way to win in a mission, and you have to start many-many times to win the scenario.If you - are the old school games and you like tactics and rpg - you like it.Strongly recommended.

												Very fun game with tons of replay value. Only downside is you don't get to keep your leveled characters after you beat a dungeon. You are back to square one. This game is more of a trial and error, really. If you can understand the enemies and know how best to use your items, than it's a sealed deal. It's a really enjoyable game with beautiful graphics and a very simple set up. I also enjoy the fact you can speed it up and slow it down whenever you feel it's needed to be done. Overall a 8/10.

												This is a real-time strategy game themed as an RPG with auto-attacking. Difficulty scales up quickly. Animation is minimal but the art style itself is fine. I do wish it showed more information about characters I'm not currently selecting because the battle gets frantic fast. If you can forgive its short-comings then it's a fun game.			"

												I'd lie if I said this commend is for everyone.The game is great to waste 10-20 mins in a break at work and you really have to be INTO this kind of games to enjoy it. I'm kind of the farmer type in these games so I enjoy my time farming the first dungeon to buy stuff in the shop.Mechanichs are kind of meh. The game basically plays in it's own and you just have to press 1-2 buttons and switch the heroes positions.More info in the other comments in which people complain :D			"

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/286120		

this is a real time rpg with no dungeon crawling, just battles.there are 12 levels of wave like rpg fights, 4 will have a lobby before you start, here you can pick your party of 3 (out of 15) characters with 1 or 2 random sidekicks, & 3 random equipment that you can buy that will start in your inventory. in battles your characters are on auto attack but you can swap/use items and also use stances/abilities any time they are ready and after every few waves you'll get a choice from 2 events ranging from a death, or poisoning, to being healed or getting/losing potions/items. instead of abilities using mp after each use and before you can use them again you need to take a few hits & each character also has a stance that will increase a stat but lower some others. sidekicks will do different things when you give them an item like make a potion, make a weapon/shield, heal, give xp, or attack. there is a inventory on the left that you can drag stuff that pops up on to your characters or sidekicks, you get 1 item after you take out a group or steal it but after you have 4 items the 5th will make you drop the bottom one. items can be melee weapons, magic weapons, shields, guns for shooting outside your lane, & potions that will heal or revive allies some also will add a temp. buff. as you kill enemies you'll get levels where you can pick 1 of 3 randomly picked states out of 9 (stats ups can increase phys attack, mag attack, defense, mag defense, dodge, speed, charisma, luck, and hp).the game can get hard since you start at level 1 for each battle and do to the randomness of levels and item drops.

												This feels like a mobile game, but it has cute artwork and a catchy, non-obtrusive soundtrack. If you want a simple strategy game that ramps up the difficulty fast, I would recommend it. It doesn't have any plot, it's tutorial is kinda lacking (but the game is simple enough that you figure it out anyway) and I wouldn't recommend playing the game in full-screen, as the graphics get a little stretched out, but overall it's a great little game.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!

												Great to pass the time, quite challenging .Can fight through a number of encounters no problem until suddenly you start to feel weaker than your foes and eventually they will kill you without much problem. running out of potions/other heals quickly even if used as limited as possible.Theres a problem that you cant put the game in full screen mode for some reason. (using Asus T100).I'd really want to see more abilities than just 2 for a character.I couldn't pass through a single dungeon, just got passed 3 side quests for different character profile. (game is hard and relentless).Still not quite sure which stat is best to raise everytime, tried raising charma for the Gnome but then I never get him to show up which is disappointing.Also tried to raise Luck but even at 18 it doesn't seems to help too much.Guess you better raise the Special for character with healing and attack/speed for everyone else.Still I'd recommend this for anyone with a computer not built for triple A titles or for someone who likes an unfair challenge and have some time, this game kills time(and you) easy.

												QuestRun is a strangely addictive game that runs on a pretty simple premise: 3 characters fight baddies at a high pace by utilizing random equipment, stances, powers, and auto-attacks. That yields a rather complex little bugger that you may end up pouring a lot of time into. As others have said, it does end up feeling more like a flash game than anything else, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. If the lack of plot and repetitive nature doesn't bother you, you'll end up playing for quite a while. Do try to buy it on sale if at all, though. I feel it's base price is kinda steep for the content and it's related problems.			"

Tl;dr :It would be a fun little free flash game, but lacks any semblance of depth or replayability.QuestRun is a mobile game that was ported to Steam, I went into the game knowing as much, so I wasn't expecting a full-fledged mini RPG or anything. With that said, the game still lacks depth and ends up playing like a simple flash game. The entire experience completely depends on how much the RNG gods grace you with team-comp, item drops, and hits/misses. For the most part you just spend your time switching between your 3 characters and pressing their single skill button as soon as it's done charging. The best way I can describe it is kind of like Clicker Heroes without any clicking.			"

												Tough crowd here...  I don't feel this game is getting a fair shake.  This is not Chrono Trigger.  This is not FF7.  This is less than ten bucks and if you pay more than five you're either a generous, impatient person or you're not trying...  It's a cool RPG variation that has a casual approach but is hard as nails to win.  I played this quite a bit before it was greenlit and always had fun with it.  The battle structure is simple.  Each member of your party has one basic attack.  You give them assorted gear like sheilds, weapons etc.  You level them up and pick what specs you want to buff.  In real time.  You also move the  characters around to  protect them or put them in a better strategic position.  It looks like a light, casual game but it's pretty hard to beat.  This game isn't a deep JRPG experience.  Quest Run is it's own thing and has sort of a tower defense/rts vibe without any of those mechanics if that makes any sense at all.Also note that this point, nearly every bad review that's up was from a player that has spent less than an hour with the game.   It's fun but doesn't start to make sense until you've done a bit of grinding and put a couple hours in.Full disclosure: I haven't played it yet on steam but I've put at least 5 hours into it before it made it here.

												I do not write reviews, but this game was insulting enough to warrant one.The game feels very incomplete.There is minimal interaction and little to no planning involved for gameplay. The majority of the combat is automated and RNG, including party set-up. It is pretty bold for this game to be throwing out the terms ""roguelike"" and ""JRPG"" to falsely appeal to the crowd. Do not be fooled by the video and screenshots, only to be extremely disappointed after playing it. The game's attempt at difficulty is a joke and the ""challenges"" leaves the player with no satisfaction. The lack of a ""Settings and Options"" is frustrating enough; at the very least allow the user to adjust volume..? The soundtrack used is plain terrible, does not suit the game at all.I would strongly advise against this purchase. The game reflects the absence of effort and care the creator put into their product. (opinion) I feel they were just trying to make quick cash by throwing together a last minute project. Definitely worked since I was stupid enough to buy it. Honestly, to have to pay for this game is a scam alone... I am dumbfounded how this game made greenlit and onto Steam. But whatever, this is where some games go as a last resort before it dies.			"

												This game is interesting for the sale price of 4.49 I would buy all over again. The play style is interesting. First off when you die you lose and start over again, the second thing that makes this game enjoyable is you can swap characters to different positions at will. So if you have a healer and a tank, and your healer is taking too much dammage you can swap places with the tank. Another interesting feature is items, you have 4 slots on the left side of the screen that can hold an item, every round you pass you gain an item. The items quality is based off of a certain stat, which is unique because you can literally upgrade your fighters during battle. There are other aspects to the game that make it unique, I have to admit like others I was dissapointed when my fighters auto attacked, but after playing for a bit I understand why the game was created this way. It can be fast paced and requres your attention at every turn, constant micro management is a must and being forced to tell one of your fighters to attack would be detramental.			"

												I'd reccomend it, but only if you get it for a really decent price. I'd say it would be a tentative buy at 2.50 or so.There's not a lot of content here. The game has a pretty sharp learning curve and there's a point where it just turns into a brick wall that I can't even get past.Basically you get dropped into a rush mode of enemy combatants, for every 3 combatants you kill you get a level up, which lets you upgrade one of 3 randomized stats including defense, magic defense, attack, magic attack, luck, etc.Really the only interaction you have with the game is microing your team's positions and using their spells. There's a x3 speed multiplier at the bottom of the screen, you'll spend a lot of time in this mode.I find that about 9/10 times, you die before you reach the boss of the dungeon. You get some gold and stuff to spend on items that make it marginally easier (but not much) the next time around.It's a fun time waster for a couple of hours. If this doesn't sound like your type of game, then it's not. don't buy it. if it's on sale and you're intrigued, pick it up and waste a couple hours.			"

												Luckily I bought this game on sale for very little money.  The upgrades to your characters are temporary, giving you very little option to customise your characters to make them stronger.  Basically your ability to win relies on RNG, which is just time consuming and makes for very boring, repetitive gameplay until you actually find yourself winning.			"

												A fun little game, good for burning a few hours. There is quite a bit to do, but it's all sort of the same. Variation for each run comes in the form of your party members and how you choose to equip them and level them up. There are main dungeons where you use a randomized group of adventurers, and side dungeons, where you have a preset group designed to challenge you in different ways.This game is very passive, so don't pick it up if you like dictating the action. The fun comes from micromanaging your characters' positions and special abilities each battle. There is no story, it's just a fun way to burn a few hours.			"

												This is a casual game made for ios and offers little depth or strategy. The entire game is turned based combat and not much else. The combat is focused on luck and speed. Your characters level up as they kill more enemies and you collect items after every round. This game gets a negative  review for one reason...the difficulty. The difficulty is very unbalanced. Sometimes you will die very quickly and other times you will make it very  far into the level. The difficulty is based mostly on luck and that can get be very frustrating especially in the later levels. If you can get this game in a bundle or very cheap then it may be worth your time, otherwise you could easily look elsewhere for something more engaging. "

												This game is bad. After the first 2 quests, you'll die, and die, and die even more.It feels like it's all based on luck, you can make the best strategy with the (always too few) resources you have and still lose without hope.The most annoying thing is that when you level up you can't even chose what skill to enhance. Some quests you have 0 luck and lose all of your items or one of your team dies, others you have 20 luck and happens the same thing.The game would be surely enjoyable with a MUCH better balance of the quests. This is not a game for hardcore gamers, it's just a broken game.3/10			"

												I was... Very quickly bored.Very little action or actual choice involved, as you can begin a dungeon and leave the computer to go do whatever it is you do with food in a kitchen- mostly thanks to the lack of strategy, events, or just about anything interesting. At all.The animation of the figures appears to keep changing, and I was at first fooled into thinking that the game was running at about 5FPS, when Fraps said 60. I don't even know how they pulled that off.The music is boring and repetative, and I kind of want to strangle whoever made that design choice.Actually, it reminds me of the first Final Fantasy game released in the US; you know, the rubbish one where you basically pressed A throughout the entire thing and read a magazine off to the side.This is exactly the same as that, except with even less required effort on the part of the player.Shameful.On the positive side, you can... Play it? I don't actually....Oh, yes; trading cards! Wait, I don't care about those... never mind.Cheers!-Camolot			"

												QuestRun is a fun little game where all you do is have a team of 3 characters with different classes try to fight though series of monsters and bosses. The characters can be unlock by beating certain levels or purchasing using in-game golds/crystals. Furthermore, there are also pets that offer different kinds of abilities that can be unlocked too. During a run, random item drops occur after each battle and random events happen after each sections of a run that will influence the difficulity of that run. There are in theory various combinations of characters that can be form to beat each level, but from my experience it became Sorcerer as main damage dealer in combination with Warrior for Protact stance and Priest for Heal, and allow Sorcerer to gain most the experience and later carry the run by himself.Overall the game is fun at least for the first playthough, but does not seem to offer much replay value unless you want to unlock everything and thus having to keep playing the levels over and over again,			"

												Ok so I have a really high threshold for bad games. My friends will say a game is terrible and i'll defend it,  because I have bad taste.With that said, this is a terrible game. I hate to be one of those ""omg a mobile app game!!!"" because I don't care. That's a dumb complaint and those are dumb threads, so stop posting them, but this is a game where if you made that thread, i'd agree with you.It doesn't translate well on a computer at all because gameplay consists of switching spots occassionally with your three characters and waiting for them to ever so slowly kill the thing in their way (It's so bad that even the 3x Speed battles take minutes), only to do the same thing again.And again.And again.If you got this game in a bundle, just idle for the cards and delete this game from your harddrive and never look back. I play these types of games when I am trying to fall asleep since I have sleep issues, but this game is boring it's bad boring.. or maybe badoring. I may call Merriam-Webster to see if I can get that word into the next dictionary.Anyway. Please don't buy this game. Donate the money to charity instead. Donate it to a Multiple Sclerosis charity... any charity. Just don't buy this game. Even if the Steam sale is 90% off. That money is better going to charity.			"

												I bought this game for £2.99, of which, I have certainly got my money back.There is practically no storyline, so don't expect one.You are just thrown into battles which are VERY hard to beat until you've shopped a bit (ingame money) - So expect some grind.BUT.The game is highly addictive. All you want to do is beat the damn level, the game is set up that the smallest decisions could be the difference between winning and losing quite hard. It has its obvious mages/swordsman - And these types of units are obviously better equipped to fight certain enemies other than the former etc. And so there are tactics involved - You cannot pause the game, forcing quick action decisions. Overall for the price I'd full recommend the game if you're looking for something to play while doing something else, but if you're looking for a storyline or something to fulfill you, then I wouldn't.

												Cutesy graphics, but that's about all this game has to offer. I guess it's more fun to watch the paint dry than watching poorly animated fights with almost zero input from the player. You can't choose your party for the fights, so technically there are no quests - only challenges. Maybe it worked on mobile platforms, you could play it while waiting for a bus or something and get equally bored as if you're doing nothing, but this just won't cut it on PC.Bottom line - don't buy this game!

												I've been trying to advance through levels, but in order to beat each side quest/dungeon, you need luck. There is no skill involved, just luck. Sometimes you'll have potions to go through, sometimes you won't. The amount of time it takes for each special to load, your characters would probably be dead or close to it. Not a fan.

												Its kinda like a roguelike.  You roll a random party of 3 seperate classes through different dungeons and challenges--What few there are will take a few tries to beat since the game doesn't go easy on you.  The game is simple in that you reposition lanes, activate character spells, switch stances (which can buff the unit or even team at a personal stat cost) and use items as you knock out wave after wave of baddies. Characters level up in these runs and you up their stats and try to finish the dungeon.Is it a good game?  Sure.  Its not a $9 game though. Catch it on sale for $3 or less and it'll be a nice casual time waster.			"

												Fun little game that gives you the feeling of 'just 5 more minutes' that turns into 30 minutes easily.Though the game bills itself as tactical, some may disagree and find the gameplay shallow. If you're not sure, do yourself a favor and check some Let's Play videos because the gameplay is definitely not for everyone. For me, the tactical and automated parts play along well together.One thing to note is that the game's actual minimum requirement is much higher than stated, as the game is impacted by memory leak issues (that doesn't seem to be patched ever if you check the dev's replies in the Steam forums - this seems more of a technical limitation of the engine used rather than the developer being lazy though). So if your rig only just meets the minimum requirement, it will definitely lag and will likely eventually crash.Also to note is the lack of any options for sound / full screen.Besides the two issues above, the gameplay is still highly enjoyable and tactical, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys tactical games and want to support indie devs.			"

It is not worth it but if you can get it for a dollar or less, get if you are bored.			"

												I'm not sure why the description labels flash graphics from 2000 as ""modern"". The worse thing is that it gets upscaled fullscreen and that surprisingly makes the game lag. The only old-school in this game is that it almost doesn't depend on you - it depends on random. Once you can finish your dungeon one-shoting your enemies, the other time you won't pass the first line with the same strategy. The all win strategy is to kill 2 of your useless heroes and just grind with the last one. If your luck anything above 3, you will lose, cause you will constantly get useless weapons instead of potions. The only positive thing is that the game has cards, even though it doesn't mention it in the description. Anyways I wouldn't reccomend to buy this game for the full price as there is almost none content to full up few hours (and it wants you to play 10 hours for achievement...).			"

												This game isn't much fun. It's more like watching something happen instead of participating in it. While playing the tutorial I had no idea I was actually playing the game until the 2nd or 3rd wave of monsters. That's not an intended insult, I had absolutely no idea I was actually starting the game. I thought I was watching a tutorial video but nothing really happened then one wave got defeated, then another, until I realized it was actually the game.The whole point of this game is to click on an icon in an area and see how many waves of monsters you can clear before you die. Another and more accurate way to describe this game is by comparing it to Final Fantasy; take away all of the moving around, story, or anything that really makes it a game you play, and just focus on the battles without ever leaving the screen.Use each member's special ability when you can to heal or help the group. After each wave you get loot instantly and disperse it amongst your group the best you can but it's usually not much that will help. You can't control your characters or their stats in any way other than to swap places with other characters on the same screen or when you get limited inconsistant options when they level up.I got this game in a bundle and based on the amount I played, asking $9 for this game is insanity. If you are really bored and want to buy a game that you don't really have to do much in, this game would be good for you but even then I would only pay under $1 for it.			"

												Plays like a mobile game, doesn't seem to have been much edited to release as a pc game. Still has a mobile shop with a premium currency, through it doesn't look like you have to pay for it.  Also no settings menu. It opens as a window, no option to change resolution or make it full screen.Mobile games have some excuse for shallower game play, as you are likely playing it in short chunks. However when you are playing at the PC you expect something deeper. This game unfortunately doesn't deliver this.Would not recommend this unless it was free and even then just as a example of how bad mobile games are. "

												The problem is it's not a bad game. It's just bad (in my opinion) PC game.And it's not because of some gameplay/performance problems. The gameplay is very simple (a fair enough idea for it) and well executed (no problems with the game itself/it looks decent). Although some options to at least mute the sound would be nice.The thing is I don't think an over-grindy game like this is fun enough for a PC standalone. Sure it can be good timekiller on a mobile, but is not on a PC.Add to that the incredible randomness you'll come across (from party chosing for a dungeon to the gameplay itself: you'll need lots of runs to finally get that one item that'll allow you to progress through the dungeon, get that one stat on level up or to finally find one broken team build which will allow you to dash through this one dungeon).Overall if you think that's a kind of a game you'll enjoy playing on a PC then go for it, but personally I didn't enjoy it enough (mostly because of the frustration from random side of the game) to recommend it.

												There's really nothing to this game. It feels like a cheap, drop-in mobile game or something. If you're into the whole Final Fantasy timed-battle system, it's okay. The amount of variables in the combat make it a bit too luck based, but for a few bucks it's a decent time killer.			"

												If you like JRPGs, roguelikes and tactical RPGs, forget about this game. Its flimsy premise, lack of interesting game mechanics, and a lack of creativity and style in the art make it a pass. There are no elements of the game that stand out, and I feel like the creator's description is deceiving.			"

												Final Fantasy 13-lite.Kidding aside, QuestRun is a game that actually requires your full attention. You simply can't cut through the enemies because each wave of foes differ from one another and require specific strategies to defeat them effectively. Managing HOW your heroes level up is the key to winning every battle. Balancing your 3 heroes with the right stat build-up, giving them appropriate equipment and little foresight will ensure victory at every turn.QuestRun is a fun stat management game that makes every decision truly important. It may look a little silly at first but when you give it a little time and effort, it eventually all feels very rewarding. "

												This game isn't much fun. It's more like watching something happen instead of participating in it. While playing the tutorial I had no idea I was actually playing the game until the 2nd or 3rd wave of monsters. That's not an intended insult, I had absolutely no idea I was actually starting the game. I thought I was watching a tutorial video but nothing really happened then one wave got defeated, then another, until I realized it was actually the game.The whole point of this game is to click on an icon in an area and see how many waves of monsters you can clear before you die. Another and more accurate way to describe this game is by comparing it to Final Fantasy; take away all of the moving around, story, or anything that really makes it a game you play, and just focus on the battles without ever leaving the screen.Use each member's special ability when you can to heal or help the group. After each wave you get loot instantly and disperse it amongst your group the best you can but it's usually not much that will help. You can't control your characters or their stats in any way other than to swap places with other characters on the same screen or when you get limited inconsistant options when they level up.I got this game in a bundle and based on the amount I played, asking $9 for this game is insanity. If you are really bored and want to buy a game that you don't really have to do much in, this game would be good for you but even then I would only pay under $1 for it.			"

												I played 27 minutes of the game and got very very bored. After 5 rounds of the same enemies, voices, and characters that seemed to drag on I had to quit. The game didn't save and I had to start over, so I did and quit because again it was boring af in the same ways. Story? I don't even remember one, something about coins and dungeons. Even if it were free I think the download time wether it's 1 min or 2 hours for you it still wouldn't be worth it.			"

												I really HATE making negative reviews about a game, but in QuestRun there's no plot, no goal, no options, no music, no voices, no nothing. every level is extremely long and repetitive. you get no bonuses for going forward on the game. The art and is funny but it's not enough for the price. I don't even understand the meaning of the title...The mechanics are not polished yet. I thing that it need a lot of work yet to be a good game.take it only if you find it for free at indiegala, it doesn't worth any money.			"

												I've been trying to advance through levels, but in order to beat each side quest/dungeon, you need luck. There is no skill involved, just luck. Sometimes you'll have potions to go through, sometimes you won't. The amount of time it takes for each special to load, your characters would probably be dead or close to it. Not a fan. I just kept playing to see if it was even possible to beat some of these quests. I think I'm going to quit this game until some things are fixed.			"

												I only beat the tutorials and couldn't get past the first dungeon after hours of play. I think the game was designed for pay to win micro-transactions. Without them, there isn't much progress. It's a shell of a game designed to extract money from gamblers. It's very addictive, hence the hours I put in, but there's nothing in it. Surprised it's on steam really.			"

												I bought this game in a cheap bundle, making it cost about 5 cents. If it wasn't for the trading cards, I'd say I paid too much.This game looks ok on the surface, but several things make QuestRun pretty bad. The game has few options to speak of, both in terms of UI settings and in-game combat. Additionally, the RNG factor often determines your chances of completing a run.I could go on, but I'll just say that this game is not worth the money. I've seen dozens of entirely free games that are way better than this.			"

												This game feels more like a mini-game.However there is something very engaging.Granted the game has balancing issues and success relies heavily on RNG. I would still go to say I enjoyed this game much more than a lot of other games I've played, as weird as it sounds.I was aiming to get all the achievements and it took me 11 hours to even finish the first dungeon.I kept head butting myself to certain monsters without realizing the full potential of my characters... and only later to find myself in 'shop', using the in-game rewarded gold to buy myself a few more characters and starting weapons.However, after unlocking most of the characters it was a very joyful ride.There is still more to play even after unlocking the achievements -- a dungeon or two and a side quest or two.Not sure if I would pay 7€ for this game, but if it's on sale... Go for it.			"

												There's no real motive to this game. Maybe, I'm not persevering enough but this game seems to rely ALOT on luck (and no thats not the in game stat)Randomly rolled random characters at the begining of ""main quests"" and given underwhelming characters for the side quests (that I guess are achievable - it just may take 50 attempts after the first easier ones few)It has a lovely polished feel - lovely sprites, great music and the battle system works well for the style of game - once you get your head around it.I would say if it is on sale at 80% off take the risk, otherwise this really isn't worth it.
