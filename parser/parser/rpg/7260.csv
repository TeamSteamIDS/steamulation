												the map is divided in areas separated by load screens, and if you die(and you will), you dont lose anything but a little bit of time, for you'll respawn in the entrance of your current area.combat is difficult and it takes quite a while to progress through areas if you plan on killing everything. or you can just rush to the next if you have enough potions, since there is no fog of war and a giant marker on the map pointing to the quest goal.since you can choose whether or not monsters will respawn when you enter the game, you can progress as slowly as you can, killing a little bit at a time, which is great if you cant play for 2-3h in a row.all and all, if you ever see it on a 75% sale, its worth trying. wont be as good as torchlight, diablo or titanquest, but might give you some hours of fun.

Loki: Heroes of Mythology is a hack & slash RPG. The Norse God of Mischief is on the loose across the world, so local heroes must each travel across their lands and help their own Gods safeguard the world.Pros: This game has plenty of dungeon crawling. With each of the four characters, you have an entire campaign set in a different part of the world, interacting with different Gods and different enemies and creatures. There is a large variety of weapons and armors, and different levels of rarity very similar to the Diablo series. Graphics are ok if you're zoomed out, and you heal quickly enough when idle that you can jump right back into action after a few seconds of rest.Cons: The game is basic, story is bland and so is the voice-acting. Crafting is pretty good, or at least it would be if it was of any use: Why would you disassemble your Two-Handed Hammer's magical handle if you'll throw it away as soon as you start getting the Spiked Hammer a few levels later? Why would you recycle for material your old weapons and armor if you can't even sell the material, which will be outdated as soon as better material becomes standard a few levels later? The game lags terribly whenever you're walking along an invisible wall (whether a ledge or an actual wall). Game gets quite repetitive after a while. You'll find equipment for classes other than your own (example: finding an Aztec Shaman armor while playing the Norse Campaign), which doesn't make sense seeing you can't transfer inventory between the different characters, and the characters will never set foot in the other campaign settings. The advertisement in Steam would have you believe this plays in 3rd person mode, but you actually play in isometric view (image #11 is the only accurate representation of the game).Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youIt's an ok game. I'd even say Loki: Heroes of Mythology is a great way to just get the hack & slash crave out of the way when you're done with other Diablo clones. Unfortunately, that's as far as I'll recommend it, as the lack of intriguing story or puzzle (of any form) prevents it from being more than that.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Loki is an isometric perspective action role playing game.  There are different classes to play each entrenched in one of four mythologies; Norse, Greek, Egyptian or Aztec.Character controls and the interface are functional, but lack polish and feel.Individual enemies are extremely well drawn and animated.The terrain feels blocky and awkward, almost as if it was an afterthought.There is no smooth transition between zones, and the zones are all square tiles with portals linking neighbouring zones.  Moving between one square tile zone and the next brings up a loading screen.The game balance in early game is among the worst I have ever experienced.  Your character will keep dying and respawning at the zone entrance.Loki has a nice design concept which has been extremely poorly implemented.  This is a lack-lustre attempt to create a ""me too"" game to cash in on the Diablo / Diablo 2 franchise success.  The quests, storyline and mythology are the strong points, but these are let down by poor gameplay mechanics and lack of balance.As an alternative consider playing any of the ARPG games in the Blizzard franchise (Diablo, Diablo 2, Diablo 3) or consider Titan Quest and it's add-on Immortal throne.  Sacred and Sacred 2 are also alternatives worth consideration.  Other alternatives include Spellforce, Spellforce 2, Dungeon Siege, Dungeon Siege 2.Loki is not a bad game, but it lacks much of the finesse, polish and playability of the top games in this genre current at the time of its release.  In other words Loki is not to be considered a good game, but rather a mediocre attempt to imitate games that are good.  That said, Loki is not the worst game in this genre, but certainly could be contrived as making a half-hearted attempt at achieving that accolade.Worth picking up when it is on sale at good discount, but Loki is not a game you will be tempted to re-play too often or remember with fond nostalgia.4/10			"

												Okay, it's a nice game. I can call Loki ""beat'em'up-RPG"". It's really atmospheric, there are lots of different enemies, weapons and skills. About minuses... Storyline is crap, non-customizing characters, monotonous gameplay a little bit.			"

												After playing this nonsense for a few hours I checked the Steam page and did a doubletake. I swear it looks like a completely different game than the one I'm playing. I guess anything could be made more exciting if you zoom the camera in on action shots. When you actually play Loki you'll notice that you spend almost the entirety of it a mile away from the action, watching your hero slay countless foes in repetitive drab backdrops in the hopes of getting a hold of that phat loot. If I had a grain of sand for every hour that I've spent with games like Diablo 2, I could create my own Sahara in the backyard. Naturally I'm easy prey for games like Loki. Eventually my better sense prevails and I realize that I'm playing with hot garbage.The biggest problem with Loki is that you're staring at a giant middle finger while playing. It's in the background and it almost feels like if you alt-tabbed at just the right moment you'd see it. That middle finger doesn't appear until you start leveling up. Getting a level up is usually a good thing in Action RPGs. You become stronger, you gain new abilities, and you can proceed to take on new challenges. In Loki however the monsters level up with you, and they tend to do so at a better rate. The gear you find doesn't in any way compensate for this rapidly growing disparity. I have no idea what happens 5, 10, or even 20 hours into Loki. Does that middle finger grow in size? Does it disappear for awhile and then come back with a vengeance? Or is it like a heart beat? Pulsating and thumping every second as a reminder that you're spending time with something that hates you almost as much as it hates fun? I don't know and I really don't care to find out. "

												This game came out at around the same time as Titan Quest, yet Titan Quest looks 100x better graphically. Heck, Diablo 2 looks better. This game has unpolished looking graphics, a horrible UI, a rather badly made loot system, a frustrating skill system, and lousy combat.The character balancing was pretty godawful too. You choose one of four characters (Greek Archer, Nordic Barbarian, Egyptian Wizard, Aztec Shaman), each of which have three skill trees that you can access by worshipping one of three different dieties for that particular class. You may only put points into a tree if you are currently worshipping that particular god. It is a rather needlessly complicated skill system.The difficulty of this game is also a tad skewed. Picking anyone other than the Egyptian and you're gonna have a hard time with this game, the difficulty curve spikes pretty high, even on Normal difficulty. Picking the Egyptian however gives you access to various AOE spells in each of his diety trees, any of which you can use to nuke monsters from around corners and generally out of their lines of sight to kill them without aggroing them. Some bosses being the exception with this tactic, but still rather easy to kill with his spells regardless. The melee characters all have hard times avoiding great amounts of damage and the  Aztec Shamans pet spells seem lackluster by comparison to the Egyptians nuking.The voice acting is subpar, even for this games time. The monsters themselves can vary soundwise from normal levels to occasionally ear splitting combat screams depending on the monster type involved. You have to slog through the story on each difficulty to actually get the final ending, and go through each other classes area on each difficulty fighting their bosses along with your own. Combat is repetitive, frustrating (if you're not the Egyptian), and boring (if you are). The boss fights are pretty painful to get through as well. Particularly the final boss in the Aztec area. I hated that fight.All in all I'm probably giving this one a bad review because I had played Titan Quest right before it. Titan Quests only problem after release was a slight memory leak. This game had many more issues and overall can't compare to it. Or Diablo 2. Or Diablo 1 for that matter. Even the first two Sacred games have a certain charm that this one just....lacks. Skip it.

												They took an interesting idea, and while they didn't really succeed completely, they did somewhat well, if you can get past the kind of confusing skill system and the very linear combat system. The storyline eventually smashes all of the myths together, which induces some interesting questions. I haven't played it through too far in, but this is what I've noticed so far. It doesn't seem like this game is ever updated, or if it is, it isn't done very often, either.			"

												Well this game was a dissapointment. I expected something along the quality of titan quest or din's curse, but this game has failed to deliver many of the consepts of what makes an Arpg enjoyable. Lets not kill the game outright and talk about some good things in it:+ The game worlds have great background music, especially in the egyptian world.+ The fighting animation of both the hero and individual enemies is well done.+ This game has found a way to make the restart mechanism of Arpg compatible with the story.+ The game offers you respawn enemies you have killed, otherwise they stay dead and cleared dmaps are empty.This is unfortunately it when it comes to positive things about this game. Some of the negative ones are really what set me off this game:- The movement is clunky, the terrain(doesnt matter how small it is) is an obstacle to gap-closer abilities.- It is very hard to get aggro of large group of enemies. They wait until you kill 5-7 of them and then attack you. This one is very apparent in the Greek world.- The Worlds are very similar, you either fight through a Square map with similar topography in every world, dungeons with identical pathing or  islands connected with bridges through mountain cliffs. The only difference between world are the colours of the levels.- The skill trees are very straightforward and are not rewarding to mixed leveling of abilities (some might like this, well I do not)- The items are not diverse enough. Unique items are just stronger statwise than their normal counterparts.- Crafting is suboptimal.- This game crashes frequently while teleporting and transition of maps.If you are a die-hard fan of the Arpg genre and want to kill some time go for it, else dont waste your time.

Product received for free
												Hack 'n slash RPG in what players as mythological heroes fight against evil. Each character like Egyptian sorcerer, Aztec shaman, Greek fighter, and Norse warrior has their own three Gods to call on for power, but it will cost 25% of the experience points you earn battling enemies. Nevermind the slower leveling, though, because the only way to advance your skill trees is to do all your deeds in the name of some god or another.Norse warrior can specialize in two-handed weapons, dual wielding, and lances depending on how you allot the points between Thor, Tyr, and Odin. The Egyptian has fire, darkness, and lightning spells, while the Aztec can summon animals, transform herself, and fight from the spirit world. The Greek is more hunter than fighter learning swords as a supplement to her bow and trap use.To accelerate your skill trees, you can make offerings to the gods at the same altars where you switch alignments between the three.Loki motivates players to complete all the difficulty levels like Diablo II did. Better loot and level uber characters. The ""timeline"" a character plays through their own world first, then the other three characters, and then moves up in difficulty to do it all again. You can reset enemies and dungeons to gain extra experience, but the important part is that by continuing, you keep your level and inventory each step of the way.A good piece of Hack and Slash. I was playing long time ago when I was play it on my old crappy PC. Those good ol' times.			"

												I think this is one of the most underrated AARPGs of all time. The inferface is clunky and the story is generic, but the action is great, the bosses are epic, and the gear is amazing looking (for its time, the gfx are getting progressively more and more dated).  Don't let my puny 11.5 discourage you --- I played this game A TON from the disc copy and did multiple playthroughs on a norse warrior and a playthrough each for Aztec and Egyptian. I'd love to love the ringtossing Greek, but the physics on the ring never gelled for me. This game is $10 and worth every penny -- if you can get it for less it's a must have.			"

												This is a fantastic game. I loved the original Sacred games (Sacred 1 and 2) and these brought back some good memories.

If you like point and click games (Like Diablo or Sacred) then you will like this game. If you do not like any of which I just listed then this game is not for you.

												I really want to recommend this game. It's got a good concept and I was looking forward to playing. Unfortunately the control system is difficult for me to use. Movement is point and click. Screen rotation is awkward. There is no first person view. In the early stages of the game (at least) there is very little opportunity to communicate with npcs. I'm going to set this aside for awhile. I may give it another go in a few months. If I change my mind, I'll amend my review. For now, though if you were a fan of this game when it first came out, then by all means, purchase it. If you're a fan of pont and click (instead of fps), then by all means purchase the game. Otherwise, hold off on purchasing until the game is on sale.			"

												LOKI has great story and nice female voice to descrive missions. And all tiny things are just right. For example, before you do anything while entering a map, those enemies never attack you. That is, they won't attack you until you move. It's importt or the attack while you r not ready will be very annoying.Though the acts are dumb, that dumb way makes the gameplay fun.
