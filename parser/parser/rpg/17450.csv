												Please DO NOT buy this version of the game. Get the Ultimate Version instead.Although it is an amazing game, there is no easy way to purchase all of the DLC for it through Steam. At regular price the base game costs $20, with the much needed Awakening DLC costing another $20. The other 8 expansions for this game can't be purchased through steam, but rather through Bioware points. If you decide to pick those up, it'll cost another $60 out of your pocket.Instead of paying the $100 you'd need to spend on this version, buy the EXACT SAME THING for $30 in the Ultimate Version.Edit 6/23/2016: Another steam sale, so my review is high up again. I just want to note that the Ultimate Edition of this game is region locked, so some places will not be able to get it. The Ulitmate Version might be available on Origin, so I'd check there. If it's still unavaible, then it's okay getting this version of the game.			"

												This is a great game! First of all, this game surpassed my opinion highly on Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and I adored that game. I believe that I got this game on sale, but I would gladly buy it again, full price, if I had the money. Second of all, my mom plays this game on my laptop instead of on the Xbox, which is nice, because she hadn't touched the game in a long time. When she saw that I had this game, she asked to play and has now raised my time on the game up to 66 hours. The greatest parts of it, in my opinion, is the freedom to choose. Of course, the story-line is always the same, but there are minor differences that still change the ending, at least a little bit. Other great parts of this game include loveable characters, balanced gameplay, and moderately difficult combat. One bad part that my dad complains about is the amount of talking in this game. It has an excess, so be wary.I would definitely reccomend this game to a friend!			"

												I'm not one of those types of people to replay video games. I play 'em once, and I'm done. That's all that I need to do. On occasion, if a game is really good, I'll go back to it once or twice. Maybe. What I don't do--what I absolutely do not DO... is put two hundred and eighteen hours into a game, which at present, is exactly what I've done with Dragon Age: Origins.It is, suffice it to say, very much an exception to the rule, and I can't entirely be sure why. The plot's bog-standard fantasy fare (and worse, it requires that you be friendly to elves, who are the single worst race that has ever (not) existed, and every single one of them deserve to die; I think you and I can both agree that elves are, in fact, lazy scumbags who probably eat babies; I am highly offended at having to play a game as if I am, in fact, a friend of elves, because everyone knows they're horrible people responsible for all the world's problems, with their high and mighty 'we were so immortal and cool and awesome and amazing and perfect but you puny humans destroyed us' well you know what, you punks? if we destroyed you, maybe you just sucked; or, hey, maybe you just pretended you were awesome because you REALLY just live in wagons rolling around the prairies being terrible at everything you DO!)where was I?Right. The plot's not that great. The gameplay, well, it could be better, I suppose. The Fade is so bad, that people have modded it out, and Orzammar, once you head out of the city and into the caves beyond, is just awful....and yet I've beat it three times, played through the expansion, bought all the DLC religiously, and, despite all clear warning signs to the contrary, purchased a copy of Dragon Age II, which ended up being worse than a good number of people said. But its lack of quality is fairly self-evident--it's been said that retail chains refused to stock a GOTY edition after EA approached them.So why do I love Dragon Age?I dunno. It's certainly not because I'm a Baldur's Gate fan, as some have suggested, because I've never played Baldur's Gate before. It's not because of Morrigan, who, up until Fenris, was the most anime (and not in a good way) character the series had.You might notice I'm bashing this game an awful lot, and I don't really mean to. The truth is that I just don't know why I love this game as much as I do. I have fun with it. I think the systems are deep. I've set up my team tactics so well that one time, when I forgot to pause, I left, and returned to find a boss dead. I've beaten the game twice as a rogue (when it comes to Bioware games, the hardest difficulty is Rogue + Hardest Difficulty, always), and experimented with other classes; what's fascinating is how differently both of my rogue playthroughs were. In one game, I was a melee archer. In another, I was a backstabber with grenades. I've discovered that the game isn't particularly fun if you roll mage--best to keep just one mage in your party, otherwise it kinda sucks.I love the characters who aren't Morrigan or Zevran. No one is exactly what they appear to be when you first meet them, except for Dog, who is exactly what you would expect from a Dog who loves you unconditionally; this is a game that benefits tremendously from the player actually trying to role-play. Leliana isn't just a puritanical priestess. Wynne looooves alcohol. Oghren isn't just a boozer, he's a man/dwarf with a broken heart. Sten loves cookies and wants to go on adventures with you, which you'd never guess if you were intolerant of weird religions.So it seems weird to say that the actual combat isn't super compelling, the plot itself is rather boring and just another Bioware plot, so it's nothing special or good. Plus and the main acts of the game are boring--the mage's tower's time spent in the Fade, EVERY SINGLE SECOND spent helping elves out, and the awful writing in Orzammar.And yet I've put two hundred and eighteen hours into it, I'd willingly play through it again, and I know I'd have fun doing it.I just can't tell you exactly why that is.

												If you are a fan of rpg's then you cannot let this game pass and give it a try, it has a really full lore in it for those that love it as well as a easy learning curve (gameplay wise) out of all the DA games this one is pretty much the best of all, sure it's the first one and the others may have some improvements but they don't get that feeling of acomplishment that this one gave.Pros:+ It has a replay value since you get to chose different paths in the story so you would need to play again and chose different options to fully see what this game has to offer. + Mods....enough said; You can use mods to improve the feeling of the game plus add much more things to make a great game even better+ Great story...seriously we all now that the most important thing in a rpg it's the story so im happy to tell you that you wont be dissapointed by it.+ Amazing and immersive soundtrackCons:- Even tho i said that it has an easy learning curve, it might not be at the beginning so it can feel frustrating at first, just don't let this stop you from playing it.- It does require a little bit of grinding (money wise) but for some people it's not really a con, IF you are one of the people that hates grinding you will have to here but its not annoyingly long like some games.And that's it!I really recommend this game if you want to play a classic rpg because that's what this is, a classic and a must play!

 This is gonna be a long ♥♥♥ introduction, so I'll warn that a TL;DR will be at the bottom of the review and that Dragon Age: Origins is probably not only the greatest RPG ever made but also one of the best games ever made that every person that considers himself remotely a gamer should try. It's my entire fault I didn't touch this game any time before like... 3 weeks ago.I usually never let any game pass my radar and dismiss once I look at the name or the colour pallet like many self-righteous ♥♥♥♥s like to do. We're in an age everything can come at your doorstep, slap you in the face with a white glove full of solidified cement and make you learn to not ""judge a book by its cover"" (and... not open the door to random gentlemen).""Oh it looks boring"" ~ Me, 2010-ish.But I digress. Had it in my steam library, was crying of boredom after wanting a deep RPG/Game experience and finding nothing to appeal me. I swear I installed Risen 2 to try and get that drug fix I so much needed. Ran worse than a fat guy trying to find the last bottle of ketchup in the grocery store so I uninstalled and went to DA as a ♥♥♥♥ing LAST RESORT And here I am writing this review while I have lunch. What's the meal?  My words.So let's start the epicness that is this party based RPG, shall we?STORYBest part of the game. The story is one of the very best that ever graced this planet. First of all, there's no introduction to tell you because of the background system, where you pick a background and that will be your ""tutorial/introduction"" so it depends on what you choose (there are 6 of them).The very only thing in common between the introductions are the fact that in the end you are called to join the Grey Wardens, a group of elite soldiers with excellent combat skills that excell at repelling the Darkspawn, a faction of sort of undead, dark possessed beasts that just want the extinction of the human race. And that's the core plot of the game. A Blight (absolutely colossal war between humans (and elfs, dwarves, etc.) and the Darkspawn. A loss would likely result in the extinction of the losing race unless re-population by fleeing losers happened) is coming, you join it at the right moment to let your sword taste some darkspawn blood (which will turn anyone into one OR drives people/animals mad with fevers until death strikes them) and time's drawing closer.If only it was that easy as politics get involved and ♥♥♥♥ gets darker than the Darkspawn itself and we get to witness over 40 hours of the single best writing ever done in... everything, making quests, exploring, reading the codex and just the relationships with your characters so real and more interesting than anything in this age, same level as perhaps Game of Thrones, which is, sadly, the only medieval thing people like nowadays.Now, I meantioned relationships. The dialogue with other party members , usually leads to either build affection with them, or... well... or not.If the affection reduces to something close to 0, the party member will simply abandon you, because your ideas go against his/hers, depending on their vision, of course (I ended up threatening a chantry mother and lost 15 affection to one of my members and gaining 7 affection with another. It just depends if they approve violence or not, and especially against old chantry mothers :p).This may seem simple but since there will be so much talking and hanging out with party members in common, some talks will lead to some building affection and other losing it at the same time, creating a very dynamic sense of relationship between all characters (and if you have ♥♥♥♥ed up moral values, some may end up fighting you, which will have permanent death in case you win the fight, obviously). Some will respond differently based on your choices, some even to your race and background, which makes the game ridiculously replayable! Testing all the story outcomes, all relationships with characters and witnessing all manners people and party members will look at you based on your choices through this epic adventure.And there's more, such as the gift system, which is literally giving specific ""gift"" items you find in the world randomly to party members that will increase their affection with you (the same item may give one character a bigger affection boost than others so use logic to who you think would like a specific gift the most), some of which will even trigger a side-quest randomly and unique dialogue options (and even new skills!), making this feel extremely natural and organic, something I consider vital to an excellent adventure game, the sense of things happening because you came across them and not because you followed a waypoint like in 98% of videogames these days.TECHNICAL SIDEReleased in 2009, Origins looked good for its time and it still looks very nice, aging pretty well and having better faces/hair than Skyrim or Deus Ex Human Revolution (which came out 2 years later). For 2016 standard it's not that great but I've played releases worse looking than it in recent memory and it runs like a beauty. It's good aging also makes graphic mods dismissable as the vanilla is still excellent.Game world is extremely varied, between forests to caves to dungeons full of Indiana Jones style trap dodging and treasure hunting, to even snowy moutains, non creepy to creepy-as-♥♥♥♥ villages and even underground exploration mines with lava and such. There's way more than this still, thankfully. Environment variety is excellent and will hardly feel repetitive.Audio is good. The voice acting is excellent for about 95% of it, the music is great and so are the environment sounds while exploring.GAMEPLAYBesides adventuring and talking with interesting NPC's (which is about every NPC in the game), you'll be killing. Oh the glorious killing! The bathing in the blood of the hundreds of creatures that will be slain by your mighty weapons!Combat can be played in real time or with pausing and tactically giving orders to each of the party members (which can go up to 4, counting with you). Each have their own abilities, depending on their class (mage, rogue or warrior, which then specializes in specific traits. Shapeshifting Mages, Reaver Warriors or Duelist Rogues are possible. Specializations are 12 in total, 4 every class and that change the core gameplay of that character quite a lot, making combat unbelievably deep), there is even a tactics screen that alters AI behavior depending on the enemies it's facing, the amount of them, etc. making the AI fully customizable to your liking. So if you complain about the stupid AI, it's probably your fault, not the game's.Combat's deep enough to carry the game and make most encounters fun and tactically entertaining (when travelling between places, random encounters can get a bit annoying but passable).Crafting is here as well, of course; ranging from poisons to buffing elixirs and runes to improve weapon performance, Origins never stops introducing the player to new and exciting moments, gameplay or story wise. PROS(+), CONS(-) AND OVERALL + Excellent story+ Phenomenal writing+ Graphics and gameplay aged perfectly+ Very deep and highly customizable gameplay+ Immensely replayable+ Great sense of natural adventuring through lack of waypoints and nice map and level design, making exploring a treat and not a chore+ Relationship with party members feels organic and almost real, which is rare, if not unique in gaming.+ Deep and rich lore/world- Some battles can wreck your nerves, feeling sometimes a bit overwhelming for a 4-member party. I feel 6 would've been the best, I struggled ALOT on normal, especially against big battles vs. 20 darkspawn. Feels a bit BS-ish.Overall... 10/10, definately one of mankind's masterpieces!			"

												After 5 years playing this game I'm still amazed that I can still find new possibilities!Bioware was at its apex! A well crafted RPG following most of the elements from Baldur's Gate 2 and at the same time modernized and inovative for its time.""You can choose out of 3 classes and 3 races different origins and embark on a journey as a Grey Warden to defend Fereldan from the 5th Blight and a civil war!""That was enough for me to get hyped with this game. As an old school gamer I had to play it.The main quest at first seemed to be one of those generic RPG stories where you have to raise an army to defeat a great evil.In part it may be true, but there are so many surprises along the way, lots of ways to achieve victory and amazing well written characters and companions.Aside from that you have amazing side quests that will mix with the main quest, instead of being generic ""read & fetch"" side quests.More than that YOU can be either a legend remembered as a good hearted hero during a time of dispair and suffering or a profiteer that only cares about gold, glory and power!Ahh, how great Bioware was! Instead of creating amazing sequels (DA2 and DAI), Bioware decided to simplify what was once an epic Dark Fantasy RPG to please both casual players and SJW,  the kind of people that can't grasp the beauty of a tactical game with brutal moments from a medieval universe.

												First, let's make one thing clear - I am the RPG Master. I suck at FPS, am mediocre at strategy games (at best), but when it comes to absorbing lore, story and fantasy world setting, I know what I'm doing.Dragon Age: Origins is a game that tries to recapture the immersion and style of the legendary PC RPGs of yore, such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment; and it succeeds...somewhat. I have mixed feelings about this game.First, the world and setting - the delivery is dark and beautiful. Most of the art and level design is fantastic, and the atmosphere is just great (including the sound assets and music). Some of the concepts explored, especially religion, is (mostly) maturely handled and gives the game a dark, gritty feel where choices matter and not everything has a fairytale ending. On the other hand, Dragon Age, as a new IP, gave BioWare the chance to move away from the tired old Tolkienen mythos with its elves, dwarves and orcs (Darkspawn). Dragon Age sadly did not grasp this opportunity, instead opting for the safe approach of classic fantasy RPG cliches. Just like every other franchise of Tolkienen origin, humans are common and varied, Elves are few in number and mistrusted, and Dwarves are selfish and suspicious underground-dwellers.Despite this, Dragon Age has some outstandingly written and delivered characters (albeit one or two iffy ones as well), and the fact I can remember who they are in 2014 after buying this game in 2009 speaks volumes of the effort that went into creating them and fleshing them out. There's some great dialogue and banter between all the party members and the Warden, and occasionally with each other, some of which is truly memorable.The main storyline, on the other hand, was a disappointment. The greatest RPGs build their plot around a link between a protagonist and antagonist, and support that link with supporting characters and a series of events that affect and change those characters. This is what made RPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, Planescape: Torment, and the PSX-era Final Fantasies so great. Dragon Age's main villain? Some sort of dragon/demon hybrid with minimal back-story (something about corrupted Tevinter gods based on an in-game myth and...nope, that's all there really is). Number of great villainous speeches and dialogues: zero. Reasoning behind bringing thousands of Darkspawn to the surface in the form of the Blight? No, I don't know either. All we get is some wishy-washy concept of the Warden being linked to the Archdemon by drinking Darkspawn blood.There are so many things I wanted to know about the world of DA:O that could've been revealed through gameplay and/or dialogue - are the archdemons really corrupted Tevinter gods? Does Urthemiel (the archdemon) retain any semblance of true intelligence or decision-making capability? What was he/she like in the way of godly aspect or personality? Who is the Maker? Is the story of Tevinter and the Golden City true? What is the true origin of the Darkspawn? All these things remain unaswered, at most hinted at in codex lore that many players will not even read.Loghain, on the other hand, was a character who deserved more screen-time and had a lot more potential as an antagonist. Unfortunately, despite his apparent intellect, he came across as too narrow-minded to be truly threatening or powerful, so again this was a story opportunity wasted. Overall, the story of Dragon Age: Origins spends too much time meandering about overly-long dungeons, collecting allies and items in what amounts to a series of fetch quests with the occasional bit of good dialogue. This part of the game should not have taken 50 hours and taken up most of the game's length, which demonstrates a lack of pacing in the storytelling. There's very little in the way of personal development for the Warden, such as discovering and unlocking your abilities as a Bhaalspawn in the Baldur's Gate series. When you're not dungeoneering or playing politics, you're doing tedious sidequests with insipid rewards like some errand boy - if you want sidequests or distractions, where are the optional superbosses, or high-end dungeons where challenging creatures and the most powerful weapons in the game are found? Lengthy but relevant sidequests that tie into the main storyline and/or character, like Firkraag in BG2? Not here, unfortunately.All things considered, I've attacked Dragon Age: Origins pretty hard so far, so why am I still recommending it? Well, the game's mechanics are good, combat is visceral and satisfying, a lot of the character dialogue is really good, and the design of the world and locations, and the immersion they provide are excellent. You will lose yourself in this adventure for many, many hours and for that it's worth playing, especially if you can pick it up on sale. It's just a shame the core story had such a lack of nuance, and left me with so many unanswered questions.			"

												Having finished the whole thing more than 12 times, have to say. It is OK. don't be deceived by the 465 hours on record, most of those playthroughs were outside Steam.  Definitely do NOT buy the standard edition, but hang out for the 'Ultimate Edition' because there is LOTS of DLC and you want it all. Dragon Age Origins is something of an enigma. It is a great RPG that brought together most of the good things that Bioware had achieved with Baldur's Gate and the Neverwinter Nights games, but it falls just short of perfecting them. All the content is superb except for the absence of an explorable world, (something Bioware has never even tried to achieve). Sadly the series turned South after this. Edmonton seems obsessed with the idea that video games need to be interactive movies where players marvel at the studio's voice acting talent and cinematic cut scenes. They forgot along the way that role-playing is about the players creating their own stories. In time all of the once numerous class and race options that players had enjoyed with the AD&D based system disappeared, along with any real moral or narrative choices. Dragon Age Origins was the last Hurrah for the old-style feel. I would say that every RPG fan NEEDS to own and play the Ultimate edition of Origins. Enjoy all that is good in it. Also observe the key ways in which it fails. Origins is a great case study in RPG design.			"

												This is one of my favorite RPG games and I consider it to be one of the best of the genre. The voice acting and character design were all fabulous. Fair warning I consider the game to be lore and dialog heavy, so i you are not into reading and getting into the environment and world then you are missing out on one of the best parts. The average time for the game is maybe 35 to 50 hours. The combat system is a great mix of tactical map usage and live pseudo turn-based pause as you need. The tougher fights allowed to good decision making on how to make proper use of your party and their skills to combine magical abilities and skills to keep your party alive and victorious. Once you get the hang of managing your party and using abilities the difficulty becomes fairly easy even on the harder difficulties. I still felt that the combat was engaging but the same tactics worked for most if not all combat encounters. If you are an RPG game fan this is not a game to skip.			"

												This game is so great that I'm on my 4th run of it! Graphics is great and so are the fighting mechanic, story and sound all well done in a good taste.I really recommend it, though gold is a bit of a problem (on a fast run you can't get all the items you want to buy - which is cool :-) ) but there are solutions for it there is a way for making money from potent mana potion crafting sales which takes ages but is kindev legit (cause it still part of the game) - though it takes a lot of time.The other way is a glitch of selling the same item 2 times and re buy it, over and over (you can find it on you tube).I do recommend to do a 1st run without any of those methods since it's a big part of the game not having gold, but on 2-3rd and further when you already beat the game? Then no harm done. i myself used the potion method on the 3rd run and now i use the glitch on my 4th run.Hope you will enjoy the game it is really great!			"

												One of the greatest PC RPGs ever made - and the fact that it sits right at the border between ""old-school"" and ""new-school"" Bioware generations makes it all the better. Combat is best done (especially in the harder fights) using the ""pause and plan"" method, which won't appeal to everyone. But the story is incredible (and seriously emotional by the end) and the voice acting is first-rate (Claudia Black is the stand-out as Morrigan). You actually CARE about the characters in this story, both good and ""evil"". Even if you've played this on console before, buy the PC version - it was designed for PC, and the PC version is the only one Bioware themselves made. It's actually quite lovely visually on PC - though obviously time has made it look arguably ""dated"", it has its own unique art style that's miles ahead of the console-driven sequels. I'm especially fond of the intricate UI on the PC version, which is miles ahead of the ""console compatible"" UIs in the later Dragon Age games.The DLC is not needed to fully enjoy the game, though if on one of the regular 75%-off sales, grab it for some extra diversion. ""Awakenings"" wasn't written by the same team as the main game and it shows.			"

												This game not only prevents herpes, but it made me a better person. Before I got this game, I was lazy, unemployed, and had not figured out pants.This game taught me how to get a job. How to stand up for things I believe in (mostly beavers and their way of life) and it showed me that pants are a reasonable leg-covering device. I should also say that this game makes you believe that people's underwear cannot be removed, and that wizards are real. I know that only one of these things is true, however.Side effects may include spontaneous mustache growth, and the urge to put Q-tips in your ears. Do not do this. It's bad for your ears and the Q-tip. But, in order to keep the cotton industry going, you should just burn entire boxes of q-tips. Or cotton balls. Either one, really. It's up to you.			"

												Don't buy it, or at least not here ! Please tag this review !You're on Steam, and only the standard game is sold, not the Ultimate release which have all DLC addons included. So, here, we're supposed to be the  cows and EA/Origins the farmers.You thought to have bought this game my friend ?  Nah, if you really want to enjoy it, you will have pay again 50 or 60 $ ... Exploring the tiny DA map, you will find lot of quests with a ""!"".  As to do them you will have to use your Bioware points. All these quests/""dowloaded content"" need about 6000 points to unlock. So, a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off; you will check  the main menu and will be directed to the Origins site where one will propose you to spend 16 $ for each 1600 points ""bundle pack"".You will have to add 9 $ more on steam or 9.9 $ on Origin as to get the DLC Awakening, but this, we are used to.The cherry on the cake : the game main quest is bugged in dwarves city, a NPc does not drop a (bone) key in all cases ---> load a previous (very old one) save or start since the beginning if you have none left. Thx wikia for the tip.If that game hadden't so lovely characters and corrects plots, it would not anger me so much.I hope this was usefull for you, tag it as more people be able to read it and do not let them being trapped by this Steam current offer. (sure it is not Steam fault, a note would be helpfull anyway, don't you agree ?)			"

												Dragon Age is a kind of game that is becoming increasingly rare: a deeply immersive single-player RPG with an interface clearly designed for the PC. It's easy to sling around the word ""immersive"" at any game that looks pretty, but DA isn't messing around - the world of Ferelden shows a unified sense of design and depth that blows even famously vast games like Oblivion out of the water. Coupled with consistently excellent writing and across-the-board quality character design even down to relatively unimportant NPCs, the game truly does feel like it's reacting to your choices dynamically from the very beginning, and how you play your character can have amazingly subtle effects on the way the story unfolds.Graphically, the game's a little uneven. All the design elements are there, and it has plenty of high-quality textures and strong environmental visuals - particularly fire effects. The polygons themselves, particularly on character faces, are a little simpler than you'd expect from a 2009 game. Overall, the game looks about on level with Oblivion, although the visual distinctiveness and design ethic of areas and characters are significantly better. Animation stands out as a strong suit here, particularly during the game's frequent dialog sequences, with none of the dead-eyed staring or bizarre walk cycles that plagued other RPGs like Fallout 3.Gameplay is pretty straightforward, and very much in keeping with previous Bioware titles like Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. You control a party of up to four characters, each of whom develops a plethora of useful abilities to keep track of. The inclusion of a minor programming element (very much in keeping with the gambit system from Final Fantasy XII) will let you set up a few default actions on each character so you're not stuck frantically switching between them to make sure they drink their healing potions, but battles frequently require some degree of tactical planning. Setting up ambushes and planning your party strategy to play to strengths is necessary to get through some tougher areas. The interface is, shockingly, clearly tailor-made for the PC (the console versions have their own interfaces designed from the bottom up and are apparently easier games to allow for the sacrifice in easy access to skills). You have an insane number of quick-access slots, and nearly the entire keyboard is bound to one thing or another. It's the kind of interface that hasn't been in vogue since before the PS2 came out. The game is extremely linear, although the frequent and varied dialog options give it the feel of a more free-roaming game, and it's very tempting to go back and replay huge chunks of the game just to see how the complex and dynamic conversations will play out. The main downside is that there's no easy way to level-grind, which is to the game's benefit to a point (no tedious circling around killing wolves) but occasionally means you can get in over your head.What the game sacrifices in terms of sandbox free-roaming it more than makes up with in the excellent writing and characterization. An absurd attention to detail and across-the-board excellent voice acting breathes a lot of life into the game's conversations, which make up a significant chunk of gameplay. Characters are extremely varied and the interplay between them is a major draw, a trademark of Bioware's games, but Dragon Age has some of the most likable characters I've ever seen in a video game and the excellent performances from talents like Tim Curry, Kate Mulgrew and Claudia Black really put the game a notch above. Even the game's fairly generic-on-the-surface fantasy world is livened up by a few critical details - for example, the elves in Dragon Age are a massive underclass of servants.It's actually difficult to find things to level complaints against in this game. One petty gripe is Morrigan's visual design - her character is one of the game's strongest, and she has great personality and some very clever writing, but visually she's a pair of giant breasts with a cloth draped improbably over them. Other women in the game are treated with a bit more restraint, though, and female armor is gratifyingly sensible. Another issue is that it can be difficult to manage battles on the fly, and accurately targeting enemies with skills frequently requires tactical pausing just to line the cursor up over their relatively small active areas. It's a petty annoyance, but the game clearly wasn't meant to be played Diablo-style anyway.A few other things to know about the game:-The game is mostly DRM-free, and ships only with a simple disc check. EA has a reputation for fouling up its customers' computers with DRM malware, but DA seems to be free of those problems.-If Dragon Age were a movie, it would be rated R. I don't remember ever seeing any swearing, oddly, but the game is rife with violent imagery, extremely dark themes and frank sexuality (including a handful of relatively tasteful sex scenes and occasional demonic nudity). The game handles all of it with maturity and depth, but it's clearly not meant for children, and even parents of younger teens should be cautious.Overall, Dragon Age is one of the strongest games to come out in recent memory, and is another installment in Bioware's increasing resume of superbly-written RPGs. Players looking for a fast-paced hack-and-slash ""rpg"" should look elsewhere, but anyone who likes deep and elegant plot development, memorable characters and excellent role-playing will love this game.

												Dragon Age: Origins is a near perfect game - I was playing Skyrim at the time, but found it rather cold and was looking for something more and found it in Origins, which immediately became my favourite game of all time. Dragon Age Inquisition is a very close contender but I have a profound emotional attachment to Origins which gives it the number one spot. For anyone wondering, I previously owned this on CD but the disk got damaged, so have now bought it on Steam - actual time spent +100 hours.Here's what it does right:- One of the most impressive things about this game is the 'spontaneous' conversations among party members. You'll be walking along and your party will chat to each other - there are hundreds of conversations and even if you save before a trigger point, it's highly unlikely you'll get the same conversation again. It is highly unpredictable as it plays out between certain characters so the conversations you hear depends on who's currently in your party. These can be revealing, funny or just interesting, but are a major high point.- Connected to that is 'spontaneous' cutscenes - these appear when your relationship with a party member has become high enough. These moments can either be friendship or romantic in nature.- Branching love stories.  Like any relationship, love needs to build to a point where declarations are made and if you choose, the relationship can be consummated. You can easily sabotage a relationship, e.g. cheating, but can also create a deep bond. This can have some highly memorable and often spontaneous relationship cutscenes.- The outstanding voice actors - the characters are so well cast that they feel like real people and you develop likes and dislikes to people like in real life. High points are Alistair, Morrigan, Zevran, Loghain just to mention a few.- Breathtaking music - the haunting Leliana's Song is positively exquisite, for example.- A vibrant and complicated world with religions, politics and cultures which have been fleshed out to a truly astonishing degree - there's so much history here that you could spend hours reading the codex alone.- The characters are the same - complicated, living people each with their own backstory and motivations, and sometimes secrets, and you become very attached to them. You can build or break down relationships with your party members - sometimes through direct interaction and sometimes through your actions and decisions. This can drive away a party member or create a friendship/love for life.- A elaborate conversation system which means you can spend long periods of time just talking to your many party members. You'll often be startled at where you end up, depending on your choices and finding out surprising new information.- Your decisions matter - sometimes the consequences are small but others change the ending of the game. There are multiple instances of this, sometimes even changing who your allies are in the final battle. This means great replay value.- 4 party members and you can easily switch between them and play different characters, or help out a character in a fight.- Straight forward inventory system, no searching for things or struggling to equip something.- The fight system is easy to use and the skills are easy to understand and can make or break you if you make bad choices. E.g. the coercion skill allows you to convince people you are right and it can work on very unexpected people... if it's high enough. Tactics allow you to program automatic responses - e.g. healing, drinking mana, responses to specific enemy types etc.- You can easily loot corpses from a distance with your character auto-running towards it. This is removed in Inquisition, for example, a rare mistake on their part. This is extremely convenient.- The game is exceptionally stable, allowing you to use literally dozens of mods simultaneously, without the game crashing or causing characters to act strangely. The only issues I've ever had is either a mod not working (conflicting with another mod - those often have 'compatibility' files to solve this) and occasionally a weird graphic like invisible skin. The mod system is incredibly easy - either just paste the file into a separate folder under the program files, or use a modder program to install. Removing a mod is as simple as deleting the file in the folder or uninstalling it via the modder program. This allows highly creative players to add fantastic extra content - sometimes just outfits or hair, but sometimes entire sections that weren't in the game before. Perfect examples being: additional recruitable party members, wedding and funeral scenes (which shockingly weren't in the actual game, for shame developers!) and great character scenes, which just adds to the already complex characters.There are two things I didn't enjoy:a)  A tedious and frustrating Fade section in the middle which is about 3 hours of wandering around trying to figure out what to do. Solution: there's a mod on Nexusmods which skips the entire section. Seriously, play it through once then download the mod so you never have to play it again.b) The Awakening expansion. It changes things about gameplay that were perfect to begin with, and the story is tedious, depressing with all but one familiar character gone. It's like a completely different game, like a soulless husk of Origins. I played it through once and never again.Bottom line: this game has a complex, branching narrative with fantastic realistic relationships, world and characters. Your decisions matter and can have serious consequences. The continuity is amazing as you can import your character into Dragon Age II and your unique world will continue. I have played this game through on multiple characters and come back to it about once a year to play it again. It stays with you, both the world and the characters. It is the game I got the most value out of and have never tired of it. Choice and consequence games are the norm now, but this game showed what you could do with it. Absolutely love it.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a role-playing game from Electronic Arts. Dragon Age: Origins is a story about a Grey Warden (your characters, the protagonist) from Thedas in a country called Ferelden. The country is under attack by dark forces. Your duty is to protect it from destruction.The gameplay of Dragon Age: Origins is good. First, you create your character, choose your race, human, elf or dwarf, each with their own starting stories and then embark in an adventure as a Grey Warden. Characters get to level up as they develop and you can equip many weapons and armors from light to heavy one. Each weapons and armors have 7 class which determine their strength, from iron made to dragon bone made. Your choice in the game will affect your entire adventure and will also carried out to the next game Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening. This game is open-world so you can travel anywhere in Ferelden and you can choose which quest you want to complete first. Also, you're not going alone in this game, you're going to meet some companions on your way in the game, some are nice, some are not.Dragon Age: Origins graphics are quite decent. The characters animation are good, each weapons can have different animations when characters attack. The effects and the environment in Dragon Age: Origins is also good.Overall, Dragon Age: Origins is a good game and I recommend this for RPG lovers.Rating 8/10			"

												I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rpgs. There is excellent character development and the lore can draw you into the world. One thing that makes this game great is the dialogue between the NPCs. I immedietly wanted to play more Dragon Age titles after finishing this game so I downloaded DA: I. Inquisition immedietly turned me off to the series due to the poor dialogue, combat and interface. I hope the next DA title will take note of DA: O as there is little I can think of that could improve this game.			"

Pros:Complex, branching narratives. Not only for the main storyline, but also for each party member. Depending on how you interact with a particular character and the choices you've made throughout the game, characters will treat you differently.Romances are well executed and don't feel awkward or shoehorned in.The lore, world building, and atmosphere are all excellent.Decisions matter and can have serious consequences.Combat is easy to pick up, but tough to master. There is a ton of depth here. With plenty of character skills, and a robust tactics system there are many ways to approach every encounter.Great soundtrack.High replayability.Cons:The Fade - A section of the game where you wander around aimlessly for like 3 hours. Not sure what they were thinking with this. It's so bad community members even made a mod that skips that entire section of the game. Believe it's on Nexusmods. "

												A game that defines true modern classic RPG, no wonder people claims that this is one of the best RPGs of all time.At first I didn't expect to experience this much,- Never expect how good the companion system is- Well written dialogue- Fluent story progression- In depth story telling- Choices made in the game really matter. A lot of choices blend naturally that you don't even realize what you do can affect the game, even some RPG nowadays aren't able to provide better choice-matters gameplay- And much more that you need to experience yourself!Although some people might not enjoy the combat system much, the RPG elements itself is enough to make you keep playing. I myself enjoy the tactical combat system.I can't really recommend this game for those who can't stand talking with many NPCs and explore options available in the conversation or like to skip conversations because there are lots of chit chat to be done in the game, for me it's an essential way to enjoy the game world.I can say that this game is a must buy for RPG fan.

												An absolute fantastic story in grim world.  The sequals do not do this world justice at all.  If you have played DA:2 or DA:I before this,  you are in for a bit of a shock.  The systems are a bit clunky and menu heavy by todays standards, but what it lacks in streamlining offered by the sequals it makes up for in depth.  Infinitely deeper and more nuanced systems requiring to you actually form a party and design their commands to work together to stay alive.  Slow and methodical wins out here.If you are an older gamer or just a gamer looking for something a bit deeper than the surface level systems RPG's offer these days, this is a must play.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a game that dives into new depths of story and action sequences, and that pushes the limit of the very game itself. The game itself has rich graphics and setting for your character to explore and commute, and tactical action situations that require you to make full use of all the characters in your party. The game also has very indepth story ranging from side characters you will meet everyday on your travels, to indepth looks at all your ""party characters"" backstories, lifes, secrets, loves, hates, and really gives them an unforgettable personality in the story. Above all else, this is your story and you can make it whatever you want with the multitude of choices you can decide in this game, each choice you make influences the world around you and what you party thinks of you as a whole, whether good or evil, the choice is yours.

												Excellent game. The complexity and depth of strategy in combat will keep you going for MANY playthroughs, not to mention the expansive story. Even when you know what you are doing the base origins game can take many hours to complete (if I had to guess I'd say 50, though this will be more first time).One word of warning though, If you are new I'd look up the best way to stat your characters and try get a good general idea of the best talents/spells. You can ruin a playthrough by building your characters wrong (especially for mages) as I did first time I played. Second time through I managed to complete the game on easy (and it was a challenge!) now I run nothing less than nightmare and basically don't need potions at all, probably doing a solo run soon! ...Such is the depth of the combat and leveling system, still learning nearly 300 hours in.If you like this kind of game you have to buy it. If not, it's still worth a shot as I didn't KNOW I liked this kind of game when I bought it! "

Virtually any choice you make may affect the way the story goes, which makes you ponder more before making a decision.And even after finishing the game you'll be surprised to see that you've seen less than a half of the game. Dragon Age: Origins is definitely not a game for a single playthrough. After finishing it for the first time you'll be tempted to begin anew to discover a new origin story and brand new possibilities that come with it.The battle system is great and will be please both the lovers of fast-paced action-RPG-style combat and the tactical geniuses. In any case, the bosses are quite tough to beat without proper tactics even on normal difficulty.I cannot ignore the hard work the voice actors put into filling their character with life. I was especially impressed with Claudia Black and her Morrigan. I couldn't imagine a more fitting voice for the daughter of the Witch of the Wilds.Inon Zur's soundtrack for the game is one of the best I've ever heard. I would put it on the same level as brilliant works of Jeremy Soule for The Elder Scrolls series.Finally, my verdict is such: if you love role-playing games, there is no single reason why you shouldn't play Dragon Age: Origins. In fact, if you don't, you will probably regret it.			"

												Another Bioware game , another masterpiece.First you must know that you have to play it to understand how deep it is. As always Bioware did great job while creating characters and environment. One of the best crews you'll ever see in a videogame (just like Mass Effect) and you feel like you are the one who is Grey Warden while playing.     -Unlike many other RPG this game let you choose your origin(Human Noble , City Elf etc.) and those your mini-personal stories will make your character to become you. Almost everything you do , every decision you make will have some consequences so play it smart.In nightmare difficulty game is really challenging and probably if you are new to that combat system you will get rekt so hard. So be careful before you choose.    -Combat system is really really good in my opinion. You have your party which can contain you + 3 more party members and while you are choosing your party member especially in nightmare mode you need to be careful. While in combat every member of your party have it's customizable AI which you can personalize as your own. If your tank's HP is below %20 he will automatically drink potion or if someone focuses your mage your tank will use taunt. It look really simple like that but it is complicated than it seems.    -Music and atmosphere is magnificent. I can't even say anything about it you need to see it yourself.    -Your party members are really cool and interesting , they have their own unique stories and those are not boring too , if you do their own quests they will have new ability and if you help them , listen to them , gave gift to them etc. their stats will increase so keep that in mind.I think that would be enough.       9.5/10 - FOR THE GREY WARDEN !

												Finally, after 94 hours of gameplay I finished my first playthrough. And all I can say is that I am shocked at how amazing this game is. There is so much to learn, so much to witness, and so much to experience. The way that the characters react to you, depends on your race, class, and party accompanying you, and that makes you experience something different everytime. The fighting mechanics may not be the best, but that is not what this game is about. It is about the story. Here are a few things that makes this game brilliant...- The different races and characters.- The interaction you have with your team. (Romance options, companion quests, companion approvals etc.)- The choices you make that influence the story.- All of the characters background and how they fit into the story.- The plot itself. (Uniting the Dwarves, Elves, Werewolves, Templars, Mages and humans to defeat the archdemon and end the Blight.)- All of the side-quests.- The  wide range of equipment, armor and weapons.- The whole of Ferelden that you can explore.- 6 Origins to choose from.(Which depends on the race you choose.)And a few things that could have been better.- The side-quests can be a little difficult and overwhelming.- The fighting mechanics and fighting animations.- For people starting this game, the skills, talents and equipment choices can be a bit confusing.I hope you find this review helpful. :)			"

												I don't usually recommend or review games on Steam, but when I do, they're games that are worth the time and effort.Dragon Age: Origins may be from 2009, and the graphics have evolved and improved a lot since then, but damn, this game is amazing in every way.First off, since it's an RPG game, you can build your ""hero"" just the way you want him/her to be. From race, gender, background story, classes, and more.And then there's the main component of the game: the gameplay is fun, diverse and challenging, the world is mythical and really gives you an epic feeling, and by the end of the game you'll be left off with a feeling that you need to replay it and try everything you hadn't tried out before. You'll want to try out being evil or good, generous or selfish, kind or rude, it's all up to you. The choices you make impact certain events of the game, and the choices you make can have dire consequences as well. So choose wisely who to side with, and consider your options.The negative aspect of the game, though, is that it can be pretty linear, and some areas are reused. The graphics are a little outdated, but it shouldn't matter. It still looks great with certain mods that can easily be implemented.Overall I highly recommend this game if you love RPG and are looking for an epic story and fun gameplay.			"

												I have played a lot of RPG's. Some were bad, some were good and then there is this game. Dragon Age origins is by far my favorite game of all time! It has some of the best characters that I have experienced in any media and one of the best back stories. The way the game starts, no matter your background, is amazing! And I have not experienced any fantasy world that hates magic this much, which just makes it even more unique.Sure there are holes in the game here and there and it is not the best combat system, but I am not playing a game like this for the combat. If I wanted combat I would play a different game or genre all together. What this game does, and the sequals fail at, is putting the story above all else and shows you, if you will let it, one of the all time best stories full of monsters, evil and major plot twists that you never saw comming.This is obviously not a game for everyone. If you do not mind a game that does not focus to much on combat, has a few bugs here and there and performance issues in certain areas but just want a game with awesome characters, exiting background story for your own character and a rich and dark world for you to fix and best of all. Choices that MATTER! Then you should consider trying it out!			"

												~ DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS ~This game is fascinating!! I bought this long time ago but never play it until this year. Before I play this game, I play its second series -- Dragon Age; II. It was installed on my PC. But since I don't know how to play it, and my computer spec is very outdated and can't hold DAO: II's heavy graphic, experienced in lag condition, then I decided to uninstall it. Then, I meet Steam, and after that search of this game. And I tried to buy it. After that I decied to play it. And I found excitment while playing this game. It's nice and great..!!! This game is very great!! And this is my score to this game... :1. STORY : Rich (5 stars)2. Gameplay : GREAT!! (4.5 Stars)3. PLOT - THEME : FAIRY TALE at Max Level!! (5 Stars)4. SKILL - TALENT - SPECIALIZATION : GREAT!! (4.5 Stars)RESULT : THIS GAME IS RECOMMENDED!!Note; I'm not smart giving scores to a game. I write the game rate as objectively only.Thanks... :)			"

IMPORTANTIf you're about to buy this version of the game, don't. Go for the Ultimate Edition instead. The price at the moment is pretty much the same and it includes The Awakening expansion aswell as all of the DLCs. Steam doesn't include the option to buy DLCs for the basic version. The only way to get them would be using BioWare points in-game which is a big waste of money./IMPORTANTThis game is my second favourite RPG right after The Witcher series. Somehow I've got into it that much I have to play it at least once a year. The hours might be quite low for few play throughs due to playing the game on Origin (with dlc's etc. and polish version which for me doesn't fit and ruins the gameplay, sadly). Dragon Age has an awesome and interesting story, a big nature diversity of your companions, pretty cool combat style and quite good graphics as for a game from 2009. The story is well written, starting from the different beginnings for each race/class, lots of side-quests (which you might miss playing the first time), few discords between you and your companions and so on. As for the combat, it might be quite slowpaced and boring at the beginning for some due to its tactical type (not a hack'n'slash one) but after gaining more skills you will find it more interesting and entertaining. The graphics might not be as good as the current games have but honestly, who gives a damn about the graphics?The only thing that has been bothering me was the lack of main character's voice during the dialogues. It's basically mute. You will get to hear it only in the middle of the fights and that's (as far as I remember) all. The reason of such doing might be that it was expensive to do the voice sets for each class, type of voice and gender.It has mods, too! Well, probably not as much as Skyrim with its' trains instead of dragons or animated fart shouts but hey! If you're looking for some check out nexusmods[nexusmods.com].Few mods that I've been using and you might find useful:- no helmet[www.nexusmods.com] - not really an issue, it's just that the visuals sometimes didn't fit and it looked ridiculous on few characters- extra dog slot[www.nexusmods.com] - the Mabari becomes your summon, instead of taking up the character slot- character respecialization[www.nexusmods.com] - whenever you want to change the default skills that have been given or try different builds you can drink the mysterious potion from a raven- a year with sten[www.nexusmods.com] - different model for one of your companions that fits the image of DA2 Qunari- improved atmosphere[www.nexusmods.com] - the title speaks for itself, you might want to play without it first then install it midgame to feel the difference- skip ostagar[www.nexusmods.com] - that's rather for people that play it for 2nd (or more) time and don't want to waste their time on the ostagar chapter- skip the fade[www.nexusmods.com] - same as above. Skips part of the quest in mage's tower. Used it due to the quest being, uh, annoying after few timesThat's all I guess, if you haven't played this game yet and you like RPGs I strongly suggest you to try it out, it is one of the must-play titles for everyone!

												If you're into RPG's, or rather if you love roleplaying in general, there's really no need to waste time reading any reviews of this game. The same goes if you regard games like Planescape: Torment, Fallout 2 and the Baldurs Gate-series among the best computer games ever made. Because this game is everything a person like you look for in a game, and so much more. Be aware though, Dragon Age: Origins is not a revolution of the genre, rather it is an evolution, where Bioware has refined everything that made them into a formula as close to perfection as possible.A spectacular experience from beginning to end, and with an enormous amount of choices to make, cities to visit, dungeons to crawl, NPCs to interact with, treasure to find, quests to complete and crafts to master, I feel pretty confident in saying that Dragon Age: Origins is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable and immersive RPG experiences I've had.Incredible storytelling, great characters, and exciting battles are just a few of the things that make this fantasy role-playing game so extraordinary.Dragon Age: Origins might have a few clichés here and there, but for those looking for a RPG to lose themselves in, you need not look any further.This is the most enormously detailed game world I've experienced, its history stretching back thousands of years, its cultures vivid, beautiful and flawed, the battles enormous, the humour superb. Roleplaying games now have a great deal to live up to.			"

												(Note: I originally wrote this review on November 4, 2009 for a publication and focused on both the console and PC versions. I just updated it five years later in November, 2014 in order to update some of the references and make it more palatable for a gamer considering the title in the modern day.)Most of the gamers that are going to purchase Dragon Age: Origins know exactly what they're getting into. They're likely to be either old school PC gamers with love for the Baldur's Gate series or a younger, fresher class of gamers that have enjoyed BioWare's more recent Mass Effect series. I'll preface this review by letting you know right now that if you fall into one of these two categories and for some reason haven't yet purchase this game, you need to buy it immediately, because you will be hopelessly enthralled by it. You don't even need to read the rest of this review. Just go get it. For those not familiar with any of BioWare's other games, or those who have played only more recent RPGs and enjoyed them, read on.Dragon Age: Origins' most important strengths are the story, ambiance, and characters. Lead writer David Gaider came from a job in hospitality services to begin writing for Dragon Age years ago, but his lack of proper experience certainly hasn't hampered him in the slightest. He's brilliant. The world building is a particular strength; it's amazing, and the art team supports Gaider and his team's writing very well. Every structure has an apparent age to it, and everything feels well-worn. It doesn't just look like the structures and settings have a history behind them, it feels like it, and the game certainly helps out the feeling by providing a detailed history codex providing further detail on everything you encounter in the game. We're talking about a Tolkien-esque level of effort put into developing the lore behind this game. I was shocked to learn that I hadn't even seen combat yet in nearly two hours of playing the game simply because I was so engulfed in reading every entry provided to me in the game's encyclopedia. For gamers like me who enjoy this sort of thing, it's fantastic. If you ever feel bogged down by the constant codex entry notifications, don't worry, because you're free to go about your way without ever delving too deep into the historical aspects of the world, and the game doesn't at all punish you for neglecting it. Nearly anything you need to know by means of storyline will come up in conversation anyway. A realistic, living world is always nice, but the true value of this lies in how many different ways your choices actually affect this world. There's no good and evil meter to gamify and cheapen them, and your choices all affect the land of Ferelden in a very real way.Another strength of the game is the richness of the characters. The nuances of your main character will be more or less shaped by you, and while that's a good thing, I would've liked to have heard spoken dialogue for my character rather than have him go the silent protagonist route. I thought BioWare did a fantastic job with how they allowed a healthy mix between player construction and static, unchangeable attributes regarding Shepard in Mass Effect. I wish they would have steered the main character of Dragon Age more toward that end of the spectrum. Aside from that gripe, the rest of the cast of characters are simply fantastic. All have deep, fully realized personalities and feel as genuine as a character from a great novel. There are no Vaans or Penelos in this game. Each character has their quirks, their strengths, and their weaknesses. The characters are so lifelike that you'll end up legitimately liking or disliking them after only a few conversations, and that's one of the real strengths of Dragon Age. It's all due to the fantastic writing done by Gaider and his team.The gameplay is almost what you'd expect from a classic CRPG. It's very much like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, KOTOR, etc. If you're familiar with the combat in those games then you'll be able to step in to Dragon Age and feel right at home. If not, then you'll need to make a bit of an adjustment to this style of game. You can pause and micromanage, queueing up actions for your various party members if you wish, or you can set the AI to do what you'd like it to and let your party run on autopilot without pausing the action at all. At lower difficulties the game doesn't punish you for playing either way, though once I pumped up the difficulty I found it almost a necessity to utilize the pause-and-play micromanagement style. The way you choose to play will depend strictly on what type of gamer you are.Make no mistake, this game was meant to be played on a PC. The graphics are absolutely atrocious while playing on a console, and it's obvious that the devs designed for a PC and then ported to the consoles -- A stark and unfortunate contrast to most titles nowadays. The graphical level of the XBOX 360 version of Dragon Age is equivalent to those of the first Mass Effect's now infamous pre-texture pop-ins. There is surprisingly little detail in the texture, and framerate has a terrible tendency to grind to a choppy halt at random intervals -- even when there isn't all that much going on onscreen. This, sadly, looks very much like a game that belongs back in 2005 or so. The PC, however, is very different, with much nicer textures and environments. The use of a hotbar and the tactical overhead view on the PC also favors that platform. The radial menus on the consoles are decent enough once you get used to them, but the hotbar is infinitely more effective, flows more continuously, and is far more comfortable to use. When you consider the amount of user-generated content available for this game in the form of mods, it's really no comparison. Rejoice, PCMR: This is a game created primarily for old-school, hardcore PC gamers.There is, however, an issue to be had with the bugs present in the retail version of this game. Several times your character will get stuck on a bump or smooth rock on the ground, causing them to run in place continuously until you move them away manually. There's also an issue with your controlled character not responding to an attack command. Little things like this take away from the experience of an otherwise quality game, which is unfortunate, but now easily correctable with bug fix mods.If you're a fan of BioWare's previous titles or old school CRPGs in general, this game has a very good chance of becoming an instant favorite of yours. It's not for everybody, though. Those who find RPGs to be a bit too slowly paced or plot heavy for their liking will probably be instantly turned away from this game. But if you can look past the faults of the game, there's a wonderful experience to be had with this title, and I'm sure I won't be done playing this for a long, long time.In conclusion, this is a love letter to old school CRPGs like Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate II, and the like. If you liked those games, you'll absolutely love this one. If you're an RPG fan in general, it's absolutely worth a purchase, as the story, world building, and characterization is second to none. You'll just have to get used to the overhead, tactical style of gameplay.			"

												This game is certainly my favorite RPG of the 2000-2009 era in gaming.  It built on the successes of earlier RPGs such as baldur's gate and neverwinter and really decided to make a gmae world worth exploring. I've been playing the game every so often since 2009 and there are certain aspects of the game that don't hold up, like excessive pop-in texturing, long (and progressively longer loading times with larger save files) loading times even on PC, which is a sad, sad thing.  When one has a hybrid-SSD, a game should not take 5-10 minutes to load an action sequence.  Which leads me to believe it is a memory leak, or a fault in the programming, as this generally seems to follow a set pattern.  The length of the load-time increases in proportion with two variables.  The first variable is how long you have been playing the current character, and the second variable is how long you've been playing in the current session.  Also, random encounters are a crappy thing to do to a player.  Just look at every JRPG.  Did anyone think that was a good idea?   And...some of the animations are cheesy and overdone.Okay, I got all the bad stuff out of the way first.  Everything else is completely masterful.  The art direction, music, combat/tactics, and story progression are legendary.  I have yet to find a game that has this massive of a scope and yet allows consequential decisions by the player-character/warden.  Even in 2009 I thought the Origins were an awesome addition, even if they didn't altogether seem to change the overall outcome of the game.  They were subtle and yet informative.  They helped shape a person's backstory, and also changed the way NPCs refer to you throughout the game.  I played as Dwarf Noble, Dwarf Castleless, Human Noble, City Elf, and Mage.  The only one I've yet to do is Dalish Elf.   I can't wait for inquisition to come out, since i have a Dwarf Female Castless rogue (warden plus warden commander and all dlc) imported to DA2, and ready to go for DA:I.Mass Effect capitalized on the meaningful companions and meaningful choices formula, but DA:O took it to a new level (minus the whole gifts charade).  Each companion you pick up (and many of them aren't even required) are unique and interesting.  They interact with each other and with the world around them.  They respond believably to the events that your Warden gets into, and are all worthwhile investments of your time.  Get to know them.  Even Morrigan, and especially Alistair and Leliana.  They're all wonderful people that feel real.  In the end, though, what keeps me coming back to the game is that there aren't any other games out there like it.  There are some that have tried, but oh how they've failed.  I'm looking at you, Kingdoms of Amalur.  Even DA2 couldn't compete with its predecessor in terms of replayability and meaningful consequences.  It would be exceeedingly rare for two separate gamers to have two Wardens that made all the same choices.  I'd say the odds would be somewhere in the hundreds of millions to one.  There are hundreds of small choices, and quite a few large ones that not only affect the ending, but leak over into the DLC and Awakening (and somewhat into DA2).  This is what makes this game a masterpiece.  It singlehandedly makes you forget your life and brings you into the fold of Ferelden, Amaranthine, and Thedas itself.  Only the Bethesda games can claim to have as large a scope, but DA:O will always win in excecution in my book.			"

												EDIT: Nominated for my  The “Test of Time” Award Steam Autumn Sale 2016 AwardDISCLAIMER: This game is very much worth the asking price but please consider getting the Ultimate Edition instead with all the dlc for only 10 more USD. Getting it all ingame through bioware point microransactions costs far more. Dragon Age: Origins is easily one of the best games I have ever played. No other game has made me actually care about the characters on such a massive degree as this game has. Combine the world class Bioware writing and worlds with a pretty good but not perfect combat system and you have truly an epic adventure to behold. The world itself isn't really open world but that doesn't stop the land of Ferelden from being an interesting realm to explore. Graphically the game is quite dated now and lip syncing/animations are at times awkward (oh god the sex scenes ._.) but there is a very large mod database for improving visuals and despite looking old the game is still very much playable. (Also I'm pretty sure anything can run this game in this day and age) Having many important choices actually matter and have a huge impact on the story makes this game incredibly replayable and a wetdream for roleplayers. In many situations you can be the good samaritan or evil incarnate. This leads to a level of immersion  rivaling that of other high fantasy rpgs such as the Elder Scrolls games. Everything from the various dialogue/party banter for the smallest of details to your companions actually having opinions on every choice you make really sells Dragon Age: Origins as a living breathing believable world which you can get lost in for hours on end. The combat is very traditional dnd/baldurs gate style combat which some people who favor tactical combat with many pauses will enjoy and those who enjoy something like traditional hack n slash may not. Also the game starts off very slow so you have been warned. It picks up a few hours in when your party actually has a variety of skills.My playtime (5% being me alt tabbed out) is for a single playthrough so there is definitely a ton of content in this game.

												The game that started a franchise. Dragon Age Origins brings us to the kingdom of Ferelden, caught in an epic battle against the Darkspawn horde, led by an Archdemon. I can't say much more without giving away the story, though I will say get ready for intrigue, mysteries, betrayal, redemption, and more as you join forces with Wandering and Mysterious strangers, Brothers and Sisters in Arms, and people you help along the way. Dragon Age Origins has just the right blend of RPG elements, and plot driven story line, to make it fun and interesting without letting you get to sidetracked. If you have any interest in the series at all, you must start with Origins. There are several DLC packs available for DA: Origins, which further the main story, provide backstory and history, as well as introduce new companions. Playing with all available DLC is recommended for the full experience. Having played DA: Origins, as well as DA 2 on the PS3, I look forward to reliving those experiences on the steam version of DA: Origins. It is that good!			"

												As you can tell, this game sucked me into the world and consumed a great deal of happy time.   Highly recommend playing it through once the way the devs intended but with mods aplenty you can make it more shiny and polished if that's your thing.  ( It was mine, I even began making mods).  The characters and story are what sell the game, the combat mechanics are clunky by today's standards but even they have their fans out there.  But be warned, battles are best planned and strategized rather than hack and slashed so if that's a deal breaker, maybe walk away.  If though you want a great story, stellar voice actors, likeable characters and can forgive an aged combat system I can easily recommend this.			"

												Note: hours on record don't mean jack ♥♥♥♥, as I played this a LOT during some periods without Steam connection, not to mention having played it(multiple times) across PC, 360, AND PS3. (yea I like the game)That said, this game is AMAZEBALLS. Not only can you play it in a hack-n-slash way(all zoomed in likea ♥♥♥♥♥), or you can play it in a semi-casual mode(zoomed fairly far out, 3rd person style), or you can play it all ""real man"" mode, which is basically zoomed out as far as you possibly can, pause the ♥♥♥♥ outta EVERYTHING gameplay(a la BG).The core game is great. The locations are awesome and varied. The characters are all VERY deeply rendered. The combat is quite good(although you'll find certain classes destroy across the board). The audio is good. The story is good. The replay value is good.So yea, game is good.Now, if you were thinking, well ♥♥♥♥, I'mma buy this ASAP, let me give you one more thing that is good: the ♥♥♥♥ing mods. Did I say mods? because I meant: MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODS. Seriously. This game has WAY too many of them. I mean, it's not Skyrim level of silliness, but you'll still find nude packs and waifus here too. Not to mention, TONS of imports from DA2, namely weapons and skins, which Bioware is ok with(kthxbye).tl;dr: If you don't have this game in your account yet and you call yourself an RPG fan, then no, you aren't.

												I've finished all 3 Dragon Age games. This one is the greatest, Inqusition being the second and Dragon Age-2 being the third. Despite being old and lacking today's engine capabilities, this one managed to beat the newest installment on the series for me. I'd recommend anyone to purchase this one before any other. This had a lot more depth to the desicion mechanics, interactions between characters, immersion and overall story presentation. Side quests actually have a proper backroung story and diolog options whereas in Inqusition, they are similar to a typical mmo levelling quest. Their purpose is to offer a grinding source in order to reach the main story mission and they aren't enjoyable. Origins base game offered a decent amount of content for it's price. The only downside on the original Dragon Age game compared to the newer ones is it's combat.			"

												I have to say Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best Role-Playing games I've ever played. The storyline (which looks like it's been inspired by both J. R. R. Tolkien and George R. R. Martin) is - by far - one of the best storylines ever told in an RPG. But okay, you can expect that from Bioware. The gameplay combines very well - in my opinion - combat, tactics and the abillities each character has. The quest system is great, not as good as Mass Effect 1 and 2 though. Each companion has its backstory, the most of the backstories are interesting. The side quests are less boring than Mass Effect 1. Buy it. It's really worth playing.			"

												Just got this game, and even though it's old and I was playing it for my first playthrough, I racked up about 110+ hours in the game. And that's not including the length of the DLCS. With everything that's going on, everything you can do, and everything that your decisions will determine, just makes this game incredibly thought-provoking and interesting. Choices choices choices. I'm really looking forward to playing Dragon Age 2, and Dragon age inquisition, and when that time comes, you probably won't be seeing me for a few weeks.I recommend this game, 10/10. If dragons aren't your thing, trust me you'll like it anyway. Just make sure you give yourself at least 3 hours to play it, otherwise you'll hate yourself for not having enough time.			"

												First of all, It's a very very very excellent game!!!!!!! Never ever miss it!The reason why I do not recommend buying this is because that this version contains no DLC which also you cannot buy.However, the Ultimate Eidtion of DAO has all DLC, so if you want  this game you should pick the Ultimate Edition version!!!Or, you should go straight to Origin paltform to purchase this game, besides you can use the Dragon Age Keep more handily.

												Honest to the Maker this has turned into one of my favourite rpg series. Bioware knows what they're doing! Perhaps the star of the game besides its story are these wonderfully complex charcters that feel like actual people, easily turing into some of my all time favourite characters. The characters truly do grow and change and you can even choose to shape them and their perception of the world, and this will ultimately influence the ending. With difficult and even painful decisions to make along the way, it creates the feeling that you as a Grey Warden are currently making history and are of the utmost importance.Thoroughly enjoyable, very replayable. I can't say enough. Buy it.			"

												Man, was I late to the party with this one. Most people were long done with this game by the time I got around to play and I can  see why I had to literally run away from people who wanted to spoil the game for me. Its just fantastic. The tone of the story is that is serious and somber, the mechanics are also serious and somber and when you die for the third time to a random group encounter you will also be serious and somber.This is the first game in a while that not only gave me a fairly compelling narrative with interesting character but also a very challenging game that required that you work for your victory. You can't just cruise through the game and I love it for that.So, if want something to entertain and challenge you then you need to get this game.

												Have a no never-mind on the number of hours; I've finished Dragon Age: Origins about a half-dozen times, and I've gone through the origins about 1300 times (approximately). I have yet to play it with Steam, and that's where I'm getting stuck. And I'll get to that in a bit.Dragon Age: Origins is an RPG, very much in the vein of classic D&D 3.5, except not. It's a wholly new Universe, with its own history, gods, races and rules. The characters have attributes similar but different to those from D&D, talents and skills replace feats (sort-of), and everything involves numbers flying out of people's heads.The ""origins"" part of the game is two-fold; first, this is the initial game set in the Universe. Second, there are six unique origins (Human Noble, Mage, Dalish Elf, City Elf, Dwarf Noble, Dwarf Commoner), which changes your starting equipment and your starting experiences. It's pretty good, all told, and I also like the minor variations between Male City Elf and the Female City Elf.The graphics are impressive for the RPG genre. Walking / running animations for females seem a bit awkward, but it's not really all that bad. Hats are goofy, and should generally be avoided if you want to keep a straight face. Voice acting is similarly good, supplemented by snappy dialogue. And Simon Templeman!The story, when it came out, was touted as a ""shades of grey"" sort of thing, which, to be fair, did seem that way at the time. To be honest, it's still very much a ""good vs evil"" struggle, and there is still certain decisions that are more complicated than they appear (dwarven kingdom, I'm looking at you), I think it's fairly clearcut what the ""right"" decision is. Spoiler, being evil still involves being a ♥♥♥♥. Except there aren't any alignment points to tell you that.You get companions, and as is the fashion, you get influence points with them. You can get alignment points by giving them the right answers in the talk-a-thons, or giving them gifts. It's a gameable system, which is appropriate since this is a game. I can't imagine anyone trying to ♥♥♥♥ any of the companions off, but it's there, and there are points where you can kill them off permenantly (as I'd learned when I was first playing and wound up killing Wynne).My main problem with Dragon Age: Origins however stems from game mechanics. If you've ever been through the online Wiki, it makes for depressing reading, when you discover that half the talents don't do what they're supposed to, or don't work the way they're advertised. It really puts a damper on playing the game, especially with a slightly obsessive compulsive like myself, who must have the character be absolutely perfect. There are mods for everything (because of course there are), but why should I have to install a half-dozen mods to play a game I've paid for? It really torques me off.But that aside, Dragon Age: Origins was a brilliant start to a great franchise. I still haven't downloaded Dragon Age: Inquisition (because it's not on Steam), and I'm waiting to see how the story progresses.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is, in short, one of the finest modern tactical RPGs you will ever play. If you loved Icewind Dale, Baldur's Gate and the like, this is THE RPG for you.Far from the hack & slash tactics of the abomination that was the sequel, this game encourages and demands intelligent, tactical thinking on the battlefield while supporting deep and meaningful choices motivated by rich stories and characters.At time of writing (2016) the graphics still hold up as respectable. The voice acting is some of the best you will ever hear in a computer game, the musical score is inspiring in its own right, and lore is deep and engaging. I could not possibly like this game any more. 300+ hours played and still keep coming back to it.			"

A proper fantasy game with all the wonderful talks of valor, duty and bravery, mythical beasts, magic and all those other awesome things.Lovely gameplay, a couple of minor bugs, but those do not mess with the storyline.After completing the game for the first time (I fully intend to go through it again, only choosing another starting hero), I almost felt like all the characters I had the oportunity to play with were kind of my friends. At the end, I almost got emotional (there's no ""almost"", I really did).I guess this would be the first time I am experiencing that ""I don't know what to with my life now!"" feeling regarding a game.

												While dragon age origins is a good game and is certainly worth buying, there are a fair number of flaws to the game that you need to know.First of all, it's a good RPG. It tells an interesting story, provides plenty of content, and has a lot of different options you can take that can affect the story or combat.However, the game has weird difficulty spikes. You can be blazing through encounters with not too much resistance, only to hit a brick wall where you instantly die and have to reload a save from 20 minutes ago. Lost progress is never fun, and it's just extremely inconsistent. Even the non-encounter bits are weird; i was looting lesser health poultices, the weakest of healing items, just before the final encounter. If you play this, autosave all. the. time.Related to this, stability is an issue. Throughout my playthrough, i had ~20 or more crashes.The game seems fairly intent on pushing DLC - personally i'm not a fan of that, especially since it has an NPC with a big glowing exclamation mark above it right in your party camp, to tell you of this adventure that you would have to pay for to access.Overall though? If you're a fan of RPG's and/or good story, go for it, it's well worth the price. Just leave it on easy if you're not a fan of the combat,  that way you can avoid most of the difficulty spikes and get combat over with faster.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is definitely in my Top 3 for favorite Bioware games, coming close to KotOR 1 and ME2. It definitely has some of the most memorable companions (imo). I don't usually like to do pros and cons, but it's hard to break down this game any other way. so:Pros:- Incredible story. You really can't find a better underdog story than this, especially if you go the City Elf route. Not to mention that this could probably compete with Game of Thrones with all of the scheming and backstabbing.- Six unique backstories. Sure the general plot stays the same, but with six different introduction stories, the game becomes very re-playable.- Companions. Aside from the dog that you'll probably forget you even have, your companions are very unique and interesting. From Alistair to Zevran, they all have a personality that is hard to forget. Well, except for Sten, but he's memorable in other ways.- Engrossing. The first time I played this, I was so involved in the story, I could hardly believe it when I checked the clock and saw that 3 hours had passed like nothing.-Content. It will take a while for you to finish this game, no doubt about that. I generally average about 30 hours to finish, and that's without doing half of the side quests.Cons:- Combat. Don't expect the combat to be very exciting. It's a bit slow paced, and you'll spend most of your time watching your party take their sweet time to swing their swords while you wait for their abilities to cooldown.- Dungeons. A lot of the dungeons are really drawn out. You'll spend so long fighting your way though the quests that you'll probably forget why you're there in the first place.Overall, I'd give this game an 8.5/10. You won't be wasting your money here. So what do you say? Are you ready to join the Night's Watch (er... Grey Wardens!) and take on the evil White Walkers (er... Darkspawn...) to determine the fate of Westeros? (Crap, Ferelden, sorry xD)			"

												Still the Best Game in its Franchise...The first game I ever had on Steam. In fact, this game was the reason I got Steam in the first place. Bought the game upon it's first day of release and I have been playing on and off over the years. Shame, I played this at least 3-4x the amount of hours it says on my profile offline, and I've not lost my interest in the game one-bit.Rating(s):Visuals & Graphics: 10/10+ It was very innovative during it's time. I can remember all the HYPE it received months before release. Considering today's present standards DA 1 Graphics is already a bit dated, but I will rate it accordingly to the time period it actually got released, and for that time's standard's it was one of the TOP.- TERRIBLE looking armor and weapons, not really my style. I guess this was intentional for immersion purposes, but I was hoping they used better item models for higher quality gear.Music and Sound: 10/10AMAZING OST. I have the full OST on my Music Library along with the other Game OSTs I thoroughly enjoy. The ambience music is appropriate, the Intro Song is infectious, Leliana's Song was memorable. It's not as impressive as Skyrim's OST but it does come very close to being perfect. Plot/Story/Characters: 10/10+ Story-Rich, this has possibly one of the, if not the MOST, DEEPEST Story Lines I've ever played. + One of the game-changers in the RPG genre, and perpetrated the ""player-choice actually mattered"" trend. While many games actually promised this (*cough* I'm looking at you Fable *cough*). DA 1 is probably the first game that ever delivered this promised to the extent that it did.+ The characters are memorable, and their side-humor is actually funnyGameplay and Mechanics: 9/10+ Call me old school, but this is the format of Western RPG (BG-type) I grew up with and still enjoy. Positioning, character and team control micromanagement just calls for so much decision making and tactics input from the player's end that it makes playing enjoyable even if you at certain situations. + While game can be played in Real-Time the gameplay system allows you to use the pause function as a means to reorganize and plan your next move during a fight. Probably a homage to the turn-based system Bioware was originally known for, but overall the system is very well thought out.+ Mod-friendly game, lots of content to extend your gameplay are available at DA Nexus= AI is horrendous, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on who is playing. If you are a casual, and expect to only concentrate on your own character with the rest of your team as support, then I suggest you turn it to Easy/Normal. Don't expect to play this game on Nightmare, with fully knowing/wanting to Micromanage your team every step of the way.- Balance Issues (Arcane Mage Tank, I'm looking at you); I'm pretty sure Bioware did not intend for this to happen, having a mage caster as a front line being able to Solo Nightmare by itself once this specialization is open at lvl 7, but it did. As usal, Bioware being the pompous, arrogant, unapologetic ♥♥♥♥♥ that they are never gave a fu.ck and left it at this state.- Tactics scripting is a mess (can be fixed with mods though) - severe need for micromanagement at higher difficulties become mandatory because this ""feature"" was incomplete/defective on releaseOverall, a very fun game and a big recommendation to all true RPG fans out there.

												If you buy this get the version with all the DLC. Otherwise you encounter random NPC's that are super interesting and while talking to them the game informs you that you can't do anything without buying the DLC. Sometimes the game even has you venture into a brand new area from the world map just to tell you to leave unless you buy the DLC. This happened three times within 20 minutes of playtime. 0/10 I hate DLC product placement.EDIT - I just want to say this game is really good, my hours keep rising... I stil hate the DLC placement.

												Auto Combat isn't necessarily my favorite type of game. But the story and characters are so perfectly crafted, that from the very beginning it immerse you in its rich backstory, vibrant story-telling. Compond that with all the moral choices that keep you coming back for seconds, and thirds. For this fact alone it gives the game great replay value. The game fantastic, and immensely entertaining. 9/10			"

Theres no shortage of things to do and hidden gems to find in Dragon Age: Origins. Bioware have really outdone themselves this time.If your a fan of rpgs and Bioware especially, then you owe it to yourself to play Dragon Age: Origins. And dont rush through it. This game shines when you take your time and explore the world thats been crafted here.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins represents the final, yet surprisingly dignified breath of the big budget/big publisher party-based isometric RPG (in the same vein as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc). The combat is streamlined just enough to be accessible to a broad audience, but also allows for second-by-second strategy, as well as ability/item use for individual party members via the Tactics menu. The companions themselves... well, they're written at least as well as their predecessors from earlier Bioware games, though not terribly deviating from genre conventions. People generally complain about the brownish, detail-less graphics, which thankfully can be at least partially rectified through use of texture mods and color filter mods like SweetFX; in the end, however, this was conceived as an isometric-view RPG for a reason (as far as graphics go). The actual ""Origins"" part of the game, aka the multiple races and backgrounds you can choose from in the player character creator, is well-integrated into the adventure as a whole; the atmosphere produced from playing as a Dwarven Noble compared to one developed through starting out as a Circle Mage can be substantially different, affecting your story decisions and companion interactions. Speaking of playing as a Mage: please do. Or don't; it basically depends on your willingness to become a swirling-firestorm death god and subsequently, shred any pretense of balance. Such a career choice can be quite fun, but also somewhat boring; players worried about such an issue can merely avoid choosing the ""Spirit Warrior"" specialization which, for the most part, serves as the source of the class's overpowered nature.  As far as DLC goes, most of it is nonessential from either a story or gameplay perspective, but get the Ultimate Edition anyway: It's a ridiculously better value than buying the few above-average DLCs and expansions (well, expansion) separately.

												I love this game. The real strength is in the setting and the characters. I would recommend this game to anyone with an interest in RPGs in general, and doubly so to fans of the later DA games. I sunk ~75 hours into my first playthrough without getting bored. A lot of people say the gameplay is clunky, and I can definitely see why, but I enjoy it. Playing a mage is particularly satisfying for the sheer level of ridiculous destruction you can inflict. If you like setting setting the entire screen on fire and knocking down friend and foe alike, I highly recommend it.Make sure you know whether or not you want the DLC! If you do, make sure you buy the Ultimate Edition instead of this version. Buying the dlc individually is a real pain in the ♥♥♥. The Awakening DLC is great, imo, but I could take or leave the rest.			"

I knew nothing about Dragon Age at the time of purchase. I started playing and was immmediatly blown away. The storyline was enthralling, it brought back memories of sitting around a table playing dungeons and dragons with my friends. I thought The fact that you could control a party of characters was a great addition to how the game played out.If you like The Elder Scrolls, Lord of The Rings, and Dungeons and Dragons, then I highly recommend this game.

I finished both the Origins and the 2 in maybe 100 hours (more or less, I didn't play them through Steam, so the number of hours isn't recorded) which usually seems plently, but with these games it didn't seem enough. I will deffinitely play this game again in the future, and I can't wait to buy the third one to play it as well (maybe this time on Steam, so I can actually record the progress :))) ).

												When Bioware announced that Dragon Age would be a ""Spiritual Successor"" to the Baldur's Gate franchise it had many people. myself included, hoping that it was a sign that they would turn away from the cinematic ""gameplay"" they had been making for so long and return to making solid tactical RPGs' that were a joy to play and a pain to master.However as it turned out, this was not the case. DAO may look like it takes it's inspiration from old Infinity Engine games but this is not the case, the game is an action RPG, with poor voice-acting, mediocre storytelling and little to no tactical elements in the combat sequences.While the game is not completely bad, and even takes many steps in what I'd consider ""The right direction"", it is still a monument to the fact that Bioware is no longer interested in making games that challenge their fans. No longer wants us to question ethics, to be inquisitive or to play any of their games more than once. It is the tombstone of the old Bioware.			"

												Are you kidding me?  Do I even need to say why this game is so awesome?  First of all, this is a legit RPG; the decisions you make WILL affect what happens later on.  The character progressiong is a tad dull, but there are several options for each class, and several different ways you can play each class, regardless of what you pick.  Second of all, I personally love the story.  I would have to say this is my favorite RPG to this date, possibly forever.  Newer games really don't focus on the content as much as the graphics anymore, which is ♥♥♥♥ing gay considering the amount of people have substandard-level pcs.  The only flaws in this game are the lack of quality (as in good) story mods, and the limited amount of DLC.

												There is so much to be said about this game I don't even know where to begin.Overall story is huge and deep with ALOT of plot twists which I enjoyed alot, all the companions that you meet along the way are easily lovable and useful.Gameplay wise its very strategic and actually makes you think before you mindlessly attack your enemies.First game that I spent 96 hours on a single play through, I REALLY REALLY recommend this game to all the rpg fans out there.

												An exciting RPG that has BioWare throwing back to the Baldur's Gate Era, combining classic party roleplay and tactical battles. Also, it's pretty clear that the cinematic presentation took some notes from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies. The storytelling is great, the dialogue is up to BioWare's legacy, the sound effects are great, and the world is engrossing.Is the technology start of the art, though? No. And the textures and background details could have used some work as well.			"

												I LOVE this game. I have fallen behind on playing it however, and for good reason. Im stuck. When your stuck your royal stuck and screwed. Its impossible to back track enough to get unstuck, especiallywhen you get into the higher levels. I got into a room and immediatly get screwed over within 3 minutes. Its a strategy I have yet to overcome, even though I have repeated it 9 times. At this point, the developers should have input a mechanic that let you back track, because after that first fail, there is no recovery. Other then that, it has beautiful graphics, a great action control, good A.I control and NPC partners. Dogs my favorite. Hands down. No matter what race you go with as well, YOU ALWAYS GET A DOG <3 This is a game I feel a bunch of skyrim people would like. Its a challenging strategy that has you on your wits end and emotional too.

												It's a good RPG, if a bit silly at times. It carries interesting messages which a lot of gamers don't care to think about, due to the fact that most gamers don't tend to think at all, so I'm surprised this game is as popular as it is. It's pretty neat, though, for much different reason than the second game. The first game is a really cool story; the second game is a really averge story with really pretty location, object, and character designs, and cheesy, cartoonish animations that don't fit the mood of the game world in the least. The first game is much less flashy, but much more coherent.			"

A Customizable character, several party members each with a deep background story, a combat system that really takes you to more than just ""kill'em!"" commands, and a somewhat big world to explore. Your companions really need attention, you need to talk to them, give them gifts, an maybe you can even have a romance with some of them, but no... not the dog... tried that....It took me about 60 hrs to play through for the first time, some modding included...Speaking of mods, you really get to do a lot with those, there are mods for almost anything, just have a look.Would and will play this again, without hesitation.

The depth of the Characters and story is unparrelled to anything I have played yet and the story tree is what really drove the game; each decsion you make effects the out come. the combat was also not wanting; the interesting style of pause and play allows for a unique battling system. to vary it up though I would suggest switching tactics so you do not get bored (as some people have found) but the story itself makes up for any grievences that you find with the game.

												Story. Story everywhere.Let em start by saying I am not a very big fan of newer RPG games (I do like them once in a while but since I played a lot of RPGs in my teens I kinda grew tired of them) but his one is soo good. just the story alone would be enought to keep you playing.FIrst of all it plays very different from other RPGS I have played, you have 4 characters (top without mods) you can control, they handle like in a MMO RPG, where you have all skills assigned to your lower bar to numbers, and at any time you can freeze the game to give them orders on what to do, who to attack, etc. And you can also set up AI strategies so they respond in a certain way to certain circunstances.Its challenging, its fun, its rewarding to level them up, get new items, learn their backgrounds, etc.The only small downside I find in this game is that you cannot reset your skills, nor have an option that allows you to not show your helmet (they are quite ugly). Fear not, there exist 2 mods that will help with that (I would dare say they are a must)Everythign else is perfect, it got me hungry for more of this series.			"

												This is a great RPG. The campaign settings is very well constructed. The story is very immersive, and your actions have moral implications during the plot. The characteres are well developed. The combat system is great and the graphics are beautifull. I really recommend this game. Just right now, I finished the main campaign, and I enjoyed it a lot.The campaign settings is composed by a brutal and mercyless medieval world, with all the problems such a place has: pety lords fighting for power, an invading army, peasant refugees, low crops, nobles locked in luxury inside his palaces, and so on. This is a low fantasy scenario with no black and white sides. To stop the invading army you'll have to ally with good lords and with tirants, and all your moral decisions have impact into the world.It's a great game that can be playede in various ways. The engine adapts itself to your style of play, and, in my opinion, there are vry few aspects that coul'd be beeter, like:- The main charactere coul'd be a personality, like Sheppar in Mass Effect. In Mass Effect, when you choose an option in dialog, the main charactere uses thath option with his/hers own personality. They coul'd be used that feature in this game.- The secound charactere classes coul'd be more usefull. Theese classes coul'd be better worked.- At the end of the game, you are strong enought to fight almost anything. So, except for the final boss, there were little chalenge. But almost all RPGs suffers from this.Finally, the DLCs. For now, I played Return to Ostagar, The stone Prisioner and Warden's keep. The only one that really makes difference was the stone prisioner. The items (armor and weapon) were not that good, and the story was so disconnected with the main plot that it simply is not woth what is charged. The worst was return to ostagar. Completelly dispensable.The other camaigns: Awakenning, darkspawn cronicle and so on, I still didn't play it. So, in a future post, I'll talk about it.In general, I really recommend this game. If you like RPGs, you enjoy it a lot.			"

												While perhaps the combat mechanics are not amazing, being roll based, the amount of options and interactions between different skills more than compensate for it. However the game's main strength is the amazing story. The amount of variation depending on the choices you make and how you create the character itself makes this one of the best games I've ever played.			"

												The ultimate edition is an excellent value, and will give you many enjoyable evenings of gaming. Replay value is high, with many achievements to earn and some interesting class combinations to explore. The graphics are somewhat dated, and the camera controls a little clunky. Characters and NPCs do require some micromanagement.RPG elements are not as limiting as many RPGs, and some of your decisions have far reaching consequences (so save often and keep key saved game files for your entire first playthru).

												Now I spend about 60 hours on this game.Considering that I dislike RPGs aside from Fallout and Skyrim, which are open world games, this is one of the best titles I've ever laid my hands on. It takes time to get used to, especially the combat system. Your companions and yourself will die a lot untill you really figure out how to properly play and especially skill the classes. The tactics system might seem confusing at start but once you get the hang of it you will realise that this is one of the probably most powerful tools ever included into any kind of game. Maybe a bit overextended but I think this works even better than most strategy games or tactic-based games like Operation Flashpoint or ArmA.As for the story, I won't exactly say what's going on incase anybody is afraid of spoilers, but I can tell that it sounds like the usual ""Let's save the world once more""-stuff, which it actually is, but when looking at the details, you can tell how much effort and love the developers spent designing this story. Every decision you make will change the outcome of the game. You can have romances with your companions as well solve some quests involving their personal past.Conclusion: GET. THIS. GAME. Even one of the biggest RPG-game-haters (which is currently writing this rewiew) fell absolutely in love with Dragon Age.Can't wait for Dragon Age: Inquisition.PS: Don't ♥♥♥♥ with Leilana. Or I will ♥♥♥♥ with you.			"

												I bounced off this game the first time, probably because I wasn't in the right mental ""space"" to tackle a big old-school RPG.  But once I got into it, I couldn't get enough.  It wasn't the story-line that did it for me (fairly cliche, with an edge of modern dark fantasy), or the characters (except for Morrigan, who I did find moderately interesting), but the tactical combat and deep RPG mechanics that truly did recall fond memories of hours spent in Baldur's Gate.

												This was not one of my all time favorite games but a game in the Spirit of Baldur's Gate is always a fun time.  I was never really into the whole ""darker theme"" thing but this game made it work and made the dwarves the coolest racists I've seen in a game outside of a sandbox shooter.  I think I lost track of what exactly I wanted to say but if you like a good classic western D&D style RPG this is a good choice.			"

												The last great RPG out by bioware before EA turned them into a mindless zombie company.  Seriously, this game is really good for old RPG fans who care about deep dialog, branching outcomes, rememborable NPC's, interesting lore and much more more.  If there is a negative, it is that some of the DLC is not worth it and it is very annoying that there is NPC's trying to sell you DLC in the game (EA's doing).  If you want to know what bioware was like before EA's corrosive touch, this is a good example of how amazing they used to be.			"

												Favourite game of all times <3 Dragon Age offers the most in-depth RPG experience I've ever seen : every choice you make has an impact on the story, the consequences are interwoven to form a narrative exclusive to your character. No two stories are the same, and even NPC reactions are tailored to who you character is : race, class and gender are all taken into account. The relationships you can develop with your companions are meaningful, feel real and have consequences on the story as well. I left the game feeling like I had befriended real people, and made a difference in the world. Graphics and music make for a beautiful, immersive game, and the voice acting is amazing. Combat is pretty intuitive, as is the character progression system. It can also be tailored to your interest : from completely casual, easy and letting your companions do what they want, to extreme tailoring of their abilities and complete tactical view of the field. You are free to do as many side quests as you want, or none at all, letting you choose your pace and the length of the game. Regarding the main quest, even though it might seem unoriginal at first, there are a few plot twists that make it quite interesting and unique. (I had read spoilers and still had heartwrenching suprises while playing.)I definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs !!			"

												Exeptional game. Probably one of the best in party based rpg' s to date...To be honest; i have to tell that i was not a die hard fan of party based rpg's until this one. But this game does everything right. What i mean by that is; while it contains all the elements a party based rpg might have; it does not overuse any of them. The game is in an absolute balance in this regard. It does not choke you in wall of texts, dialogs, lore, combat, dungeons etc. Every element is on a right dosage. Even the most criticized portion ""The Fade"" has some interesting mechanics which might appeal to someone. Besides; you always have the option to do some other things if you get bored. Like chatting with your party members, exploring the lore reading codexes, doing some side missions, crafting and so on...The main plot is a classic save the world scheme with some interesting plot twists and consequences. Not a masterpiece, but definetely above average. You may encounter some really good missions, conflicts, moral choices on your way to the end. Graphics and art style blend well together and are consistent with the lore. I believe the game holds really well to this date on this matter. But what makes this game so special is its gameplay and mainly combat. Personally; i always look for freedom and full control in games containing tactical elements. Only a minority can give that to you. Most of the time; you' ll be crippled by a combination of different gameplay mechanics like bad and unresponsive unit ai, inefficient ui, lack of camera options, slow animations or simply combat being so fast that you can' t catch up with the pace... Let me tell you; Dragon Age does it all right near perfection. You can play the game in anyway you like. Like me; you can use all the intruments available to you and dictate the course of the combat. Or; you can simply customize the tactics to your pleasure and play it like an action rpg. Simply; you can be anywhere between these two extremes in playstyles. Which means; if you want to, you can really make every encounter different from each other. This is huge. And i believe it contributes a lot to your satisfaction and to the game's replayability.Besides all above;Inability to respec and pre-specced party members is not in line with the freedom i have mentioned. But may be considered consistent within the lore. ""Awakenings"" lets you respec and you can always use a mod to do that in ""Origins"" anyways. So it is not a big deal. Itemization is another weak aspect of the game. At least that is how i feel. Most of the time you' ll see items with random and useless attribitues to your class. They do not really contribute much to your gameplay and most of them are not appealing to your eyes especially mage helmets. I mean; itemization is not that bad but it is not an integral part of the game either. You feel like it got less attention because of that.Some missions may bore you, especially during replays. Like the ones involving ""The Fade"" and ""The Deep Roads"" which everybody is talking about. But they can be moded out. Ultimate Edition has region lock in Steam. I don' t know why but it is really annoying. Also Dlc' s are way overpriced for a 4 year old game and nearly never gets a discount. But there are some sort of free stuff downloadable via Bioware' s website being mainly cosmetics and items. The game also has a toolset for modding and editing that you can download if you are interested with this stuff. Anyways; while you can find some flaws and issues with the game here and there; they are all minor annoyances considering the fun you' ll get out of it. Therefore; i strongly reccomend it to anyone new or familiar to the genre. It is really one of the best...			"

												Dragon Age: Origins to date, remains one of the greatest single player RPGs ever made. The characters are remarkable, with each having their own opinions and personalities, and the world itself feels genuine. The story has been told before; Big evil threatens the world, a lonely band of heroes ride to stop it, but Origins manages to keep it feeling fresh through the whole thing.Some of the DLC is of questionable worth, ultimately you'll only really want it if you're a hardcore fan, and the expansion was relative rubbish, though it did advance the story in an interesting fashion if you find yourself enjoying Origins enough.Want to see what Bioware was capable of before they started selling out?

												Why I give this game 10/10:- The combat is flawless and original. It's a combination of Real Time Strategy and Tactical Combat (I would call it RTT, Real Time Tactics) and the attack combo potential is limitless. You could even exploit some of it if you thought the possibilities.- Your own adventure. You choose races and their background & backstory. You could be a noble human, an oppressed city elf, a free dalish elf, a noble dwarf, anything that suits you. Even the prologue is different for every backstory, making the game had a lot of possible playthrough. The choices you made also alter your adventure and made different outcomes.- A bit hard for newbies/non-RPG gamers, but for me it's challenging and fun. I could reload the same save point 10 times just to defeat an annoying enemy but it was worth my time.If you don't have this game yet, buy it. Now. Or maybe wait for Steam Sales.			"

The graphics are simply breath taking and the battle system (as well as the Player/NPC relationships) are really intense and thought out.  If you plan on getting this game, though, I would have to recommend getting the Ultimate Edition.

I was never really into the whole ""darker theme"" thing but this game made it work and made the dwarves the coolest racists I've seen in a game outside of a sandbox shooter.

												This game is simply fantastic!By this I mean really good gameplay with incredible stories for both main storyline and all the sidequesting things. I've had two runs of the game already (as an elven mage and a human noble) and I STILL have 57% of the game to do (I tend to miss the sidequests easily, but that's my problem).My only complaint would be the travel system, but at least the loading screen is pretty and you can track the darkspawn through it.This game suits EVERYONE. Listen up, if you need to get your ladyfriend interested with PC games, start with this one. Make her a female human noble, make her love Alistair and - bam! Done. She's on it.P.S. This game can be quite hard sometimes, as it has no defined instructions on what to do. You can run around for 10 hours and only then notice a small fiddly thing you're supposed to press to progress, And the enemies... they attack in packs of 20. You can break your WASD, but it does worth it.			"

												Why I give this game 10/10:- The combat is flawless and original. It's a combination of Real Time Strategy and Tactical Combat (I would call it RTT, Real Time Tactics) and the attack combo potential is limitless. You could even exploit some of it if you thought the possibilities.- Your own adventure. You choose races and their background & backstory. You could be a noble human, an oppressed city elf, a free dalish elf, a noble dwarf, anything that suits you. Even the prologue is different for every backstory, making the game had a lot of possible playthrough. The choices you made also alter your adventure and made different outcomes.- A bit hard for newbies/non-RPG gamers, but for me it's challenging and fun. I could reload the same save point 10 times just to defeat an annoying enemy but it was worth my time.If you don't have this game yet, buy it. Now. Or maybe wait for Steam Sales.			"

It wasn't the story-line that did it for me (fairly cliche, with an edge of modern dark fantasy), or the characters (except for Morrigan, who I did find moderately interesting), but the tactical combat and deep RPG mechanics that truly did recall fond memories of hours spent in Baldur's Gate.

												The last great RPG out by bioware before EA turned them into a mindless zombie company.  Seriously, this game is really good for old RPG fans who care about deep dialog, branching outcomes, rememborable NPC's, interesting lore and much more more.  If there is a negative, it is that some of the DLC is not worth it and it is very annoying that there is NPC's trying to sell you DLC in the game (EA's doing).  If you want to know what bioware was like before EA's corrosive touch, this is a good example of how amazing they used to be.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins to date, remains one of the greatest single player RPGs ever made. The characters are remarkable, with each having their own opinions and personalities, and the world itself feels genuine. The story has been told before; Big evil threatens the world, a lonely band of heroes ride to stop it, but Origins manages to keep it feeling fresh through the whole thing.Some of the DLC is of questionable worth, ultimately you'll only really want it if you're a hardcore fan, and the expansion was relative rubbish, though it did advance the story in an interesting fashion if you find yourself enjoying Origins enough.Want to see what Bioware was capable of before they started selling out? Play this, and the RPG community will cry with you. Also, avoid the sequal like the plague.			"

												In an age of... Er, that is, in an age where old school CRPGs are considered dead to most big-budget developers, Dragon Age Origins stands out as an attempt to update - without replacing - most of the classic western RPG mechanics. Begun before EA got its claws into BioWare, it reflects what many of us loved about them in years past, and seldom see now. It's a big, literally epic-scale, slow-paced story heavy game with overflowing inventory and an original but not too unfamiliar fantasy world. Fans of action should try its sequel, Dragon Age 2, first - but those looking for something other than a quick adrenaline rush will find much to explore within. The massive world still has a number of significant bugs, but is quite playable, and the modding community has provided much to both fix and add to the game if you're so inclined.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and it does it so successfully that it's a great blast to play on top of feeding that nostalgia old school RPG players have.  The combat is excellent in that it's less about timing and more about managing the entire party's skills and abilities. The round-based faux-realtime combat makes for an easy method to alter plans when paused and in turn makes combat a fun game in it's own right.Combine all that with an excellent story, a fleshed out world, and excellent voice acting for well-written characters and you get a perfect update to what is essentially a classic RPG.Make no mistake, the game lacks the ""exciting"" animations of movie-esque combat, but that's fine considering the world's take on things. Realistic-ye-fantasy works so well for the game, providing a much needed grounding for characters' abilities to be believable.If you haven't picked up Dragon Age, grab the bundle, enjoy all the DLC and expansion content.

												Really, I love this game.  Certainly not perfect, and certainly not immune to the ""Bioware effect,"" but bar none, I think this is the best classic western-style (read: inspired by D&D) RPG I've ever played.  It's a tiny bit generic at this point, but that's really a result of an obsessed culture more than anything else.  If you like classic ARPG's, this is one of the best - especially making use of the top-down camera.  It makes the game feel like a modern version of Baldur's Gate - and the strategy element can be very challenging and satisfying.  I got the xbox version of this game and was very disappointed to find that the top-down strategic play had been totally omitted - lame!  PC all the way for this game.  Be ready to put down the controller and whip out the keyboard.Swords, Mages, Dragons and everything else you'd expect.  Want a medieval fantasy RPG experience with a little thinking involved?

												Dragon Age: Origin [4/5]This game helped me discover my love for RPG. Steep learning-curve, but worth it.Story [4.5/ 5] Gameplay [3.5/5]Plot [4.5/5]Similar to Mass Effect 2 this game provide a wide range of interesting characters that you get to associate with, in this case, you will have to bring the fight to darkspawn, ending the Blight. All the characters have traits, skills and personality that you would eventually have to get use to and stick with, and maybe fall in love with in the later time. The more time invested in the game, the more you understand the strength and weakness of each characters. Character customization, this game allows you to choose your characters' race (human, elf, dwarf) and class(warrior, rogue, mage). All of those with different attributes and strength. Tinkering with the inventory is always fun. Deciding the types of weapons to equip depending on the class of the characters. Dialogues are cheesy, but still ok. The outcome and the consequences of the story depends on the decisions through all those cheesy dialogues that you make.The story might seem straight forward, ending the Blight, reclaiming peace for Ferelden. True, that is the ultimate goal. The essence of the game is when you explore Ferelden through various quests while  getting ready to face the Blight. Deep and in depth backstory of characters and the plot itself. The BGM was ok, but really gets you into the mood during combat.The gameplay is limited, but strangely satisfying. The Combat System was well developed allowing you to pause during a battle, enabling you to strategise your attack. Strategy may vary based on players choice of character and companions. The best part is that, no matter how high your characters' level is, one mistake would ♥♥♥♥-up the outcome of the game.			"

												I got this game on xBox 360 at release. The first time I played  I was hugely disapointed.  The trailers made it look brutal, visceral..  When I realized I would be activating power buttons for 80+ hours like a single player World of Warcraft, I immediately  sold my newly purchased copy on eBay,  HAPPILY LOSING $10 to get rid of the prospect .  Years later while perusing the steam vaults,  I noticed this game had a 96% favorability rating.  Scratiching my head, I started reading some of the reviews. More trying to prove to myself that steam reviews are made by niche nerds than actually interested.   I as shocked.  Sensible sounding people claiming this was the spiritual successor of the Baldur's Gate series or something.  I shrugged,  what the hell, I  bought it.  thinking , I'll just refund it once I confirm it still sucks.After installing,  i was reassured by the  fact  the PC version has no controller support.  HA! Even the developers  gave up on this garbage, I thought.  But then it happened..  I finally played Dragon Age. For the first time, as it was meant to be played..   With a mouse & keyboard.  Instead of feeling playing a boring 3rd person hot bar waste of time, I was the coordinating  a tactical fantasy shock squad..  Every moment counts,  pause , camera tilts, and tactical views become tools in you kick ♥♥♥ pallot.    Every battle ia fun.    hours in and I concure,   Dragon Age is not only the spiritual successor of baldurs gate but it may even be funner..  Also the writing and direction is award worthy..  This is the fiirst game I've ever said that about.			"

												Graphics: While a bit old now, they still hold up well when compared to more modern games. The game uses its design to project a cartoonish, yet dark, atmosphere. Plot: A decent story about a dark force threatening the land, with the main player as the one to stop it. As cliche as this may be, the game focuses moreso on the world that the player is living in. It follows you as you travel the world, with your companions reacting to the actions you do. It falls under the same feeling as Mass Effect, where talking to those that follow you gives you a great feeling of satisfaction as you learn about them and grow close. Gameplay: The game is real time, yet you can pause the game to issue precise orders to your allies while looking at the battle from above. As with most RPGs, you get stronger with better items and with leveling.Music: The sounds in this game add to the overall atmosphere without overtaking it.Overall, this game is one of my classics, and I find myself thinking about it even now.

												At first I owned a copy of Dragon Age for Xbox 360 and something didn't feel quite right. It had(and still do) many elements that felt half finished, so eventually i traded it in for something else. A while later I bought it on STEAM, after thinking that the experience might be different on the computer...and what a good decision that was! The character control feels so much better using the keyboard. This will be apparent when you find yourself in a tight spot during battle, which you will. It's somewhat unbalanced (caster > everything else) but the given the story driven nature of the game, i found myself quite okay with that aspect and totally in love with how the controls work on PC. The good voice acting, the visual scenery and the quality of the dialogues that shape your experience, are as usual from Bioware, top notch. I actually repeated this procedure with Mass Effect, going from console to PC(ME2) and again found myself appreciating the game much more on the computer, but that's a different story.			"

I have never been so captured by a story driven game like I have with BioWare and their plot decisions + how they effect your future.

												alright so first off when i bought this game like two months ago, i was pretty hyped, i had a few friends that already played the game and recommended it to me. so i go and buy a steam card for $20, go home, and buy the game. with one cent left on my account. so the next day the game goes on sale for like 40% off or something and i was kinda mad that i could've waited a little and bought the ultimate edition. im still mad about this.anyways, this game is sick. i like the diversity in character customization, though it could use some cooler, a bit more modern hairstyles, because most of them make my character look like a toolbag. it's got some weird default settings that you can change at some pointat first, the game is pretty straightforward. as you move on, you tend to unlock all of these side quests from talking to some of the npcs and in the process of performing the side quests you unlock more side quests, and while attempting to complete the side side quests, you unlock MORE, and it still bothers me how i cant finISH ALL THE SIDE QUESTS FOR ONCE, but i think that's an effective method to drag on (pun intended) the game.you can get a dog, which is pretty cool, if you complete the sidequest for it. it fights along your side in battle, though i'm not sure if it can die or not, but i think i named mine juan. ripit makes me a tiny bit angry that i can't be in a relationship with alistair, because WOW he's a cutie but thats beside the point.the storyline is well developed and exciting, it keeps you engaged. i offer no critique on it, as i think it's already a fitting plot for this type of game. some of the responses you can choose to reply with are outright ridiculous, but they keep a smile on my face and shows that this game isn't 110% serious all the time, and that contributed to its success.in my opinion, dragon age: origins is definitely 10/10, would recommend to anyone looking for a cool adventure/fighting type game. it's about time i go and buy the next one already.

												Jesus wept. Dragon Age is quite possibly, nay, without question, the greatest work of fiction ever produced in any medium. In all the 63 years I have played video games, I have never in my life encountered such a powerful, emotionally moving masterpiece. This game was so utterly amazing that I ""encouraged"" (read: forced) my 4 year old grandson to play so that he might better understand what a watershed work of art this is. Undoubtedly, it is the most important piece that will be produced in my lifetime, and I think I can safely assume his as well. He didn't understand it at first, but after a few rigorous beatings he finally came to grips with the profundity of what he was experiencing. He would later insist that he merely feigned interest in order to avoid further beatings, but I dismissed his crude humor with a hearty laugh and a swift kick to the groin. It was clear to both of us that we were a part of something bigger than ourselves. I award Dragon Age 11 points out of 10 without reservation. Please play this game. Please force your children to play this game. Please force your children's children to play this game by any means necessary. If anyone ever tries to convince you this game is so much as a hair width short of perfection, promptly beat them to death with the nearest blunt object.Enjoy.			"

												1. On normal difficulty, this game is hard af.2. There are stupid exploits, sorry, ""fighting techniques"", that are not fun at all, but are most reasonable if you want to win a hard fight. Some examples: (WARNING! Exploit ahead) For melee fighting bosses, you can run away with the one that is being chased by the boss and shoot the boss down with your other partymembers (END OF EXPLOIT). You will be constantly pausing the game and adjusting your party's actions, because they generally do stupid things or do nothing (if you have disabled their free choice, which I recommend >:D). You want more intelligent partymembers so that you don't have to pause all the time? Then just spend a huge number of points into their fighting intelligence, which can also be spent to make the character objectively stronger. If you would really do that, the game would get even harder. What a dilemma.3. This game is full of fights.Which means in conclusion: NO FUN (on normal difficulty).My Advice: Don't buy this game for it's combat, and if you play it, play it on easy difficulty.Everything other than combat is OK i guess...

												Hot lesbian dwarf on human romance, that's all you need to know.Ok fine! It's the last good traditional style RPG Bioware ever made even though it's made in their standard ""go to three or four big story related locations and do a bunch of unrelated side quests while you're at it"" format. The overall plotline is very solid, the voice acting is great, the romance is standard Bioware crud we've all come to expect and the gameplay encompasses that classic Baldur's Gate real time/pause strategy we know and love. Ruleset is heavily based on 3rd edition D&D which is to be expected and it works well, but the overall difficulty of the game is pathetically easy unless you ramp it up to maximum and throwable potions make it that much easier.Dragon Age is the suicide note of Bioware, after this it would never ever be the same again, so by all means enjoy the last CRPG made by a big publisher before the Kickstarters get their projects done.

												The story has some promise, and there seems to be good depth to the core game, but the camera controls are really awkward for mouse and keyboard and gameplay is a bit messy (it's an unhappy mix of MMORPG, classic top-down and action-RPG mechanics). These made the game unenjoyable for me on PC. The game also starts to show the bad writing and poor motion capture that plagued Bioware all throughout Mass Effect 3 and The Old Republic; the characters' origin stories are uninspired social justice rants railing against humans/normality and cutscenes convey little to no emotion or life, for example. Characters are also very stereotypical: Evil is evil because reasons (or because they are normal humans doing normal human things which are or inevitably lead to evil), Good can do no wrong (as long as you are not a normal human), and every 'deviant' is oppressed to the extreme yet glorified and noble.I really like stories (such as Neverwinter Nights from old Bioware), so I will probably finish this game someday, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. The later parts might be better, if you have to play this particular series.			"

This allows you the freedom to choose whatever class for your main and still have the benefits of other classes when dealing with enemies, which of course in a high fantasy setting is much more important than in a game like Mass Effect. You can tell how good a game this is because even though Dragon Age 2 was panned by a lot of people, there's a lot of excitement out there for Dragon Age Inquisition and it's all on the strength of this game.

												What kind of moron defends a castle by standing out on the field in front of it? Lots of really annoying quirks with gameplay, story, and characterization. Tank characters only seem to grab aggro effectively if I'm controlling them, making other classes get really underused. The mod to respec companions is a must or they are foolishly locked into whatever role the game has specced them for before they even join you. All that aside, the good outweighs the bad and it's a pretty meaty game. Good value and fun.			"

												I tried to give this game a chance but I couldn't find any motivation to keep playing it since the overwhelmingly generic setting+story just made everything bland. Some of the characters and dialogue are very good as is expected from Bioware at this point, but I found the setting to drag everything down to the point I had no interest in seeing anything else. There's a ton of lore to find and read and the game has a lot of content, but that's only if you can get past the fact that you've seen this setting and story a million times before.Combat is clunky at best and character customization pales in comparison to something like NWN2, but all that is secondary to the fact that I was falling asleep trying to get through the game.

												Excellent story-driven WRPG that gets bogged down by poor pacing. While the characters and storyline are generally very good, certain areas get tedious to slog through (especially Orzammar & The Deep Roads) and become a chore to finish. There are plenty of game-changing decisions to make, adding thorough replay value, but some seem like no brainers for me (who would ever side with the werewolves other than to be edgy?). There are the typical Bioware romance options and ""do a tutorial & intro then go to three areas and then fight the big bad boss"" gameplay structure but overall this is a lengthy, memorable campaign that RPG fans should invest their time in.

												The first game was good, but their addiction to nickel and dime everyone for DLC has ruined the game for me. For example, in between traveling to different locations, you go to a camp. Once there, an NPC will tell you an intriguing story about a castle and he wants to know if you can help. But then he asks you to buy the DLC so you can continue with the quest.  It breaks the fourth wall and left a sour taste in my mouth.			"

This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												Super addictive. Characters and dialogue are interesting and well-written. World is probably not the most original, but the in-game storyline is nicely done. Can replay multiple times to get different outcomes without it getting old. Have played 100+ hours and see myself playing 100+ more.Combat is OK, default tactics are kind of annoying. Set your own.There's at least one quest that is bugged and becomes undoable (yet stays in active quest list instead of moving to completed/failed) if you do certain things. Don't know what to say to that except save often if completing every side quest is important to you.For reasons others have stated, DO NOT buy the standard edition, just go for the ultimate.			"

												I love this game more than skyrim, the story is told more dramaticly and makes you feel more sorry for the character. This is like a real RPG, modern one in fact. Only thing I hate about this game, is that it has lots of tactics and strategy. If you love mount and blade, possibly skyrim (trying to be original here other than say it's like skyrim). Story starts you off pretty good..I can't get into this game, I would though. It requires tons of time, other than another RPG like path of exile, you can hop in at any time and start playing.			"

												Dragon Age: Origins is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare's Edmonton studio and published by Electronic Arts. It is the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 3, 2009, and for Mac OS X on December 21, 2009.Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. BioWare described the game as a spiritual successor to their previous Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. The game is played from a third-person perspective that can be shifted to top-down perspective. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and accompany the player throughout the game.BioWare described Dragon Age: Origins as a ""dark heroic fantasy"" set in a unique world. Its setting was inspired by The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice & Fire, and was described by BioWare as a mix between high fantasy and low fantasy. Development of the game began in 2002, and lasted over six years. BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired Inon Zur to compose the game's music.Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies, and 1 million pieces of downloadable content. Its multiple year-end accolades included Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released an expansion pack for the game titled Awakening in March 2010, and two sequels, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively.Dragon Age: Origins is an action role-playing game. The player is a Grey Warden, part of an order of elite fighters, whose task is to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from a disastrous event called the Blight. Players create their own Grey Warden character, customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class.The available classes are warriors, who perform strong physical attacks; rogues, who carry out stealth attacks and steal items from other characters; and mages, who cast spells on enemies, create combo spells, and support other party members. The three choices of race are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines which of six different origin stories the player experiences: Dalish Elf, City Elf, Dwarven Noble, Dwarven Commoner, Mage, or Human Noble.This affects the way other in-game characters perceive the player's character; for instance, a Dwarven Commoner would receive hatred and discrimination from other dwarves. However, all classes follow the same plot after the completion of the origin story.			"

												I really enjoyed this game a lot. Probably more than I should have, and I think at one point my wife was jealous of the attention I gave it.The graphics are kinda middling, which is kinda sad, considering how much prettier the Mass Effect series was. Also, though the game was marketed as a dark fantasy, the setting and story really doesn't seam to draw much from George R. R. Martin, but instead from another author with two Rs in the middle of his name. You lead a not-fellowship to wage a war against not-orcs, to finally defeat not-Smaug picking up multiple Nouns-Of-Gerund along the way.The combat, however, is both challenging and fun. It can be played from either a pause-and-play tactical isometric perspective, or a more visceral, action-oriented over-the-shoulder perspective. Things become particularly interesting when you add spellcasters to the mix. Many players of Dungeons and Dragons, will quickly recognize the simultaneous feeling of glee and dismay of accidentally incinerating your compatriots with an ill-targeted fireball with just a little too large a radius. Friendly fire can be turned off, though, for those so inclined.For me though, one of the real appeals was the apparent fluidity of the story and incorporation of choice as a central element. Gone are the melodramatic moral decisions of past Bioware games, where you are choosing between saving an orphanage or committing genocide. These are replaced by hard choices where both sides have merits and flaws. Also gone are the binary morality meters, and are now replaced by levels of loyalty/amicability between yourself and each of your companions. For every choice, it seems like it will be popular with some in your group, and unpopular with others, and it's not all based on some oversimplified alignment code, but more on each characters individual values and history, which you will have plenty of interaction and clues leading up to these choices, so you feel like you have some insight in the consequences. There may still be some surprises though. These choices will also extend to the beginning at character creation, and each character you create can have different origin stories which will have varying degrees of reference and relevence throughout the story all the way until the end.All these choices do have a limitation however, by the time you get to the end of the game, you may notice that for the most part, the consequences of your choices are mostly cosmetic. Whether you chose one side or another in a given conflict, really only determines the look of the disposable units you get in a final battle, and the grand story arch is fairly immutable. By the time you may realize this, though, it has been a fun ride, and it doesn't really diminish the grand feeling of shaping your story, and being torn on certain decisions along the way.Finally, if you opt to buy the dlc, I recommend avoiding the in-game downloader, it takes FAR too long and is very buggy. Instead visit the bioware social site, log in to your profile and download and install them from there. It's much faster and hassle free.			"

												Dragon Age is a fantastic RPG that lasted longer than I thought it would. I finished it in 40 hours, but it could easily take you 20 hours longer to complete everything.The characters have depth, the story is pretty good, the graphics also still look very good and the gameplay is tight for a 3D RPG. It can be a bit unbalanced at times though, so I had to change the difficulty from time to time in order to advance. It's disappointing but, it never really frustrates. The isometric view is actually very helpful and, in my opinion, works better than the default camera view. I do admit that the default view is the more cinematic one, but for the later battles isometric view is recommended, required even.Dragon Age is a title that I immensely enjoyed. It's one of the better RPGs of the last decade so if RPG is your thing you should definitely play this.(Play the second one as well. Despite the repetitiveness of the environments it's also well worth a playthrough and it's not as bad as people say it is).[Rating: 92/100]			"

												This is not Baldur's Gate. It's not Icewind Dale and it's not Neverwinter Nights 2...This is Dragon's Age and this is new.The game is great. Very different for most people who, like me, come from the old RPG school. I was a bit shocked when I first started playing it, but by the end I was pleased with the whole experience. It's got all the good elements from the oldies we all love, with a new approach to combat that might or might not be your thing.Overall, it's a new type of RPG. Definetely a must have for story-hungry players out there, just bare in mind that as the first of its kind, it's got some rough edges which might put you off at times, but nothing so bad to make your wholesome experience a bad thing.In regards to DLC... research before you buy! Truly! There's some good DLC here and there's some REALLY pointless overpriced DLC... Do your homework and make sure that you are spending your money well. "

Starting with 6 different Origin stories which change how multiple characters interact with the player, which offers great re-playability. Each companion in the game has intresting backrounds, along with many options on how you can interact with them. The plot for Dragon Age: Origins kept me intrested all the way through with the multiple paths you can choose that will effect others within the world.

												This is the best game, ever. Each race has three story lines, and although you still follow the same main storyline, the starting stories give each version a different feel. I have put DAYS, nay, WEEKS into this game. I'm still playing it now. I cannot recommend this more highly, if you like RPG type games. I can take or leave DA II, but have high hopes for the third one, when it comes out. Everyone should play DA:O. It should be made Law. You should not be able to have a Steam account unless you have played DA:O right to the end, on at least one race/class/background, whether through Steam or EA or just a boxed copy of the game, played without attachment to anything else (as I did, first time I played it). PLAY THIS GAME!!!On a side note, I see that it shows I've played an hour of this via Steam. I just installed it from the disc, on the first day it was out, and don't recall registering it with EA. I can say you get at least 50 hours of play each run through. There are 3 races to choose from, with 2 back stories, and 3 classes. I've played every version, background story, class, race - I estimate I have played a minimum of 450 hours - probably more, considering I have a few double played classes/races (one female, one male version) The rogue is the best class, if you like being able to open every chest in the game. Warrior is best if you just like to go in and beat everything to death, although one of the main sidekicks makes an awesome tank. The Mage is a fun class to play, if you like sparkles and fighting from a distance (or healing).			"

Main character very customizable, a variety of choices as to how to resolve the situation at hand, interesting companions: DA:O is one of these games where you will curse the unending caverns and zones you will have to explore but still do it because of the story.

												8 out of 10 Dragon Age Origins is adventure RPG.  It has the mechanics of a typical top down RPG except that you would mostly play zoomed in that makes it look like a 3rd person RPG.  It still plays like a top down even though it looks like 3rd person. The good: 1. Really interesting background setting.  Humans (tevinter mages) invaded heaven.  Heaven was corrupted gave birth to the dark spawn. 2. Interaction with your companions is good.  Each has an interesting personality and story. The bad: 3. It felt like it took forever to get anywhere.  The game feels too long. 4. Combat did not excite.  It did not work very well. The ugly: 5. About 70% into the game, it started to slow way down occasionally - like a low frame rate.  And it was not limited to action sequences.  No logical reason why it would do so.			"

												Definitely. A very addicting game, creating just one character or save file is not enough. Sometimes you want to create different characters with different characteristics. So far my most succesful and favourite character is a Dwarf Noble Warrior, but i still have a bunch of other characters waiting for me to play them. In my opinion, out of the all Dragon Age games, this one is the best. Maybe not graphics wise, but gameplay, story, characters, mechanics. Definitely worth it!Pros+ Awesome game, despite its age.+ Dialogue options are actually good, and not the crap you would see in Mass Effect or Dragon Age 2.+ Awesome Gameplay. A nice blend of RPG and Strategy.+ Great Voice acting and characters look and talk like they should. (Unlike Skyrim)+ Alternative Openings (Depending on character Race/Class) and Alternative Endings (Depending on choices you make), which makes for great replay value.+ Best story and characters out of the 3 games+ No Dwarf Scottish Stereotype, Dwarves are American apparently.Cons- Sometimes the choices you think matters most, matters least,  and Sometimes the choices you think matters least, matters most.- I'll be honest, some of the armors are horribly designed and lack variety aside from different colour schemes.10/10 Definitely Recommended			"

Starting with 6 different Origin stories which change how multiple characters interact with the player, which offers great re-playability. Each companion in the game has intresting backrounds, along with many options on how you can interact with them. The plot for Dragon Age: Origins kept me intrested all the way through with the multiple paths you can choose that will effect others within the world.

												Dragon Age is easily one of the BEST rpgs to ever be made to this point. It features a wonderful world with tons of lore and things to explore and a story that truely sucks you in and makes you want to play the game over and over again just to see how things turn out differently. Pick this one up for sure.			"

												Great game, I personally preferred Mass Effect series relative to this, however the events in this story are no less memorable, and the story is relatively good. As with all Bioware games, there are some laughable design flaws and inconsistencies, but this game is a definite buy for anyone who loves immersion, good/variable story and  fantasy. Gameplay is hero/MMORPG style orientated and actully plays quite well although the combat itself gets repetitive in some areas. My only major complaint with this game is the somewhat long quests which force you to fight excessive numbers of enemies often for no reason. Additionally the difficulty of this game is definitely not for novices, and although not hard by any means is more difficult than your standard RPGs now. The cinematics and characters are well done for the game's age, and have aged very well (and I'm sure they will remain that way for years to come). In short, the game is a long and very worthwhile adventure, full recommendation.			"

												This is a good game if you like dragons and maybe even if you don't like dragons, because you get to kill dragons in the game. The game is not really about dragons so much, so I don't know why they called it that. That is part of the mystery of the DRAGON AGE!			"

												One of the Best RPGs on Steam, even if it showing it's age now. There is lots to do, the characters are compelling, and the battle system is better than any of the other games in the series. There is strength in preparing proper strategies, developing your characters and discovering every recess and side mission to get the best gear for your characters. They will need them.With plenty of locations to explore, a well grounded and motivated cast, this is one game on Steam I hope to replay soon. Only downside is that sequels are exclusive to Origin.

												Dragon Age: Origins is the most generic Triple-A game I've ever played. It, is, in fact, Bioware's first entry into generic fantasy.You start out making your character: do you want to be male or female? okay, do you want to be a dwarf, elf, or human? What.. Is this a Korean MMO? Bare in mind that this game opens a whole new universe of lore for a new franchise, so of course they're going to front their most creative minds when it comes to character design for this brand new lore.Well, now you get to select classes: Warrior, mage or rogue. Maplestory has more classes. Bioware's other games have more classes, and one of them is a third person shooter. This is a long-run RPG that boasts over a hundred hours of content. Granted, there are 4 subclasses, to be unlocked at some undisclosed point. Still, nothing interesting therein as far as I can tell. Subclasses get an extra dash of five talents when they're unlocked. I can't speak for deep later in the game, but that's what I've been shown.Each race has two starting stories, three if you're a mage. This is a great innovation, and the starting story is reasonably engaging. However, even this achievement only shows to shine light on the game's failings in presentation. The stories to start are engaging, expose a world ripe for character developement. However, within the first hour characters are yanked out of their own story where the producer says ""wasn't that nice? forget that, here's a new story"".Converse to every other BioWare game, the introduction has more replay value and than the rest of the game seems to. In fact, as soon as you've gotten to the 'real game' on more than one character, the story seems to saterize itself. It doesn't matter if you're a 6'0 elf male or a 4'3 dwarf female (let's not talk about skin color, nobody in the game does; I'm black with a white family of course), that only changes a few responses and interactions with certain characters. It doesn't change who you feel you are or who the story thinks you are. Its a little funny to see, having been an elf, that the king who welcome you to this ""real story"" looks you in exactly the same spot when you're a dwarf. ""Oh, and who might you be? *looks 4 feet over your head*"" The stories all lead to the same place, directed by the same people, with little implication to your choices at this point.The main characters are generic caricatures, and anyone of interest is killed off immediately. You're led about by Kyle Katarn, principly, who is so ""honor driven"" he kills innocent people right infront of you with no moral implication given by the story. The king character is constantly talking about how much he wants to be the subject of legends and to win glory, and all anyone says about him is 'this guy only wants to have songs written about him and to get all the glory'. I really like the side characters, like your dwarven friend, your elfen cousin, or your big dumb soldier friend. But, of course ""they can't possibly come with us"", etc, etc.When I was a kid, you had Final Fantasy 7, where you started in an endless metropolis, ran across a swamp being chased by a giant snake, wound up in shimmering emerald mountain caves, and came out at a military base town with a giant awesome gun mounted to it. In Dragon Age: Origins you start in a town, then you go to the woods and fight orcs, then you go to an outpost.. and fight orcs. There's no variety or anything pulling me in here. There's nothing monumental to introduce me to this new universe, no stimulation besides a story that's immediately killed and replaced.What reinforces this is the 'you don't feel like a hero' aspect. You're the up and coming champion of the Grey Wardens, you're an excellent fighter, besting seasoned veterans, guards, nobility. How does the combat in the game work in the first few hours? You see an enemy, then you right-click it, then you watch your health bar to see if you need a potion. Its basically World of Warcraft lite. Why would I want to see what's more to be offered by this title when they've seemingly put no effort into making it presentable? It doesn't give me the impression that there's much progression, even, because I'm just seeing very linear talent trees (5 talents to about 6 weapon specific trees, and a few for class and crafting).The game plays like a party-based diablo-esque, but your party is killed off every 5 minutes and reintroduced again, leaving one to care very little about what the other characters in your squad are doing. This is how you introduce people to a modern MMO, not a long-run RPG.This is just a first impression, and I might play it more, but this is probably the worst first impression I've gotten from a game. It just seems to have little to offer beyond 'BioWare made it'. Maybe if Obsidian had made this game it would have made more sense.			"

												Since this was released I've bought it 2-3 times, on the promise of one of the few CRPGs which even came out in a decade. And every couple years I pick this game up again, thinking I might have missed something. But I didn't miss anything. Yes, there's a lot of content and it takes a lot of time to grind through. It's just kind of tedious and wooden and unsatisfying to me.			"

												I finished the game simply because I bought it. I bought it because of the overwhelming hype claiming that this is one of the best RPG's ever made. Sadly, what I found was pretty much a hack and slash action RPG with, sure, lots of in game stuff you can read about the world, but the actual gameplay involves very little that isn't simply bashing through armies of enemies Diablo style. This is an okay game, if I could give it a neutral instead of yes or no I'd give it that instead. It's glitchy and on my i7 Windows 10 machine with 16GB RAM crashed several times even with affinity set to 1. Several of the quests bugged out and at times textures disappeared too. A lot of the battle sequences are overly long, yet not all that challenging, patricularly the final battle and the Fade part of the game. I had to force myself to continue several times because I simply got bored with clicking enemies to death and pausing the game a million times to micro manage each character. Sometimes the characters just stand there and get bashed in the head even though you give them orders. There is nothing original or interesting about the plot or game mechanics, it's essentially Baldur's Gate 2 with more fighting and bugs. I honestly don't know what the fuss is about, and in my books this game falls far short from something like Ultima 7 (which I still consider the king of RPG's) or even Skyrim. 5 / 10.			"

												Since I didn't have many other PC games at the time, this was the one I played the most. Bear that in mind when you see my 75 hours playtime. I bought this since I'd played Neverwinter Nights by BioWare and enjoyed it greatly, liked Knights of the Old Republic well enough despite its shallow and predictable story with flat characters, but was disappointed with Jade Empire -- it seemed rushed and incomplete.For the longest time, playing this gave me vague hints of deja vu. I knew that the interface and gameplay reminded me an awful lot of World of Warcraft, so that wasn't the source of my unease. After 75 hours of suffering my irritating emo companions and doing fetch and deliver quests typical of MMOs, I finally realized: it was the same plot setting as Jade Empire, and to a lesser extent, KotOR. ""You are the last jedi/martial artist/gray warden of the council/dojo/demon-blood-drinking-cult, and it falls upon you to save the galaxy/empire/world!""Okay, so it's not an uncommon setting, but BioWare just does such an astounding, jaw-dropping job of rehashing stereotypes and making them even more bland and hackneyed than previously believed to be scientifically possible. In a sense, it's an amazing achievement, but I can hold more appreciation for ""World's Largest Ball of Dryer Lint.""			"

												Beware! This game is not similar to Dark Souls or Lords of Fallen. This is a dialog-focused, RPG-tactical-combat game with multiple combat rounds. OVERALL - Despite of the CONS, it is extremelly RECOMMENDED. Note: You do not need to play DA:O in order to play Dragon Age 2. Hence, you can start a new character with a ""default background story"", using canon ending decisions for the first installment.PROSSTORY - 10 out 10. 'Origins' stand for 6 different character origin stories depending on your main character customization. You can customize genre, race (Human, Dwarf and Elf) and trainning classes (mage, rogue/archer, warrior). If you choose starting with a Human Mage character, you will see different cutscenes, NPCs, locations, maps, dialogs and even initial quests prior to the starting of the main campaign. Then, there are 6 origins stories in the game (Human Noble, Human Rogue, Human Mage, City Elves, Noble dwarf, etc). It is a unique feature in this game, which delivers a deep and interesting initial story with great quests, side missions and secondary quests spreaded throughout the world map. The focus here is to learn about the story by talking to NPCs and reading in-game books excerpts and the in-game codex. This game offers a good quest management screen that separates active quests from completed ones. Also, there is a 'plot inventory' comprising items you may find that must be delivered to certain characters in certain quests. There are romance options that will be unlocked depending on your approval score for each potential romance option. Based on your decisions, some characters will like you and some will dislike your actions and reputation. For the sake of the chronological timeline, I advice you to play the main campaign and its DLCs in the following order: 1. Leliana's Song: Accessible from the ""Other Campaigns"" menu only for the Ultimate Edition, and it is a very short origin story of one of your main party members: it is less than 2 hours lenght, however it serves as a game tutorial for collectables items and character leveling up. You can test different abilities, atributes, skills and talents to see how they actually affect gameplay combat, character experience and plot development.2. DA:O main campaing: 60+ hours lenght gameplay, depending how deep you invest your time in reading the codex and the massive in-game information. The amount of inventory items, powers, craft items, weapons, armors, gadgets, talents and side quests are overhelming at a first look. This game delivers a huge content of dialogs, characters, locations, items, and plot-linked decisions. I beat the game in 65 hours at level 22 out of 25. See http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Experience for further reference about character experience levels.3. The Awakening: It is the main DLC of DA:O with impact on Dragon Age 2. It is a 20-30+ hours length and it delivers new companions, talents, locations, quests and serves as a sequel to DA:O main campaign. It is extremelly valuable in terms of quality and story content. 4. The Golems of Amarak. 2 hours.5. Witch Hunt. I have not played yet. You must search for a former companion that has chosen to run away. 2 hours.6. Darkspawn chronicles. An alternative universe, you play as the bad guys. Similar approach as the game's DLC Half-life: The Opposing Force. 2 hours.Every DLC delivers new characters, party members, itens, skills, and locations. They are extremely valuable.It is also noteworthy the massive game lore and complex story and timeline covering all official published items from Dragon Age: Origins to Dragon Age 3. There are multiple midias such as games, novels, Game's DLCs, comics, cartoons and animated series. The total amount of midia sums up to 40+ items. For further details, visit https://forum.bioware.com/topic/511645-dragon-age-media-timeline/FINAL MISSION - 10 OUT 10 - IMHO, Dragon Age: Origins delivers the second best final mission I have ever played. The best for me is the Mass Effect 2's suicidal mission. Awesome.GRAPHICS - 7 OUT 10 - Overall is good, but some graphics seem dated, unpolished and rough for a 2009 title. They could be much better. It is looks like the same game engine of KOTOR, from Bioware, with some improvements.LEVEL DESIGN - 10 OUT 10 - Maps are interesting, different and compelling. And they are not linear. Get ready to go back and forth and to visit finished locations multiple times using the fast travel feature. You will want to finish all game quests.UPGRADES / LEVEL UP - 10 OUT 10 - skills and talents are unlockable by earning XP for each kill, loot or plot decision. Here, your squad levels up independently from you. The progress of character upgrades is remarkable good. The effect in combat improvement is awesome.TRADE STORES / INVENTORY - 10 OUT 10 -  You can buy and sell items from your inventory. And all your characters share your items. You can find many stores throughout the world locations and sometimes there are merchants on the road.DLC / Extras - 10 out 10 - Buy the Ultimate Edition. Game content is huge with 3 DLC added to the main campaign and 5 bonus missions lauched from the 'Others campaigns' menu independently one to another. CONSCOMBAT - 5 out 10. The weakiest element of the game. Camera position ranges from traditional 3rd person (over the shoulder behind the main character) to an aerial view similar to the Baldur's gate view. You need to point & click with your mouse to define a new target. The best part is that you can swap beteween controllable characters. For instance, regardless your main character is an Human Rogue, you can play in combat with your Mage squadmate (also reffered as your 'party member' in the game).  Actually, you can play with all your party members in combat or during map explorations. The shame is that during a combat, some NPC will attemp to strike you or another character and will hit nothing but the air. AI seems dumb and poorly scripted and affects all controllable characters and NPCs. Most of the enemies will rally into you and your team faster and furiously than you actually can move. That is why you need to pause the combat and prepare yourselves for the battle. Automatic combat strikes can be easily set up by using the ""combat tactics' menu for each controllable character. For instance, IF the CLOSEST ENEMY is attacking MAIN CHARACTER using MELEE weapons, THEN use the ability SHIELD BLAST. In this game, you can pause the combat, rotate the camera, change the camera angle, change the controllable character, choose the power, strike, weapon etc and resume the combat. However, due to poor AI programming, this feature does not work 100% well. I would prefer real time combat like gears of wars, mass effect, etc. However, the character upgrade based on Experience points has a strong impact in gameplay combat.- NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT. Play it with keyboard /mouse or try to find a game mod on the net. That is why I did not played KOTOR.- LIMITED INTERACTABILITY - PC version has no 'interact buttom' message as you gets closer to a door or a chest. You have to use a mouse to point at it and click all the time. Really anoying.- REPLAYABILITY - Due to the combat mode, I prefer not playing it again.- MUTE MAIN CHARACTER - no comments.- GAME CRASHES - PC version crashes a lot- LOW LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIVITY. Interactivity is limited to the looting system (crates, chests, doors, corpses, etc) and some levers to open gates and doors. YOU CAN ONLY DISARM TRAPS AND DESTROY SOME BARRICADES if you or your squad have certain skills. - No horses to travel with neither you cannot walk from one location to another. Fast travel only.- TOO MANY LOADING SCREENS - In a city, there are multiples buildings and houses. If you enter a house, you get a loading screen. If you decide to exit it...oops, another loading screen. Very anoying.			"

												First off Dragon Age: Origins is a good game but this review is more about ""this version"" of the game as it is right now. You see as of this time Dragon Age: Origins does not have all the dlc available for purchase except in the Ultimate version and that is a different story. If you get this version you can also get Awakening but Awakening does not have all dlc, and there is no option to upgrade from either Origins or Awakening to the Full version. If you want Dragon Age with all the dlc save some money and confusion and get the Ultimate edition. I suggest you wait for a sale or whatever and get the Ultimate edition seeing as the Ultimate edition has Origins, Awakenings, and is the only way to get all dlc aside from paying roughly $30 in Bioware points using the weird online store they set up to take more money from you.That being said Dragon Age is a good game with plenty of atmosphere and story. I originally played on the PS3 and wish the Steam version had controller support but it is nonetheless a good game, the graphics still hold up well and the playtime is extensive, sadly I got wrapped up in work and have been unable to finish the game but will start over and play again. Luckily I got the Origins base version in a bundle so it cost me little to get this version for rating purpose, I had to play some in order to leave a review so the listed playtime is inaccurate and I will now play from the Ultimate edition.

												Too bad there is no ""may be"" recommendation.I can recommend to get this only with big discount of 75-80% for reasons I'll try to cover below:Story:This is a story like you've never heard before. A horde of orcs Darkspawn is ravaging lands once in a few centuries. Why? Because they are evil.There is a bunch of gifted people called Witchers Grey Warden who can sense Darkspawn and fight them effectively but at high price.Some jerk decides to overtake the throne in a middle of yet another Horde invasion Blight leaving his king in a middle of a battle.Now you must visit Dantooine, Manaan and Korriban several locations to get help.Here is your story, take it and feel the epicness!Gameplay: Hey guys, we need to get it to 80 hours mark! No problem, let's make it a grind through series of battles every 20 meters from each other. Exploration and vistas? Pfff, who need that.Oh, and we should make almost every fight a micromanagement hell because ""hardcore"".Bloody brilliant idea! Hey, about bloody... We are making dark tone fantasy here so there will be BLOOD, BLOOD EVERYWHERE. See those rats? Decaliter of blood under high pressure in every one of them. Splat!Here is your gameplay, better check your Spacebar key, son, you gonna need it.Presentation:Everyone love MMOs.Ability bars. Big exlamation marks above quest givers. DPS. Rudimenary inventory screen with little icons. Marvelous!And as I said, we are making dark tone fantasy here so everyting going to be 50 shades of brown.Here is your singleplayer MMO, now go grind some more to get 5 minutes of dialogues. Don't be afraid, we'll make a big marker above person who can provide you those 5 minutes.TL;DR - as bland, generic and tedious as possible.			"

												I know it says I spent 317 hours playing this, but I really just left the game running a lot because it's really boring so I'd have to take breaks and it loaded up slowly on my old machine so I just left it on. This game is alright, I suppose. Nothing groundbreaking, some parts of it feel exceptionally generic, other parts are more interesting. Some of the party members stand out, particularly Morrigan, Sten, and Oghren. There's some royal skullduggery that you can take direct part in, but it happens only after a lot of rather tedious questing. I think a big problem with Bioware rpgs these days is that they set you up for big decisions that don't really have that much of an effect, you can *kinda* decide what side you're on, but the end game isn't going to change. It's not as bad as Fallout 3 in that regard, but it's not great. I believe your time is better spent with other CRPGs. This game doesn't do anything those don't do better. Consider some infinity engine games, I personally enjoy those a lot more.  I will concede, however, that the Dragon Age Awakening expansion is fantastic. It's the best Dragon Age experience I've had (and I did play DA:II all the way through.) If awakening was standalone I would recommend that, as it doesn't try to shoehorn you into a ham-fisted 'epic plot' and instead just does strange things. If Bioware was ever listening to me, I'd tell them to dump their 'main' plot and focus on the Darkspawn-Archdemon-Fade-Dwarf lore exclusively. Origin's story is hella predictable. It's only specific quests that showcase some nuanced writing, particularly the stuff involving the dwarvers and the mages. Meh all around, in my opinion. I remember that this won RPG of the year over Demon's Souls in 2009 and that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off at the time. I'm not so salty any more, but I'm still not sure this is worth your time. There is much better out there.			"

												Ive heard alot of praise for this game and DA series in total so i got my hands on it just to see for myself.Dont get the wrong idea that i dont recommend this game while only played 2 hours of it. This is my first impresion of the game so my overall opinion might change after more gameplay.Personally im the type of guy who prefers butchering everything in complete first or third person camera with stealthy or tanky character not to mention i mostly hate companions because they mostly are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and only good as extra inventory space.. Yea i know this game has 3rd person  too, yes i know that you can control your followers directly by yourself if needed but for the love of god you know 3rd person camera is ♥♥♥♥ when you cant even aim your shots with bow by yourself as its completely click and wait him to die and follower just faps while getting shot in hes ♥♥♥ if you dont hassle with taking controll over him just to attack that sniping lil bugger.Large portion of you game youre going to spend watch them talking (if you dont skip it) and sometimes you will need to put your own replies ( i was being a total prick and there were no penalties ) tho i admit they put a lost of effort in character detail while they chat.Another thing i didnt liked was turn based combat... I can deal with classic turn based combat games like Pokemon series, Aveyond Series (loved the first and 4th games), lets nor forget Final Fantasy i could list em quite a while, so for a 2009 game they just could done way better as they asleary using 3d enviroment. Yes ik its faster paced but still its meh.Last problem is that i can tell that game didnt got finished and released as i easily can manage to get under the map and ect. i mean cmon if you dont want player to noclip all over the place or take amazing adventure outside the area put god damn invisible walls. Jeez even Gothic 3 has invisible walls where you shouldnt go (there are some holes in them but takes forever to find them without video or somthing like that and get under the map)To put it shortly:Pros: + Decent graphics + You can be a total prick in conversations + Fancy Graphics + Quite good story + Has Mods + You can have a dog follower which you can even name by yourself + Can take control over dumb follower and make him somewhat usefullCons: - You can glitch out of the maps (in most of the areas) - There is no big world to explore ( unlike in games as Gothic 3, Oblivion and ect.) - Follower AI quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (getting attacked by archer and doesnt retaliate even while set to aggresive mode) - Camera is one of those ""very hard to get used to"" - Pause in the middle of fight just to give stupid AI follower some directions - Turn based combat (especially skills which remind me WoW with the casting mechanics) - Without follower youre kinda good as dead - Start of the game can make you bored - Class lockedI will give this a try somewhat later and ofc update review if something changes.ALSO KEEP IN MIND SO THAT IS MY OPINION. IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION WHICH IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS GAME GO ON AND WRITE REVIEW LIKE I DID IT WONT KILL ANYONE			"

												There are RPGs that draw you inside their own unique world, there are RPGs that feel boring and colourless... and there are RPGs that could almost provide the perfect roleplaying experience, if only their gameplay wasn't that dreadful.Dragon Age: Origins belongs into the latter category. Indeed the storyline is far from new and largely inspired by the classic ""Humans, Dwarfs-living-in caves, elves-living-in-forests"" scenario. The idea of a dark threat lingering in the depths, waiting to eradicate the known world is also nothing new in the RPG world.Dragon Age: Origins however manages to put a decent emphasis on the roleplay part. The fact that your possible dialogue options merely consist of the standard 3 ones (polite, not interested and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) does come as a little off, though.Yet, I do not recommend this game and that is because of the gameplay.Unfortunately, DA:Os story just isn't good enough to turn it into an ""interactive-movie"" kind of game. Therefore, the game has to rely on decent gameplay features such as world connection, quality of travel and most importantly battle mechanics. It is these features that take away the fun, in my opinion. The world is not open, but divided into towns and outposts with ""level-like"" areas connected to them. The battle mechanics rely on you pausing the game and giving 10 different orders before you start the fight and probably fail due to someone not being healed quickly enough.Even repeatedly pushing an attack button is more fun than this approach Bioware has taken to the game.

												Boring. The main quest is just boring. It also gives you some illusion your choices might matter, but they don't. For instance no matter what you say as a mage you have to betray and collect your friend's blood phial. Everyone talks about duty this and duty that. And disagreeing = death. I know I've only played 4 hours but the story is so boring and levels are really slow. I just want to explore by myself and have fun. But everything is just so slow.There are bugs too. At one point I was trapped and couldn't get out of a spot until I switched to a party member in another part of the room. At another point I walked right out of camp and floated above the ground you aren't suppose to see up close.I also don't really feel in any danger bcause if anyone dies they just auto-revive. If I get hurt, auto heal after the fight fixes everything.			"

												I've tried to like this game, but it's just not for me.Characters are good, story seems interesting. However, controls are K+M are really weird, especially when you go in the tactical view, camera does move in a fixed pattern like on rails, so that you might have hard times finding a proper position.The tactical combat system forces you to learn each skill from any class, since you'll need to control each member of your party regardless of the class you picked for your main character. Say you choose a rogue, you'll still need to learn warrior, paladin, mage, etc. skills in order to give party members your commands.The strategy screen is a mess with godzillions options - tried a couple combo and my party stopped attacking.In concusion, you will need to like this game A LOT in order to face the hard learning curve of it.

												This game felt like I was playing a shallow MMO story. Dragon age had pretty good game play...at first. I enjoyed it a lot...at first. but it got boring really fast as the gameplay and plot became very repetative. The plot was pretty boring, and repetative, and the diferent segments of the game did not feel connected. Go there do this, so somewhere else do something completely different. And the gray wardens were...lets say dull. Then there's relationships with the characters in your party. If you listen to what the game says, it's really deep and your decisions effect different characters in different ways. Which is great and all, and they DO do that, it's just....if you buy them random gifts they like you so much that it doesn't matter. (not to mention none of the characters is really very interesting.)Overall, the game got boring for me real quick. The only reason I ever beat it was because I kept thinking I was SO CLOSE, so I might as well finish it off...but if I had just known from the beginning how long this game would drag on, I would have dropped it then and there.

												Lore. If you like cool lore, you will probably dig this game. The world is your standard Tolkien LotR kinda place. There are plenty of strong differences that make this game's setting its own, such as a religious order with knights who imprison all mages in a tower or kill them, demons threatening to possess said mages in their sleep, orc-like fiends in dwarven roads deep underground, few but powerful dragons, and much more. You'll find scrolls and books with lots of info on these things, and it's usually pretty interesting stuff, unlike most games where I roll my eyes and skip reading the extra stuff.The game plays sort of like a Knights of the Old Republic game, though the graphics are much crisper, there is no d20 system (they've made their own system), and obviously it's medieval fantasy rather than sci-fi. You can pause in combat to give your party orders, and your party consists of (mostly) interesting characters you meet along your journey. Of course, romances are available like in the Mass Effect series. The difficulty can be a bit tough at times if you don't look up a guide for building the kind of character you want to play when you start, but otherwise, it's a fun game. I'd definitely recommend it.			"

												Do not buy this, This version of the game is broken and will not run on most PCs. Please find this game somewhere else as EA refuses to support it on steam.			"

												I can't say what exactly I dislike about this game. Graphics is cool, story is ok, well, characters are fair. But somehow I abandoned the game for three (!) times starting over, so probably it's just too boring for me.			"

												Incredibly well written story, the way characters are built, how dialogues make you feel actually important, like your choices really matter. It's absolutely brilliant and I can't recall any other RPG that managed to do that so wonderfully. Too bad I would not be able to see how that story ends. Combat is awful, tactics are totally counter intuitive, dungeons are sometimes too long and dull. Difficulty settings are totally unbalanced. I played it on normal and it was good for first 10 hours maybe. Then every battle got awfuly long and boring. After switching to easy game was... easy. No challenge at all.Maybe it's just not game for me but after promising beginning, it came out different than expected. I feel disappointed.PS. Also stepping on these ""BUY DLC TO PLAY THAT QUEST"" is so annoying.			"

												Probably one of the best non-DnD fantasy rpgs you will every play. Immersive, deeply satisfying and thrilling, even the most jaded, cynical rpg fan (like myself) will enjoy it.			"

												Do not buy Dragon Age Inquisition. Under no circumstances. It will ruin the franchise and this masterpiece of gaming. Oirgins is one of the best games I've ever played. Dragon Age 2 is acceptable, but a mere shadow of Origins. Inquisition is cancer. Don't buy Inquisition even for 5 dollars.			"

												一部可以游戏上百小时的好游戏，每句对话都会影响剧情的发展，每次带的队友都会影响对话甚至小任务的触发。三大职业，每个细分4个小职业，还有3个种族多种出身，每个不同都在对话或剧情中体现不同。队友都有自己的性格，对话中说错话都会影响关系，很赞的rpg游戏，细节给满分。			"

												Unlike the MASS EFFECT series from the usually very brilliant BIOWARE guys, this one does not work out for me. I do not know if it's the gameplay, the plot, the characters. It just is not worth a recommendation from my point of view.			"
