												I first played the original PC version of FF7, and then later the PlayStation version.After purchasing and replaying the Steam version, I can wholly recommend it as the definitive version of Final Fantasy VII to play. I'll start off with some quick points about this version in comparison to previous versions. The actual game will be discussed in more detail below.Vs Playstation:+Smoother look on the characters+No disc swapping+English translation has been tidied up and the plot is more coherent (No one seems to talk about this, but it's major in my eyes)-Swearwords have been replaced with !@#$ style characters.Vs original PC release:+Hassle-free, in my experience (40+ hours) <-- This is the key thing for me.+PSX music added, as opposed to the awful original PC music. Huge plus! The song ""One Winged Angel"" now has vocals like it should do :)+Rendered characters are now synced perfectly when walking over a pre-rendered video.+Videos look smoother and match the PSX version, which is very nice in comparison to original release.-Default keyboard controls need two hands. Original PC release had default keys all on the Numpad. Meaning you can scratch your chin or drink coffee while playing. Easily resolved anyway :)-Yet another thing you have to create an account for. This time for Square Enix. Once you've done so, you can pretty much forget about it.I have an Xbox controller, but never tried it admittedly, so can't comment on that! I found the game plays perfectly with keyboard.It's surprising how well Final Fantasy VII has aged. I hadn't played the game for nearly 7 years now, and was expecting it to be incredibly ugly. Don't get me wrong, it IS incredibly ugly, albeit in a charming way now. Rather than a good looking game being badly ported, this is a bad looking game that's been ported just right. You can't change your resolution (to my knowledge), but there's absolutely no need to. The game makes use of pre-rendered backgrounds and the resolution they chose for the 3D characters was a good compromise between smoothness and not sticking out too much from the backgrounds. It does look much better than the PSX version, and a bit better than the original PC release.I am also happy that they stuck with the original PC version's English translation. If you've only ever played FF7 on one platform before, you may not know that the PC version had a much neater, tidier translation. I'm not talking about a complete overhaul like some of the other Final Fantasy remakes. This is still the original story told in what the original PSX translation was trying to do. Any line that was fine before, is unchanged. They simply removed some (admittedly funny) spelling mistakes, and only changed lines that really did not make any sense at all. It makes the game feel more natural and therefore I highly recommend a replay if you've only played on the PSX before. The one noticeable, and unfortunate, change is that the swearing has been replaced with !@#£ style symbols. You can still tell they're swearing and what word they were going to say, but this unnecessary censorship felt a bit out of place. Still, it doesn't make or break the game. And just to be clear, this isn't new to the Steam version as it was present on the original PC release.Also, as I might as well say it now: The story IS really good. As FF7 is one of the most popular entries in the franchise, it sometimes gets a lot of flak from people who seem to only want to dislike popular things. These are personal games, which you should play for yourself, and FF7 offers a deceptively complex story, with a fantastic combination of twists. 'Twist' is a harsh word, because it implies a sudden and unexpected change in the story's direction. This is not the case. The 'twists' are completely natural and only serve to make everything before fit into place better. The combination I mentioned earlier is in reference to twists which you will definitely understand on your first time through, and some which may only make sense with a bit of thinking or a replay. The latter are not essential to understand, but you'll feel a satisfying sense of revelation if you do. All in all, this is a well-thought out constructed tale. It may not be as fast-paced as you'd like, but the end result is very satisfactory.The gameplay itself is surprisingly fast for a 90s JRPG. You can get through battles pretty quickly, and most of the attack animations are short enough to not be too annoying. With the exception of summons; huge magical attacks shown in a lengthy animation of a monster being summoned and inflicting damage on your enemies.The Materia system is still great and offers lots of customisation for your characters, although it's not as complex nowadays as it used to be. To be clear, Materia are 'gems' which you attach to characters to give them extra abilities or magic. As a Materia is used, it gains its own experience and gets progressively more powerful. The only complexity comes from managing who has what materia, and this is the one area of the game where the age really shows. You can only quick swap between character's Materia screens for the three characters in your party, rather than every available character. Therefore you are forced to constantly swap characters in and out to get the best setup. [EDIT: A number of comments have corrected me and pointed me to the Exchange option, which negates this complaint of mine!]Is it worth £10? Admittedly, this port probably generated no where near the amount of work needed to justify the price, but the quality of the game does. Therefore it's a tough question to answer. I suppose if you look at what you're getting, then yes, it is worth the price. Your first time through the game can literally take 60-70 hours. My replay was 40 hours long, and I know the game extremely well.This is now my favorite way to play Final Fantasy VII. And that is probably the one thing you needed to know.EDIT: Voted this game for ""Villain most in need of a hug"" award ;)			"

												Final Fantasy VII is a classic, there's no debating that. With it's first release on the Playstation back in 1997, this release is a repackaged version of the PC port released in 1998.  With cloud saves and achievements, it doesn't really stand out to people who may have already bought the game or have it elsewhere.Final Fantasy VII uses almost all the assets from the original PC version of the game. Music was re-encoded to OGG Vorbis, but was still based off of fairly ugly MIDI tracks that the PC used. Thankfully they are easy to replace as some poeple have even decided to use remixes of said tracks instead.Visually the game is very dated. 2D backgrounds, 3D sprites from that era with resolution stretching 2D elements while providing a modicum amount of improvement to the 3D models. While in the field, higher resolutions don't really help, but in battle scenes and in full 3D environments (Chocobo Racing, Submarine Minigame), there is a noticeable improvement.Controls are a bit awkward as for a 360 controller, the triggers, d-pad, and right stick aren't usable. However, you can get around that either by binding everything to usable controls or using a utility like JoytoKey.This is a bare-bones re-release, with the hard work for making it work with a modern OS stripped away for most people.Update: SquareEnix has managed to replace the MIDI quality music with PSX quality tracks. This means the game's music sounds extremely detailed compared to the original PC release.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Final Fantasy 7 Original Release: 1998 (2013 Steam Version) Genre Tags: JRPG; Turn-Based RPG; Action; Classic; Industry Jewel My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 20-65 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Fans of the intellectual property; Nostalgia chasers; Strong narrative advocates; Gaming industry aficionado REVIEWIf you scroll down the (serious) positive reviews for this game, you no doubt see many people expressing their nostalgic love for this legendary piece of their childhood. I stand among these people. For many of us who were kids in the 90s, Final Fantasy 7 was and always will be the first truly epic game we ever played. So I’ll admit that I am definitely biased to love it, as it was my personal favorite game during a number of years of my childhood. But that isn’t why I’m going to recommend that you consider trying it. You should consider it because Final Fantasy 7 is a classic piece of video-game history that revolutionized the genre and because it’s a kickass game. At the time it first released, there were a handful of other large RPGs with huge worlds and a lot of gameplay (relative to the era), but they were uncommon and unpopular in the Western world. Final Fantasy 7 reached a pinnacle of awesomeness for RPGs that was unprecedented and subsequently elevated the genre into the mainstream gaming market outside of Japan. Not only did it have sound RPG fundamentals, but the sheer amount of variety of gameplay it offered was quite revolutionary for the genre. Chocobo racing and breeding, the motorbike scene, the snowboard scene, the Golden Saucer, the Don Corneo segment, and more all contributed to shattering the status quo for the genre. A lot of young gamers went from not knowing about RPGs to one of them being their favorite game ever. Not only that, but it became one of the cornerstones which provided a foundation for the genre to grow towards what it has become today. If there was a Video Game Hall of Fame, Final Fantasy 7 would no doubt be in it. Obviously, with more recent RPG blockbusters from franchises like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, and Fallout, it is hard to continue to consider Final Fantasy 7 to be an “epic” game by today’s standards. Somehow it still feels that way to me. Or at the very least: since I enjoy the genre, I still find it quite fun to play.So I will admit that it definitely has been a long time since Final Fantasy 7 was one of the best games in existence. That said, even after the erosion of the sands of time, the game still feels exciting, intriguing, and massive to me. Even on my 8th playthrough I pick up on new subtleties in the story or discover new secrets and items. The story is interesting, if not a bit convoluted. (Some of the story was cut away to make it “less confusing for the Western market” or some such silliness. This wound up making it more confusing.) The Materia system is fun and, combined with the traditional XP leveling, continuously offers the satisfaction of progress as you play through the campaign. The world is intriguing and still semi-large(ish) even by modern standards. The characters are perfect clichés of the very clichés that they themselves introduced. And one of the best parts of the game will always be the intimidating boss battles with the signature music. It is doubtful there will ever be another kid who says Final Fantasy 7 is his favorite game ever, but most modern fans of the genre will enjoy this game despite its age.So there are a few reasons you may want to consider trying this game if you never have.If you consider yourself a true aficionado of the gaming industry, you will probably want to play Final Fantasy 7 at least once in your life. Even though there is a “remake” on the way (or out by the time you read this), I would argue you should play this version at least once to really experience a legendary piece of video game history in this semi-unadulterated state.Or: if you don’t care about any of the historical mumbo-jumbo, and just are looking for a fun, turn-based JRPG, then you can comfortably look to Final Fantasy 7 for that as well.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

Based on it's simple ultra low poly chibi characters and it's low resolution, pre-rendered backdrops, younger gamers would have a hard time believing that Final Fantasy VII was a cutting edge title in 1997. In addition to being a technical marvel in it's day, along side Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time, it was an important ambassador for the potential of 3d graphics in gaming. Squaresoft had been working for some time to make their characters more emotive in order to sell their grand fantasy stories. With it's pre rendered cut scenes and fresh diesel punk and cyber punk informed sci-fi setting it allowed JRPGs to explode in popularity in the west. Boasting one of the most thrilling openings in RPG history, players take control of Cloud Strife as he joins the terrorist group AVALANCH in order to destroy a Mako reactor. Cloud's former employer, an evil corporation named Shinra, is using these reactors to harvest a new form of energy that is destroying the planet and each of AVALANCH's members has a personal reason to fight against Shinra except for Cloud. Annoyingly enough, Cloud starts off as an angsty, aloof ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but slowly opens up, dealing with his own bag of issues over the course of the game. The rest of the cast is colorful and generally likeable. During the fight against Shinra a new threat emerges, shaking the plot up and introducing players to one of the most iconic villains in history. It's a narrative that is compelling though it seems a bit more silly now than it did upon release. Square has desperately tried to recapture the magic of Final Fantasy VII and often it feels like they have only managed to parody their own classic game. Final Fantasy VII established several character archetypes that are regularly found in many modern Final Fantasy titles and they have never been as likable as they were in VII.  What hasn't been cheapened by the failures of subsequent Final Fantasy titles is the combat mechanics. While the turn based structure may feel slow by modern standards, the materia system remains a phenomenally flexible system that effects everything from what weapons you want to use to your character's stats. Materia are magic crystals that are a byproduct of the mako reactors in the game world and allow characters to use magic. Each materia falls into one of several catagories: spell, command, support and summon materia. Each weapon and piece of armor has a number of slots to place materia in and some slots are linked allowing support skills to compliment offensive materia. For instance a poison materia linked to an added effect materia on a weapon allows characters to poison enemies or deal elemental damage. Final attack materia combined with life materia will instantly revive characters when they fall in combat giving yo a second chance during tough encounters. Characters don't really have classes, statistically some are better suited for certain roles than others but the right equipment allows any character to function in a desired role.  Personally, what has burned Final Fantasy VII into the deepest part of my memory for the past 17 years has been the soundtrack. From it's delicate melodies to it's whimsical themes, the soundtrack to this RPG classic is every bit as ambitious and epic as the rest of it's design. Since characters relay their dialog in text, the soundtrack serves as their voice. Hearing a character's theme several years after playing the game is like hearing the voice of an old friend. There is more humor, love, suspense and wonder in this game's sound scape than many entire franchises. Final Fantasy VII is a classic and it's certainy worth revisiting for even experiencing for the first time. Thanks to a recent re-release on steam as well as versions available on the PlayStation network that's pretty easy to do. Unfortunately the port for steam isn't exactly exemplary. The controller support requires a mod to function properly, there are a handful of bugs and it requires registering with Square Enix. On the upside, there is cloud save support and achievements. In any case, I'd buy a lackluster port of a bonna fide classic if it convinces Square Enix to take a break from releasing embarrassing new entries into their flagship franchise in order to give gamers new and old a properly remade version of what is, arguably, the most popular game in their company's history.

												Best game ever!Definitely buy it somewhere, like from a store! But...DO NOT BUY IT HERE, AVOID!! Here is why:It is a 15 year old SINGLE PLAYER GAME. SQUARE have decided to finally put their prized games on steam...so why is that? why now? Unfortunately theyve gone down a dark and corrupt road...even as low as stealing...yes, i used the word stealing, because that's what this is.You need to register your personal information, which is required to be able to login to their online client, so that you can play this single player game. DRM...oh but it goes a lot deeper than that. Afterall, why have DRM on a single player game?...The terms and conditions of this unnecessary online integration, is THEY ARE SELLING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER COMPANIES AND INSTALLING SPYWARE. In this aspect the game shouldnt cost you anything as theyre already making the money off of your private information which they have no right to deny you access to the game after pre-taking your money.But oh it gets worse...it also repeatedly installs a tracking cookie into your all your browsers in order to spy on your activity. Yes...spyware. You can remove them if you want, but they'll just keep re-installing themselves. (wtf Square...wtf)It gets even worse!Q: ""But wait....if you buy it on Steam, does that mean i automatically agree to the terms?"" NO because you havent even seen or even knew about these terms and conditions, nor accepted them. They have taken your money ILLEGALLY first, and given you the agreement later.^This warrants a potential Class Action Lawsuit, which if it happens, i will be joining.Square-Enix would not have a leg to stand on if people got organised enough to create this lawsuit against them.Q: ""I bought it, but didnt agree to these rediculous terms...can i get my money back because i was mislead and missold this item?""Legally you are entitled to a refund because you were, mislead, and tricked into buying something that had dangerous conditions given to you AFTER the sale, which is illegal.But to answer your question,NO, YOU JUST GOT ILLEGALLY ROBBED, SCREW YOU GIMME MONEY. YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? YOU CANT HAVE IT BACK, AND NOBODY IN THE WORLD, INCLUDING STEAM IS GOING TO HELP YOU GET IT BACK ( i love you steam, but not helping people get refunds in this case, is again, an illegal procedure because YOU and SQUARE have not given any warning, any notice that these conditions exist before the sale). You just got robbed, and no authority on the internet has the balls to challenge this because ""Big company"" gets complete fkin immunity from the law.Square has gone so down deep in greed and corruption, that they are taking your money, and NOT giving you your game until you accept their spyware and contractual agreement to sell your private information....and NOT giving you the money back if you do not agree to do so.IV BEEN ROBBED, and have been refused my money back...having NOT been given the product i paid for.Its criminal...anyone one of us would be arrested and either fined or given a small jail sentence, yet these guys are getting away with it like theyre above the law.---EVIDENCE SECTION---The agreement link: http://account.square-enix.com/agreement/eu/#Your Privacy link: http://eu.square-enix.com/en/documents/privacy(if you are in the US, you may have different links than these im a British European)STORING YOUR INFORMATION: (this parts the same for most companies, straight forward)Quote 1: (agreement link) ""The Registered User agrees to keep the Square Enix Account information updated, current and secure.

												Final Fantasy VII was one of the first RPGs I played, and the first game I bought for the Playstation. I had never seen anything like it at the time. Such a big, immersive experience. Three discs long! It was the first time I had seen a game span multiple discs. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started.Breakdown of the game itself:Graphics - The graphics in FF7 are very much a mixed bag. The 3D models used in battle are about as detailed as you could achieve for 1997, at least for console gaming. The models used outside of battle, however, are very blocky and much smaller. They sort of look like squashed down versions. It may take some getting used to if you're coming from a game like FF8, for example. FF7 uses pre-rendered backgrounds, which looked far superior to the 3D textures of the time and look great on standard def TVs, but look a little pixellated on higher res computer monitors. The FMVs still hold up pretty well, even if they're nothing mind blowing like they were for some of us back in the day. Personally, I think the spell/attack animations hold up the best out of everything, graphics-wise. I love seeing the animation for spells such as Aqualung. :)Music - FF7 has some of the best music ever put into a video game, if you ask me. Nobuo Uematsu is a fantastic composer, and this game simply wouldn't be anywhere near as charming and compelling without his score, which does an incredible job of setting the mood for much of the game. Many of the tracks will tug at your heartstrings during the game's more emotional scenes, and many other tracks... Well, they just sound plain cool. The boss battle theme really got me pumped the first time I heard it, and I used to look forward to upcoming boss fights just so I could hear that music again.Battle mechanics - FF7 uses an active time turn based battle system. You can have three characters in your active party, and each can equip a weapon, armor and accessory. Each weapon and armor has slots in it, which you can place little orbs in called materia. Materia are where you get your special abilities. Without them, you only have the standard attack and item commands during battle. Materia come in five varieties: Green, which contain magic spells. Blue, which alter the effects of a materia it is placed next to, if those two slots are linked. Red, which contain summons. Yellow, which enable extra battle commands (Steal, for example). And purple, which are basically stat boosting materia. These categories of materia are referred to as magic (green), support (blue), summon (red), command (yellow) and independent (purple). There is a TON of materia in the game and each weapon and armor can hold up to 8 materia orbs, so character customization possibilities are practically limitless. The materia system is honestly one of my favourites of any Final Fantasy or RPG.Plot - You are Cloud, a former soldier of the Shinra corporation, which is basically the biggest world power in Final Fantasy VII. After parting ways with them, Cloud embarks on a new life as a mercenary, ironically being hired by a militant anti-Shinra group known as Avalanche. As you progress through the game you'll learn more about Cloud and his comrades' pasts and the various secrets the Shinra corporation holds, as well as the mako energy that's become so profitable for them. Along the way you'll meet lots of interesting characters, and there are even two optional ones you can recruit. I think that's a pretty good outline without venturing into spoilery territory. The characters in this game really have a lot of depth, for the most part, which is one of my favourite aspects of the game.Controls - FF7 was originally released for the Playstation, but didn't make use of the analog sticks. It used the D-pad to move your character around, so you should be able to configure it to work with just about any USB gamepad you happen to have. You can also use your keyboard if you don't have a gamepad or simply prefer not to use one.Issues specific to the Steam release:First off, if you get an error when launching the game, try going into your program files (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FINAL FANTASY VII\ for example) and right-click on FF7_Launcher.exe. Select ""Properties"" and go into the Compatibility tab. Here, tick the box that says ""Run this program as an administrator."" This fixed the issue for me on my Windows 7 machine.The only other issues I've had running the game have been it crashing a few times. Once when I first played through it on my laptop in 2013, just outside of the Mythril Mines (after travelling through them), and a couple times when casting Beta on my current playthrough. Not ideal, but nothing to really worry about. Just make sure you save often and always after a major accomplishment.So, a few things about the Steam port. For one thing, you now have achievement trophies. These are little badges that show up on your Steam profile to let all your friends know how awesome you are, lol. Well, something like that. You'll gain a badge for getting to certain points in the story, and there are badges for getting the most powerful limit breaks, maxing out your characters' levels, collecting materia, beating optional bosses, etc.One big change I'd like to talk about is the sound. The music in the Steam release is nowhere near the quality of the original Playstation version's. Luckily, this can easily be remedied by searching through Steam's mod section, where you can find mods to replace it with the original music, or even higher quality mixes (I recommend the one based around FinalFanTim's remastered soundtrack). :)There are a few other little changes here and there. Some of the dialog has been cleaned up a little, a few of the curses have been replaced with the iconic @%#$% characters, and... The models have mouths. Basically little black circles pasted onto their faces. It looks pretty silly to me, but it's not a major distraction (you can also mod the graphics if you're so inclined).I think that about covers it... Final Fantasy VII is widely regarded as one of the best JRPGs of all time, and it's definitely high on my personal list. Give it a try. For $11.99, it's well worth it.			"

												Bought this for the Nostalga trip I was looking forward to. and I would love to recommend the game, except for a few quite significant things:* Online activation of the Single-Player, Offline game before it will work. This relies on SE's servers working, which they didn't at the time of this review.* You MUST have or create a Square account before it will launch. This is *Mandatory*, so yet another set of credentials that will need to be created and remembered. Haven't gone through that process yet because of outages. - No clear warning on the STEAM page for this game.* From a brand new install, the ff7_en.exe file gets picked up by AV applications like Comodo apparently as malware, even though it's clean. This is apparently a known issue, and has been since July 2013 at least - There is NO warning about this on the STEAM purchase page.How the hell can you butcher something so badly? I haven't even managed to launch the thing successfully yet due to these issues, which is why I have a stunning 0.2 hrs on record for the game, attempting to launch, get to the auth part, then then AV eating the .exe .. I shouldn't have to make an exception in AV settings for a game.This is a SINGLE PLAYER GAME, and I was mistaken in thinking the Cloud saves and such were STEAM based - They are NOT. Maybe I'll come back to it and try again another time. Right now, it's uninstall and added to the ""I regret this purchase"" pile. My mistake for not researching deep enough before buying.Thanks for butchering the memories Square.Edit - They have finally put in that it requires a Square Enix Account in italics at the very bottom of the system requirements.

												From a new player who never had a Playstation growing up:What more really needs to be said? It's that game that has the legacy that no other RPG has ever attained. I went back to this because I never had a Playstation when I was a kid, and practically any time I've had a discussion about games of the past this one always came up, so when it came to Steam I had to give it a try. At first, it just sat in my library for nearly a year before I picked it up, because there was plenty of other stuff for me to play. But one day when I had the time and was like ""eh, why not?"" I finally did.After several days of playing from day until night, I understood why this game is important. I understand why FFVII is etched into history as the most famous RPG of all time. And I only just played and beat it for the first time like 2 years ago.If you're curious, I promise it's worth it. And the people who say it doesn't hold up may have a point, because RPGs have evolved vastly over the years, which might make this feel less special if you've played others before you give this one a try. But it does not take away from the fact that it is still an excellent game. Hell, here I am writing up a Steam review (regardless of how unneccessary it is) because I revisited the game again today, and seeing the empty review textbox felt like an invitation for me to pour my heart out for a game that, while new to me, I feel the same kind of love for as games I have been playing for the past 2 decades.I mean, you decide. I just spent like 20 minutes gushing about it to complete strangers that aren't even going to respond to me because FFVII clearly doesn't even need my positive review, because it's just going to get buried under all of the other positive reviews.

												I could go on and on about FF7. But I think it's the Nostalgia talking. I grew up with this. I was a hardcore Nintendo fanboy, loved my N64, until one day I walked into a Blockbuster (Oh yeah, I'm that old) and in the store they had a playable demo of FF7 (Yeah seriously that old). I was instantly absorbed. I'm sure younger people won't get why so many older people go on about FF7, it isn't a matter of it being timeless exactly, though I still love the story. I think it's a matter of if you grew up playing video games in the 90's, this was just something else. There really had never been something quite like FF7. It wasn't a kids game, it was an over the top action title, it was serious and dark (relative to the era again). It had/has amazing music, a deep story and narrative, one of the most classic villains in gaming, one of the first and most powerful death scenes in gaming and had a great battle system. Again though, this was all for its time (Except for the soundtrack, it's still wonderful). By todays standards I'm not sure it compares so well, especially since RPG's have really changed in a lot of core ways, from combat to dialogue, it just doesn't work the way RPGs today do. It requires time, a lot of it, investment and interest. If you're the kind of gamer who just clicks through unspoken dialogue you should probably pass, if you play games in a hurry and don't walk around searching areas and talking to random NPCs, you should probably pass yet again. You get into FF7 to get into a story the way book worms get into a book, this is an investment on your end. You should celebrate the characters triumpths and mourn their losses. I'm sure that sounds silly to many, but that was the era of gaming this was a part of. We weren't CoD junkies who lived for point and click gratification, we wanted stories, and not the stories that our parents had, these were OUR stories, these were the new stories of our childhoods, we just didn't know it yet.

												Back in 2005,I was handed a pirated game by my friend.""You HAVE to play this!"". Curious,I installed and played the game on my then-fossil PC and found myself lost into the game for weeks!For I discovered a new genre.RPG,as the cool kids used to say.Cut forward to 9 years.RPG Scenario has completely changed with Bethesda and Bioware as the demigods of WRPG.Souls' franchise has been hailed as the masochist's paradise.CD Projekt Red is promising to deliver possibly the most epic game in terms of both scope and and scale.Square's Final Fantasy is struggling to keep up with its contemporaries due to the recent games which have been a complete blunder and is on the very verge of downfall should the next game fail.So how does a primitive game like Final Fantasy VII hold up today?{TL;DR Version Down Below}PRESENTATION:Oh, Final Fantasy VII was a complete looker for a game to be released in 1997 and the first game in series to have 3D graphics.Polygon textures, Pre-rendered cutscenes, Modelled character designs were the terms people heard for the first time.Storyline is above average but its narrative and storytelling is ace! This game proved that Square Soft knew how to do story right.They do have a few plotholes, but they aren't enough to bring the whole experience down.  Sure the game itself looks supremely fossil for today's standards.But when a game has memorable characters with zero voice acting...yes,picture this.. Characters with no voice actors that were memorable!So yes, Great characters, a plot that just oozes intrigue to be uncovered and soul-rending music, Final Fantasy VII represents all that which the recent games seem to be lacking.GAMEPLAY:Final Fantasy VII is am old school JRPG in every sense which boasts an open-world setting, turn-based combat and some annoying mini-games.But you'll be interested in the former two aspects. The character progression system requires you to be playing a lot of hours because once you hit Level20,you are going to need a LOT of XP points to progress.For that reason I found myself farming XP for hours,that can be frustrating for some. The game does get tough eventually so you'll need to keep your character's levels higher and equip them with better gear from time to time.Turn-based combat is also very well implemented with ""Materia System"" which is incredibly deep and allows for some interesting mix-and-match combinations.The influence of its combat can be seen in recent games like South Park:The Stick of Truth and Child of Light. It takes a while for the game to open up.By end of first 7 hours, you almost learn everything you should about the mechanics and systems.Animations are still clunky and stick-like, meaning its still the unchanged PS1 version you're playing.While it does have Keyboard support, you'll still want to play using a gamepad.The game can be completed within 40hours.Even more if you try to unlock all characters, learn all techniques and defeat the additional bosses. For most part, the game fulfills your needs for everything Role-playing.{FOR TL;DR SPAMMERS}PROS:+Satisfying storyline and narrative+Great characters+Robust combat+Reasonably challenging+Sublime music and OST+Features one of the best antagonists in video game culture CONS:-Graphics sure look outdated.VERDICT:An absolute piece of masterwork.Final Fantasy VII was an achievement in RPG genre when it released.The later games in the series sure had upgraded visuals and graphics but none of them come close to this one when it came to capturing the very soul of what makes RPG an RPG, like VII did.All said and considered,Final Fantasy VII is the best game in FF series and one of the best JRPG of all time.If you are a self-proclaimed fanatic of this genre,then pick this one up whenever you can. You owe it to yourself.			"

												Final Fantasy is back. Again. For the 3rd time. But what's nice is this game is fully optimized to play on new hardware. I won't go into specifics on what Final Fantasy VII is all about, since unless you have been living under a rock, you already know. But for those rock dwellers, I will give some basics. Final Fantasy VII is an epic turn based RPG. One of the finest in its genre. It has a grand story. Memorable characters. An amazing soundtrack. Everything has aged wonderfully, except I'd say the visuals. Luckily with the power of the MOD, you can relive this classic with a fresh spin of the visuals (just search around) giving you a new experience on this gem. The only problem with modding FFVII is that you will need to roll back the exe which will in turn disable any achievements. So I'd suggest for achievement hunters that you play through the game unmodded. And replay it later with the beautiful mods added. With that said, aside from better new system support, this re-release of FFVII also adds a higher res for the included character designs, as well as cloud saving, and a mode which will increase HP and Gil, with a seemingly tedious process. The latter mode is completely optional, but works in a way which does not hamper any enemy level scaling. It only boosts HP/MP, and not any stats or levels. So you will get the same scaling flow you would when playing it normally. This however does mess with your limit meter. So use at your own risk. either way, FFVII is a great classic. Fans of it originally should check out this re-release. And newcomers need to experience this at least once in their lives.			"

												Honestly, I don't care much for writing these glowing pieces on highly-acclaimed games. It's the whole ""preaching to the choir"" aspect that bothers me. I ran into this before back when I reviewed Resident Evil 4. Everyone knows FF7 is a great game, so why even bother with the review? I should just save myself the time & effort, make a humorous reference, then sit my ♥♥♥ down and drink...oh right. So I have to say something significant. I have to put words on a page that somehow match the importance and majesty of this classic JRPG. So let's get started.Like any other game series, Final Fantasy has had its humble beginnings, its ups, downs, controversies, and even today we're uncertain of where it'll go next. Like any good lemming we follow along, buy the latest games, all the while hoping that eventually Square-enix will take the franchise back in the direction we want it to go in. The thing is, there's always been one path, and game-development isn't about what ""we"" want. FF13 might be a wildly different game compared to FF1, but if you played through most of them, you could see how such a divisive entry could be released. It's the accumulation of elements, taking what works, changing what doesn't, and evolving into something different. But we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.Final Fantasy 7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. When it comes to opinions; I don't touch best/worst anything. FF7 is a great JRPG, and certainly a remarkable entry in the series. Part of its quality is in its spectacle. Yes, I'm actually talking about the flashy stuff. Even in its earliest entries, Final Fantasy was always about grandness. In FF3 for the Famicom there was the discovery that your world, was just a tiny floating island in a much larger world. FF7 works in a similar fashion, with that tiny island being Midgar. The battles in FF games have always pushed for more special effects. Everyone remembers their first time casting Ultima in FF6, just like the first time they summoned Knights of the Round. This touches on another aspect of FF. No effort (no matter how slight) goes unrewarded. One of the aspects I've always enjoyed about FF, is that I can wander into a forest in the middle of nowhere, and possibly bump into a unique monster. Perhaps this monster has a cool special move, that looks really neat, and maybe I'll be able to make it my own (via blue magic or otherwise). Other entries (like FF9) mix things up, like having mini quiz-shows hiding in the forest. It relates to one of my favorite aspects of the original Baldur's Gate. By simply wandering the outskirts you're bound to encounter more than just monsters. There's a lot of neat little discoveries in the dozen or so optional areas BG1 had. FF7 is a much more linear game, yet it still understands the importance of deviation.The character models...I actually can't complain about them. Yes, nowadays we can simply mod everything so that it looks uniformly superb but...well I'm starting to see the appeal of those blocky wonders. This isn't nostalgia talking either, this is something I just noticed in my most recent play-through. Squaresoft put a lot of work into giving NPCs life. Even today, NPCs in RPGs are only good at standing around, walking in random directions, or (in the case of later Bethesda RPGs) doing a bunch of ""radiant dynamic AI"" actions that somehow look more robotic than if they were just scripted. A lot of NPCs in FF7 do things, memorable things, things that humans would actually do. Early in the game, there's this woman waiting at a train-station. Now this woman isn't anyone important. In fact, you're supposed to pay attention to the flashback this woman is a part of. Regardless, her boyfriend/husband arrives via train. He's back from war, and he's so happy he does his best Gene Kelly impression, by swinging around a streetlight.I can't state enough just how brilliant these little moments are. There's no dialogue between these unimportant NPCs, they don't factor into the plot, and yet they add so much. The two most recent FF games I played through were FF13 and FF13-2. The few times I ran into NPCs they're just...standing around. Sometimes they walk, and they say a line or two when I walk past, but that's usually about it. Actually, FF13-2 did have the kids that run around the beach, one of them trips a lot. It might not sound like much, but that little bit of life makes the experience a lot more believable. Complexity. The first Final Fantasy was practically Wizardry with an overhead view. Even then, it had numerous ideas that offered replay value. The most obvious one is the class system. Once you decided on your party, that was it. Whether you went with the traditional (Fighter, Monk, White Mage, Black Mage) the different (Thief, Thief, Red Mage, Red Mage) or the ridiculous (Four White Mages), you were stuck with that party until you won the game. FF1 was an altogether difficult entry, with numerous random encounters that could wipe you out. One of my most memorable party-wipes was when my party of 4 was killed by a handful of ghouls. Every round they did 1-2 damage, and every round they paralyzed everyone. That was about 25 years ago...sheesh.By the time FF4 came out, the random encounter was no longer a serious threat. I never saw the easier battles as a ""dumbing down"" of FF. These RPGs have numerous mechanics and design decisions to keep track of. What better way to drill this into the player's head than through actual combat? The battles are there so you can figure out how everything works. Look at this way: You're always getting a new party member, new spells, espers, materia, junctions, jobs, gambits, etc upon etc. So naturally, you'll want to try things out, and not get killed in the process. It's like a tutorial...without actually being a tutorial (though FF has plenty of those as well).Most of the depth and challenge in FF comes from taking away all of the stuff you receive. This difficulty has to be player-imposed, but it works wonders for extending the value of these games. FF7 is no different, as there are low-level runs, no materia runs, and so on. Even something as simple as choosing not to use limit-breaks can massively change the game. After all, once a party member takes enough damage, their fight command is replaced with limit. Now what? Hopefully that character learned mug, or has some items that do damage. Heck, you might have to kill them yourself so their meter will drain. Suddenly those bosses you meteorained through become a lot more interesting.The best part is, even if you play through FF7 and take everything that's given, it's still an enjoyable JRPG. This is due to pacing. Unless you're trying to max out everything, FF7 is a +/-30 hour game. That is PERFECT! I can not emphasize it enough. Those hours are going to be spent in various locales, doing a wide variety of things, and having a grand adventure. I can't tell you the number of RPGs that I've given up on, simply because nothing happens for 5-10 hours at a time. A game having 100s of hours of ""content"" just isn't a selling point for me anymore. FF7 moves quickly enough, and still tells you all you need to know in terms of story/characters. It isn't spectacularly written, but it's an effective story that is appropriately-paced. All of this is why I think Final Fantasy 7 deserves respect. It encompasses everything that makes JRPGs work. No really, I believe this game is an example of flawless execution. I mean, a game like Xenogears might have a better plot & more interesting characters (to me), but between disc 2, the platforming, and  t h e  s l o w - m o v i n g  t e x t  t h a t  c a u s e s  m y  b r a i n  t o  g o  n u m b, I regard it as a ""more than the sum of its parts"" kind of JRPG. Still, it's like I said waaaaay back, FF7 is probably not the best JRPG of all time. It does a pretty good job of making you think it is though.  "

												I came into this game without any nostalgia at all connected to it, and came out thinking it was a masterpiece. A lot of people will say it hasn't aged well, and I agree to a certain extent, but it's pretty easy to get past the parts that feels clunky and outdated. If anything, it just makes the game feel more charming. The world is cool and interesting, the gameplay is fun (allthough sometimes it can feel just a little bit tedious) and the story is absolutely fantastic. The writing focuses a lot on the characters, which I think is a great thing, personally. All the playable characters got a lot of attention and character building, which made me really care about them in the end, adding to the emotional roller coaster that is this game.There are some pretty deep themes in FINAL FANTASY VII, such as loss and identity, and life and death. This only adds to the world and story, and makes it a much more unique and interesting experience.It's a pretty dark and complex story, at least for the time it was concieved. It does however come off as a bit much at times, like a ridiculous scene in the early stages of the game, where the main character, Cloud, rides out of a large office building on a motorcycle, all while fending off enemy pursuers with a sword.Despite this and a few other scenes, the story is very interesting and keeps you invested until the very end.As someone who had never played this before a few weeks ago, I can see how this game became such an instant classic. I honestly consider this to be the best game i've ever played, and I want to recommend it to anyone, as long as you have the patience for the outdated gameplay and graphics.			"

												Game Title : Final Fantasy 7Developer: Squaresoft / Square EnixGenre: RPG / Turn Based / Not turn based you can turn if off.I first started playing Final Fantasy 7 when I was 8 years old. I loved everything about it the world, people and music amazing. This game was my first RPG and really set the bar for others. If you ever read about why Square has not made a remake they state it is because and I quote here. ""CEO Yoichi Wada said that a remake of Final Fantasy VII will happen once the company makes a new Final Fantasy title that succeeds the seventh game in terms of quality and sales, something the company has to date failed to do"". Think about that for a mintue this game was made in 1997 almost 20 years later no other game they made has yet to top it...Story: This game is set on earth in another place and time. A place where the planets very blood ""The lifestream"" discovered by a company called Shinra, INC. Shinra found a way to turn lifestream into a power source and built reactors all around the world sucking up the lifesteam and killing the planet. You are Cloud Strife ""mercerany"" hired by your old childhood friend Tifa to help her and AVALANCHE put a stop to it... this story unfolds into an epic tale of love that puts the very life of the planet in your hands.Game play: The gameplay is smooth and seemless you always know what you need to do next. If you ever get stuck there are many guides that will help you figure it all out.  Battling enemies is fun you can make it turn based, or set it to active (no turns) for a greater challenge. There are many very fun and challanging mini game series in this game. A motorcycle challenge, submarine battles, snowboarding, and a few others. This game supports controllers I played the whole game with a Xbox 360 controller.Graphics: For the time period 1997 the graphics were soild the few in game movies have really nice graphics. Otherwise it's mostly blocky textures. There are graphics mods out that give the game a more updated feel. They are hard to install but, pay off if you get them to work.Audio: The music now updated is very nice! One of the only games where I used to play it just to listen to it.Overall: It has everything a rpg fan loves. A great story with wonderful music, the people all have backgrounds your can really get into. There are many side quests and challenges. You can't forget the Chocobos everyone loves those for dinner... I mean to race them.Story 10/10Gameplay 10/10Graphics 7/10 for 1997 10/10 if you can mod itSoundtrack 10/10Difficulty 6/10I give this game a 10/10 ( Square would make a killing if they remade this game with current graphics)			"

												Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite games of all time.  I had the original PC version back in the day and it ran flawlessly if I remember correctly.  I played it with my Gravis gamepad.  Again, with no problems.  This version is a disappointment all around.  The first thing you will be required to do is to create an account with Sqaure.  Makes no sense at all, but hey.  Still, it is an annoyance.  Once I finally got the game fired up, I immediately started having problems with my gamepad.  The cursor was flying all over the place.  I had to download a profile for Pinnacle to fix that and the fact that a few of the buttons would not respond at all.  Again, an annoyance.  Despite this effort my character still wants to walk to the left much of the time.  This I cannot seem to fix.  Sure, I can just plow forward and try to ignore it, but it still detracts from the game.  Lots of people have complained about the music or the fact that the graphics look terrible on current HD monitors.  That really does not bother me at all.  The same great gameplay is there if you can get to it.  The horrible controls completely wreck it.  A person much wiser than me, who also owns this ""updated"" version, told me that it was a better idea to just use a psx emulator to run this game if you really want to enjoy it again.  He was right.  Square totally dropped the ball on this one.  They have pretty much dumped all over the game that literally put them on the map.  I am definitely NOT saying that Final Fantasy VII is not a great game.  It is.  This is just not the version you want to play if you want to enjoy it.			"

												Needs a seperate account to run, which detected me logging into my own account as unauthorized, locked down the account as if it was stolen. Also does NOT come in Japanese. Great game, and you may encounter great issues if you want to run it. Just get the Playstation version, which can be had for roughly the same price.			"

												10/10 If you don't play this game, you'll miss out on something really special.It's FF7. Genre defining JRPG from one of the great eras of gaming. Graphics were kinda dated on the PS1, the updated version hasn't exactly raised them to hyperreal levels. Sounds will stay with you for at least 15 years. The story is still one of the best loved and remembered of any jrpg.			"

												I purchased this game thinking it would be a lot of fun to revisit.  It would have been if the game would load, but it doesn't thanks to Square's spotty online DRM servers being down at the moment.  Reading about it, there are a number of others with the same issue dating back 4 years.  Square doesn't seem to concerned about it, so I've requested a refund.			"

												A classic from the Playstation 1 era. This is one of the first RPG games I ever played and has always set the standard of what I expect from an RPG. It features turn based, but active combat, a fun and more-or-less easy to follow story, and decent characters and personalities though some border on the cliche. Finaly Fantasy 7 has a good amount of side quests and minigames that can eat up plenty of time. From snowboarding to breeding and racing chocobos the handful of side quests and metagames can keep you entertained for quite a while.                I found that, as with almost all RPGs I play, one of my favorite things to do is collect all the strongest magics and weapons. There are monsters you can encounter that are even stronger than the last boss at the end of the main story. On top of that there are magic abilities that, if you have the patience to level them up, can make the final boss a walk in the park. Getting these weapons and magics require a great deal of grinding though, which is someting I find to be rather offputting. Squeezing every last ounce of gameplay from this title will probably take you somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 hours if youre the occational gamer like me.              Since it's initial release the game has not really aged well. If youre looking for a top-notch Final Fantsy expierience I would point you to one of the newer titles. It's kind of hard to look at the old graphics in high resolution. To help this they have an ""original graphics"" mode for people like me. It keeps the display to 480x640, but without the inherit funnyness of a SDtv set you still see plenty of jaggies and protruding polygons. The graphics didnt stop me from playing through one of my old favorites though.              Another gripe I have about the age is the clunky controls when roaming about but it's nothing you cant get used to. The button layout can be a tad confusing on the keyboard. If you happen to have a gamepad it eases this considerably, but you're probably going to have to spend a moment remapping the default controls-- no biggie.            One of my favorite aspects about the steam version is the cloud saving. True: its usless if you dont have an internet connection where you want to play. But I like the ability to play on my PC, go wherever, and pick the game right back up on my laptop. Aside from that there is also a ""character booster"" if you get stuck...or want to be a badass. I have not used the feature mainly because I forgot my square-enix login stuff moments after i made it.               Its not particularly weak in any areas but isnt as deep in character skill devlopment as I would like sometimes. Rather than molding your character(s) into what you want them to be, you have to play to each character's strengths-- again, no biggie.               Theres no voiceover, which is a huge plus for me. The story is good, characters are likeable, the gameplay is solid, and its good on length. It's probably 20 hours on the game clock on a casual playthough if you ignore endgame badass equipment, skills, and sidequests. All-in-all its worth it if it's on sale, but if you just want a stroll down memory lane you might be better off digging out the old PS1.			"

												I think after spending 200+ hours on this game, it's time to write a review.You guys ok with this? If not, so sorry (sarcasm)The PC version of FFVII! A great game gets a great PC port with a little graphic upscale on the side.Pros:This game is magic. Absolute gold. (And I don't even like FF games.)Fun to play (I literally spent 200+ hours on this. I think I might be a bit biased)Minigames. Chocobos are fun to ride around on.It will literally keep you busy for hours.Controls well. (Although, I did not use a controller and I'm not sure if controllers can be used. I prefer keyboards anyway.)Music is sweet.Cons:Master Tonberry (Stab stab)Ruby WeaponEmerald WeaponRandom EncountersAnalysis:Upon first glance of Final Fantasy VII, I almost blew it off. Steam Christmas sales changed my mind quickly.I picked it up and started it. The beginning was slow. Not slow enough to deter me from the glory that I would experience later on though. You start off as Cloud, an edgy, roided up, Ex-SOLDIER mercenary. You are hired by AVALANCHE to rig one of the mako reactors to explode. You do this. Easy stuff.Story continues (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just look at this review and determine if you want to buy it.)You will find enemies that you will absolutely hate. I'm quite sure my least favorites were the parasites and Master Tonberry. The story will tug a few heartstrings. I choked up a bit when a couple things happened. There'll be some twists and turns that you might not expect (Unless you were played the original. Then enjoy this masterpiece again, friend.)There'll be some goofs and gaffs. The characters are unique and their dialogue is entertaining. DON'T TOUCH THE RED THING IN THE DESERT. Still not going to spoil anything... but when you get to the ending, Be prepared to have some of your soul ripped out of you because it's so gosh darn good.Conclusion:The game is almost perfect. It's flaws will and have been pointed out, but I'm not here for that. I like the game for what it is and I highly recommend buying it. It's been worth the 200+ hours and I definitely got my money's worth.			"

												This is the most memorable game you can find, and the best. There are so many epic characters, fantastic gameplay, lovely world map, and AWESOME story!You have many interesting and epic hours if you want to do the story, and even more fun hours if you want to do all of the side quests. This game has also very high replay value, because when you are finished with the game, you will miss everyone and starts the game again after a short period.The soundtrack on this game is a Masterpiece, you will love it! There are many emotional parts on this game, that is hard to forget. I know the graphics are not perfect, but it's very nostalgic!This is the greatest game of all time in my personal opinion. Play this game NOW!
It was, is and will always be the best Final Fantasy. Period.

												1) You DO NOT NEED TO BE ONLINE 24/7 TO PLAY. You just need to have internet while you make a square account. Then once you're logged in, go to 'FF7 Launcher Settings' and disable 'Cloud Saving'. There you go. FF7 will never need to be connected to the internet again.   I point this out because I keep reading reviews that say you need to be online 24/7 DRM blah blah... and its completely untrue. It put me off of buying the game for awhile. Screw that. Now you know.   2) They updated the character models and enemies and they did a good job. Its a perfect mix of old and new, slanted towards old. The models are improved, not changed. And if for some reason you hate it, in the launcher theres a toggle. You can have the exact Ps1 graphics if you want. But once you switch you'll want to go back to the updated version, trust me on that.3) Check out all the different mods for the steam version of FF7. Depending on how far you want to go, you can mod this games graphics pretty hard.   TLDR: If you played FF7 as a kid and loved it then get this. 6 bucks is a steal.   TLDR#2: You don't need to be online 24/7 to play. That's a myth. So don't worry.			"

												This game isn't just a game... It's the best story I've ever played. I'm 27 now, and have been playing this game since the day it came out. What tells me this is a good game... I can describe to you where I was when I played it. The time of day, who had the controller, my brother or myself. If you haven't played this before, I welcome you to YOUTUBE some of the FF7 Remake Live Reactions. These videos hardly display the feeling a lot of people have for this game. Some of the most vidid memories of my life revolve around this game. I can't hear the word Cloud without picturing golden spiky hair.*----------------SPOILER ALERT---------------------*I remember the morning I sat and watched my brother play through the Forgotten City (Capital). The music plays in my head on a daily basis... I'll never forget the pit I had in my stomache all day after watching one of my favorite game characters die in Cloud's arms. The story never stops unraveling, and has generated such a vibtant world I enjoy as much every time, as the first time.Sure, games these days offer a lot of what FF7 had. But this is the game that really re-defined a whole Genre.This (to me) was the end of Final Fantasy's Golden age. FF4, FF5 (Ish to me), FF6 and FF7. Incredible story telling, fun characters, memorable moments. 8 Was the start of a slide that they almost came out of with 10, but in my oponion...this is the best Single Player Final Fantasy ever made.DYING for the new release. Already bought my PS4 for the occasion.CONCLUSION: Unless you're not into fun games, awesome stories, crude language, and a fun guessing game of what they will have to tone down for PS4, BUY THIS MUTHA' ♥♥♥♥IN GAME!

												What to say about FF7 that hasn't already been said? No, it's not the best game ever. Yes it has flaws, yes, the graphics are outdated, and a big part of his success comes from when it was released...That being said, and while I can't deny the fact that I have a huge bias, since it's the first video game I've ever played...The thing that strikes me when I play again is this game's generosity, in pretty much every aspect.- generous in term of longevity, the story is huge, long, with twists, takes you in many places. It's a game from an era where games where not necessarily designed with replayability in mind, and that frankly still doesn't need it.- generous in its gameplay, with a really nice system allowing you to think about your group roles, and that though about the fun part more than the efficient part. Also, an incredible number of mini-games introduced in the story to shake things a little, and later available as full blown mini-games (snowboard, submarine, Fort Condor,...)- generous in its music, with lots of soundtracks very well used to illustrate each place, or returning characters.So, yeah. There are a lot to be done, and the beauty of it is that it isn't forced upon you. It's a game where the devs did all they could to make the experience even more enjoyable, but didn't shove it in your throat.As I said, it's not perfect. But it will forever stay the perfect exemple of a video game done right, with the player's enjoyement always in mind.			"

												While Final Fantasy VII is a great (if very dated) game at its core, this has every symptom of a poor console port.  It's just a repack of the original port from over a decade ago.  Some things that show it's an effortless port:-Characters faces are bugged.  All eyes are open, even if they're sleeping. All mouths are gaping, which looks ridiculous after a time.-Controller mapping is awful (XBOX 360 controller).  The D-pad can't be mapped, which makes battle menus a pain.  You'll often accidentally slide to the side and choose Defend when trying to scroll down the menu.  R2/L2 can't be mapped.  The OK button decides to go ""turbo mode"" frequently and skip dialog.-No 16:9 mode (I don't count 4:3 awfully stretched to 16:9)-Lots of odd crashes.  If you tab out of fullscreen, it will crash.  If your controller idles off while tabbed out in windowed mode, the game will crash.  For a non-autosaving game with 90s-style spread out save points, this is infuriating.-If it can't sync your cloud saves, you can't save the game unless you exit and turn off cloud saving (losing your progress in the offing).If you played this in the 90s, and you want to give it a nostalgic run, go for it.  But know that you're going to have to accept a lot of lousy-port-isms.  If you didn't play this in the 90s, the dated graphics, old gameplay mechanics and PC quirks will make you regret the purchase. I wish I could give it a 6.5 instead of a ""Not recommended"" because it is still fun, and it's great to go back and play.			"

												When you launch the game you have to sign in with your Square Enix account because why wouldn't you put DRM on a 20 year old game that you made your money on 50 times over?The problem that I run into is that after signing in with my account it asks me to ""Enter a Nickname""  which I have tried a few dozen times.  Everytime, no matter the combination of Capital and numbers, it says ""Has already been taken""I contacted Square Enix directly when I couldn't set up a nickname on their website either.  They told me to try different browsers, use a different network, and even try a mobile device.  I did.  I tried everything they told me to try and I stil couldn't get in.  Here is another reason why online DRM for a single player game is nonsense.UPDATE 03/25/2017I have finished the long drawnout process of trying to get Square Enix to help me with my problem.  They told me that they could not help me and that it was the customer's responsibility to complete their own account information....which I can't...because their website is broken.It is past the 2 week mark to get a refund from Steam so I am just out the money.  This is the 3th time I have bought this game and it is the last time Square Enix will get another dime from me.  Congrats Square Enix you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a loyal customer who has spent LITERALLY thousands of dollars with your company all so you could rob me of 7 dollars.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is the most iconic Final Fantasy game in the series and one of the most popular videogames that have ever existed. Its success is known worldwide which lead to the creation of other Final Fantasy 7 games and movies based on the original FFVII universe including the upcoming Final Fantas 7 remake. The story of FFVII is a masterpiece in every aspect, the battles, the characters, the mystery, the overall feelings combined together and the main protagonist Cloud Strife who is one of the most loved and famous characters in the history of gaming. Its a game that is definately worth experiencing.			"

												New to the Final Fantasy series, I decided to pick this game up after hearing lots of good things about it. Final Fantasy VII is one of those iconic games which you hear so much talk about, that you have to play it in order to see if it matches what people say. And does it live up to expectations? Well, mostly.Story:FF7's story suprised me, as it was quite different to what I had expected, although not in a bad way. From what I'd heard beforehand, I was used to thinking of Final Fantasy 7 as this dark, brooding story set in a dystopian futuristic city, and while this holds true for the first couple of hours, there is so much more to it. As mentioned, FF7 is often seen as quite dark, but in reality it's a game which never takes itself to seriously, and still retains a sense of fun. The story itself is long and developped (it took me around 60 hours to beat the main story alone), and covers several mature themes. I have to say that I found the main story really engrossing, even if I'd heard some spoilers beforehand. If their was one criticism to be had with the story, it's that the latter half of the game doesn't quite manage to meet the standard of the first half, with the plot becoming a bit too convoluted, and difficult to follow.GameplayThe gameplay in Final Fantasy VII is good, but nothing spectacular. Being an JRPG, a good deal of gameplay is taken up by turnbased battles. The combat system is simple enough for beginners, but also has enough technique for more experienced players. This makes for several fun battles, although a large number of random encounters, as well as summon attack cutscenes which can take up to two minutes to play out, can make them seem a bit repetitive. I enjoyed the battles for the most part although some of them towards the end of the game, I found very frustrating .As well as battles there are also several minigames such as motorbike chases, or snowboarding which you can try out. These can be fun, but I didn't try them out much. Outside of battles and minigames, you will travel across the world and explore caves, and towns. This is easier said than done, as the static backgrounds can be quite hard to traverse.GraphicsIt's no secret that Final Fantasy VII's graphics are a bti dated, with some characters looking like lego, but I genuinely didn't mind them that much. They have been sharpened for this release, and some of the battles actually look quite decent. There are several cutscenes as well, which look quite good for the time.MusicIf there's one thing which is easy to agree on about Final Fantasy VII, it's that it has great music. From killer battle tracks, to heart wrenching leitmotifs, this game has some of the best and most memorable music I've seen in a game. Mr. Uematsu, I salute you.VerdictFinal Fantasy VII is an amazing game with a memorable story, some fun battles, and a killer soundtrack. Even the occasional frustrating moment, doesn't stop this from being an incredible game.10/10			"

The game that sold the PlayStation Final Fantasy VII is adored by young and old around the world. The game's various versions have sold over 11 million units as of 2015, and it remains popular to this day. If you've never heard of it, then where the hell have you been?!The story has an excellent premise, as evinced by the extensive efforts of Square Enix to milk the universe of all its worth (spin-offs include Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus, and even a movie, Advent Children, among others). You start with Cloud Strife (employed as a mercenary) and long-time friend Tifa Lockheart as members of eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, under the command of Barrett Wallace. The underlying belief of the group is that the planet's life energy is being consumed by Shinra Corporation's reactors, slowly but surely destroying the planet. The group organise attacks against the reactors in the belief they are saving the planet. These events are eventually dwarfed by a new threat to the planet: Sephiroth.The game has done well over the years thanks to a whole plethora of reasons that help make it come alive, and it often stays alive in the minds of gamers long after players have experienced it. The engaging story, of which I have only touched upon here, is littered with so many twists and turns and shocking discoveries that you'll likely be dizzy with awesomeness by the end of it.Gameplay is much the same as previous titles, using the standard random encounter mechanic we all know and love to initiate fights with monsters or people. Equipment is limited to one weapon and one armor at a time, but these can have various materia slots. Materia is crystallised Mako, or lifestream energy, and is the source of many abilities and enhancements characters can make use of in the game, not the least of which is magic spells, summons, auto-abilities and stat boosts. Materia can be levelled, and once mastered can spawn a duplicate materia, allowing much customisation and experimentation.The game really is an emotional rollercoaster. The characters are a lot more fully realised than many of those in previous titles in the series - Barrett's concern for Marlene, Tifa's concern for Cloud ... even some of the Turks inspire our empathy at times (eg, Reno and Rude deciding they are 'off-duty' in regard to orders to search for Cloud, after working together briefly). Cloud's cross-dressing scene is good for a laugh. People are killed. Truths are learnt. A good game is a game that holds our attention, and that is what FFVII and its characters do as we strive to know more about what is happening and why. Indeed, the shock death of one of our own team members definitely added to the game's infamy. Most of you already know who I'm talking about. And perhaps because of this, Sephiroth is often lauded as one of, if not the, greatest game villain of all time. I know my own feelings are a mix of admiration and hate when I think of him.The art style was a leap ahead in its time, but in today's world of newest releases it does have a dated feel to it, with chunky 3D graphics on par with much of the earliest games to implement 3D graphics. On the PC version little has changed, although it has been criticised for its lower quality graphics, installation and framerate problems. I did not experience any problems personally, and have come to not expect vast improvements in framerate from FF re-releases.Some would say the PS version is more impressive - I myself cannot say as I never got around to playing that version. It does seem as though Square Enix has only done the bare minimum to get the game to work on PC - a trait shared by many FF PC ports, much to the disgust of expectant PC FF fans.The music is excellent, but many of its most loved tracks have been reworked for Advent Children, and it is these versions I enjoy the most, especially One-Winged Angel. As it happens, the FFVII version is also composer Nobuo Uematsu's favourite from the soundtrack, and his favourite battle theme from any Final Fantasy game.Some cons I believe are worth noting:- Cheap final boss fight, impossible to lose- A minority might find the plot very confusing to grasp as more facts are brought to lightI would have listed the game's linear nature, but this isn't so bad when you consider it as a trade-off for good story. Also to make up for this are the game's various mini games, helping to beef up an already impressive game. There is a barrel pushing game in the Sector 5 Church, a 'squats' mini game at the Wall Market, a sneaking game in the Shinra Building, in addition to various mini games that can be played at the Gold Saucer, including G Bike, the Fort Condor strategy minigame, and of course the chocobo racing game, among others. Some of these are easy while others can be hard.With the inclusion of Steam achievements, there is plenty for the aspiring completionist to aim for. Be sure to add this piece of gaming history to your library, you won't regret it.			"

												7/10 In 1997, one of the most influential, inspiring, and standard-setting RPG's ever was released: Final Fantasy 7. In fact, it was the #1 best selling game in the series' history, and one of the best selling games of the time. FF7 ""sold the Playstation"" (according to Wiki). It pushed the petty PS1 to astronomical levels above and beyond what it was intended for. Square had developed a game so indepth, so massive, that it took THREE discs just to contain it all! Great writing, beautiful story telling, breath-taking art, and a soundtrack that will sweep your mind away and invoke so many emotions are the words to describe this....AND SQUARE FREAKIN' RUINS IT WITH THIS PC RELEASE! First of all, DRM. Yap, DRM...FOR A SINGLE PLAYER GAME! I almost saw past  this, then the unimaginable happened: THEY CHANGED THE SOUND EFFECTS AND THE MUSIC FROM THE ORIGINAL. UN...FORGIVABLE. The new music and sounds are literally painful. A guide here on Steam shows how to get the original music, but what was Square thinking?! If you can get the work around for the music to work (or use youtube like me), see past the DRM, and fight the weird PC controls, one of the greatest games ever made lies hidden behind it all. I don't even know if I should recommend this or not. Maybe go for the PS version instead. I feel so let down.			"

												This game was released in 1997 but I still doubt it was crafted by humans. It was either a gift from the gods or was sent to us from an advanced extra-terrestial civilization.Yoshinori Kitase, when you read this, I want you to know that I love you from the deepest of my heart for making this game. And if you don't mind, I propose we have human intercourse as soon as possible.Words can not describe this game. If you missed it and you're not a graphic-spoiled Call of Duty brat, I highly recommend, no no, I force you to play this game. And now excuse me while I'm on my way to defeat Ruby and Emerald Weapon, my arch-enemies from my childhood...			"

												It's FF7, do I even need to say anything more than that? Well, for one thing, does all the hype buzzing around this 90's big budget JRPG title actually stack up to the experience of playing it? Admittedly, as a teenager when FF7 first came out, I could never get that far into the game because heart-crushingly my second hand FF7 disc two would not ever properly load, hence I never made it past the first disc.. So, considering this was pretty much my first time playing through the game, in some sense my opinion about FF7 is as unbiased as one can get for a RPG of this stature and age. I can safely say, that yes, this is a great experience! While FF7's combat may seem dull at first glance, it's actually rather deep if you dig into it and if you're like me and enjoy trying out new build combos then it's definitely worth poking around and experimenting with. There are several extensive side quests based around finding ""secret"" items that will make you and your party stronger.. The game's plot is done well, mainly due to the strong characters.. The game slowly leads you along each character's past, but never fully gives you everything.. This type of story approach kept me constantly wanting more!So yeah, go play this game!			"

												This game is the peak in the videogame industry, you have the best plot ever made but with some missing things that you have to guess. It contains the most known spoiler in the videogame history, and one of the most known antagonist as well...and he is not evil just because no reason, it has a very deep reason.STORY/PLOT 10/10The best story in a videogame. Deep plot involving: Contamination problems, fighting a nemesis (which you don't want to kill, just make him come to reason), discovery extra things in the story, the saddest spoilerS (yeah one in the middle and one near the end, but it is better described in Crisis Core).CHARACTERS 10/10The best antagonist in a videogame, it's not ""bad"" for no reason, and over time you don't want to kill him, just understand his reasons and stop him from his main objetive.You could think that you have more developed characters than others (I'm talking about their past) but when you do all their extra things you know you have been mistaken (even with the optional characters)COMBAT SYSTEM 9/10Of course the combat system is static, but imagine being the first FF having animations in the battles (attacking, preparing attacks, covering allies, etc, and the bosses as well). You can equip everyone with any materia, the only differences among them are the limits, some stats and some equipment of course. Some summons could be anoying to watch (specially Knights of the Round). Once you reach high lvls and equipment/materias there is no more challenge than Weapons (optional bosses spreaded over the map)GRAPHICS 9/10I know that some videogames had better graphics back then, but this was the first FF with: a) 3d characters/enemies (with a proper appearance for your chars inbattle...no more dwarf chars against well drawn non-animated enemies)b) 3d to 2d rendered spaces, you could think it's not good, but it gave them the opportunity to show a lot of detailed things within the places, and you don't have the same houses/buildings structures over and over in a town/city anymore.c)being a pre rendered 2d place, you don't have popping textures which they were present in almost every game in that gen (it was normal then)GAMEPLAY 10/10I did split ""gamplay"" from ""combat system"" for three reasons:First: no more party splits to solve puzzles (If you played FFVI you know how anoying it could be without no-encounters).Second: the 3d map now looks the most alive map in a FF so far, so you really feel like you are discovering new places every time, and now you have more vehicles.Third: a lot of minigames in the game, defending a fortress, doing sport, chocobos(very anoying if you don't have a proper chocobo), snow, motorbike, etc...DIALOG 10/10It has very deep conversations sometimes, everyone has something to say, maybe the only ""bad"" thing in this game is the translation (at least the spanish translation is known as the worst translation ever made)MUSIC 10/10Nobuo Uematsu made a very good job here, this soundtrack not only has a lot of memorable songs, it has the sephiroth theme, used in the next FFVII games, and (of course) KH sephiroth battle. I think I can say that there is not another song that identifies a videogame character like this song does.CONCLUSIONThe best PSX game (I know, the closests to this one are MGS and CTR). The best plot in a videogame. OPINION ABOUT THE UPCOMING REMAKE:I played and enjoyed this masterpiece a lot of times. I totally agree with a remake, and I would like to see a new combat system, because I have the old combat system in this game.I want new stories within the game, new characters if they are needed or showing more content that we could have not seen before.People think that a bad remake could destroy the game, but I don't think so, the FFVII was done and finished 20 years ago, you are not touching that game, you are making a new one, if it is a bad remake, it doesn't matter, you have the old game forever, and even better, you could be the guy which always says: ""the original was better"", ""if I wanted to play FFVII I wouldn't play this ♥♥♥♥"", etc.			"

												This is ""The"" Final Fantasy game for a lot of people. The holy grail. The best of them all. The pinicle of the series.Do I think that? No, actually, I don't. I liked IX more than VII personally. However, I do still enjoy this game and I do recommend it. Don't let my play time fool you, I've got 3 complete playthroughs under my belt on the PS1 and I recently purchased this PC version so I can always have it on hand.This game holds a special place in a lot of people's hearts because it was the very first 3D final fantasy game and it has a story that hooks you early, and keeps you going throughout.It's very important to keep in mind that this game came out in 1997. 17 years ago at the time of this review. That's nearly two decades, and this PC release of the original PS1 game is by and large the exact same graphically. They did slightly upgrade the character models and portraits, but they're still just as blocky as they were then.A downside with the PC release is the MIDI sound files are not the best of quality. That can be modded though, if you're feeling rather adventurous as modding is not a built in feature so it takes following some guides to know what files to replace and in what folders. The graphics can also be modded to make the game look more recent than it really is, but with these you have to be a bit more careful as the most popular set of mods will make you unable to gain achievements in the game or use the cloud saves. That is because the mods were created for the original PC release of the game, and not this much more recent Steam release and no one has gone through the effort of porting all those mods over to work with the Steam version to keep achievements active.The game itself has a standard RPG story that you'll come to expect from Final Fantasy games, and as you probably know it is highly regarded by many. VI and VII are by and large the absolute most popular Final Fantasy games, and that's likely always to be the case. I really don't want to spoil anything so I won't go into specifics.A unique feature of the game is its materia system, which is a system where your weapon and armor has slots in which you can equip materia that gives you access to a specific spell. This allows you to take your characters and build them up with exactly the spells you want them to have, but you can switch it up to meet any paticular challenge without any penalties. This is particularly nice because it allows you to put the characters you most care about into your active party and not be punished for doing so. Characters still maintain a unique identity through their limit break skills. The only exception being that through much of the game you are required to use the main character, Cloud, but you're free to pick and choose the other two fairly early in the game.For a very early PS1 game, it still features a lot of content like an overworld map, travel by airships, mini-games, optional super bosses, etc. Now, while it has an overworld map don't be fooled into thinking it's open world. It isn't. Like most of the Final Fantasy games it is by and large linear, but at about the halfway to 2/3 mark you do start to get more freedom in where you go. It's linear in that while you can wonder around the map, natural barriers prevent you from going too far from where you are suppose to get until you advance the story and unlock new modes of transportation.Overall I do think this is a good game, and worth playing through at least once if you have not done so. If you've already played through the game once before on a different system and are just curious what the changes are, I'd probably skip this as the changes in graphics is minimal.			"

												I heard people say this was the best Final Fantasy and they were right.If you never played this game or any other final fantasy what are you doing with your life?10/10 needs more chocobosEdit: I have over 250 hrs of this game and imo this has to be one of the best rpgs out there and if you are a fan of them get this game, it will not disappoint.I still havent completed this game due to buying many games and never completing them, but sometime in the future I plan to go back to this game and finish it.My Experience so far (No Spoilers): So far with my experience with this game has been great, the gameplay is fluid which you have turns attacking in real time with the classic Final Fantasy gameplay, idk about you but I really like these old poly graphics which have a charm and a place in my heart ;), story wise this game has a lot of climatic moments which makes you keep on playing more and has 3 discs which you don't have to switch since when you get to a certain point you can save and quit or continue. I'm really happy I decided to buy this game because, it holds a special place in one of my favorite games and perhaps my favorite rpg but, if you still haven't bought this game buy it, period.			"

												Boy, oh boy. How I usually avoid writing these kind of things.So you know, whether or not this 'review' has a thumbs down is completely irrelevant.I have a fond place in my memories for this game and it will always sit there, regardless of this ports overall quality.It's by far and wide not my favourite of the series, but it sits high on the list.That said, this is a passable port at best. At it's worst it's an OLD port of the original PC release.The music, while seemingly a huge issue for some didn't even register with me.The needless always online DRM for a game I've been playing since 1998 is also not a selling point, but once you've signed up for an account, it just becomes a minor hurdle to get into your game (not wholly unlike the Steam service itself). It's more a mark of the times in which we live than an actual mark against the game.At face value, all of what made Final Fantasy VII such a fan favourite is still very much present in this port.But recently sitting down to an in-depth playthrough (My first actual playthrough since buying the game on Steam) has brought some... Light issues to my attention.- Graphics:No, no. This isn't a ""Man, why do all the characters look like Popeye?"" kind of graphical issue, this is more of a ""Why update the models but not their faces?"" issue.As mentioned the models are updated, looking smoother with less pixelation on the edges, the characters really stand out against the background (sometimes they even stand out against the foreground for no reason) and it runs beautifully smooth, rarely any sign of frame lag. But as I said, the faces for the characters seem to have been lifted straight from the Playstation version and then plastered onto the new models.Beyond that there are a couple of fascinating new gltiches/oversights that I've noticed. First of which being the gaped, open-mouth vacant look most characters seem to have. The most hilarious example being Sephiroth. Man, is it hard to take Aeris' death seriously when Sephiroth is standing over her the whole time with his mouth wide open THE WHOLE TIME.The second facial issue I noticed while inside the HoneyBee Inn's Group Room.Obviously, there are some copy-pasted dudes in that room, that's no secret, but did you noticed the black guys have blonde eyebrows whenever they blink? It's not even limited to them...Remember the scene where Barret and Dyne lose their arms? Well the moment where Barret recoils from being shot in the wrist there's a fabulous close up of his face, blone eyebrows and all.- Controls:If you're playing using your Keyboard, congratulations, you're clearly more patient than most of us...If you're playing using a Gamepad... Again, You're probably more patient than any of us.The button configuration for this game is a logistical nightmare and the games outirght refusal to relay meaningful information about what the buttons actually do is a hurdle I certainly could have done without.This is a complaint from someone who is admittedly not a ""seasoned PC gamer"". So I'm not all too familiar with the buttons on my keyboard that don't type words or relate to something in photoshop. Nor do I know which button is ""button 4"" or whatever on my wired 360 controller. So that is on me. I'll freely accept that I could be better informed in this instance.However, if I plug my controller in to play a pre-analog game from 1997 and for reasons never explained there is no D-Pad support what-so-ever, then yes. I'd call that an issue.If I have to run Joy-To-Key in the background of a port of Final Fantasy VII so that I don't have to manipulate menus with an analog stick then someone in the process of this port wasn't working hard enough.I will say though, once I got Joy-To-Key worked into the equation, navigating the world with the analog and switching to D-Pad for battle menu navigation felt so much better than the original experience on the Playstation. So, analog support is a pro, but no D-Pad option negates it entirely.For some people I understand that this won't sound like a big problem ""Oh boo-hoo! You had to configure the buttons to your liking on a PC game!"" And normally, those people would be right... Kind of.But with a port of a Playstation game, that is as much-beloved as this one I'd like to imagine that maintaining as much of the original experience as possible would be the most important thing to the developer.Making the controls wonky to the point of needing outside assistance to work is counter-active to that goal.And if you can't have fun controlling a game, then it's hardly an experience worth paying for in my opinion.So all together, there are some minor and now I think about it, really funny graphical glitches and the controls are so poorly handled that chances are you'll spend more time trying to work out how to make it all go then you ever will saving the world from slack jawed Sephiroth.The game as is, isn't the most offensive port I've ever played but it's a ways off being one of the best. Like I said at the start, at best it's passable, at worst it's old and nothing learned from the years before this release was ever implemented.My verdict? Well chances are if you liked this game already then you've likely bought it before even reading this. If not, I'd suggest buying the PSN port instead if you can, as it's essentially a 1 to 1 version of the original Playstation and requires less set-up and is no where near as fiddly controller-wise.

												Overall Score: 9.85/10       ---------------------------------------Concept: 10The story is great, the characters are interesting and fun, Open world exploration and at some parts a little linearity (is that a word?). Not too much to say about it.---------------------------------------Graphics: 9.75Graphics are... ok for its time i guess. Many people would have liked to seen an HD remake of this game, but what we got was just a little polished version of the ps1 version, but for its time the game looked pretty solid!----------------------------------------Sound: 10Amazing music. just... just amazing. Beautiful. Catchy. Awesome. so much variety in the music styles seen in the game as well. Perfect 10.----------------------------------------Playability: 9.75Only Playability problem with this game is the controller support. The game supports controllers, and a good amount of them, but it would be nice if the game maybe said ""press A"" or ""press Y"" for my Xbox 360 controller instead of ""press BUTTON12"" because I sure as heck don't remember the numbers for all the buttons, and at certain times this led me to pressing random buttons until it works.----------------------------------------Entertainment: 9.75Very entertaining game, you get really involved into the story and the characters, alot of variety, fun, and exploration. Only minus was at certain times having no clue where to go, with no objective marker or mission status telling you where, which left you wondering around an open world for a good while wondering where to go (but some people like doing this)			"

												What the ^@#$!....My pride was wounded on this one. I love this game and still mark it as my favorite videogame ever, but I cant in good mind recommend this pc port to anyone. The game is great don't get me wrong, but the resolution wasn't changed from the low low resoultion they used to use for TVs and it shows. I just bought this on steam right after playing it on a emulator and omg....the textures  EVERYWHERE look utterly terrible and fuzzy compare to it (litterally 2 to 3 times worse) (why isn't anyone mentioning this!). I would normally  recommend you buy a game to show your support for it, but this IS one of the most well known games in the world. Do your self a favor and download a common emulator to play this game instead, where people at least showed the love and care this game deserves on a pc port instead of....this...TLDR: Textures are much much lower resolution and fuzzier than any emulator has on this game. Do yourself a favor and emulate it where people gave it the love and care it deserved.			"

Its worth it for Cloud saves and achievements such as: ""use characters limit break"". I love you Square-Enix! Please hurry up and make Final Fantasy 13-5: Lightning takes Samba lessons.All that aside, its still the best way to play this game. however, When you are playing games from Steam Big Picture, Having to pull out a mouse and keyboard just to start a game that is designed for gamepad play really irritates me. Thumbs down mostly because all these ""Features"" keep an other wise perfect release from getting out of the mud.			"

Here are some notable differences you should keep an eye out for.-Every character inexplicably has some kind of a mouth. Cloud has a :| face all the time, Tifa and Aeris are c:, and literally every NPC (including Sephiroth himself!) suffers from a debilitating case of open mouth syndrome. Please keep them in your hearts and prayers.-The game loads faster, and because of this, some of the sequenced music sequences (like the tiny bronco taking off) are off sync.-You can warp into the debug room with seemingly random saves and loads.

												Good freaking god, there is not enough I can say about how awesome this game is. This defined my childhood. The story, while cheesy, keeps you going and has some twists that defined an enitre generation. The Materia system is one of my favorite systems Square has used for one of their games and allows for infinite combinations for your characters in battle. Plus it has an enitre Chocobo breeding and racing minigame that will take you hours to clear.If you've an RPG fan and have never played this game, buy it. I'm certain you wont regret it.			"

												I cannot for the life of me figure out how to play this game.  I refuse to get facebook to play a game from the 90s and I created a square enix account - But everytime I log in it says ""SEA"" accounts are not working at the moment.  Why in the world do I need to sign in to a stupid website and answer a bunch of questions to play a game that is 20 years old!?  No wonder people just download illegal ROMS.  Starting to look like the easist way.. I have paid for the game and can't even play it.			"

												An almost decent port sadly sabotaged with several problems making it impossible to recommend.Its controller support is sadly lacking. With no way to assign the d-pad to up/down/left/right I'm forced to use the analog stick, which for this game (and its constant awkward movement angles) is seriously debilitating.Cloud saving is apparently not working right now, which meant when I hit the first save point I actually couldn't save at all - even though it's telling me it's using local files, it just errors with a 'save file not found' first time I try to save.It forces you to create a Square Enix account and 'log in' just to play the game - which is unnecessary and obnoxious, especially since the only benefit to the player, cloud saving, doesn't seem to be working, at least for me.There are no graphical improvements here, so all in all I feel I'm better off running the original PSX version in an emulator than running this. Unless you really have a desire to collect achievements for some dumb reason...			"

												It kills me to give this game a thumbs down. It is a great game but Squares ""Registration and Account Tracking Services"" TOS is insane. It gives Square permission to examine and take anything they want from your computer or phone. I dunno why square would smack the customers that support them in the face like this.I never pirated a piece of software in my life before FF7, and I actually paid for thios atrocious steaming pile of malware garbage on steam, but I have installed the cracked version because it doesn't require me to give my PC and phone to square. I am loving the game...and I intend to get clean versions without the ""Registration and Account Tracking Services"" of the other FFs.It just bums me out that the actual developer can release such a crummy paid version, I would have liked to support square because they used to make awesome games, but if they would rather their customers surf the crack sites in order to get clean versions of thier product so be it.Really bummed about this....

												I can't tell you how many times I have played Final Fantasy VII. It is perhaps my favorite Final Fantasy ever, and I know many will agree with me. There is a reason why they made several other games and a movie based on the Final Fantasy VII universe.Positive:- Cut-scenes still look good- Game-play still great- Story still holds up (it still excites me even though I know what will happen)- Oh my God, the music- The materia system is so incredible. It is so fun and rewarding to experiment with different materia combinations. It is by far my favorite magic/equip system of all Final Fantasies- Plenty of side-quests, side-stories, mini-games, and collectables- Some extremely challenging boss-fights Negative:- Plenty of little glitches (none that are game breaking from what I know)- All those polygons (old graphics)- Turn based battle system - don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the system to this day. However, many magic/skill animations (especially summons) take a lot of time, are unskippable and ruin the flow of battle. - Some battle abilities take so long to complete (especially summons)- Damage cap at 9999- It can be difficult for new playersConclusion:I understand that it can be difficult to convince someone to buy Final Fantasy VII. For me, it's main selling point is the nostalgia. If you have no emotional ties to this game, it's basically an old game with a dated turn-based battling system. However, if you are willing to give Final Fantasy VII a shot, you will not regret it. The story is captivating, the battles are exciting, the world is vast, and the materia system is magnificent. I guarantee over 30 hours of old-school goodness.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is easily one of my favourite games of all time. In fact, I'd go as far as calling it a contender for my favourite game full stop. Whilst its age is shown in its graphics, it still holds a prime place in my heart after playing it over and over for many years, and it will continue to do so for the rest of my days.Obviously, the game isn't without its flaws. No game is. However, FFVII has few of them. The main flaw is its plot holes during some of the flashback sequences. However, these are mostly due to translation errors and censored content outside of Japan, so that's not really the game's fault. However, a vast majority of these relate more to the lore of the world rather than the events of this game in particular, and are explored in more detail throughout the other games in the FFVII collection. The very few that apply to this game in particular can be found within the game, but through optional quests, which isn't too bad. The other big flaw is the occasional use of compulsory, story related minigames that tend to break the pacing a bit. However, it could be much worse, as many games of the time were, when it comes to pacing, as a vast majority of the rest of the game deals with pacing in a relatively superior manner.Of course, to be a game that many gamers consider the most influential and most iconic JRPG of all time, as well as one of the top 3 PS1 games of all time (according to a poll that PlayStation ran, alongside Crash Bandicoot and Metal Gear Solid), it must do a lot of stuff right, right? That is indeed the case. Here's a list of things that are done really nicely.-Story - The story is among the best throughout all of gaming history. It's powerful, it's moving, it makes you think... You'll be hard-pushed to find a video game with a better story, even today.-The characters - The characters are amazing. The main party members are all likeable in their own way, and they are all relatable too. The bad guys are the kind of bad guys that people love to hate, which is why they are popular, and actually good villains. The chemistry between characters is well done too. -The music - FFVII has a phenomenal soundtrack. The music always matches the mood of the current location and event. The battle themes make the battles feel action packed, especially the boss themes which add tension to the fights. There are also multiple tunes in the game that are moving, and they are used to set the mood beautifully.-The gameplay - Unlike XIII, this Final Fantasy is not a corridor. Whilst it tells you where to go next, it doesn't force it upon you. It allows you to explore, finding new items and equipment, and even two extra characters. There are also numerous sidequests which you can do, should you fancy a break from the story. The battles are also fun. The battles are turn based, which some might consider a bad thing outside of Pokémon these days. However, in 1997, most RPGs were turn based, with FFVII being no exception, and FFVII has a really good battle system. It's also mildly customisable. You can make it easier and more casual by setting the game to wait for you to make your choices in your turns before attacking you, or you can make it harder by letting CPUs take their turns whilst you select, meaning you have to be faster in making your choices. As well as this, it has a wonderful ability system in the form of Materia, which allows you to customise your characters' abilities easily.Overall, this game is a masterpiece. This game proves that video games could be considered an art form when done well. With the remake around the corner, I highly recommend this masterpiece so you can see where the worldwide love for Final Fantasy VII first began. The remake will likely be an amazing game, but it won't necessarily have the charm that the original does. Play this game. If JRPGs, or story driven games in general, are your thing, I promise you that you will not be disappointed by this timeless classic.			"

FINAL FANTASY 7Reviewed by someone who's not a fanboyOpening Case:Starting about 2 years ago I decided to pickup and play every single main Final Fantasy games, I and II were lame, but cool as in: they laid the ground for other FF games, III introduced interesting mechanics, IV and V are really good even by today's standards and VI is one of the best games I've ever played, so I was a little skeptical about playing 7, I'm not much into the current/futuristic fantasy, the trend started with 7 and was only left out of 9 and 11 as far as I know, bias apart I was surprised with how many things 7 does right, changing the gameplay with minigames throughout the whole game, with a whole plaza full of them, they make a great change of pace from the repetitive gameplay, music is done spendidly with tracks ranging from smooth jazzy sounds of Midgar to hard rock battle and bosses themes.Well, that's good enough for an introduction, so here we go:Combat""But it's turned based, that's all I need to know"", says the one which all FF expiriences comes from X and on.Combat is always a big part of FF, with lots of equipment, weapons, magics, summons, skills and items. I hate to start off with a big let down however the combat is incredibly lackluster for most of the game, I got through CD1 and almost all CD2 only attacking and healing my party when battling random encounters(never needing to grind), most enemies are damage sponges, never representing any challenge at all, although that's not something I can say about the bosses, with a few exceptions every one got me exited and actually fighting against it, managing items, health, magic, summons, skills and everything that should be on most fights, even early bosses are fun to battle against using those damage items that are really crappy after 6 hours in the game; only by 2/3 og the game the battles start to become fun, by then you'll have the material necessary to battle against anything that isn't immune to stop, slow, and with your whole party on (cocaine and cannabis) haste and regen.I've got to talk a bit about summons one on one with you dear reader, they are so cool... the first two times you use them, most have a half-minute unskippeable cutscenes, and if you're up to do some good damage on bosses you'll be spamming these every big battle, and don't get me wrong the cutscenes are amazingly well made for the time, especially for the first time 3D final fantasy, but when your battle takes 13 minutes you watching the same summons only to die at the last hit and have to re-watch every single summon again is so infuriating.Graphics""But they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the same as the PS1 version, I'll wait for the awesome graphics from the remake"", Says the console peasant who is unaware of mods.Well, while it is true I can count the polygons on a model with my fingers I used a mod which changes every model to a hi-resolution with more polygons one, and I must give credit where credit is due, what an amazing job the folk that worked on The Reunion mod[forums.qhimm.com] did, here's what the game looks after the mod, there's more to the mod then just this, so I'll link the mod at the end of the reviewMinigamesThere's around 20 of these beautiful thingymajigs spreaded across the whole game, most of them are really fun and surprised me when I actually played a section that I thought it be only a FMV,  they all come with rewards depending on your performance at 'em, they provide a fun alternative to the rather repetitive gameplay.Music""The quality is awful, it's all compressed and is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to listen on my $800 razor headset"", and for that my reply is: FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE MAN, SHUT UP!Can't say much on the original soundtrack quality, but I'll be damned if not to say FF7 has one of the best soundtracks of any FF I've played, I'd say only losing to FF tactics advanced, to enjoy the whole thing at it's best quality I highly recommend(again) the The Reunion mod[forums.qhimm.com], to fully apreciate every track.Character Development""They're not even rea-"" ARGH! GET OUT!Look, here's where the game disappoints me the most, is the character development bad? No...Yes...Kind of(?), look, it really depends on who you refer to, Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and although short lived(*), Aerith's character arch are amazing, and they all are really well presented and developed, the rest of the crew really seems as if they're only there to be part of one or two importante dialogs and then thrown to the corner never to be used again, not even used on gameplay, as no character really is unique, everyone has the same basic attacks and the only difference between them is limit techniques, no one has an unique skill or ability, wich makes everyone the most blend combat characters, the good part is that one is blend and you can play with any party without having any downsides.(*)see what I did there? short lived hehe...Should you buy it? try FF 6, not the steam version, emulate it get it through legitimately means and if you really like it then I'd say yes.

												What can you say about Final Fantasy VII that hasn't already been said?  It's one of the best Final Fantasy games to date, which is easily said due to all of it's spinoffs like the absolutely thrilling Dirge of Cerbeus, the wonderful prequil Chrisis Core, and the ever popular movie Advent Children (just to name a few).That said, there are some good and bad with this Steam version of Final Fantasy VII, so lets get the list going;CONS:- Requires you to be online and sign in via Square Enix before playing.- Cloud saving is slow (2-5 min pause) and you can't Save/Load until it's ready.- No additional content added.- Subtitles have been censored, which actually removes a bit of character emotion.PROS:- Final Fantasy VII- Graphical Enhancements (allowing high resolutions).- Video and Overlayed characters are better synced.- Music has been updated (uses the higher-quality playstation audio tracks)- Subtitles have been ""repaired"" to remove ""engrish"" language.- Fully mapable keys & controller support.- Ability to disable cloud saving.So is the game something I would recommend?  Of course it is!  It's Final Fantasy 7 for cryin out loud!  But...  If you already own a copy of Final Fantasy VII on a console than there is no real reason to get this one.  There isn't any new content, just updating for modern PC technology.  That said, if you have the older PC version (and love it) then replacing it with this one might be a good idea.As far as the price, I don't actually believe this game is worth $17.  I'm willing to bet most individuals who are looking to purchase this game are doing so because they already have Final Fantasy VII and are simply looking to update it...  I purchased it during a 50% off sale for $8.49, which I consider a decent price.All in all I'm giving this a NOT recommended.  Shocked?  Well it's true that I love Final Fantasy VII but Square Enix screwed up with a few things.  First, this is a single-player only game so an internet account should NOT be a requirement.  Second, the regular price is a little high for a game that is almost 20 years old (no matter how good it is).  Third, the Cloud Save feature (which is the only real reason for being online) is so horribly slow you'd be better off going back to CD swapping.So as much as I'd love to give this a thumbs up, because I really love this game, I simply can't.

I played through the entire game in 2016, so my thoughts may be different from those who played it back in 1997 when it was first released+ The gameplay is great, and generally focuses on combat with an active time turn-based battle system. This system rewards you for thinking fast, while punishing you for taking too long to choose an attack.  The mechanics can get deep later in the game as you have many skills and items to sort through and use in time sensitive situations.+ A HUGE variety of very unique and interesting creatures throughout the entire game. Every area has new enemies to face which are almost entirely different from one another. This made the game very exciting as you never knew what to expect next.+ TONS of fantastic bosses to defeat which is where I personally had the most fun. Every boss is challenging, and you really have to prepare and devise a strategy for each one or you may find yourself overwhelmed. Every boss is also very interesting visually with some being absolutely ginourmous  in size.+ The ""Materia"" system is fantastic once you learn how to use it. Basically, every weapon and armor has a number of slots that can be filled with ""Materia"" which are basically skills. These skills can be leveled up indivually to increase their power and even linked together in chains with added benefits. You can remove materia and give them to other characters at any time without losing progress. This makes all characters able to play any role at any point in the game.+ You can summon a huge variety of creatures who all have their own epic cutscenes. They are all a lot of fun to watch and are rather strong to use.+ A LARGE amount of content! A full playthrough can easily take 35hours+ + Tons of unique environments, towns, and areas to explore. It will feel as if you are traveling the world meeting new people and cultures.+ Very mature themes and language througout the game that is borderline shocking to see in a video game. Things like suicide, domestic abuse, vulgur language, and a lot of death. In one part although not technically married, Cid treats a girl named Shera like complete crap and orders her around like she's lower than dirt, and in another part Cloud (under control by Sephiroth) beats the living hell out of Aeris+ Lots of interesting characters with unique personalities and backgrounds. + Many mini-game sections that dramatically change the gameplay. One part you are riding motorcycles trying to knock down enemies, another part you are racing chocobos, while another part you are snowboarding down  a mountain. There are many more, which do a nice job of breaking up the game and keeping things from getting monotonous.+ Great ending+ Loved the soundtrack. You will end up having some songs embedded into your brain.- The story was extremely confusing, vague, and a bit hard to follow at times. Near the end a lot of questions are cleared up, but you will be scratching your head throughout most of the game trying to figure out what is happening. Even at the end you will likely have a lot of questions...- The first part of the game (while you are in Midgar) is extremely slow-paced and boring in my opinion as it tries to introduce characters and the plot without much combat or action. Honestly, the game did not peak my interest until after leaving Midgar, when able to travel around the world.- This may just be a personal thing, but I had a hard time connecting to the characters. It may have just been because I'm used to voice-acted characters, and reading through dialogue was a bit dry. This especially held true for me with Aeris.- Throughout many sections of the game you will be forced to use other characters you don't use normally or have no desire in using. This wouldn't be bad in itself, but you are forced to spend a considerable amount of time removing and re-equipping materia and equipment.- The game does not hold your hand and it can be very difficult to figure out what to do, where to go, or how to progress. To avoid frustration I would say using a guide is almost mandatory.- This is a minor note, but there are addional sidequests and optional bosses you can complete near the end of the game. Unfortunetely, there are no save points leading up to the final battle / story ending so you can't go back to do these opional bosses afterward which can be annoying.			"

												I bought FF7 because I was a big fan of part 10 of the series and heard FF7 also competes for the best Final Fantasy. After 9 hours I just finished the intro and can freely move on the world map. The German localization does have 2-3 bad translations and I encountered a few book shelves whose description were still in English. Other than that the story is quite exciting so far, the combat system is easy to learn but takes time to master if you want to memorize how to counter each type of enemy best and how to develop your characters best, e.g. which spells to teach them.Overall, Final Fantasy 7 is a very good game and an absolute must if you like JRPGs, for other gamers I can still clearly recommend it.

												Awesome game loved it since the day it came out on Playstation. The game isn't the problem here. When I purchased and downloaded it there's a log in(yes LOG IN) screen I had to go through. You have to make a Square Enix account to play this game. Normally this is just an inconvenience. However, when I made my account the log in screen didn't accept it. That's right. The Square Enix log in screen for a Playstation game that came out nearly two decades ago did not accept my freshly made account. After numerous attempts and password resets, it finally let me in. After playing for several hours and taking a break, I come back to find out the Cloud Saves did not process. HOURS of gameplay gone. The Satanic login screen combined with the failing Cloud saves is enough for me to uninstall this game and just play it through an emulator, which looks just as good and works better.....with no LOGIN SCREEN!

												O.k I have to Review.I was almost hesitant to buy this because their are a lot of gamers on steam that worry the most about 1st world problems.I have played this game literally 12 hours straight, and had absolutley no problems. Nothing with sign in, no confusing controls, no problem with the server's or connection or whatever.The 12 hours I spent on this were straight nostalgic bliss.Every mission, every character, every inch of the gameplay is just as I remembered within FF7 from its original copy on PS.If you are hesitant because of all the negative reviews, don't listen to them at all.

												If you don't mind square enix forcing you to make an account with them and forcing you to accept that they will monitor you and make you take cookies every time you play this game, then this is the old classic for you!However if you don't like that companies can force you to give up your privacy and become their little b____, then i recommend you find something else.

												If you have the original CDs of the Playstation version, use them, because this PC version is bad as hell, terribly pixelated graphics, I will not install any crap from MODs to improve a game, it should come already perfect and not a garbage like this version, I totally regret having bought this game on Steam.

												I have barely made it halfway through the main campaign and I already have over 90HRS of playtime! This is an excellent title by Square Enix and in my personal opinion, one of the best Final Fantasy games I have ever played! To define and enhance the defition of a(n) RPG is what Square Enix set out to do in 1997 and not only did they succeed but they re-shaped the entire existence of a Role Playing Game! Getting into the actual gameplay of FF7 the charcters and world are designed in a blocky format however the worlds and characters are still quite detailed and an enjoyable sight.It's up to you whether or not you enjoy this element of the gameplay. The storyline is detailed and fits quite well into the previous and post franchise story line of the Final Fantasy franchise. As for the combat system it's a mix between turn-based and real-time-stratagy that combines all you may love or hate, tbh I would have preferred if it was one or the other for the combat but either way it's a simple system that i don't believe anyone can truely ""hate"". When it comes to negativity about the game there isn't much I can say however it gets quite grindy at certain parts of the story and if you're planning to enter the game blind then you should know that sometimes it leaves you with no idea of where to go and you may have to search for up to 1/2 an hour to check out every single place on the map you may need to go to.Personally I love the FF franchise and of course this game, therefore I would strongly advise you get the game and if you're sitting on a fence, check it out rather I hope this helps someone decide whether or not they should buy FFVII and thx for reading! :)			"

												SQEX's awful secondary DRM requires a security token from their servers (to play a 20 year old single player game). Wouldn't be a huge issue if their customer support actually worked.However, hugely nostalgic port for those who used to play, and if you're into old JRPGs, I strongly recommend this game. Login servers seem a bit shoddy sometimes, but other than that, I can't complain. Good controller support if your joystick/controller has similar mapping to a PSX.			"

												Simply my favourite game of all time... yet I still prefer playing the game on a PS1 emulator. Practically nothing that has been added to the game since 1997 has been an improvement. I guess it looks a little better, but that's it. The character boosters are a joke and the input method hasn't been updated at all, so using a controller is a mess of unclear configuration options and button prompts. Having to create a Square Enix account to play it almost feels insulting. If you have a PS4, get it on that instead. Not recommended.			"

												Greatest game of all time. I played it some when I was a kid but I just got it for steam a couple years ago and literally got hooked. I love this battle system, how I can relax and play this game while watching TV and don't really have to sit there steady pressing buttons. Summons are great. You unlock them as you progress and my favorite part is the different ways you can pair materia. You can put Quad Magic with Meteor 2 and use W-Magic to hit them with over 20 meteors, using MP Turbo on Meteor to make it do 9999 over 20 times. I'll play this game for the rest of my life			"

												This is the third time I've purchased this game. The first was for the original PSX, the second was the EIDOS PC port, and now I've got it on Steam.Why have I dumped so much money on this game? Because it's ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.+ Soap Opera plot, yes, but you can ignore it if it's too telanovella for your mood.+ Level up everything! EVERYTHING!+ Golden Saucer indulges gambling addiction nicely. Given that I was seven when I first completed this game, I probably HAVE a gambling addiction because of the Golden Saucer.+ Cait Sith!

												*SPOILER-FREE*so, this might be my favorite game of all time, if not its a definite contender for. the materia system is definately my favorite magic/skill mechanic of any game, although not everyone seems to like it: basically your magics level independently from the characters, and can be reassigned to different people on a whim (outside combat anyway). the story, oohh the plot... i heard once that they ran short on time, and ended up making a change to the plot so they could release the game on time (actually there is other evidence that the game was never actually finished, but ill come back to that later) and that plot change is, i think, the most critical thing that has made this game as great as it is. instead of following a more traditional storyline, something i think very cliche, as they origionally intended, they did something that, when playing it for the first time, my friends actually cried. had i not been watching them i would have too. im trying REALLY hard not to spoil anything, so ill end with previously mentioned evidence of it being unfinished: there are 3 elements that dont have a magic/materia for players, but enemies can do some of them, debug room contains 3 blank materia, magic labels are things like fire2, cure3 instead of thier traditional fira, curage, etc. and some other stuff in the debug room that i cant remember.

												Note: Look up the Xbox 360 controller fix if you're planning on using an Xbox 360 controller to play this game.I wanna start by saying that I have zero nostalgia for Final Fantasy. The only game I had played was Final Fantasy 1 and I never finished it.I was skeptical about the ""turn-based"" combat as I was pretty burned out on that kind of gameplay from playing too much Pokemon as a kid, however I decided to try it out after my brother recommended it to me and now I can easily say that this is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Right from the start I was hooked on this game; The music complements the gameplay and narrative masterfully, almost everything in this game feels truly epic. There were many times where I would stop for a moment and appreciate how good this game actually is, and slowly I started realising that I was truly playing one of the best games ever made. I won't talk about the story because I don't want to spoil anything (you should go into this game knowing as little as possible) but the story and world-building is phenomenal and had me hooked right from the get-go. I am aware that Final Fantasy VII does receive a massive amount of praise and that might make people think that it is due to nostalgia, but as someone who only just finished this game a couple of days ago for the first time ever, I can garantee that it really is a good as people say. I honestly cannot stop thinking about it even after having finished it, it is a beautiful game and I think everyone should experience it.			"

												This is a good game. Even though some parts of it are confusing and sad, it still is good. You do have to make a Square Enix account for a 1997 singleplayer game, but that's really the only bad thing. If you want the graphics to be better, then buy the upcoming remake or just install mods to make the game look better. The game can also be frustrating at times, but you'll eventually get past what you're stuck on. I recommend to buy this game if you haven't yet. The music is also great. So, go ahead and buy this (on a sale if you don't want to pay the $12)!			"

												I'm a new comer who wanted a amazing rpg game to play I've played a bit of fallout 1 and 2 and love both of the those games but I wanted something a bit more exciting so I ran into this game my friend said he's loves it on his phone and says I should get it. So I asked around a bit more people tellling me stuff like ""buy it now you wont regret it"" and you what they were right I played this before i went to bed for 4 hours and had a awesome experience the game has great characters , great dialog , Really fun monsters to fight. It sadins me that I didn't own a playstation back then to play this game it could have been special to me. But even i just got it Its already special to me. Go now and buy and have a wonder ful time like i did great game on the winter sale.Oh you may be wondering how's the steam port well it has better resoulotion ,slighty better graphics (you can switch back to old graphics) , and the best one is it plays at the same fps as it would on the playstation.My only conplaint is there are black lines on the sides but they probaly could not have fixed that.Anyway if you do get the game i hope you enjoy it as much as i am and have a merry christmas :)			"

												One factor that everybody fails to mention in their review, is the fact that once you finaly register with Square Enix you can't log in to the game till you have link steam to your new profile on the Square Enix website. Once this is done you don't have to worry about the log in at the start of Final Fantasy VII ever again. For those that are queries, just follow these simple steps.;1.) once you have finaly gotten your e-mail verify2.) while logged in on Square Enix's website click on your account name in the top right corner 3.) choose User Settings4.) click on Link Account5.) click on the link button next to steam6.)

												Final Fantasy VII is one of those games that everyone knows. It was revolutionary when it first came out for the PS1, and was one of the best selling games of 1997. The PC port is amazing. The original soundtrack was replaced with a newer soundtrack, and the graphics were also dramatically improved. I, personally, did not enjoy the music that was put into the PC port of this. However, with the aid of mods, I was able to replace the PC soundtrack with the classic PS1 soundtrack.  The PC port also offers 3 different graphics choices, depending on the preferences of the user. The user can choose between the PS1 graphics, or the PC graphics, as well as a mod that gives combat 3D graphics. One downside of this game, is the fact that you have to create a Square Enix account to play. This was a disappointment for me, but not enough to keep me from playing it. Aside from the technical aspects of this game, the gameplay is amazing. This is by far, the best game I have ever owned, because of the great story, the great soundtrack, the amazing combat, and the replayability. After spending over 500 hours on this game over three different game systems, I won't be stopping any time soon. I highly recommend FFVII, and honestly, this game is worth much more than $11.99.

												Maybe it's just the time that I live in. The game's good and the music's cool and everything, but... Did people really care that much for these emotionless-looking blocks of people that consisted of two 3D polygons? Also the backgrounds are in really bad resolution and the game feels pretty slow... Especially in battles where there actually appears to be lag! Was this seriously  what the original game was like?!Look, being faithful to the original release of a game is good. I love originals more than remakes most of the time! But there are some games that are better when they're remade, such as Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. I think Final Fantasy 7 should have an HD version by now or something? I don't know, but this original PS1 version here just isn't drawing me in as much as I thought it would. It's NOT keeping my attention... Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance? Still...EDIT: ARG! How could I forget that whole... What do you call it? DRM? Why would you do that for a game that supports no multiplayer in anyway?! And don't give me an argument involving updates... That's Steam's deal, not yours Square Enix! People hated the Xbone for pulling the very stunt you're trying to pull on me now! I have half a mind to rush over to your site and delete my account because I don't want to ever support that!!Not only that, but I hear bad rumors... Apparently the music I'm hearing is actually a low-quality version of the original? For real? Is this fixed or now? As a newbie I can't tell. But based on how you later treated FF8's Steam release... I'm starting to get the sense that I should never trust you, Square Enix.I mean, I was dissatisfied with the game already when I thought I was playing the original game! Now that I am hearing these rumors and have been reminded of this DRM horror... Which I feel SUCKERED into...What happened? Why are you doing this? I thought you were supposed to be one of the top game companies around! Don't tell me you're getting greedy and selfish too, like Microsoft is becoming and Capcom is (I hope) recovering from.

												We are all pretty aware that this is one of the best games ever to be released and its quality is hard to match. However, playing the steam version sometimes involves a certain degree of frustration due to the occasional crashes and bugs. I have had to use the cmd quite a few times to exit the game because of a bug that does not even allow you to properly close the application.The game itself is quite well done and the remade graphics are noticeable. I am hellbent on the idea that the game will forever stay as one of the most prominent examples of how to effectively make an RPG: its plot will make you laugh, make you cry and will give you the goosebumps too, all of this while you enjoy the work of one of the most outstanding maestros of videogame score design.All in all, a game you will not soon forget about.

												Before you vote this review unhelpful solely due to the thumbs down, please read this: I recommend Final Fantasy VII! I highly recommend it. It's one of my favorite games of all-time. However, I do NOT recommend that anyone play this port! Please read on for details...Final Fantasy VII is acclaimed as one of the high-water marks of the role-playing genre. Many gamers, particularly RPG fans, have played through this game not once but a multitude of times. I downloaded the new Steam version and played through it one more time on my PC to assess how the game has aged.The very first thing that I noticed about the game was the chasm between how well the audio design and soundtrack have aged versus how poorly the graphics have. It becomes clearly apparent that sprites have aged far better than polygonal characters when comparing this game to an older, sprite-based games in the series such as Final Fantasy VI. Sprites carried a certain charm to them, and remain tolerable despite their lack of beauty. Polygons, for lack of a better description, just look strange and ugly. Their blockiness represents a human character far more poorly than even a sprite can. To compare it to Hollywood, sprites are like Disney cartoon of the '70s, while polygons are like the bad special effects of the '80s. The audio, however, has aged gracefully. Nobuo Uematsu's score has always been perfect for the game, and I remembered how fond I was of it the first time around immediately upon starting the game again.Final Fantasy VII, to me, was the beginning of Square's ""hit-or-miss"" character design specifically regarding western gamers. As a western gamer, I just can't see the appeal in a character like Cait Sith. While the majority of the characters still have good levels of depth and development, Cait Sith is a worthless entity who brings absolutely nothing to the game. He's a quirky stuffed toy injected into the game to please a culture that I just can't understand. Square Enix has continued down this path even further in future games, particularly in Final Fantasy XII, which saw two cherubic children as the main protagonists. Yuck. But there are some game-savers here. Cloud is such a deep and human character that it's worth playing through the game just to witness his growth. Sephiroth's villainy hasn't shown age, either. He's still one of the best gaming villains in history, a title well earned.It's obvious what to expect from the gameplay. This game is purely old school JRPG. It doesn't bother me, as it's a type of game that I once had a huge affinity for. I can jump back into the more slowly-paced, active turn-based battle systems any time and still enjoy it. To others, it may be a bit more tedious. This is especially true regarding random battles. As an old-school JRPG player, random battles are familiar to me and sort of a necessary evil. To others, the tedium may be intolerable. It's difficult for me to be objective enough to say.I've always loved the materia system. It's my favorite form of character development in any Final Fantasy game, and it holds up. Growing your materia through the management of your weapons is so much fun, and the high-level materia such as Slash-All and Double Cut really make you feel all-powerful toward the end portion of the game..The main complaint that I have about the game is an issue that never seemed to bother me before. The control of Cloud through the various pre-rendered areas is absolutely atrocious. Pressing up on the directional pad will sometimes cause him to go left or right, and pressing right or left on the pad will sometimes cause him to go down. There's no clear indication of when this will happen -- It's unique to each area. This becomes particularly annoying in areas where random battles occur. Very often I'd find myself doubling back due to this, and fighting far more random battles than I actually had to.I wouldn't be able to conclude this without mentioning the cutscenes and minigames. The idea of rewarding players with a CGI cutscene during certain parts of the game was a fresh, new concept at the time of the game's release. Seeing the devs at Square flaunt their graphical prowess was mind-blowing, and the cutscenes were unlike anything in video games at the time. They truly were rewarding, and I remember being so impressed as a 12-year old first playing this game that I recorded them on a VHS tape for later playback. The minigames were also groundbreaking, but have aged poorly. Bad control plagues many of them, specifically the motorcycle and snowboarding games. But the inclusion of these changed the genre for years; the lack of minigames in a post-Final Fantasy VII JRPG would be a strange omission for a later title.Final Fantasy VII has got its problems. In some cases, it's aged beautifully and become the historically powerful title that gamers expected it to be upon its release. Final Fantasy VII brought RPGs as a whole into the mainstream. Without Final Fantasy VII, games like Mass Effect 2 and Fallout 3 may never have been developed at all. The graphics and control, however, will be nearly unbearable to any gamer going back in time to play this game for the first time.As far as the Steam specific port that I'm reviewing here? Unfortunately... It's total trashEvery resolution that isn't 640x480 windowed looks terrible. They've upped the resolution on the characters and NPCs, but the pre-rendered backgrounds are the same so they look awful in any other resolution. And don't even think about going to 16:9. All it does is stretch the picture to fit the screen. Barf.There's also a persistent black bar along the bottom of the screen that is only ever filled in when accessing the menu. Imagine you're watching a film in letterbox, except that there's only one black bar on the bottom of the screen and no matching bar on the top. Just awful.On top of the graphical issues, Square's ridiculous DRM is present. You must log into Square Enix when you first start the game. People already hate Uplay. Why would Square do this? It's an idiotic move.I'm a die-hard PC gamer, but even I have to say that the best way to play this game in the modern day is to download the PSone port from the Playstation Store and play it on a PSP or a Vita. I wouldn't recommend the PC port to anybody that isn't looking to modify it heavily, as mods are basically the only reason to purchase the PC rerelease.People have also mentioned the music quality being subpar compared to the PS1 version, but it honestly didn't affects my experience at all. I've played through the game probably a dozen times since 1997 at this point, and while I definitely noticed the music being different, it didn't seem any worse than the original game.In conclusion, this game still remains a must-play for anyone who liked the original or any gamer looking for a history lesson. Like an old painting, Final Fantasy VII continues to be historically relevant and is worth seeing and experiencing if only to recognize the influence it had on present day gaming. But the paint has aged, and the artwork is unfortunately not quite as vibrant and stunning as it once was.Just don't play the newly released PC port. It's a bad.			"

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANA English:Where do i start? You're going to jump in a long and fantastic adventure, in a fantasy world, populated by crazy creatures and wonderful, charismatic and lovable characters. Be aware though, ""fantasy world"" doesen't necessarily means ""perfect, colored and happy"". No. In this world there are death, pain, depression, corruption, broken hearts and broken dreams, avarice, homicide... This list could continue. Yes, you live in this kind of world, but you don't care at all, you're interested only in your profit. Oh, but things will change. Soon you'll rediscover emotions, passion, you'll rediscover life. You'll rediscover details of your life that will remember you that you used to be real. You used to be alive. And you can be once again. Learning the values of llove, friendship, sacrifice. When you will be called, along with your bizarre, imperfect but tight-knit group to save humanity. If this isn't enough, you got a serious problem. I shouldn't even talk about graphics or gameplay, here they doesen't count. But some people is just obsessed, so... It's a classic turn based RPG well structured, with an open world exploration outside the battles. The graphics are not new, but is remastered, pleasant for the eyes compared to the PS1 version. The difficulty is hard, the asked efforts are many. Is this not enough? Come back to Call Of Duty then. This game is effort. This game is emotion. This game is life.                     (Sorry for my bad english.)Italiano:Da dove comincio? Stai per tuffarti in una lunga e fantastica avventura in un mondo di fantasia, popolato da creature pazzesche e personaggi stupendi, carismatici amabili e ben caratterizzati. Ma attenzione, ""mondo di fantasia"" non significa necessariamente che sia un mondo perfetto, felice e colorato. No. In questo mondo esistono morte, dolore, depressione, corruzione, sogni e cuori infranti, avarizia, omicidio... La lista continuerebbe ancora. Si, tu vivi in questo tipo di mondo, ma non ti interessa particolarmente, sei interessato solo al tuo tornaconto. Oh, ma le cose cambieranno. Ben presto riscoprirai le emozioni, la passione, riscoprirai la vita. Riscoprirai particolari della tua esistenza che ti ricorderanno che una volta eri vero, una volta eri vivo. E puoi esserlo ancora. Imparando i valori dell'amore, dell'amicizia, dell sacrificio.  Quando verrai chiamato, assieme al tuo bizzarro, imperfetto, ma affiatato gruppo a salvare l'umanità. Se questo non è abbastanza, hai un serio problema. Non ci dovrebbe essere nemmeno bisogno di parlare di gameplay e grafica, qui non contano. Ma certa gente è ossessionata da cose del genere, dunque vi accontento. Il gameplay è il classico RPG a turni ben strutturato, con esplorazione open world fuori dalle battaglie. La grafica non è moderna, ma è rimasterizzata, resa piacevole agli occhi rispetto a quella per PS1. La difficoltà è alta, l'impegno richiesto è molto. Non basta ancora? Allora torna pure a giocare a Call Of Duty. Questo gioco è impegno. Questo gioco è emozione. Questo gioco è vita.			"

												If you want to see one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series' history, you need to own this one.It is without doubt the best ever.The graphics, although old-style, are still gorgeous.What sets this one apart is the rich storyline and the amount of time the game holds for you.Forget trying to complete it fast and just go along with it instead.

												There is a reason many people consider this game to be one of the best games ever made is because of the gameplay and story. Final Fantasy VII starts the player off in Midgar, a city that uses the Planet's energy to use everyday tools such as electricity. A terrorist group called AVALANCHE plan on destroying the complany thats pretty much in charge of the world, Shinra Inc. Now what does this have to do with ur character? Well Cloud used to work for the company as a First Class SOLDIER but he eventually left and is now fighting with AVALANCHE to destroy Shinra. There is another plot in the story besides taking down Shinra which is killing Sephiroth. Im gonna let the players discover how big of a role almost every character is in this game no, series. Final Fantasy VII's story is so big and explained that there are 3 parts of it. Crisis Core is before the events of Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children which is a movie which takes place 2 years after Final Fantasy VII.The presentation is simply amazing. Even though this game was first made on the Playstation 1 in 1997, the graphics still look amazing to this day. Almost everything is hand drawn such as the background but when ur enterting a train for example, the whole screen changes just to make the train move and than go back to the hand drawn background. The only reason y every character is almost entirely made out of polygons is because of the size of the game. For those who dont know, This game came with 3 discs on the PS1 so it makes sense for characters to be polygons. The gameplay is awesome and theres 2 types of it. The first type of gaming is just roaming around in the world map and through villages/towns. The second type is the Role playing. You must wait till ur time gauge fills up in order to choose wat to attack. There are diffrent kinds of magic in this game and when you level up ur materia (items to improve ur characters) u may get increased damage as well as new spells such as using Cure3 when leveling up ur materia. You not only earn EXP but u also earn AP for materia. There are also Summons in the game like in almost every Final Fantasy game. Even though u ccant skip any cutscenes of summon cutscenes, its always nice to watch some animations such as Knights of the Round (Best Summon) and Bahamut ZERO's cutscenes.I give this game a 10 out of 10 because even though this may not be acceptable graphics for this generation (2015). it still shows that u can break the limits of a PS1 by simply using more discs.

												Chances are you already know what this game is and what most people think about it. If you're reading this to find out if the PC port is worth playing, then simply, yes it is. I heard people complain about the DRM and Square Enix account nonsense before buying it and all you have to do is make a Square Enix account through the game launcher one time and then it'll just auto log you in every time.I heard people complain about the music problems, well thankfully they patched out the terrible midi music and put back in the original soundtrack that people remember from the PS1 so that's no longer an issue.The graphics are improved from the playstation original, they've been upscaled and look noticeably better to where this is a preferrable version to the ps1 original. There's also no compatability issues like there was in the original pc port.If you have never played this game before, buy it, it's one of if not the best JRPG of all time, and unlike later Final Fantasy games the story doesn't completely fall apart when you look through it critically.

												Final Fantasy VII - The game that defined an era.One of the greatest games, arguably on any console from any time. Final Fantasy VII is another epic installment from the Final Fantasy franchise, which needs no introduction. Released well over a decade ago, Final Fantasy VII still lives on in the memories of almost every RPG fan. Wether you played it when it was first released, or you are just trying it for the first time today, be prepared for a journey like no other. Join Cloud Strife, a seemingly selfish, arrogant mercenary as he fights at first for himself, but as the story progresses, maybe there is more to Cloud than you might think.With an entire host of unforgettable characters, journey through a mass world, visiting huge cities, quiet coastal towns, beach resorts and much more, all backed with an incredible soundtrack by the legendary Nobuo Uematsu, this is a game that will not let you down, not the first time, not the tenth time. Final Fantasy VII truely is, one of a kind.			"

Don't waste your time or money on FF Online MMORPG crap or the recent FF games. THIS is the game you should be playing first.

												I know the actual game-play of this game is good, because I own the game on the PlayStation. I bought this PC game to  support the future development of Final Fantasy games on the PC platform, however if this is the way Square Enix plans to treat the PC platform they just shouldn't support it at all.I was aware of the DRM when buying. Having a single Square account seemed easy enough to handle and I was craving some nostalgia. So I created a Square account, but apparently it takes a while for the game to register an account creation because it didn't immediately register that my account was valid. I tried logging in on the opening screen for thirty minutes to no avail, but when I came back two hours later Square was finally ready to let me play my game. But when I started playing, I found myself in a fresh new nightmare.The controls are atrocious with a keyboard. To keep things short, in order to interact with people, doors, and items in the game the character must be facing the object. The buttons are too sensitive and if I don't take my fingers off the movement keys at exactly the same time the character moves to face which ever key I take my finger off last, even if it's last by less than a millisecond, making the character turn in a direction the item is not in. It is infuriating to try to talk to people or open doors because of this sensitivity. I found my self trying many times just to interact with characters.In order to not deal with this issue, I tried plugging in a controller- and the controller just as bad as the keyboard; the only way to move a character using a 360 controller is with the joy stick, the game IGNORES the directional pads altogether. It feels so wrong using the joystick in this game. Complaining about feeling may be nit-picky to some, but after spending so much time playing the original FFVII using the directional pad and playing all the other FF games using a directional pad, I have the question why Square willfully made this game ignore them. The PS3 and PSP versions of this game do not force players to use the joysticks, why do PC players, who normally enjoy the freedom of choice, get the short end of the stick with this game? I bought the game for nostalgia, and without good controls there is definitely no nostalgia.At every turn, even from first booting it up, it seems Square Enix did not want me to play the game. So I have not played this game. I'll probably come back to it when I'm less infuriated, but ,if you buy it, do know this game comes with issues that Square Enix willfully put in the game.			"

												Oh well...here goes the two cents from someone who didn't play it when it was originally released by the PSX, and for how long have I regretted it. Finally, Square gave us the pleasure of delivering it to Steam and despite some of the aspects of the game haven't actually aged that well (the first 10hrs of gameplay or so do get a bit tedious) the fun suddenly snowballs and I've ended up enjoying this game a lot. It certainly lived up to the expectations I had on it and that's saying a lot.The active turn battle and the Materia system open the field for a lot of variations in your strategy, which you will have to adjust to each boss (until you get a certain Summon who is just plain broken -you know who I'm talking about-).The story of the game is certainly a thumbs up, there's a large enough variety of playable characters that you can follow up their stories and see how they grow and change without it being too tedious.Superbosses make for an incredible challenge in this game and you'll have to do your grinding before facing them and getting obliterated (yup, even with that certain broken Summon we were talking about before). If there is one thing that outweights the tedious task of grinding to defeat the bosses is the great satisfaction that such an achievement leaves behind.Be sure to play it. This will prove to be a formidable experience for almost any gamer who is ready to invest some time.9/10			"

												One of my favorite games of all time. Something about this game just draws you right into it. I never liked the Final Fantasy series as a kid and didn't find the appeal but one of my friends persuaded me to try FF7, and I reluctantly did, but never regretted it. Don't be fooled, even though this game is nearly 20 years old now, it is huge and has tons of content. There's a reason it took 3 discs on the original Playstation version.All of the main characters draw their own unique story and make you want to help their cause. The game starts out slow and easy, at first I didn't think it was going to be good, but once you get out of the starting area and unlock the world map, you'll quickly find why this game is so good. The areas, characters, and soundtrack all work together in a perfect way to deliver a very impactful story.As for the graphics and other technical details of the game, you have to remember that this game came out in 1997. Keeping that in mind, this game still looks and sounds amazing. The port to PC works great and has never crashed on me or had any issues. I do recommend a controller as that's just how the game was designed to be played, but even with a keyboard and mouse you can complete everything just fine. Using a controller adds to the nostalgic and original feel of the game, which boosts the experience though.100% recommended to anyone who is into old or classic games and like RPGs or to anyone who likes the other games in the Final Fantasy series. The story does not have any stale points and keeps you wanting to complete it all the way through! If you're planning to get the remake for Playstation 4, I recommend trying the original before or after you play that one so you can get a better feel for what FF7 is about.			"

												I remember playing this years ago on my PS2 system, this game has best story i've ever seen in a game, and background music really draws you into the game, Once i started playing the game i could not stop at all and i kept playing until i 100% EVERYTHING.  I'm so very happy to see this game released on steam with new achievements, character boosters and more to keep the game going, but the main thing i do not like about it, is that the steam version has the horrible remixed midi music from the 1998 PC version and the DRM sucks so badly, other then that i heavily recommend this game, also i'm stuck playing it again non-stop LOL.UPDATE: Square relased an update that removed the horrible crappy midi music files and replaced them with the original PS1 music, now the game sounds much better and the battles and boss fights will be even more epic.

												Final Fantasy VII is, in my opinion, the best of it's kind - crushing new games like Final Fantasy X easily. If you are capable to accept the simple graphics, you should really consider to play this game. In my opinion it has by far the best in-game and battle-system, giving the player the chance to find secrets and giving him the chance to obtain Bestias (powerful summonings which the heroes can summon at a certain state in the game) which are hidden somewhere in the game. Even though it's really old, it tried to do some easy render-sequences and if you want to the graphics are, with some know-how and troubleshooting, fully modable (be careful with spoilers while doing so). You should really try to play it some time, it served me well in 1997 aswell as now!			"

												The pinnacle of JRPGs for many players, this game has aged like wine in many regards and like milk in others.The graphics have aged poorly, and the early-PS1 blockiness and untextured polygons of the characters may turn off some people, though they are charming in their own way. The pre-rendered backgrounds still look decent, and battle models are much less blocky than their overworld counterparts.The story has aged very well, and provides a strong narrative with many emotional moments and memorable locales, and all of the main characters have strong character arcs and growth throughout the story, even if they are not in the forefront at times.The battle system is good, never feeling too frantic or too slow, and abilities and strides a nice line between turn-based and real-time. Difficulty is pretty well-tuned throughout the game, there were not many situations where it felt that grinding levels and equipment was necessary (Although if one wants to take on some of the post-game optional bosses, they will need to grind quite a bit).The soundtrack is immaculate, and almost every track in the game is memorable in their own way.

												A timeless classic RPG that has been loved by many people since the original release. I remember playing this game every few years never quite managing to fully complete it and now I begin again with the hope of an eventual completion that will make life worth living.The game runs fine apart from the occasional crashes though it only tends to happen when the game is minimized and this is easily avoidable. The steam achievements give an additional gameplay factor to help spurn on the dedicated player, though it would be nice to have a few more that are inventive and challenging rather than requiring a mass grind session (Of which we tend to do already) or perusing youtube/guide sites in order to find glitches and bugs to aid in the completion from almost twenty years of playing.I would recommend this game to all generations, as a long time fan of the final fantasy series (Waning in recent years due to the class of game they have released). I will rack up the hours gladly and not be disappointed that my life accomplishments end here.			"

												Do you really not know this game? Seriously, do I even have to write this? I want to note, that this was the first game I played when I upgraded from a Genesis to a PS1. I had never played an RPG before. This game introduced me to video games with true stories, even if the story is pure insanity. That said, instead of listing why it is awesome, I'm gonna tell you all the things that I know suck about it. Also note, I recommend it. I own it on PS1, PC hardcopy, and on Steam, so I want you to buy it.1. The graphics. Holy ♥♥♥♥ are they awful. Like seriously, so blocky and distracting and if I didn't love it so much I wouldn't even be able to play it and get past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics.2. Summons are so ♥♥♥♥ing long! They are beautiful, yes, even with ♥♥♥♥ graphics, but they get real tiresome after the 75th Knights of the Round.3. As previously mentioned, the story makes zero sense. Yes, in broad strokes, there's supposed to be a pattern and such, but as you get to the details it is nonsensical. Yeah, the death scene was tragic and yeah I cried, ♥♥♥♥ you I was young and had no idea and had raised that character as one of my powerhouses, but despite that the rest is just crap. Also that death still seems to have no reason behind it.4. Angst. so much angst! So much sad drama angst. Am I who I think I am? Are any of us truly human? Just... let me hit things with my giant phallic sword.There's more, but I'll stop there. So yeah, buy the game. You'll still love it.The Nostalgia is strong in this one.			"

												Dear Gamers, welcome to...« FINAL FANTASY VII »A few weeks ago, after doing my first trial on Final Fantasy 7,I though this game was crap. I even did a « downvote » evaluation.Alright, I knew that I would try to game more and that I might like itand would change my evaluation (actually, I really did one but Itrolled a bit on it. oAo Kinda. Was more like frustrated xD)Basically, Final Fantasy VII is a wonderful game. You might get lost in the beginning and hate the game (total beginning), but keep playing.Trust me, you will thank me later.The story is amazing, the game is pretty long itself. They were many questsnext to it, even though the game is from 1997.Most of players, when they first played the game, got lost. They did not know what was going on in that kind of uggly Factory area.But the game will explain you what was up at this time, a bit later.The fighting gameplay is awesome and kind of original, for a old RPG game kind!The game has some glitches that makes the game unique.I really hope that, in the FF7 remake, they would put the ""duplicate item"" glitch system back.It's one of the main reason of why players love this game. xDAnd you know what !?After doing the game, SquareEnix offers you an awesome and beautiful movie named « Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children » which is the following of the Story.Wonderful movie look for a 2004~2007 movie made.The only one thing I regret about that movie is the Kid voice acting.Like in many movies but oh well! I'm getting out of the topic.Please, buy FF7, enjoy every minutes out of it. Even the most annoying minutes. There is so much to do.Story, fights, chasing materias, growing chocobos, playing in Gold-Saucer, improving your character, hunting Achievements.Unlike my first evaluation, I do recommend you this game.Peace! ♥			"

												Final Fantasy 7.Possibly the most Iconic Video Game that SquareSoft/Square Enix has ever made. And for good reason.Final Fantasy 7, although the graphics compared with today's games are completely rubbish, however back in 1997 these graphics were top of the line. The cutscenes amazed fans and enticed them.Final Fantasy 7 has a great, gripping storyline, Filled with humor, horror and of course sadness which anyone who knows anything about Final Fantasy surely heard of the tragedy that happened with one of the main characters. Not only does it have a great storyline but it has one of the most iconic and loved antagonists, ""Sephiroth"", much more then just a ""Mummies boy"" as many fans and haters stated, he has one of the best battle themes and of course best Limit Break, ""SuperNova"".Final Fantasy 7 has a excellent soundtrack composed mainly by Nobuo Uematsu but the PC Version was given, poor horrible MIDI formats. Luckily Square Enix upgraded them but it isn't the same as the original PSX version.Not only is the main quest great but it also has a brilliant side quests and entertainment. You can learn the history of the playable characters during Disc 2/Disc 3 and you can spend your hard earned Gill at the Gold Saucer, betting on Chocobo Races, Smashing SOLDIER off bikes or just slide down a snowy slope on a snowboard some idiot kid gave you.Storyline: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Music: 6/10Side Quests: 10/10Addictivity: 9/10Overall, great value for money. And is definitely one of or THE best RPG game ever made. No wonder fans all around the world still want a PS3 / PS4 Remake. I know I do!			"

												FFVII is an absolute smasher of a game.  Part of that for me is nostalgia but the other part is that when you get down to it this is probably the series at its best.  The magic system is flexible, summons are not broken, the characters are more interesting than in other installments...they just really nailed it.  I remember getting this game for Christmas when I was in my early teens and spending most of my winter break absolutely glued to it.  Having played through it a bunch of times over the last 20 years I must concede that it's one which I feel like ""I wanna play that game again!"" and then find myself saving at the same spot and not picking it up again for a long time because I feel like the beginning of the game drags a lot (pun referencing an early plot point not intentional).However, when the timing is right and I can get into actually going beyond Midgar I get sucked in big time.  Without exaggerating at all I will confess that within the past few years I have completed the game three times and in each of those playthroughs I would sit and play the game for a week straight, putting more hours into it than my full time job.  This game is that good, and it is seriously worth your time if you like RPGs.  There's damn good reason that this is a legendary chapter in the genre with its name spoken with the same reverence of titles like Lunar.			"

												It's Final Fantasy VII.  It looks terrible but is still one of the best JRPG experiences there is.  Very typical JRPG story, you and your rag tag team of people you met along the way are gonna take down a being of unmeasurable power and save the world. There's cool summons that take to damn long to do what you want them to do, great cut scenes that make you forget how ugly the rest of the game is, cool weapons and characters to go along with great cities and locations. If its a big long confusing story that makes you feel good when reach the end of it, then FF VII may be what you are looking for in a game.			"

												I was one of those people who actively hated Final Fantasy 7 back in the day thinking that it was just all unnecessary hype (I'm more of an FF6 kind of guy). Having played it now, though, I can see the source of praise. This is a great FF to start with, but it has some problems that make it feel rather dated even more so than the GBA ports of the first handful of games.The story is great and the characters are all well-rounded and interesting and you actually feel for them. Kind of hard to do seeing as the dialog is very dated in terms of translation, but they're just that well-written, I think. And I think that's it's primary selling point -- the story. It's a fun time capsule for what it's worth and it stands up to the going version of FF6 at the time in terms of character and story and it might even be a bit better in some respects given that it has fewer characters, meaning more time to bond with each of them instead of having only one feature per character to go through an arc with like it's done in FF6.That said, I think that the controls and balancing are VERY dated. Command inputs are rather clunky when compared to other FF of the era (glad they fixed this with FF9). Accidentally targeting your ally with an offensive spell just because they walked up to an enemy or healing an enemy because they walked up to an ally is annoying and I wish that Sqaure hadn't experimented with the targeting system the way they did. The menu overlay in-battle as well as navigating through the Materia menu may take a bit of getting used to especially if you forget there's a [SWITCH] command on the button layout.Graphics, while great for their time, are rather dated seeing them in HD. The HD character polygons don't blend as well against pre-rendered low resolution backgrounds and it breaks the immersion a bit and makes things look more dated than they should. I think I'll give the graphics settings a few more tries to get it to emulate the old CRT-TV graphics on the PS1 as close as possible.			"

												Played this back on the ps1, one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.  Has a few bugs and some glitches, i cant remember where in the game, but they are easily bypassed.  Other than the few bugs, fantastic port, great game, brings back all the great memories from the original game on ps1.  This game also has a a massive amount of save blocks (unlock final fantasy 4) so you can save your game at all the cool parts in the game.  If you dont know the game, the story is detailed, the characters are awesome, and the game has tons of extras throughout the game.  The materia and limit break system takes a bit to get used to if you have never played this but its not difficult.  The game also has a feature to turn on max levels if you dont want to grind and work the trenches.  The game is not HD remastered, it is pretty much exactly the same port as the PS1 version, we are still waiting on that from squaresoft.  Considering this was made in 1997, its very impressive.  It is worth nothing that skill wise many of the characters are the same.  It is not like ff4 with a specific dragoon or ninja, or ff6 with a specific thief, or a specific martial artists.  The characters are differrent in look, have different weapons and limits, but they all have access to the same materia.  It would have been cool to have unique skills for each character to really set them apart not just from the story and visual, but in battle as well.			"

												A popular opinion among many, but FF7 is my favorite game of all time. Not just because of nostalgia, but because it is an incredible experience. While it has not aged well graphically, the story, soundtrack, and characters still stand tall. Fighting the Ruby and Emerald Weapons still has me mashing the O button hoping I don't get obliterated. The final fight between Cloud and Sephiroth still pumps me up as Cloud shreds him apart with Omnislash. The loss of arguably the most beloved character of all time still brings a tear to my eye. Hell, I will still attempt to bring Aerith back, knowing in the back of my head it's not possible, or I will try to get that mysterious chocobo the runs underwater or even outerspace knowing no such thing exists. Call me biased if you will but this game is a must play! Infinity/100 greatest game ever! "

												Though I have not beaten the game on pc, I have beaten it and played it to its fullest hundreds of times on its original platform and to say the least: A complete Masterpiece.

												Final Fantasy VII is the first game I played on the original PSX back in 97. I was 10 at the time and the most advanced game I'd played until that point was Sonic ;) FFVII opened up an entire new world for me, showing what video games can and should be. With a story better than any film, that is both tragic and at times wonderfully frivolous and off the wall, the emotional dynamism of this game makes it an all time classic. It changed my life in more than one way - Nobuo Uematsu's timeless score, with it's clever variations on the main theme, was my inspiration to follow a career in music.I've finished the game at least 20 times in almost as many years, and every time I look at the game in a different way. It is as relevant emotionally and politically now as it ever was. If you've never played it before, it's not too late. And if you have, then seeing it spruced up is a great experience. Could Squeenix have tried harder to make this a more unique experience? Absolutely. Is the DRM a nuisance? Some say it is - I haven't had a problem yet but I do fundamentally have a problem with the idea of DRM. So Squeenix definitely lose points for that. But it is great enough as it stands to be worth it anyway.			"

												A popular opinion among many, but FF7 is my favorite game of all time. Not just because of nostalgia, but because it is an incredible experience. While it has not aged well graphically, the story, soundtrack, and characters still stand tall. Fighting the Ruby and Emerald Weapons still has me mashing the O button hoping I don't get obliterated. The final fight between Cloud and Sephiroth still pumps me up as Cloud shreds him apart with Omnislash. The loss of arguably the most beloved character of all time still brings a tear to my eye. Hell, I will still attempt to bring Aerith back, knowing in the back of my head it's not possible, or I will try to get that mysterious chocobo the runs underwater or even outerspace knowing no such thing exists. Call me biased if you will but this game is a must play! Infinity/100 greatest game ever! "

												Played this back on the ps1, one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.  Has a few bugs and some glitches, i cant remember where in the game, but they are easily bypassed.  Other than the few bugs, fantastic port, great game, brings back all the great memories from the original game on ps1.  This game also has a a massive amount of save blocks (unlock final fantasy 4) so you can save your game at all the cool parts in the game.  If you dont know the game, the story is detailed, the characters are awesome, and the game has tons of extras throughout the game.  The materia and limit break system takes a bit to get used to if you have never played this but its not difficult.  The game also has a feature to turn on max levels if you dont want to grind and work the trenches.  The game is not HD remastered, it is pretty much exactly the same port as the PS1 version, we are still waiting on that from squaresoft.  Considering this was made in 1997, its very impressive.  It is worth nothing that skill wise many of the characters are the same.  It is not like ff4 with a specific dragoon or ninja, or ff6 with a specific thief, or a specific martial artists.  The characters are differrent in look, have different weapons and limits, but they all have access to the same materia.  It would have been cool to have unique skills for each character to really set them apart not just from the story and visual, but in battle as well.			"

												I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan despite the fact that I never got around to playing FF7 in its glory days. I can now testify after finally beating it that the game deserves much of the praise it has received.HOWEVER, if you didn't grow up with Final Fantasy or ""old school"" JRPGs, you might find this game a little tough to get into due to the conveniences we are now offered in modern games.There are random battles which can't be avoided without the use of third party software. I still highly recommend it, but perhaps consider using a guide if you just want to play it for the story, as it doesn't always hold your hand.I still think FF9 is superior and makes for a better entry point to the Final Fantasy series. I think FF7 gets a bit too much credit. That being said, it is still a fantastic game--one that every RPG fan ought to play.8.9/10 "

												I played this game originally on the PSX in 1997 when i was 13, since then the game has aged ok.the background renders are still beautiful but the 3d sprites are a bit rubbish.The battle scenes, magic effects anf FMV though still have that quaint feel that feels nice even now.i sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into this game and i have completed it start to finish at least 10 times, gotten every secret and probed every nook and cranny.I love this game though i admit that its partailly through rose tinted glassesIf you have never played it before and you are interested in JRPGs or the final fantasy series in general i suggest you pick it up. if you are into your CoD and Halo and were born after the PS2 era, id give it a miss because im not sure that you will like it.However for me as its the game that introduced me to serious storytelling in gaming, im going to give this 10/10, would omnislash Sephiroth again			"

												FF7 is a game of split opinions. If you have never played it or any newer FF, you will love it. Lots to explore, fun side quests, some rather amusing scenarios you'll chuckle at, and a dark story to follow. The battle system is dated but very easy to learn but can be made interesting through 'sneaky' materia(magic) combinations. It is a fantasy world and sometimes things just seem to defy logic, just remember its japanese game things will be strange.If you have played this game, then purchasing this version has nothing new for you unless you're N/A region. and even then its 2 optional bosses. everything else is the same. just looks nicer. doesn't play faster isn't harder, and some of the dialog appears changed.

												For a great many people Final Fantasy VII may as well have been Final Fantasy I. This was the game that introduced me to the genre of JRPGs, with its classic spiky haired protagonists and oversized weaponry. More importantly, it also demonstrated, to a worldwide audience, the potential scale and spectacle that modern video games now provide almost effortlessly. At the time, this was something special.Returning to the game now might intially highlight some out of date looks and casts a stark light on plotting that perhaps passes less muster to a more discerning, mature player. However, I think too much is made of these critisisms; the game, while aged (as happens to all of us) still has a charm to it's blocky low-poly models that elevate it above most games of that period (even ones that were arguably better looking at the time), and the high production values, cinematic camera shots, and incredible music score help promote a timeless quality that help retain playability. And the story, while suffering from a sometimes dodgy translation, touches upon big themes of identity, loss and the environmental cost of progress, while remaining accessible in a children's action/soap opera vibe. The story beats swing between comedy and seriousness a little unevenly (sometimes a more than a little, actually), but not unsuccessfully, and overall the plot is driven by appealling character relationships, and great action set pieces cut between quieter, more reflective moments.The game is huge, opening out from an inital starting city into a whole world to explore, filled with lots of optional things to do which will keep you busy way past the more linear main story path. The combat system is interesting, featuring an active time battle system which merges turn based strategy with some time pressure. The magic system is fun, collecting materia, which acts as spells which attach to your weapons and armor, and level independently of your characters, providing flexibility. The game finds lots of ways to play with the systems it establishes.The PC version has some weaknesses in that the backgrounds don't always merge as seemlessly with the video transitions and 3D foreground elements as well as on the original console versions, and the music suffers a bit too. Also, if you play with keyboard controls, some of mini-games have occasionally overly dexterous key mappings which might turn your delicate hands into twisted pretzels.Despite the flaws above, if you haven't played Final Fantasy VII, the PC version remains a solid way to experience a true classic of gaming.

												I never got the chance to play this originally on Playstation. It was always one of those games that I wanted to play, but could never find a copy of, so I was ecstatic when I found out that the PC port was available through Steam. One Steam sale and 36 hours later, I now finally understand both the hype and the hatred towards this game. Personally, I really enjoyed it and consider myself a part of the hype category. A colorful cast of characters that are well-designed and well-developed, a combat system intertwined with the Materia spell system for unique encounters and boss battles, and an amazing plot that kept me invested all the way through. Few JRPGs have held me for as long as this one has, rivaled only by the Kingdom Hearts franchise. There may be other entries in the Final Fantasy series that can be argued for over VII, but I can understand and respect why this game is held on such a prestigious pedestal.			"

As i previously mentioned, i had to consult guides online to help me get directions. However, without any guidance, you would have great fun exploring the massive world this game has to offer.

												I loved this game when it first came out, and having bought it on Steam, I thought it was safe to throw away my original CDs (of which I had 2 sets) so as not to fiddle with DOSBOX.I should have never done that.  Before even getting this ""port"" to run, there's all kinds of signing up and account creation happening, and that sort of idiocy sticks in my craw.  I remember when you could just buy a game, take it home, and play it, without having to allow it to target market to you.In short ... no, don't buy this.  Stick to your old disks.  Wrestle with them to get them working under whatever version of Windows to which you are enslaved today.  It'll  be better than having to deal with the Steam version.			"

												At first, I didn't quite like this final fantasy. I thought it was pretty overhyped for what it was, and I never really understood why some people called it ""the greatest game ever made."" Now that I've beaten it, and played through all the story, I finally understand all the hype this game got, and, as a Final Fantasy game, it was pretty up there on my favorite games, though I still liked 4 and 6 better. I can happily give this game a pretty good rating, an 8/10, for it was a great experience all the way through. My reason for deducting points is the materia. Materia are these gems that you equip to your weapons and armor to perform magic, or add health with stuff like HP Plus Materia. You could also add completely new commands with Command Materia, such as Sense which tells your opponents weakness, level, and current health. I guess it's cool in a sense (heh, get it?), but throughout the game it became harder and harder to manage, with all the new materia birthed from mastering materia it became a cluster♥♥♥♥. I preferred the regular old spells you could use at any time in past games like final fantasy 4. Also emerald and ruby weapons can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves.			"

I didn't find out about/play FFVII until I was 15 but when I did, it immediately became my favorite game period. I've completed the story around 6-7 times (lost track) over the last 5 years.

If you're a hardcore Final Fantasy fan like I am, then you absolutely MUST get this game; getting the achievements proves to your friends how dedicated you are. :)			"

												It's exactly the same as the old PS Final Fantasy 7. It is not HD, so you will see 2 blocks of black striped on the left and right end of your screen. Graphics is still very blocky, nothing changed here. The music is not bad, although haters gonna hate, I still love it despite the difference with the PS version.The gameplay, needless to say, was awesome and epic! However since the graphic is so old, no enhancement whatsoever, I guess only FF fans will like it.I am FF fan. So I love it.Best played with a joystick.My score: 9/10			"

												What is there to say? This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time!It is acclaimed as one of the best RPGs of all time and even as the best of its franchise, it has a grand story coupled with memorable characters and an epic soundtrack to boot.While I can't recommend it enough to everyone that still hasn't played it yet, I suppose that despite all the praise one could give, it still might not be a game for everyone. This is a Turn-Based J-RPG with an Active Time Battle system, and so if you're really not into this genre maybe this isn't the game for you.One of the best qualities of Final Fantasy VII that any of its fans can tell you is its incredible score, what a masterpiece! Nobuo Uematsu - long time Final Fantasy series composer - outdid himself with this soundtrack. It ranges from catchy and happy to sad and sombre pieces, from highly atmospheric to fast paced adrenaline-pumping tunes, from very simple to more complex melodies, it also covers a great amount of musical styles: classical, rock, industrial, techno, reggae, bossa nova... and the list goes on.As for the graphics, this version improves on some things: FMVs have been upscaled to be of better quality when compared to the original PlayStation FMVs, this time around Shaders were added to increase the quality and looks of models and thus eliminating the jagged lines that plagued the PS1 version, and now it also allows the use of resolutions up to 1080p by upscaling the game.Even with these modest improvements, for some the game hasn't aged all that well. And I can agree that to a degree the 2D backgrounds can look very pixelated at times, this setback is more apparent because of the higher resolution the game uses, coupled with the fact that the backgrounds were never redone for this newer version, from what I heard this was because the original 2D Pre-Rendered Background assets were somehow ""lost"" from Square-Enix archives (or maybe they never even bothered to retain the originals, who knows?) and so, to make higher resolution ones they would have to remake every single one of them from scratch.By releasing on Steam it also came with the now mandatory Achievements, I know some people that really look forward to those.And lastly, I would also like to point out that for those who are computer savvy enough and are willing to put in the extra effort, the exclusive possibility for the PC to Mod this game with all sorts of textures/models/sounds etc. is indeed a big plus for many.In conclusion, Final Fantasy VII is without a doubt one of the best experiences out there to be had, and this PS1 era Classic looks now better than it ever did thanks to it's 2012 version PC re-release.I sincerely hope you'll love it as much as I do.

												If you are looking for a great story line with great gameplay and don't mind outdated graphics this is a game you should try.Together with FF9, fallout 1&2 this game makes up the top of my list of best games ever made. Literally spend hundreds if not thousands of hours playing this back on the PS1 and on emulators before it came to steam and all I can say is that despite the somewhat ""slower"" gamespeed I still enjoy the game like I did when I first played it.

With no exaggeration, I've finished this game ten times including beating all of the weapons, mastering all of the materia, collecting all items, Chocobo's, limit breaks and started it many more times again. I've lost tens of thousands of hours to this game over the last 18yrs and was my true first gaming love, the game that made me love playing video games.If some how you have not had a chance to play this, it is a must - forget about the ""poor"" graphics as just one hour in you will see past the two decade old graphics and settle in for one of the best gaming experiences you can have.

												After the many years of this game being out and playable in various platforms I have finally taken the time and played this game for the first time.I see a lot of the praise this game gets for the Final Fantasy franchise for the creative and beautiful graphical achievements it did back in the day when the game was first released. It also had quite a deal of depth in the nature of option side-questing things that would give you good rewards for the effort (even though there were some I had not even tried/found.) The musical score definitely had some wonderful pieces in there that definitely set the mood and the feels with the story. Speaking of story this is where I believe it faltered a little. There were some parts that I felt were not needed or were not explained thoroughly for what it was showing. Some parts felt even patched in just to add more to the story and extend the gameplay. If it kept to the main theme of what the game hummed all along the story would have been solid.In the end though: I'd still give it a few more playthroughs just to see all the bits that I had missed for a first playthrough and try different team combos.

												Some people may find FINAL FANTASY series such a boring games,but for me myself... i found this as a masterpiece.FINAL FANTASY series is the best RPG games of all timesIt's the games of my childhood, and I really have a big time fun enjoy playing the FINAL FANTASY series, not only VII.It's a 100/100 Metascore RPG game for me.FINAL FANTASY VII :Good GameplayGood Game MechanicsInteresting StoryExcellent MusicFun Mini GamesInteresting Quest		Some Secret QuestSome HumorsThe bad thing : the graphic is screw !! (compared to modern games today)Yes ofcourse, coz it's a 1997 old classic game, was designed for PlayStationand later on was released for Windows 95 / Windows ME.And the graphic doesn't support widescreen.Yes there is mod to fix this : Tifa Bootleg.Ok about this FF VII Steam version :----------------------------------------FINAL FANTASY VII Steam Edition is just a new repack from an old classic 1997 Squaresoft game.The Difference between the orginal and the Steam version is :FF VII now become compatible with Windows 7Worse audio file (dunno about today, but i heard SE later on just release the patch for this issue)Need 1 new account at Square Enix. Well now customer got 1 more ID & Password to be remembered for a single player game (HEY THIS IS BAD !! It's FF VII single player offline not FF XIV)New features : Achievement & Online Save & Character Booster(Character Booster is the worst aspect of the game, it makes the game become not fun anymore, because our character now come with max hp and max gil..... You know what ? Our hero become too strong and the enemy become too weak now !!) Why don't SE replace the bonus with something make sense which not make our character become overpower ? such as : + 10 materia of medium level + some medicine (20 potion 20 elixir 20 ether) etc etc whatever.... instead of max hp and max gil :(And i'm a bit dissappointed about the graphic option. Don't get me wrong... i know it's a classic game, so i don't expect any high texture like modern - Geforce GTX 770 VGA - games today. What I mean is : If the game doesn't support widescreen, why do SE bother to give the widescreen resolution option ??? :D So if u are a fan of high end graphic games -------> Don't buy thisIf u already has FF VII and expect something new different in FF VII Steam Edition -------> Don't buy thisWell i just wonder, why SE don't remake this ? A full HD Remastered of an old classic best selling RPG game FF VII instead of just repackage it to be compatible with Windows 7 ?? :DD lolzOk let's check the FF VII forum......I heard that they (the community of FF VII) has make a mod for FF VII (graphic texture, music, menu, etc...etc) much better than the company itself :D lolz hahahaShame on u LAZY SE :D   Many customers angry, and we maybe reconsider to buy the repacakage of FINAL FANTASY IX in the future. Why ??? Because u lazy !!! u lazy !! and liar !!  U don't make any worth improvement, u just repackage it and add new but not so worth features, and sell it with lies !! That's why many customers regret to buy FINAL FANTASY VIII (Yes FF 8) (repackage product of SE), even the old original 1998 PS version of FF VIII game has better music quality than the new repackage FF VIII of 2013 !! And some of them are vowed not to buy any future products of lazy liar developer, unless bla bla...... (well u know what i'm about to say)I've been thinking of purchasing FINAL FANTASY VIII on Steam, but since that SE has broke this originally fantastic FF VIII (Graphic & Audio) to a disgrace level - a piece of crap, now i'm holding back !  I won't buy FINAL FANTASY VIII in this state for $ 11.99   :|Will that SE release some patch for this game ??Well let's see the future products of SE :|************Update FF VII************Recently i'm attaching Tifa Bootleg Mod to this FF VIIIt's works like a charm... a pretty cool improvement in graphic and sound.But yea ofcouse It's not a full 100% HD Remake in all aspect of the game.Tifa Bootleg Mod let u to costumize character model, graphic texture, sound, weapon, menu style, icons , better trainer, and more...Tifa Bootleg mod can upgrade ur FF VII music & also FMV cut scenes to a better quality ones.Tifa Bootleg can also make this game graphic strecth to widescreen resolution, butu will notice that's something wrong there, cause the game wasn't designed for,and never been remake to support widescreen display.The mod is the only way to play FINAL FANTASY VII HD Remake version :)Coz that lazy hand Square Enix will never do it, except the FF community.Nah... nah.... SE will never remake FF VII, too much effort for it, that's what they thought.Thanks to the community for this work.U can launch FF VII from Steam. but with limitation of the mod's resource.To use all of the resource from the mod, u need to launch FF VII from Tifa's Launcher,but by doing this : losing achievements and save games.Yes not a perfect mod though, but for me this one is good enough.The installation is quite easy, but yea the pain is u need to download around 16 GB :DThanks to FF Community !!

												Widely considered to be a true innovation of the series, this game tops the list of a lot of FF players - for good reason. Whilst not my own personal favourite, there is a lot here to love.Although looking a little jaded by today's ""modern"" standards, back in the day the graphics were thought of as a technological breakthrough; VII is the first true 3D game of the FFs. It may be a little blocky now, but if you really take issue with that then there are plenty of nice-looking mods for the PC version.At its heart, FFVII is an underdog story, telling the tale of a ragtag resistance facing a corrupt organisation (and later on, something even worse - a threat to the entire planet, coming from a villain who is without a doubt the most recogniseable of the series.) The characters are (mostly...I'm ignoring the existence of Cait Sith for the purpose of this review) a likeable bunch, with mixed backstories and rather good development. Cloud comes off as a little dull and bland to begin with, but he comes into his own later on. Occasionally the plot may take a little turn for the confusing and wacky, but it's largely resolved to a clean degree (anything that isn't is explained more in-depth through the spin offs.) The villains are very entertaining, and in some cases you really end up hating them - which is the point, naturally.The Materia system is a nice touch - any character can equip any skill, and the more you battle the more powerful these skills become, and the more often you can use them. There is a real sense of progression and accomplishment.Of course, as expected by now, the music is another accomplishment. This game probably has my favourite ""standard"" boss battle theme of the lot, except from maybe that of VI. The town themes largely have their own feel (an East Asian theme for Wutai, a tribal one for Cosmo Canyon, etc.) Also, ""One-Winged Angel."" Those of you who have played this before know that I need say nothing else.This is the ""entry game"" for a lot of players, and it does give a very nice feel of what to expect from the other games. It wasn't afraid to take risks with both technological boundaries and storytelling, and should be admired for that reason alone. As I mentioned - not my favourite, but no less of a gaming classic.

Don't feel  like setting up a customer service account with steam just to trouble shoot this. glad i only paid 4.03 but will not waste money on Square games in the future. Signing up @ another site to use a game i bought and purchased through steam is unacceptable IMHO.Will post updates should one arise but i don't see steam rushing to email me a licensing key to enter in over @ squares website anytime soon.

												I played the original version of the game years ago and it was great. So I bought the refreshed version and it sucks!Technically it's crap:1. You have to make an additional account for Square-Enix.2. The game doesn't work with my gamepad. Yeah, you can configure the buttons in the menu, but the game doesn't react on the buttons.			"

												I'm glad to see this game come to PC, since I don't own any consoles and I've heard my friends say for years how great of a game it was.  As a result, when it became available for a remarkably good price of four USD I picked it up.That said, they could have done a much better job on porting this game.  By the numbers:1.  The controls are permanently set, and if you don't own a gamepad you're permanently saddled with the most non-intuitive control scheme I've ever seen, where the binds make little to no sense and are scattered all over the keyboard.2.  The client is inherently unstable, to a point where I suffered from 4(!) crashes by the time I had finished the first battle.  I'm talking complete crash to desktop restarts here.  3.  In addition to this glaring problem, the client hangs severely even when next to no load is being placed on the system.  The first fight, as mentioned earlier, while not overly complicated and only requiring a total of 4 attacks including the ones against the player character took me over five minutes to complete.  Now I know that I don't have the best computer in the world, especially when I'm playing on my laptop like I am, but this system has no difficulty handling modern games.  It should be taking FFVII and bending it over the table, but instead it hangs... especially in the CGI sequences where I had to use CTRL+ALT+DEL to force close the client a few times because the video had picked a spot and froze while the TERRIBLE 8 bit sounding music was on a 2 second loop that would make the most patient man in the world go insane.To sum up, while I was very interested in playing this game, and I am sure that if it is patched to a playable state it will be excellent and enjoyable, I simply cannot recommend it to anyone in its current condition.  Ya let me down Square Enix.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is one of those games that to me, personally, will never get old.I thoroughly enjoy it even though the graphics are horrendously outdated, because when you start to play it, none of that matters.  It is slow to start off with, but once you can get into the open world, it opens up the story line and becomes one of the best games in the Final Fantasy franchise.			"

												A great Final Fantasy game but because of this buggy port to PC it renders this game nearly unplayable. This is my first negative review of a game on Steam and I've had an account for 5 years. I ran into several errors just trying to run this game, sign in and make an account. After I finally got logged in, I had it crash. I tried to save after a gaming session only to find my save could not work. Overall not impressed with the port of this game. I wish Square Enix put some time into properly porting a timeless classic instead of making me have to deal various issues.			"

												It's ♥♥♥♥in' FFVII. I'm fairly sure you know about this game.I didn't know the PC verison made it look so pretty but at the same time so dated. Those prerendered backgrounds looked a hell of a lot better on the PlayStation. Then again, you could just mod the ♥♥♥♥ outta this game. But if you're depending on mods for a good game, that's ♥♥♥♥ed. Check yourself. Of course I'd tell you to buy this ♥♥♥♥ and make it rain on Square Enix (If you like the FFVII), but there's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM on this game. You need to make a Square Enix account, which may not work, my first one wouldn't log in. Just get the Eidos PC release from Ebay or Amazon. Who the ♥♥♥♥ puts DRM on a single player game?			"

												Requires you to sign up for a Square Enix account before it allows you to play, then links that account to your Steam account. You cannot set your control keys in game, meaning you either have to play with backwards controls (right hand directional left hand activate and cancel, etc) or install yet another program to alter your computer's keystroke recognition. Pass on this. Whoever ported it to the PC has no idea what they're doing and needs to find a new line of work. Deleted it right after the intro, wish I could get my money back.			"

												Final Fantasy VII is basically the first game that I ever pre-ordered in my life when purchasing a game. This was when I was just a little kid, and was quite excited about the Japanese release of Final Fantasy VII. It took me months to beat this game on first try, and about 8 years ago, I bought myself an English version of it and beat it in 1 week. I still remember myself doing the final battle over and over, as it was very entertaining back then. And now Final Fantasy VII has got some HD treatment (Not sure I can call it a full HD....as it appears only the character models look decent and the background looks quite distorted still as the original. Meh, prob not a HD. Doesn't matter though) and what can I say. This game just never gets old. As I bought the Japanese version of FFVII on day one, I just had to buy this one on day one as well, as a hardcore, long time Final Fantasy fan.Music is just outstandingly epic. Even to this very day, I still listen to ""You Can Hear the Cry of the Planet""

Which is possibly one of the most powerful music ever composed by mankind. Gameplay. Well, what can I say. I beat this game twice, in both Japanese and English versions, played the final boss battle for over 50 hours. This game, is almost like a standard of RPG. Am I exaggerating somehow? Not even. Story. Well? I have never encountered an RPG that has a better story than this game. It is purely filled with the best elements that the best games normally possess. The only other thing that I can say about this game is that this is truly the best game ever made.No wait, it is actually more than just a ""best game"".

												What can I say that hasn't already been said about this legendary game.If you love JRPGs, story-rich games, and so forth, then you should buy this game.Great game, great soundtrack, great story, sure the graphics are dated, but you are probably quite a shallow and ignorant fool if you ignore Final Fantasy VII and play Final Fantasy XIII instead; don't judge the book by its cover or game by its graphics.10 out of 10, will totally come play this game again one day like I have every other year since the game originally came out about twenty years ago on the PS1.If you have not had this game's story spoiled for you, just get it now and play it now and love it now like I have and so many others have before you.

												I recently began an epic Final Fantasy binge. I bought FFIX, FFXV, FFIII(VI in Japan) and this game.  I've only finished IX so far, but what I've played of this game, it's gonna be one of my favorites.  The combat is simple, yet engaging, the characters have great interactions, and the story(so far) has been good.  The few drawbacks I've encountered is that sometimes it's hard to maneuver in small spaces, and that with a controller, the button prompts show up as [OK], [BACK], [MENU], etc instead of A, B, X and Y.  The music is amazing, as well.  Overall, if it doesn't take a major turn for the worse, I'd give this game a 8-9/10 depending on how the story ends up.			"

												What more can be said about this game that you probably haven't already heard? It's going on almost 20 years old and highly regarded as one of the classic JRPGs to set the standard for quality, story, innovation, battle mechanics, and more. If you've heard about this game and never played it, there's a reason. It has some of the most interesting settings and characters, even by today's standards. When this game released in 1997, the graphics were hailed as some of the best out there. Although they may not hold up to that these days, they are still colorful and fun. In all honesty, I still think they're good.If you have not played this game, do yourself a favor and buy it. I consider it the best Final Fantasy in the series, and I've played almost all of them.

												If you haven't played Final Fantasy 7, then you probably don't like JRPGs anyways. That said, it's probably the quintessential posterchild for modern day JRPGs, and one of the games that helped bring them to the mainstream. Final Fantasy 7 is easily one of the better JRPGs ever made, but also one of the most overrated. Also keep in mind, this game requires you to be always online, for DRM purposes, but gives no real benefits to this requirement other than Achievements. If you are wanting to play a JRPG, and are unable to find an original disc of this game, then this is the best alternative.			"

												I didn't play video games as a child so I missed out on a lot of classics. Had a bit of trouble with the version on the PSN, tried using an emulator on my laptop but it kept giving me audio trouble and I just felt frustrated and bored.I bought this  version because I wanted to play the rest of the story myself and the remake announcement reminded me how much I love Aerith. I replayed all my progress from the past few months in a few days.The PC version is great, really easy to play with a gamepad. I didn't miss save states or any of the extras from the emulated version. It really sucked me into the story for the first time. Initially I was frustrated with the pre-rendered backgrounds but they grew on me. Very beautiful. It's really easy to get pulled into this universe.Gripes:I'm annoyed you have to make a square enix account to play the game. The site goes down all the time. The cloud saving rarely works and I reccomend turning it off if you are going to be saving a lot (like grinding on the world map etc). Also I didn't use the character boost because I didn't need it. I may try it on another playthrough though.			"

												Underneath the crusty PC port is the game I love, shining like a jewel. But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.Update: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.			"

												Three times now, it has erased all my saved games. Even with me manually creating backups every time I turn the game off, it still keeps deleting saves at random. I've lost almost 10 hours of progress all told. Would like to recommend the game, but it is broken in the most fundamental way possible: it erases all your data.This is probably related to the stupid (and largely non-functional) cloud save functionality. Be warned: Do not EVER turn this game off without first going into the file system and creating duplicates of the save games			"

												FF7 was the most groundbreaking RPG of its era. It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.			"

												So after reading a lot of reviews about all the trouble people have had with this game and with square I checked out all the positive reviews and figured it was worth a buy on sale. This game brings me back to my high school days and I have beaten it many times. I still have the original for my PS but the first disk is damaged and wont let me play in Midgar.Anyway, I have had zero issues with setting up my square account and it only takes one log in to play so that hasn't been an issue for me at all. I said ""no thank you"" to having cloud saves available and I will never use the character boost, to me it is a pretty dumb addition to the game.The cleaned up graphics took some getting used to and the controls on the keyboard are a little funky for sure so if you can set up a controller I would recomend it. That being said the characters now do look nice without funky angles shooting out of thier bodies. Music sounds great I am guessing it has been fixed since so many complained about it. If you loved this game when you were younger or want to play it now because you never have and it is on sale, go for it! Still an amazing game and I love that I can play it for what seems like the 100th time and still love every second.			"

												If you want to get the best of this game, you should be new to the gaming world. The appreciation and sensation will overwhelm you and you will lose track of your realistic life. This was my first role-play game. I was entirely sold and stopped doing my homework. Which is a bad thing. You should try to do both, game and study.

												Underneath the crusty PC port is the game I love, shining like a jewel. But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.Update: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.			"

												I didn't play video games as a child so I missed out on a lot of classics. Had a bit of trouble with the version on the PSN, tried using an emulator on my laptop but it kept giving me audio trouble and I just felt frustrated and bored.I bought this  version because I wanted to play the rest of the story myself and the remake announcement reminded me how much I love Aerith. I replayed all my progress from the past few months in a few days.The PC version is great, really easy to play with a gamepad. I didn't miss save states or any of the extras from the emulated version. It really sucked me into the story for the first time. Initially I was frustrated with the pre-rendered backgrounds but they grew on me. Very beautiful. It's really easy to get pulled into this universe.Gripes:I'm annoyed you have to make a square enix account to play the game. The site goes down all the time. The cloud saving rarely works and I reccomend turning it off if you are going to be saving a lot (like grinding on the world map etc). Also I didn't use the character boost because I didn't need it. I may try it on another playthrough though.			"

The Materia game mechanic is the culmination or all learnt from the years spent developing the prior 6 games, no complex trees needed, but still allows for an absolutely staggering amount of choice and strategy.The storyline is hands down one of the most interesting in all of gaming history, while providing challenges and some of the most fun minigames throughout.I wish Steams inaugural gaming awards allowed a game to be nominated for multiple categories as it would have received nominations across multiple categories from me.

												With the upcoming remake of Final Fantasy VII there will definitely be mixed reviews about which is better. the remake or the original? The least any newcomer to the Final Fantasy franchise can do is to play the original first before any potential shortcomings the remake may have to offer.For most the 1997 release was their first Final Fantasy and is therefore special to them. Upon replaying FFVII on Steam I had such an overwealming nostalgia which quite honestly surprised me. I could remember everything so clearly even after almost 20 years since first playing it. Everything was the same as I had imagined it even back then, though I will say that this updated version has a few things which had been changed. Certain dialogue and so on, though I don't think this is such a major issue to many.The Materia system is still top notch, though now I am certainly more cautious with what I use instead of throwing everything on a character just because I had it, as I would have done on my first playthrough. Plenty of mini games to keep one entertained when sick of grinding or just want to take a break from the story. The battle system was exciting for its time, especially with the added Limit Breaks which were a huge improvement on VI's Desperation Attacks. which were quite frankly rubbish. The fact you could save the special attack for a better time as well as evolve them into better ones by using them was a reason to try out every character, just to see what they did. With the new release, the old battle system will certainly be dead and buried so we can probably say goodbye to many of the epic moves and abilities we once encountered.The soundtrack? 11/10. Nuff said.If anything, this is one of my least favourite Final Fantasies in the franchise, though it was my first. Even though I prefer most of the others, this truly is a special game that will not only challenge you, but become a part of you in the process. It can be a bit of an eyesore to look at in this day and age, but if you love a story rich game then there's nothing really stopping you from buying this game.			"

												There's no doubt that this game is a classic, whether you like or not. But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.Expect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.

												FF7 was the most groundbreaking RPG of its era. It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.			"

												I'm torn, to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Final Fantasy VII. The trouble is, I loved the original, back on the Playstation. There really is no need for this game to have cloud saves, nor achievements, especially not for winning your first battle. Yes, the gameplay hasn't changed, and yes, I'm getting to play the game again. Hell, I bought the game three times, because I kept wearing out the discs from overuse. But a game that used a tiny memory stick to allow 15 saved games shouldn't need you to register online JUST TO FREAKING PLAY.Yes I recommend playing Final Fantasy VII, but not this copy. Go grab yourself a physical copy and an emulator, it'll be better in the long run.			"

No reason, no explanation, no file deleting on my part or modding or cheating anything just loaded up the game went to hit continue and it was greyed out, happened right after my steam client updated itself so possibly they are related but either way I'm screwed can't load save games so I will have to start over if I want to play, can't recommend this experience to anyone.

												What could I ever write here that hasn't been said before. I remember putting in 70+ hours into this game when it first arrived to Playstation back in 1997. What I can say is that the PC port, while not the HD remake we always hoped for, provides a little more polish than it's 1997 counterpart and remains a distinct landmark in the Final Fantasy series.Graphics & Story: For the era it was produced in, FF7 had compelling graphics along with full motion video and a great cast of unique and interesting characters. Famous scenes such as Sephiroth's walk through the flame engulfed Nibelheim or the fateful moment in the Forgotten Capital provide the gamer with the type of immersion that has tried to be replicated through numerous games following FF7's release. Music: With Nobuo Uematsu at the helm, there was no doubt that the soundtrack would be any less than great. One-Winged Angel is one of the most memorable compositions in Video Game history and Aerith's theme provided the perfect emotional tone for that pivotal moment in the Forgotten Capital.Again not much more I can say but that I can't wait for the HD remake - 10/10Update: Mar 16, 2015Finally finished my 100% achievement file. Hoping we hear something regarding a sequel or remake in 2017 on the game's 20th anniversary. Give Final Fantasy VII a try if you've never played it before. This classic is certainly worth the time.Update: June 16, 2015Well holy hell....the remake is happening.			"

												It's FINAL FANTASY FRIGGIN SEVEN. What the hell else do you need to know? It's still one of the best JRPGs of all time, and the game that would come to define an entire genre for over 10 years. Ignore whatever preconceptions you might have had about this game being overrated, or any kind of bad taste left in your mouth from the mostly-terrible Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. This game really is as good as you've heard, from the tight and expansive battle system, the highly customizable characters, the massive world filled with nooks and crannies to explore, and, of course, a great story. In Final Fantasy VII, you play the role of Cloud, an ex-SOLDIER working with a resistance company called AVALANCHE to take down his former employers, the Shin-Ra corporation. Along the way, you'll encounter giant rideable chickens, swords the size of your house and then some, more existential crises than you can wave a giant unwieldy sword at, and, of course, a whole pile of homoeroticism. The PC port could be better, but it's still pretty decent. It doesn't really matter, because this is a game you NEED to play.			"

												A classic.  Chances are if you're buying this you've played it already.  If not, well you'll get to see what all us thirty-somethings are talking about.  There are options to run at a higher resolution and dither the textures and stuff like that... but there isn't much point.  This game has polygons and fmv's and whatnot - but it's really born from a 16-bit era design philosophy.  Keep that in mind while playing - it's more about the story than the presentation - and that story is a parable for the true struggle of our age, which is why it resonates with so many people.  The irony here is that Squenix is behaving more and more like the evil corporation in its cautionary tale...Worth the 40 or so hours, I say.  Get it.  Run it at low rez.  Punch Square-Enix in the face for big-brothering you before letting you play.  (An account is required!)  Wish you had just kept your Playstation and curse the death of privacy.

												I was one of those people who never played the game when it released, as I did not own a PS1. I now see why so many people list it as ""greatest game ever"". I wouldn't rate it as my ""greatest video game ever"" but it is certainly a very good game. My first experience with the game was around 1999 and even then I felt like these graphics were pretty dated compared to games such as Ocarina of Time, but the gameplay still holds up well in 2017. I have not finished the game yet but have put in a lot of hours, and so far the story is very good, and the gameplay itself has held up well. If you're a younger gamer I'm not sure if you'll be able to appreciate the highly 1990s nature of this game, but I grew up on Genesis/SNES/N64 and can say that this is definitely one of the games of its generation that have aged well.For the people complaining about the Square Enix servers, I created my account when I first started the game and immediately unchecked the ""Cloud Saves"" option in settings, and have never had an issue with trying to play the game other than one crash when I was near the end of the ""Disc 1"" (of 3) content of the original release.

												If you had Playstation One and you weren't dumb idiot, you HAD to play and enjoy FFVII. It's an everlasting turn based RPG classic with awesome story, awesome music, awesome characters. Right, the graphics might not be up your alley, but remember this game was made for console back in 1997. It's been optimized for PC, but then again, graphics sucks. But then again, WHO CARES? AWESOME. A+.			"

												Absolutely classic game, still stands the test of time thanks to the characterised art style. The Materia game mechanic is the culmination or all learnt from the years spent developing the prior 6 games, no complex trees needed, but still allows for an absolutely staggering amount of choice and strategy.The storyline is hands down one of the most interesting in all of gaming history, while providing challenges and some of the most fun minigames throughout.I wish Steams inaugural gaming awards allowed a game to be nominated for multiple categories as it would have received nominations across multiple categories from me.

												It's FINAL FANTASY FRIGGIN SEVEN. What the hell else do you need to know? It's still one of the best JRPGs of all time, and the game that would come to define an entire genre for over 10 years. Ignore whatever preconceptions you might have had about this game being overrated, or any kind of bad taste left in your mouth from the mostly-terrible Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. This game really is as good as you've heard, from the tight and expansive battle system, the highly customizable characters, the massive world filled with nooks and crannies to explore, and, of course, a great story. In Final Fantasy VII, you play the role of Cloud, an ex-SOLDIER working with a resistance company called AVALANCHE to take down his former employers, the Shin-Ra corporation. Along the way, you'll encounter giant rideable chickens, swords the size of your house and then some, more existential crises than you can wave a giant unwieldy sword at, and, of course, a whole pile of homoeroticism. The PC port could be better, but it's still pretty decent. It doesn't really matter, because this is a game you NEED to play.			"

												I can't give an honest opinion on what this game is like to play for the first time as I'm too much of a fan boy. I can say that as a fan boy who will always love this game that the addition of the achievements makes it well worth another play; it made me play the game much more thoroughly that I usually would. Most of them are pretty easy but there are a couple that really require some time and attention to get. Well worth getting if you’re looking for a nostalgia trip with a new challenge. It may make you realise just how awful most of the spin offs really were though, if you hadn't already.			"

												FF7, too many words to describe how awesome this game is - Lets begin.1, In my lifetime i've bought this game 4 - 5 times now, this is because PS2 games were the easiest things to lose as a child for some reason, one was from the Square Enix store and their Cee-loud services but no key for steam and once again on steam because #Enix couldn't come up with steam keys.2. The amout of mods available for this game to make it into HD is astonishing, 16GB but astonishing - I have yet to install these mods yet but once i do i shall be uploading videos or some ♥♥♥♥, i'm not entirely sure but enough about me and mods - the game right?Final Fantasy has a way of destroying the ♥♥♥♥ out of your time, you play the game at 9AM and you get off at 8AM, its just one of those games that gets you instantly hooked, the storyline and plot is a bit iffy but once you're towards the end it will all make sense, sorta. If you've played any other Final Fantasy Game that isn't Vincents offspring or Crisis Core - You will know, this is a pretty original Final Fantasy.Alot of people love the movie because of the game even if neither of them are any relevance to eachother besides the characters and summonings + Sephiroth Battle, speaking of Sephiroth battle - Let me make this crystal clear if i can - how can every boss you encounter me so mutated then you meet sephiroth and he's just stupidely mutated then at the very end {SPOILER} You hit a 0 and he dies, sweet, dramatic ending to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fightBesides all that, alot of people have found exploits and random things about the game in which the average person wouldn't look for, this is always fun to explore on youtube or google. I do recommend this game because I've never personally bought the same game more than twice and usually thats for a friend so for me to have bought this for 4 - 5 in a row now - Pretty astonishing.But i know you guys don't know me, this is a review for the game so ♥♥♥♥ you. :D<3UPDATE 17/06/15 - So i herd you like re-males, it would appear that this game is being remade.on next gen, FF7; this beautiful game is going to make me cry at night now.

This game is probably one of the greatest games I have ever played, despite it's low graphics the game feels so well down and sucks you in deep in the game, it's sound track is quite amazing as well, and there is even mod support for the game, people changing the graphics to look so much better, and gameplay changes of course. You'll play this game through multiple playthroughs just to feel it's fantastic story again, this is one of those games where you wish you can clear your mind whenever you do another playthrough, that's how fantastic the game is!

If they were so scared of people pirating the game so much, maybe they shoulda, you know, put the same measures on the version of the game that they released 10 years ago? Oh yea, that version's DRM free. Just go get that.PlayStation 1 and Windows 95 capable machines will play this game. You don't need this dual core 2GHz/1GB RAM crap to enjoy Final Fantasy VII.I bought this crap for $12, but I went ahead and priated it anyways so I could play it offline.

												The visuals are great for the time, the soundtrack was and still is absolute dynamite, and it is rich full of culture (seriously, go read the actual wikipedia page on 'Sephiroth').But bottom line, this game has not aged well at all. Majority of enemy encounters can be dispatched by holding down the O button.  You can't strategically use your Limit breaks in combat as you're forced to use them whenever they happen to pop up.  And 90% of the time, characters are all functionally identical besides ""melee or ranged"".Materia was criminally undercooked, there's not a lot to it. Something as simple as making Cloud levels materia faster, but will cause it to be weaker in the long run, would have helped.  Or some kind of mechanic where like: Tifa adds extra Agility stats to a materia as it levels up, so that can be swapped onto other characters to help out their stats.  Something to make me think about my party, how it's growing, what lineup I'm running, and how often.It's not always clear where I'm supposed to go, or what I'm supposed to do.  Seriously, how was I supposed to know I had to be looking for a battery for that lift thing, or that I'm supposed to pick some (seemingly) unrelated text option for that guard to unlock the next zone.  Trial-and-error, or just wondering around talking to everyone hoping they tell you something useful does not make for good game design.  I wont fault the story's execution as it was standard for the time, but the endless text-dumps aren't helping.I don't hate this game, and I'm not being deliberately provocative.  This game is just not nearly as amazing as people would have you believe, it could have been so much more.  I acknowledge that this game is totally a part of history, and deserves all the recognition for being groundbreaking (it was).  But this is not the greatest game ever made, it's not even the greatest Final Fantasy, not by a longshot.			"

												If you haven't played Final Fantasy 7, then you probably don't like JRPGs anyways. That said, it's probably the quintessential posterchild for modern day JRPGs, and one of the games that helped bring them to the mainstream. Final Fantasy 7 is easily one of the better JRPGs ever made, but also one of the most overrated. Also keep in mind, this game requires you to be always online, for DRM purposes, but gives no real benefits to this requirement other than Achievements.

												FF7 was the most groundbreaking RPG of its era. It was the edge that gave Sony dominance in the console market, the hammerblow to Nintendo's pride and the straw that broke Sega's back. It represents the pinnacle of Sqauresoft's history and in the eyes of many, no single player RPG has come close since. It also spawned one of the most recognisable bad guys in gaming history. The heavy anime style gives it a very Japanese feel, Nobuo's music is fantastic, from the energetic guitar based battle themes to the heartwrenchingly sorrowful Aerith's theme. A game that excited a generation, filling our heads with unforgettable memories of an awesome, immersive experience. It's a must play for any hardcore RPG fanatic.			"

												Ok, I was really doubting this game. I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. ""OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER"" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, ""Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!"" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.			"

												There's no doubt that this game is a classic, whether you like or not. But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.Expect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.

There really is no need for this game to have cloud saves, nor achievements, especially not for winning your first battle. Yes, the gameplay hasn't changed, and yes, I'm getting to play the game again. Hell, I bought the game three times, because I kept wearing out the discs from overuse. But a game that used a tiny memory stick to allow 15 saved games shouldn't need you to register online JUST TO FREAKING PLAY.Yes I recommend playing Final Fantasy VII, but not this copy.

												Ok, I was really doubting this game. I thought it wasn't going to be as all the fanboys says it would be. ""OH MAH GAWD THIS IS BEST GAME EBER"" basically that. So I played alittle and I'm like, it's alright. But let's say a year later, a really good youtube channel (The Completionists') were doing a special on FF7. Since I saw that, I'm like, ""Hey! Why not finish this game so I don't get any spoilers from the video!"" It jurastically changed from that. I couldn't stop playing. It's like it was sucking me into this game. Although if it weren't for the PS1 music patch for this game, I wouldn't be here and playing this version, because I would be playing on the PS1 (but if I would have, it would take years because I never get on my PS1 on a daily basis). The graphics are a step up, and if you see a side-by-side comparison of the original vs this one, you only see that the character models are more high-def, and the pre-rendered graphics are displayed in a better resolution. Other than that, there is no difference gameplay-wise, except for the SUPER-OP character booster. What it does is that it makes any 3 of your characters in your party right now have 9999 hp and 999 mp (I'm not sure on the gil, it wasn't 99,999 but it was like 60,000 or something like that) other than that, it doesn't give you status buffs, nothing else. Just that (preety weird if you ask me, but you know, Square Enix will make anything worse *Puts on sunglasses*). It will also feel weird the first times using the keyboard, and I have found some mini-games unplayable when using my layout (A is OK, B is CANCEL, D is MENU, Space for START, Shift for SWITCH, Page Up and Down for left and right bumpers 'PS1 controller') and it is real nice that you can use an XBOX 360 controller even though I don't have one, I just use my PS3 controller and have some software to emulate the 360 (I'm not going in-depth about that). You can also use a PS2 controller, but you need an adapter (the best way to play if you ask me, but again, I don't have an adapter). In conclusion, it is the best Final Fantasy I've ever played, but not the best game I ever played.			"

												There's no doubt that this game is a classic, whether you like or not. But if it's actually held up all these years, that's a little more subjective.Expect blocky character models and low resolution (but still quite good looking, IMO) static backgrounds, and all the spelling and grammar errors from the original PC release are still here. However, the music has been replaced, the original MIDI soundtrack is now the same music used in the Playstation release, and the game overall has been optimized to run on new systems. The actual game mechanics and combat system are solid, and the story is also still good.If you've never played the game, don't come in expecting something that can stack up to a game released today in terms of graphical quality. If you can look past its age there's still a great game and plenty of time to be wasted in it, though. If you're looking for a nostalgia kick then it's definitely worth the price as well.The only detractor from what's overall a good game is the extra layer of DRM, requiring a Square Enix account, but considering it can be activated with your Steam account and ignored once you set it up the first time, it's hardly a hassle.

												Underneath the crusty PC port is the game I love, shining like a jewel. But, with cloudsaving that, more often that not, doesn't work, an immensely rocky entry because of an account requirement for a single-player  game that should not have been a concern even months after launch on Steam, and multiple progress stealing crashes, FF7 for PC is not a game I can recommend, even as a diehard fan. It is just too much hassle, both in and out of the game.Update: Not really as upset with the game, but I still don't recommend the game, even to my friends. People who love Final Fantasy will play this regardless, just as I have. I don't encounter nearly as many crashes as I used to because I play it on a stronger computer, but have still encountered some. Cloudsaving is still a consistent problem, however. Though it works more than it doesn't, the times it doesn't are frustrating and can go on for as long as an entire day. The irony in this is that the player requires an account or linking of Facebook info, in part, because of this feature. To force a player to go to such lengths just to play a game that never required this in the first place for a feature that works so infrequently is not a good justification. This is not even mentioning that Steam has these functions covered, should the effort be put in. In text, it seems like a poor port.			"

												Classic game, reproduced faithfully to the original, for better or worse.  A remastered soundtrack would have been excellent, hopefully and easy-to-implement mod will come around in the near future.Caveat Emptor, if you already have this game through Squaresoft- your achievements there will carry over, but there is no way to merge save files.  FYI for completionists, start a fresh game through steam.Recommended for nostalgia and long stretches of inactivity.  Expect 60ish hours for a first playthrough, 40 the second and so on.  Figuring out the ultimate weapons on your own is much more rewarding than using a walkthrough.  However, in the interest of not missing something you only get one chance of acquiring (happens VERY often in this game), check out the ""Caves of Narshe"" website for their guide on ""Missable items.""

												Long time fan of this game; owned it on the PS1, the PC version back in the early 2000s, bought the port on PS3, had it on my PSP, had a port on my iPad... now here on the PC again. With achievements! Saying this game is my favorite one is an understatement. It is my ABSOLUTE favorite. Can't wait for the HD remake. Well worth playing one of the best games from the 90s. Please get this game. You won't regret it. "

												I don't know where to start, but FFVII is one of my fav game for years now. When I first met with the title Final Fantasy, it was on my PSX many years ago. Right now the visuals are outdated. Ofcourse they are, because the game is 16-17 years old (almost an adult). But still one of the best jrpg out there in my opinion. You could ask me, that why is it so good, I will tell it, but remember, these are only MY opinions, not facts. First, i loved the whole story, the flashbacks, backgrounds of the characters. Second, i rly loved almost every music in the game (Imo Cosmo Canyon Theme is the best). And the third, that i like the most and miss in many other games, these are the mini games. For me the most fun was the Chocobo racing and the Chocobo farm. And one more thing, if I'm correct, then FFVII was the Game of the year in 1997. And one little thing, if anyone saw the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, but never tried the game, then I highly recommend atleast 1 playthrough.Update:Oh boy and I'm still waiting for the FF7 Remake. Sadly it will be a PS4 exclusive title, but for me still a must have and the only reason to buy a PS4.			"

												Final Fantasy VII has long been one of my all-time favorite games.  The updated Steam version corrects some of the problems that occured on modern Windows systems due to some rushed coding on the original PC version, but more importantly, it makes a formerly rare PC game available once again.  The plot of FF7 is very rich and detailed, but unfortunately poor translation and the rush to complete the game caused the story to be very confusing.  In many ways, the mystery of the plot adds to the game experience, while it does cause some frustration at the end.  Because of the rich storyline, I found it was worth many playthroughs over the years to look for the additional clues and hidden plot points that explain some of the details and where all the characters fit in.And it's the characters that make the game interesting.  The primary cast of Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aeris, and Sephiroth remain some of gaming's most iconic and memorable characters.  And the supporting characters, major and minor, are also fascinating.  The guilt and dual-nature of Vincent Valentine, the relationship between Cid and Shera and his regret, Reeve's internal conflict, the stories of characters like Zack, Ifalna, and Lucrecia who reveal the origins of the crisis, are all interesting to explore and witness, along with the villians such as Rufus, Don Corneo, and of course, the truly despicable Hojo.  This is a story where people aren't always who you think they are, characters are in conflict with each other and themselves, and terrible losses occur on the way.  For gamers of my generation, there is a single scene I won't divulge here, but you'll know it when you see it, that sticks with you long after the game because of how strong the characters are.  As far as the game mechanics, it's pretty well done.  FF7 introduced the ATB timing system to Final Fantasy games, which combined real-time and turn-based mechanics very well.  Like other FF games, it's about a lot of stats, a lot of random fighting for experience and AP, and I lot of organizing equipment screens, but the systems in FF7 are not so intimidating or confusing as other games in the genre.  Many of the stats don't have a lot of importance in most situations, making fine-tuning the numbers less necessary so long as the characters are leveling enough and have decent gear.  What makes FF7 unique, even among FF games, is the materia system.  By arranging gems called materia, a character can gain magic and special abilities and change them as necessary between fights.  Unlike FF8's junction system which discouraged the use of magic, FF7's materia grows in strength when it is used and equipped.  The materia system is something I've always liked about the game.In many ways, the game hasn't aged perfectly.  Mainly the graphics, and the wonderful soundtrack was originally presented in a midi format. This version updates the midi to OGG, but still isn't great.  Unfortunately, the excellent work by the Qhimm forums on restoring the PC version of this game to greatness is not compatible with the new release of the game, only the original and Platinum Hits versions.  Overall, this game is legendary, and essential for anyone who calls themselves a gamer.  If you play normally, expect 40 hours of gameplay, if you choose to explore and look at everything while combing for secrets, make that 60-80, and if you rush and use walkthroughs, you can do it in 20.

												Great game - Review is based on this version on PC not of FF7- The controls can be fine but it is poor at best with a keyboard.- You can use a gamepad but you need to rebind, not terrible- Having to log in and create a square enix account to even play is ridiculous- Better now, but there have been times you can't even play because something would be wrong with the square server or site so you couldn't play as you have to be ""logged in"" despite this being on steam.This is basically just the FF7 game that came out quite a few years ago on pc, except they put it behind having a Square Enix account and slapped it on Steam.If you want to play this game and you don't have a playstation and the disks I guess you could do worse as it is cheap during sales, but even 11 dollars is a bit much normally, otherwise just avoid on Steam specifically as it is just a money grab I made the mistake of buying into.

												Well well, what must I say about this game, voted as one of the greatest video games of all time, seen as one of the best games in the Final Fantasy franchise, and known for its colossal impact on gaming? Well. If your a gamer like me, who plays games by heart and not eyes (heart being story and eyes being blown away from games featuring explosions guns and violence), then this is a game for YOU. Before I go in depth of how amazing this game is, I must tell you how I got into the Final Fantasy franchise. As a kid I shied away from the series because honestly the roman numerals in the games was just too confusing and at the time I was a strict Nintendo fanboy. Times have changed, I am no longer a strict Nintendo fanboy though I still am but now I accept other games. I gave Final Fantasy 1 a try and quickly got hooked. Then I moved on to 2 and at that point it was clear I am now a Final Fantasy fanboy. I then went to 3, and at the time (all of this happened recently btw), there was a Steam deal going on. The Square Enix publisher discount stuff. Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were in that, and I had some spare change and decided it would be a fantastic idea to purchase two Final Fantasy games with the highest amount of reputation within the franchise. I did not regret that decision, it was clearly worth buying. Now, back to our discussion on why the game is great. This game, is addictive. No, not addictive in a bad way like Minecraft (You know, playing all day losing your mind). Addictive story-wise. The story in this game is ENGAGING ON SOO MANY LEVELS. IT DOES NOT AT ALL FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING A GAME ITSELF, BUT WATCHING A MOVIE WITH A DEEP STORY AND AMAZING CUTSCENES AND FLASHBACKS. The gameplay itself is interesting and apealing to me. When I play the game, I don't care for the gameplay, I am anxious to see what happens next in the story. When a game gets you feeling like this, it is clear why Final Fantasy 7 is regarded or arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Its games like this one we just don't see anymore, it really does suck because I myself wish that these games with all these DLC's and micro-transactions would just STOP and use this game as an analogy to what a perfect game should be. This game is a classic, I had no problems with it other than how frustrating it was to get my freakin Square Enix account setup. If you can get past that one problem, you got yourself a perfect beautiful game right here. In conclusion, I say if you are one who enjoys a great story with fun gameplay, then this game is worth your 12 dollars. Or, at the moment if the deal is still going, its half off.			"

												Return to Midgar and defeat Shinra. A classic Final Fantasy that everyone loves and enjoys time and time again. Through the emotion, the sadness and the hardships. A game that should be experienced by all. If it really helps you to conclude the story play in this order:Crisis Core (PSP)Final Fantasy VII (PSX/PC)Advent Children (DVD/BluRay)Dirge of Cerberus (PS2)And then the story will be finished. Probably the most overatted Final Fantasy in existance with that much just to explain the lore and mythology of Final Fantasy VII, but it's still good nonetheless. But I think why it get's so much praise, it's the first game that a lot of people played first and introduced them to the RPG genre. But I honestly don't praise it that much... But it's good in it's own right. But do take it from me; Play it!			"

												While this review is labeled as negative, my feelings on this game are very mixed. I feel that all the hype and love that it has is mostly nostalgia based, and people aren't exactly capable of seeing it in a current critical eye. Though I still suggest that if you haven't played this game before that you should at least try it. Just because someone on the internet doesn't like it doesn't mean that you should be turned off by this game. If it has such a strong fan-base after all these years, it should                         still be played to at least try to see where everyone is coming from. Though you should go into this game knowing that it hasn't exactly aged well since 1997.			"

												There are no words for how disappointed I am with this version of FF7. Required log ins, midi music tracks instead of the playstation ones, grainy super low-res video, stretched rather then up-scaled textures and world maps, and last but not least a confusing control scheme. This isn't a 2013 rerelease, its the exact same pc port from 1998 with the only differances being achievements and that you have to log in now.  Other then that Square-Enix didn't even put in the most trival effort to improve the game. Thankfully there are modders out there doing what Square-Enix is too lazy to and much more. If you don't mind losing the trainer and achievements I'd look into the various graphic and gameplay enchancement mods availible on the net to make the game at very least more playable.Edit: The midi music was due to a bad download. After deleting the local files and reinstalling I found I had PSX music. Still not going to recommend this game though, as the only way I found it playable is with the Tifas Bootleg mod compolation.			"

												Final Fantasy VII has long been one of my all-time favorite games.  The updated Steam version corrects some of the problems that occured on modern Windows systems due to some rushed coding on the original PC version, but more importantly, it makes a formerly rare PC game available once again.  The plot of FF7 is very rich and detailed, but unfortunately poor translation and the rush to complete the game caused the story to be very confusing.  In many ways, the mystery of the plot adds to the game experience, while it does cause some frustration at the end.  Because of the rich storyline, I found it was worth many playthroughs over the years to look for the additional clues and hidden plot points that explain some of the details and where all the characters fit in.And it's the characters that make the game interesting.  The primary cast of Cloud, Tifa, Barrett, Aeris, and Sephiroth remain some of gaming's most iconic and memorable characters.  And the supporting characters, major and minor, are also fascinating.  The guilt and dual-nature of Vincent Valentine, the relationship between Cid and Shera and his regret, Reeve's internal conflict, the stories of characters like Zack, Ifalna, and Lucrecia who reveal the origins of the crisis, are all interesting to explore and witness, along with the villians such as Rufus, Don Corneo, and of course, the truly despicable Hojo.  This is a story where people aren't always who you think they are, characters are in conflict with each other and themselves, and terrible losses occur on the way.  For gamers of my generation, there is a single scene I won't divulge here, but you'll know it when you see it, that sticks with you long after the game because of how strong the characters are.  As far as the game mechanics, it's pretty well done.  FF7 introduced the ATB timing system to Final Fantasy games, which combined real-time and turn-based mechanics very well.  Like other FF games, it's about a lot of stats, a lot of random fighting for experience and AP, and I lot of organizing equipment screens, but the systems in FF7 are not so intimidating or confusing as other games in the genre.  Many of the stats don't have a lot of importance in most situations, making fine-tuning the numbers less necessary so long as the characters are leveling enough and have decent gear.  What makes FF7 unique, even among FF games, is the materia system.  By arranging gems called materia, a character can gain magic and special abilities and change them as necessary between fights.  Unlike FF8's junction system which discouraged the use of magic, FF7's materia grows in strength when it is used and equipped.  The materia system is something I've always liked about the game.In many ways, the game hasn't aged perfectly.  Mainly the graphics, and the wonderful soundtrack was originally presented in a midi format. This version updates the midi to OGG, but still isn't great.  Unfortunately, the excellent work by the Qhimm forums on restoring the PC version of this game to greatness is not compatible with the new release of the game, only the original and Platinum Hits versions.  Overall, this game is legendary, and essential for anyone who calls themselves a gamer.  If you play normally, expect 40 hours of gameplay, if you choose to explore and look at everything while combing for secrets, make that 60-80, and if you rush and use walkthroughs, you can do it in 20.

												My first Final Fantasy game, which might explain the slow (~8-12 hour) learning curve to completely understand the mechanics, but once I got there there was no looking back. An engaging if at times goofy eco-terrorism main plot, buoyed by charming yet constantly out-of-place diversions makes for a fun, quality RPG experience; one that has made me add all the other FFs on steam to my wish list.

												Even after 16 years since it's original release, Final Fantasy VII is, without a doubt, one of the absolute best RPGs in existence. It's characters, story, and gameplay are some of the finest the JRPG market has ever had. This is a game that anyone should play through at least once. This port of the classic is definently worth purchasing for both veterans of FFVII and first-timers alike. Cloud saving is a very nifty feature that allows you to play your saves on multiple computers, although there are occasionaly network issues with it. The character booster will be a great tool for those who want to observe the story rather than focus on hours of grinding. The textures have been polished up nicely, and the FMVs look a lot smoother than before. Overall, this is a gaming experience worth having, and this is the perfect version for those who wish to try it for the first time. My only recommendation: Make sure you have a controller, as the standard keyboard controls are a bit wonky.			"

												Return to Midgar and defeat Shinra. A classic Final Fantasy that everyone loves and enjoys time and time again. Through the emotion, the sadness and the hardships. A game that should be experienced by all. If it really helps you to conclude the story play in this order:Crisis Core (PSP)Final Fantasy VII (PSX/PC)Advent Children (DVD/BluRay)Dirge of Cerberus (PS2)And then the story will be finished. Probably the most overatted Final Fantasy in existance with that much just to explain the lore and mythology of Final Fantasy VII, but it's still good nonetheless. But I think why it get's so much praise, it's the first game that a lot of people played first and introduced them to the RPG genre. But I honestly don't praise it that much... But it's good in it's own right. But do take it from me; Play it!			"

												I was seriously loving this game, up until the point where all of my saved game files were missing except for one I had towards the beginning of the game. My time played is a stretch, since I left the game on for some time, but I still had put in a decent amount of time goofing around, stealing ethers, learning monster skills, etc. So, now I've lost that progress, and I can either restart or quit. I've read up that this has something to do with cloud saving, but this game has been on steam long enough that it should have been fixed a LONG time ago. In my mind, this is the equivalent of if square had come into my childhood home, taken my ps1 memory card, doused it in gasoline and then flipped me the bird as they dropped the match. I'm sure I'll at some point grind my way back to where I was and use the work around, but if you don't want the headache, find another way to play this game. +Great story+Great old school RPG elements+Awesome characters-Takes all of those things and deletes them on a whim			"

												Final Fantasy VII is about a stuggling jack of all trades who, at one point, questions his sexual outlook. After spending some time living as a lady in the slums, he realises he isn't meant for such roots and decides to wage war on the local pimp who ♥♥♥♥♥s out woman as if they were objects.Together, with the help of his female companions, they strike down the slumdog pimp and soon set their sites on bigger motions in works, Why stop the lesser evils when they can overthrow a government who oppress their people in order to gain monopoly for themselves?Our hero, Cloud, then sets off, hesitantly, on his way to see change brought to the land and its people. Through trying times, he bonds well with those around him and gains invaluable strength and bravey through out. Soon the group learn they are in way over their heads when they come across a talking dog, who's tail is constantly on fire (he doesn't seem to mind, though), and through the actions of said dog, they learn of a great evil at work. Sephiroth.Sephiroth was once a mentor, an idol and symbol of hope to Cloud, and the world at large. However, after learning of dark secrets kept from him, Sephiroth seeks vegence on those who wronged him - the Goverment known as Shinra. He learns he is nothing more than a lab experiment and that his mother was an alien. Naturally, Sephiroth is all like ""hold the damn phone here, guys... The hell is this?"" - having never met his mother, his desire to be passionately held becomes unbearable, to the point of dangerous obsession. He even steals her dead head.So, Cloud and his merry crew, who at this point are like ""... This guy is mental, he's trying to summon a meteor with magic to kill everyone on the planet because he has mother issues... We should really do something about that"", go about in search of an even greater evil. That being Septhiroth.After some forsakend, unforgiveable, and downright ♥♥♥♥ing twisted, ♥♥♥♥ sucking, lego ♥♥♥♥ing, herpes ridden deaths and Cloud loosing his mind, because, you know... He isn't actually the person he thinks he is, they confront Septhiroth, give him a slap on the rest and tell him ""Mummy said you should be a good boy now"".That's pretty much Final Fantasy VII, oh and there's also naked men bouncing around on beds, girls dressed as beads... I mean BEES, some weird ninja girl obsessed with stealing and a dude with a gun for and arm who suffers with suicidal tendancy. Oh and there is Zack Fair. And snow boarding, there's also a dating simulation thing in there.

												Great game - Review is based on this version on PC not of FF7- The controls can be fine but it is poor at best with a keyboard.- You can use a gamepad but you need to rebind, not terrible- Having to log in and create a square enix account to even play is ridiculous- Better now, but there have been times you can't even play because something would be wrong with the square server or site so you couldn't play as you have to be ""logged in"" despite this being on steam.This is basically just the FF7 game that came out quite a few years ago on pc, except they put it behind having a Square Enix account and slapped it on Steam.If you want to play this game and you don't have a playstation and the disks I guess you could do worse as it is cheap during sales, but even 11 dollars is a bit much normally, otherwise just avoid on Steam specifically as it is just a money grab I made the mistake of buying into.

I do not wish to play with a visible Windows UI to counter a problem that should have been fixed upon release. That I have to make a Square Enix account to play this game is awful. Their services are buggy and it is a hassle. Fix this mess, please. Why do I have to play accountception to get access to a game I have PAID for? It is far easier and more convenient for me to download this game illegally - that is a sad, sad fact.Square Enix, please discontinue your bad service and embrace Steam.			"

												As someone who just missed this game when it came out, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to enjoy it so many years later, especially with so much hype around it.  Much to my great excitement, it not only held up, but far exceeded my expectations!  The story was great, with so many more twists than the lone one everyone knows, and the characters really stand out as some of the most colorful I've experienced.  If you're like me and have always meant to play this game but just haven't had a chance, snag yourself a copy and enjoy!(A note: The cloud saving is off by default and very finicky.  If you only intend to play on one computer, this won't be a problem, as it will just save locally.  If you plan on playing across a couple computers, you should go into the settings from the launch screen and enable cloud saving before you start to save yourself some trouble.)			"

												Well well, what must I say about this game, voted as one of the greatest video games of all time, seen as one of the best games in the Final Fantasy franchise, and known for its colossal impact on gaming? Well. If your a gamer like me, who plays games by heart and not eyes (heart being story and eyes being blown away from games featuring explosions guns and violence), then this is a game for YOU. Before I go in depth of how amazing this game is, I must tell you how I got into the Final Fantasy franchise. As a kid I shied away from the series because honestly the roman numerals in the games was just too confusing and at the time I was a strict Nintendo fanboy. Times have changed, I am no longer a strict Nintendo fanboy though I still am but now I accept other games. I gave Final Fantasy 1 a try and quickly got hooked. Then I moved on to 2 and at that point it was clear I am now a Final Fantasy fanboy. I then went to 3, and at the time (all of this happened recently btw), there was a Steam deal going on. The Square Enix publisher discount stuff. Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were in that, and I had some spare change and decided it would be a fantastic idea to purchase two Final Fantasy games with the highest amount of reputation within the franchise. I did not regret that decision, it was clearly worth buying. Now, back to our discussion on why the game is great. This game, is addictive. No, not addictive in a bad way like Minecraft (You know, playing all day losing your mind). Addictive story-wise. The story in this game is ENGAGING ON SOO MANY LEVELS. IT DOES NOT AT ALL FEEL LIKE I AM PLAYING A GAME ITSELF, BUT WATCHING A MOVIE WITH A DEEP STORY AND AMAZING CUTSCENES AND FLASHBACKS. The gameplay itself is interesting and apealing to me. When I play the game, I don't care for the gameplay, I am anxious to see what happens next in the story. When a game gets you feeling like this, it is clear why Final Fantasy 7 is regarded or arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Its games like this one we just don't see anymore, it really does suck because I myself wish that these games with all these DLC's and micro-transactions would just STOP and use this game as an analogy to what a perfect game should be. This game is a classic, I had no problems with it other than how frustrating it was to get my freakin Square Enix account setup. If you can get past that one problem, you got yourself a perfect beautiful game right here. In conclusion, I say if you are one who enjoys a great story with fun gameplay, then this game is worth your 12 dollars. Or, at the moment if the deal is still going, its half off.			"

												I absolutely loved this game on the PS1 and when this was released on steam my wallet jumped out of my pants from the other room and started to fill out my payment information! I was petrified to see this very odd encounter that was unfolding before my very eyes. Once the payment was complete and of course printing out my confirmation email and carefully writing down my confirmation number for my personal records I quickly installed and attempted to play my newly but oddly obtained copy of Final Fantasy 7!  I checked all the options within the launcher to make sure the upmost  compatibility. I click play and my screen goes black...appears this very ominous logo on my screen ""SQUARESOFT"". I wait.....I wait some more....I click, I press ESC, my heart begins to race as this mysterious logo just stays on my screen! I rapidly start spamming all the keys on my keyboard! nothing happens! I finally Ctrl+alt+tab and I become blinded by this blueish-green screen with a few options. I choose ""Open Task Manager"" and a new window appears! I decide to put this horrible experience to an end, I had to make this my seventh and final attempt to live this fantasy.			"

The story is amazing, but the game slows down a bit due to annoying mini games and some aweful music.  The midi music did not age well and has been ported to an MP3 format. If you are not a fan of the series, this is a good place to start.			"

I have a 660ti, so it's not my hardware at fault.Unless the Square Enix holding company can be bothered to update it for later operating systems and hardware, which I doubt - do not pay for this game.*Still struggling with presumably the resolution and mouse mapping to make it work.So far as I can tell, there has been zero support and upgrades for this game - I might as well run DOS-BOX or something.

												This was at least my 4th time playing through this game. First time playing any PC version of it. Fixes in the dialogue were made. I appreciated the bug fix for magic defense added from armor. The better graphic mode was neat, but I preferred the original mode. Don't really know why the bad midi soundtrack was ever a thing on these PC versions. Immediately replaced those files.This port is almost completely true to the original PlayStation version. There are some issues that I have begun to identify from these recent playthroughs, but this is still a great game for the same reasons I enjoyed it years ago.Edit: Had to confirm that you do get the proper music files now. You don't have to worry about downloading and replacing any game files.			"

												Nostalgia all over again...One of the most epic and well-known parts of the Final Fantasy series, a true masterpiece. This game may not be up to date and it certainly cannot beat what games nowadays can offer you but it is an important piece of gaming history. Something for old and new gamers. For new players it is recommended to go into this game without any expectations in order to fully understand the story and let yourself get sucked into it. For veteran players, well... you know why the money you've spent is worth every cent and with the Steam achievements you can at the same time reward yourself for your hard work.My advice:Buy the game if- you want to play one of the most influential games from the Playstation 1- love RPG games- love dramatic storylines- just want to try something fun- you are a Final Fantasy fan- want to relive your childhood memoriesI've played this game 7 years ago and I'm really happy that I was able to get a hold of it again. The graphics are slightly better than back on the Playstation 1. Even tho it might look the same, it has a slightly better resolution. "

												Final Fantasy 7 is considered by many to be the best Final Fantasy game to ever exist and is close to many people's hearts. While not being my favorite of the series it is certainly up there. If you want to play a classic final fantasy game this is for you. While being a port this game functions quite well on the PC and can even be played quite easily without a controller which is a major plus for those who do not have one. Adding achievements was a nice touch as well. There is little to say about this game that has not been said, it's a solid game and if you like RPGs you should definitely grab it.			"

												This was my very first Final Fantasy game and still one of my favorites in the series and of my greatest childhood memories, i loved this game back then and i still do today, but i will say that it is not the best Final Fantasy game and it is by far the most overrated one in the franchise.The materia system without a doubt my favorite thing about this game and is my favorite ""leveling"" system of all the Final Fantasy Games.The music is great just like most of Nobuo Uematsu's work, one of my favorite things about this game.The steam version also includes the PS1 soundtrack the original PC version didn't have :D (From what i'v heard it wasn't included at first when the game launched on steam until a few months later which is a lazy move on Square's part)! One of Nobuo's best works alongside Final Fantasy VIII.The story is not the game's strongest part but its far from bad.Most of the characters are pretty good though but not best in the series.The graphics may look silly by todays standards but back when it first came out i found them really impressive.However the minigames in this game are definently the worst part of this game, the chocobo racing is decent, raising them however is time consuming but still kinda fun, the Bike Race is fun too but aside from that none of the other minigames are fun or intresting.Also this might be somewhat of a nitpick but i think the Steam achievements are just made up with no effort at all, boring as ♥♥♥♥ and not intresting at all, oh wellFinal Verdict 8.8/10 if you are a Final Fantasy fan and you haven't played it yet i'd say its worth your time, and for those who havent gotten into the series its a decent game to start with.

												It's my first Final Fantasy game and up to now very cool! :-)If u wanna play this game without problems with the cloud saving, u have to exit FF7. Now open the Windows Explorer with the path to ur documents (e.g. C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\Square Enix\FINAL FANTASY VII Steam). Here u have to rename the file networkSettings.dat and start FF7 again. With this change the game work without cloud saving, which means u have to handle the backups of ur savegame by urself.			"

												If you're looking at the reviews for this you're either A.) Never played this game and looking to see what it is about...or B.) Played it and are looking to see how Steam does it.If you're an ""A"" -- don't worry this game has an amazing story, and in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest RPG's ever made.  Go ahead and spend the MASSIVE $11 (I paid $40 for it retail the day it came out for the good ole PlayStation!)  The review for you ""B"" guys is below.Despite some personal technical difficulties with saves and re-downloading this is for the most part much improved over the original version.  I'm not 100% on this but I feel like the dialogue got cleaned up a lot, it just flows more like native English and less like a half-decent Japanese translation to English.  The only downside to me is that it doesn't seem to use the PS style of controller I wanted to use for playing it -- at least it doesn't let me use it very well.  However, it is perfectly fine for the mouse and keyboard.			"

And back then I only had the german version which is translated so awful that I didn't get half of the story.I highly recommend to get Tifa's Final Heaven, a compilation of different mods which affect gameplay, difficulty, models, textures, music and and and.

												Final Fantasy VII is universally recognized as the best installment of the series, and maybe one of the best RPG ever. I played the original, on the PS1, all the way through at least four or five times. FF7 was the only game I liked enough to get me to shell out the extra 20 bucks for the guide, just so I could find and/or beat every little side quest or hidden area. It absorbed many countless hours of my youth.Not to long ago, I found FF7 on Steam and quickly bought it for second time. Now I never did find my old guide (not that you need it with the internet), but I played Final Fantasy VII once again and loved every minute of it. I was reminded of it’s great story and characters, awesome weapons with unique leveling up, the way powers can be mixed together, and the great interface for both battle and world map. I enjoy that you can spend hours racing giant birds around for an awesome hidden item or fighting through a tough dungeon for a unique weapon. But the game doesn’t make you, very little of the required gameplay is grinding. This game does not require continuous, fast button mashing. So if you like to take frequent, short breaks from the game controller to enhance your video gaming experience, Final Fantasy VII is great for that.After completing this game once again, even though it took a bit longer because of that pesky thing known as a job, I still find it to be my favorite game ever. It has everything that made it great on the PS1, but the PC version is much smoother because of the updated hardware. If are a fan of the original, have played others in the series, or just enjoy RPGs or good games, it will be more than worth it to buy FF7, a great game all around.			"

												Final Fantasy 7 is considered by many to be the best Final Fantasy game to ever exist and is close to many people's hearts. While not being my favorite of the series it is certainly up there. If you want to play a classic final fantasy game this is for you. While being a port this game functions quite well on the PC and can even be played quite easily without a controller which is a major plus for those who do not have one. Adding achievements was a nice touch as well. There is little to say about this game that has not been said, it's a solid game and if you like RPGs you should definitely grab it.			"

												FF7 is a monolith of my childhood. How do you review a game with so much hype and pomp and fanatical emotion? It's easier than I thought it would be, given that I can play it again. It's just like I remember. FF7 is like putting on a warm sweater and drinking hot cider. It's a comfort-game. Let me explain.FF7 came out when I was 11. I did not get to play it until I was 12. Everyone told me how great it was--and how it was introducing western audiences to the Japanese RPG world by storm. So when I got a used Playstation, I got the game.I did not know it at the time, but this FF game was unlike the six that preceeded it in terms of setting and magic system. So I had no bias to base my analysis off of. All I knew was that the Materia system was great. It was easy to use and learn--and as I got better at the game, I began to think up more complex combinations of Materia and equipment. (Woo, Curse Ring and then Added Effect/Destruct in linked Armor slots) There were literally, thousands of combinations. And that's not even touching Enemy-Skill, Morph and Manipulate.The Materia system was rock solid. You could completely customize what characters you felt would be best for certain combinations. You weren't constrained by this idea of a Character Class--at least in regards to magic. In terms of weapons, yes, perhaps that was more restricted--but I loved it. Everyone was different--it was perfect. You could create an awesome balance between tanks like Barret and speedsters like Tifa---with characters like Nanaki, Vincent and Yuffie--who were skilled physically and magically.And of course, you can't have a game without good characters. Despite the foamy mustache that Square has gotten from milking FF7 for everything its got--don't believe what they've done to Cloud. In FF7, he was not the whiny little angst-machine that Square has turned him into. He went through big things in FF7 and he got low--but he came back. He got back up, dusted himself off and kept going. That was the entire point. But Square would have you thinking he spends all his time whining and moping around. Not true. When Advent Children came out, I was quite confused because their Cloud wasn't acting like...well, Cloud. Aeris is your Mary Sue Last of her Race, Magic MacGuffin Carrier Female White Mage thing. I make a point to get her out of my party ASAP. This is only because I personally don't like her. I hate her snippy attitude, her selfishness and her blatant disregard of everyone around her--except for Cloud. She is the most irritating character. However---that is just my personal opinion (besides, the game did me a solid and I forgave them at, you know, That Part). As a character--Aeris moves the plot along and she IS a helluva powerful White Mage/Magic User. When I have to have her with me, I always put Cover on her and Fury---so whenever she takes a hit for someone, it ramps up her Limit Break bar and then she busts out the Holy magic.Tifa kind of lists back and forth between annoying and cool. She's the fistfighter/monk character and between her and Aeris, I'll take Tifa. She can deal some real damage (Powersoul + Curse Ring = Constant 4x damage infliction) and she has a real connection with Cloud. Whereas with Aeris--her thing with Cloud feels very shallow---Tifa actually feels very natural with Cloud. She cares about him, deeply. And when you learn about him--he cares about her.Barret is your angry tank/heavy gunner. I would say he's probably the least characterized (except for Cait Sith) but he's a good long range strong arm. Nanaki, I really like too---he's very calm, collected and thoughtful. He's very reasonable, not one o pin blame like Barrett does sometimes.Cid Highwind is my favorite--tough-talking roughneck chainsmoking pilot. He gets jipped a lot for some reason. But he's the Reluctant Leader. He can lead, he's fine with leading---but he can also follow. He's not insecure like Barrett and if he needs to step up, he does. And his crew respects him for it. He's got balls--but he's not a jerk. Cid curses and is kind of rough and tumble---but when he makes that one short speech about how their planet is wandering small and lonely in the universe, it shows a little more in there.Yuffie is my favorite of the ladies. Okay, yes, she'll steal your stuff---but she has so much personality (and she doesn't fawn over Cloud). She's straight-forward, to the point, hilariously awful sometimes. And once you get her leveled up--she is a straight up badass. One of my favorite things to do when Cid is the leader---is put her, Vincent and Cid together to go on the Train Mission. OMG, funny. She is so hilarious. She's like a Chaotic Neutral---might save your life, might steal your car. And I love that about her. They seem to have gotten away from her character type later--which I think is a real shame. (Also, I ship Yuffie and Reno forever.)And then, of course, the Big Bad. THE Big Bad. Sephiroth. A psychotic momma's boy, who will kil you, your dog, your dog's puppies, your kitchen table and then burn your house down. He literally does not give a crap about anyone or anything--but gaining power and reclaiming Gaia for Jenova. His brutality is brought home--and made personal. Cloud's backstory with Tifa in Nibelheim, Zack and then finally culminating with Aeris in the Forgotten City. His menace, his power--its legendary. You hear about Sephiroth at the very beginning of the game. You don't even see him until several hours later into gameplay. And even then--its in Cloud's flashback. The way Sephiroth is presented is masterful. They talked it up, told you how strong and crazy-evil he was, built and built and built on it--until you finally get to see him for yourself and for once, he's everything that you've heard.This was what made it for me. Excellent pacing, a good blend of character types so that you can customize your party how you wanted (I'd rather not like a character, than be indifferent to the characters; FF8's characters were so bland--I hated it), an intuitive and creative magic and battle system, tons of sidequests, hours and hours of things to do. To just explore the World Map.I feel like this was Square at its very best. When they wrote a complex but compelling story, a game where--each time I play, I find something I didn't know was there. I only recently discovered the Curse Ring in Mideel--or if you visit Johnny's parents in Sector 7 before its destroyed, his father talks about Nibelheim (I was like: WHOA!) and countless other small details that enrich the gameplay. Its what keeps me coming back over and over again. I've played this game countless times--and each time, I enjoy it.   Yeah, the graphics are old. It doesn't matter--its the story, the mechanics, the characters. Advent Children had beautiful graphics, beautiful. But its story was completely lame, the plot was ridiculously stupid--it was all just fanservice. So I dont even bother with all the other stuff that Square came out with to milk the FF7 cow. I'd say they should just remake FF7---but I'm afraid they'd start messing around and changing things. Don't trust 'em. Haha.This is one game--where it lived up to its hype. It exceeded my expectations. I saw FF7 when it came out on EA's website and I about had a heart attack. I bought instantly, that very night, that minute. And then about a week later, it came out on Steam. And I got another copy on Steam--just so that I'd always have it. Look passed the graphics, immerse yourself in the story and the dynamic characters. It's worth it. I would have paid $30 for a copy of this game--and they're selling it for $12. Worth every penny.

-Quick Review-Final Fantasy VII (FF7) is a turn-based RPG that was released in 1997 on the Play Station Console by Square Co., Ltd (in 2003 they merged with Enix, creating ""Square Enix""). Final Fantasy VII (FFV) is one of the most popular games in the series.-please note before purchase-I need to add a comment that, I tend to review the game alone, however for Final Fantasy VII you are required to creature (or use an existing) Square Enix account. Achievements/Steam-Achievements, and other features are accessible through that account... I don't really know many of the perks because I just jumped through the hoops to play the game. But to some people, that's a deal breaker.I just wanted to give people a heads up. Thank you for reading the rest of the review.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You play the game as the main protagonist ""Cloud"", whom is probably tied for being the most iconic figure in the series with the antagonist ""Sephiroth"". You start the game as a member of the terrorist group AVALANCHE, Cloud has just been hired and is providing combat assistance to the group... Good thing too, the raid doesn't go nearly as planned.As the story progresses you're limited to only to the city of ""Midgar"", after hitting the pinnacle of the story within Midgar (oh, you'll know what I'm talking about, if you make it that far. I was praying for a save point, I wanted to go to bed). You'll suddenly discover the world is a much larger place then you ever thought.To people who are new to the series, it's easy to brush it off as ""oh, that's nice, a large world map *yawn*."" Try to imagine seeing it as a little kid playing the PlayStation? To many of my friends this was the first game in the genre they had played, so naturally it's actually a very memorable experience. After this excellent transition, you realize ""wow, this game is going to be a big long one"" and it is, it came in 3 disk set.Game Play: I needed to do some research to refresh some of the terms used to describe the Final Fantasy VII combat system. I have played several Turn-based RPG's, however FF7 utilizes ""Active Time Battle"". The main difference is that there's a visible timer that counts down before you can make your next move.I had no idea that's how the game worked, so when I first played and my enemy had hit me three times while I was trying to learn the menu... well... needless to say I was more than a little surprised. ""WHAT! You cheaters! I don't know what any of these moves do!"" I have no shame in admitting I almost lost my first battle, and I lost my first boss battle in the first 20 minutes of the game. Yeah, go ahead and laugh at me; but this was my first time encountering that mechanic.Outside of the combat, there are many in-game events that you do throughout FF7, sometimes it's pressing key sequences to ride a snowboard, or chocobo, or arm wrestle. While very fun with a controller and on the original game console... with a keyboard and mouse the controls and tutorial still use the old button names. So there's extra difficulty trying to accomplish those. I end up failing MOST mini events because I don't know which button I'm pressing.""Press select"" mmmmk, letssseee... which one is select... *presses X* *Cloud face plants*. Well that was fun, let's try that again...Achievements: There are 36 Achievements for Final Fantasy VII, and four categories; 1) Person joins your party, 2) you do your first breaker limit with that character, 3) you do your last breaker limit with that character, 4) Some ridicules long end game achievement.I've played 26 hours so far (05/14/15) and only have 10/36 achievements, so naturally getting all the steam achievements will be quite an accomplishment in this game.Price: Final Fantasy VII is priced at $11.99, considering the amount of time you'll spend playing FF7 to get through the whole story alone, that's a very fair price. However, if you're just collecting games to your ""maybe I'll play it someday"" list, you should probably wait for a steam sale.Conclusion: The only real negative things I have to say about the game is that I don't like making accounts to log into an offline-game (but that's just the way it is), and using a keyboard isn't nearly as streamlined and seamless as using a controller.I personally love the story, the characters, and will be spending more time playing the game, I suspect I've just moved on to disk 2, So I've still got a lot farther to go before I beat the game... Then there's the whole thing about figuring out the achievements.I recommend this game to anyone who played the original game and wishes for some nostalgia, people who want to experience ""Active Time Battle"" game play in an RPG, or anyone casually interested in the story behind any of the characters in the FF7 world.

												I remember playing this when I was around 9 or 10. I played it a good while and picked it up much later and started over. I've never actually completed it but it is marvelous. One of the best games I've ever played. Now, I've heard the port isn't so great but there are some good mods out there to restore it such as the improved PSX music and a more modern graphical update. Definitely worth it.			"

												This game is a true classic, and with the remake coming out, i think its great that you are able to get this game on steam for that nostalgic feel. Lots to do, and one of the best stories in gaming.			"

												I played this game since I was a child and unfortunately we all know how careless we can be with discs when we're young. I'm so glad that this finally arrived to steam. Being a big fan of the FF franchise I immediately scooped it up. :) Will always love this game and waiting for FF9 to hit the stores.			"

												A classic that needs no introduction. The story withstands the test of time if you can bear older graphics and some juvenility. I reccomend this game inspite of my not personally being a huge fan of Japanese RPGs or the Final Fantasy series. There is a reason VII had a movie follow up and so many spin off games.			"

												This was my very first Final Fantasy game and still one of my favorites in the series and of my greatest childhood memories, i loved this game back then and i still do today, but i will say that it is not the best Final Fantasy game and it is by far the most overrated one in the franchise.The materia system without a doubt my favorite thing about this game and is my favorite ""leveling"" system of all the Final Fantasy Games.The music is great just like most of Nobuo Uematsu's work, one of my favorite things about this game.The steam version also includes the PS1 soundtrack the original PC version didn't have :D (From what i'v heard it wasn't included at first when the game launched on steam until a few months later which is a lazy move on Square's part)! One of Nobuo's best works alongside Final Fantasy VIII.The story is not the game's strongest part but its far from bad.Most of the characters are pretty good though but not best in the series.The graphics may look silly by todays standards but back when it first came out i found them really impressive.However the minigames in this game are definently the worst part of this game, the chocobo racing is decent, raising them however is time consuming but still kinda fun, the Bike Race is fun too but aside from that none of the other minigames are fun or intresting.Also this might be somewhat of a nitpick but i think the Steam achievements are just made up with no effort at all, boring as ♥♥♥♥ and not intresting at all, oh wellFinal Verdict 8.8/10 if you are a Final Fantasy fan and you haven't played it yet i'd say its worth your time, and for those who havent gotten into the series its a decent game to start with.

												Release Date: September 3rd 1997.Console: Playstation 1.Ported to PC on June 24th of 1998.This game revolutionized the way the Roleplaying Games would be and graphics that came as a shock to most people who played RPG's. A stunning storyline and perfect battle system, this game has the most sold copies in the PLANET, a WHOPPING 10 MILLION Copies.Now ported to Steam, this game is actually MODDABLE. Meaning you can change the overworld graphics, change the Music, everything except storyline. This is one of the very best RPG's that exist. If you don't have this game, You aren't a gamer.GET IT.

												There's really not much I can say about Final Fantasy 7 that hasn't already been said. It was a revolutionary game and it changed the face of RPGs forever. Some say it was for the best, others disagree.In any case you've likely heard all the JRPG stereotypes, the random battles, and the menu based combat. The storyline is extremely character driven, and it's one of the highlights of the entire experience. That's not counting the large world you explore, the sidequests and all the optional content. Much of which most players don't know about until they read a wiki. Final Fantasy 7 is a game about replayability and choices, and one that anyone can enjoy.			"

												Wish this were a title with cards.FFVII wallpapers and emoticons would be great.Always been a fan of this game.  You have to play it at least twice to take it all in, I have gone through maybe 50 or 60 times on PSX, I bought this because my system wasn't loading the discs anymore.Now I can have it on pretty much any computer.  It requires so little to play :DIf you haven't played this yet, FF 3-8 are really the meat of the series.  Get these here on Steam, and the others over on mobile, the 3D remakes of the older FF titles are really good, I have the DS versions.I gave up on alot of games by Squeenix, but this game can stand the test of time.  I would have preferred an HD remastered edition to a rerelease of the exact PC and PSX game I already owned.  It is about high time Square gave the fans better things.I am still waiting for a sequel or remastering of Secret of Evermore.			"
