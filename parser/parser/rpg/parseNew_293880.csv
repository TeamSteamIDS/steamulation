												[h] Weirdly Nostalgic, Semi-Gamebook, JRPG Elements? Great Fusion! [/h]I bought 'Dark Scavenger', not really expecting too much. I figured it'd be a good way to waste an hour or so, in between more weighty games. However, I was hugely surprised by how good this game actually is.If you've ever played a 'Lone Wolf' or 'Fighting Fantasy' book, you'll be very familiar with the way the game is played - each ""page"" (location you visit, chosen by arrows) has an encounter (sometimes multiple) for you to take part in, whether it's a conversation, a fight, or an item to gain via a little puzzle. This harkens back to the early-mid 90s attempts to capture these style of gamebooks on PCs; Dark Scavenger manages to achieve this in a way I've never experienced before.The game's story follows you, a ""Dark Scavenger"", a being that can siphon the energy out of planets, and a crew of misfits who find you floating in space. The characters are a wacky bunch, but are also very interesting in spite of their ""zany"" initial appearances. There are a lot of excellent conversations to be had within the game, and the ""dark comedy"" tagline it advertises is not a misnomer at all - I've found myself laughing a lot at the various scrapes and events happening to the protagonist.Graphically, the game is simple yet aesthetically pleasing. There's barely any animation, aside from some flashes when weapons attack and so on. However, this really isn't necessary, as the game manages to get across everything it needs to with the little animation it provides. It still manages to provide exciting combat and fleshed out environments. Likewise, the music and sound effects of the game are apt also. Abandoned areas really feel abandoned due to the subtle sounds, and I defy you to dislike the jaunty battle music!The battle system is very similar to classic JRPGs like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. You fight alone, but have three options for each attack: 'Weapon' - direct attacks with weapons, 'Item' - use a variety of items with various effects, and 'Ally' - summon one of your many allies to help you out in the combat. Combine this with a huge amount of weapons, items, and allies, each with a limited number of uses, and you have a really varied and interesting battle system, yet one that is simplistic enough to be able to dive right into. Gaining new Weapons/Items/Allies is as simple as finding loot, each piece of which can be crafted into one of the three aforementioned categories. Therefore, you sometimes have to make very crucial decisions - is that one of a kind power-belt better turned into a mega-mace for attacking, an athletics-item, or a strong ally? You only have one, so which will it be?The bottom line is that this is a very cheap game for what it brings. If you enjoyed the classic adventure/choose-your-own-adventure games from yesteryear, especially Lone-Wolf, then this is the game for you. I planned to play it for an hour or so while I waited for a movie to begin. I never saw that movie - I didn't see why on earth I'd stop playing this game!			"

												This game looks like it could have been made in the 90's, and that is in no way a bad thing. All the artwork in the game looks like it was hand drawn and the developers use the minimalist static character design in a great and often fantastically funny way. The gaming world seems so focused on graphics nowadays they forget that graphics simply accentuate a game design, they do not make a game great. A great game touches a gamer's emotions and draws them into the world the designer has created. This game will absolutely suck you in and make you chuckle, chortle, guffaw, cackle, snicker, and maybe even regret (there can be some surprisingly dark consequences to your actions in such a light-hearted game.)So how to describe the game.. I'll start off by saying you will spend most of your time in this game reading. If you don't enjoy reading in your games then I suggest you move on right now. If you do enjoy reading then I highly suggest this zany space opera-esque adventure in which you are a Dark Scavenger! Your spaceship is out of fuel and it is up to you, the courageous Dark Scavenger who will use Your Mother as a meatbag to absorb about a million archer arrows meant for you, in order to save the day! This game plays like an epic game of MadLibs, but instead of just picking random adverbs and adjectives to make a story you will pick from your selection of Weapons, Tools, and Allies to deal with events that pop up, often resulting in laugh out loud situations. How do you get those weapons, tools, and allies you may ask? Well the game is broken into chapters. At the beginning of each chapter you will start with some sort of event in which you choose from a few dialogue choices. After an event ends there is a strong chance you will get some sort of weird object generously called ""loot"". After the event ends you'll be looking at a map of scenery in which you can point and click on various objects on the map. Clicking on those objects can often trigger events and lead to more loot, so scan that map closely! After you have found everything on that map there will be arrows you click on to lead you along to the next part of the map. After you click the arrow, if you found any loot, you will briefly be whisked away back to your three space alien buddies who happen to be excellent crafters. Lucky you. You will then turn your ""loot"" over to one of the three crafters and they will offer some sort of funny explanation to what weapon, tool, or ally they will create for you. Now that you have your real loot, what do you do with it? Well when you happen upon an event you are usually given several options of how you wish to deal with it, and are almost always given an option to use a weapon, tool, or ally to help you out. In each chapter of the game you only have X amount of uses of any given weapon, tool, or ally, so choose wisely (I found myself choosing by how funny I thought the result would read!) You do regain the uses in the next chapter though, so don't be afraid of using what you need to use. You'll work your way around the map from room to room in such a manner, gaining loot and power until you reach the end of the chapter where you'll face a boss.I've had such a blast playing through this game, and there is a New Game + mode so you can go back through the game and hand the loot over to different crafters than you did the first time so there is good replayability. Highly suggested for anyone who would enjoy reading about a wacky sci-fi adventure in which you create funny situations based on your actions in your epic quest for fuel and salvation from an ominous universal being. Worth every penny and I wish there were more adventures like this.			"

												updating review. evidently some people find my review helpful.The ""no"" is for the base price. $5 could buy you a lot better. Its too much for the kind of game Dark Scavenger is. Even getting the game on sale at $2.50 feels a bit like a gyp.  Dark Scavenger, and I know I'm going to get crapped on for saying this, feels and looks a lot like a flash game you could play for free on newgrounds. Hell, you could watch a playthrough start to finish on youtube and not lose much of the experience of actually playing it. There's not much to it.First: some people keep insisting Dark Scavenger is part jRPG. This is untrue. The closest the game gets to being a traditional jRPG is having menu driven combat and that's it. There's very little RPG about Dark Scavenger. It is almost entirely a choose your own adventure point and click game.Dark Scavenger is a real one-note game. Its very search about the screen for things to click on, an event triggers, fight maybe, ""scavenge"" an item, and craft it into equipment to use in events/fights. That's really all it is. Lather, rinse, repeat.There's no real challenge. There are only bad guesses at what to do during an event. The battles themselves are similar in that while you may choose the best weapon or item to use against enemies, luck usually plays role in how effective they are if they work at all.The sole thing Dark Scavenger has going for it is the writing. What the game lacks in depth, it makes up for with screwy odd-ball over the top writing and art direction which is usually amusing and adds a great deal of charm. Sadly, that's really the only thing Dark Scavenger has that's any good. That's what most of the positive reviews are raving about.			"

												I put this game on my wishlist after seeing it on the sidebar and seeing how it looked interesting, it looked like this space game I saw in a magazine when I was a kid (tried looking for the name of the game, but couldn't find it), So I thought I'd eventually buy it down the road expecting it to be a somewhat mediocre game that'll give me a few hours of gameplay. Well, the game went on sale with the Thanksgiving sale, bought it for almost 3 bucks, and stayed up all night playing it, it was that good.You play an alien that's stranded out in space, who soon comes across a galactic being who wants to consume you. After defeating him you're left to rot in space for years and eventually you're picked up by a group of aliens called the Dark Scavengers who are pretty much intergalactic junkers who invite you to join their crew if you can help them by finding a fuel source for their ship. This leads you to going down to the nearest planet full of your typical medieval fantasy setting including a race of giant masked wrestlers, crazy drunk bandits,  and an armored smart♥♥♥♥♥space raptor with a giant gun who wants you dead.The story for this game is absolutely amazing. There are constant twists in the story, characters that you get emotionally invested in, and even extremely interesting concepts that get explored. Each character has their own personality and always has you wanting to learn more about them. You'll constantly be laughing at the crazy situations and humorous characters you find yourself interacting with.Unlike Mass Effect 3, your choices actually matter in this game. You can kill everything you come across right away, or talk to them and get useful items and information or even backstabbed. There's several different endings depending on what you do in the final chapter.The combat is a bit different from other rpgs. There is no leveling up in this game. Combat is focused around finding objects through battle and having the dark scavengers turn them into either weapons, items, or allies. The vast majority of objects (i'm talking around 95%) have multiple options on what you can turn them into. You may find a bone that you can turn into a weapon that does wind damage, a controller which increases your damage for the next turn, or a zombie ally. You may only choose one of these, and you can't go back on your choice. All items, allies, and weapons have a certain number of uses before they break, and you won't get to use them anymore till they replenish at the start of the next chapter, making it so you have to have a balanced between all 3 categories. The only flaw in this system is that the majority of the time the Dark Scavengers don't give you good hints on what they're about to make for you.Combat is done with you going first followed by all enemies. You can stun enemies using elements they're weak against, which loses them their turn, allows you to use stuff that's strong vs stun against them the next turn, and refills your healing potion (restores you to full health when you click it). Enemies are even strong vs certain elements which makes them take little damageAlso all weapons, items, and allies have different characteristics. A weapon might be a long bladed weapon or a short blunted staff, or fast strong ally. You may run into an event (events happen regularly) which you need a long bladed weapon to attack with, or you may get stuck in a whirlpool which you need a strong ally to help you out. There are also weapons and allies that effect certain enemies, like ones with their mouths open or enemy with their feet on the ground. This adds a lot of uniqueness to the game.The game takes about 4 and a half hours to beat, but once you do you get access to New Game Plus. Once you beat it you'll be wishing that there was a sequel to continue the story (which the ending sets up for). I honestly recommend buying this for full price, it's only 5 bucks, but you'll more than get your money's worth.			"

												To be honest when I first saw Dark Scavenger here  on Steam I was mildly interested and thought this was just another RPG.      However it is far diffferent than just another RPG game. To describe Dark Scavenger then I would state it is a point n click RPG game with twists of comedy and bizareness.  When encountering enemies in this game there are plenty of other means to rectify the situation. If you love RPG games and love to laugh while also being able to make choices in this game, then stop reading and go buy it! "

												What a gem. It's the perfect marriage of RPG ""dungeon"" crawlers and choose-your-own-adventure books. Don't be fooled by the UI – it's better to think of the game as a descendant of text-based adventure games. And the great writing does glue everything together. It will have you giggling, or, in those moments that the game has sufficiently worn down your defenses, laughing uproariously. Definitely a cult classic – I would have loved to have played this game when I was still a kid!			"

												You have probably had a weird dream sometimes. Like one of those exciting-but-absolutely-weird dreams, full of action, strange persons/creatures and occurrences. Well, that's precisely what this weird RPG adventure feels like. The humour is great, the story is amusing and the characters are quite vivid. For hard core fans of the genre and those expecting a traditional RPG, the game might be a bit too tongue-in-cheek to enjoy fully. Just tune your expectations accordingly and enjoy the ride.			"

												I. What. Oh god. My brain. This game. Where do I. What do I. I don't even.Okay, get a grip. You've seen crazy before. You've read crazy before in books, calm down, this is fine, everything is fine, take the pills, breathe. Relax, relax. Okay, Dark Scavenger - Roleplaying game, mostly a point and click with turn based combat, though without levelling (that's handled with the loot you gain opening up progressively more and more powerful tools as the game progresses), where you play the part of ""an human"" who for some reason ended up in space, alone, with naught but a spacesuit on. At least, I hope you've a space suit on. You meet a creature called ""Den"", a big giant spacefaring blob, who beats you up and leaves you for dead.When you come around you find yourself on a ship home to three alien scavengery sorts, who immediately promote you, you lucky soul, to general gopher, and person who's going to get beaten senseless. In exchange, they agree to convert any loot you find into items that will surely help you to help them keep their rickety little spaceship going. Cue the game proper beginning. You are told that the ship is nearly out of fuel but thankfully the planet nearby happens to have a fuel source, unfortunately, it's in the hands of the bandits. You've been told that you're off to get the fuel, in exchange for your continued passage on the ship, and the services of your three newfound friends.Mechanically, you move from room to room, represented by static screens with highlighted ""hot spots"" which bring up text style choose your own adventure style dialogs, depending on what you pick you may end up in combat situations, or you may gain items, or gain life / lose life, or even end up dead. Such is the way of the game, the events are far, far off the insane end of the spectrum, and you'll quickly find that your arsenal will consist of things that shouldn't make sense, whilst fighting things that make no sense.There is a story in the madness somehow, in so much as your arrival may well change events which are playing out on the planet you've just landed on, but given the madness inherent in what you're playing it's a bit hard to make out all the fine details when you end up creating ""your mother"" as an ally (no, not a joke, you can summon your mother as an ally, and she stuns all opponents if you're at low health). The best way to enjoy this game is to take it on it's own terms, almost as a Hitchhiker's guide with fighting thrown in, for the ridiculously low price point - it's a steal, and an easy sell in my book, for any RPG fan.Just don't play this game on any psychoactive or hallucinogenic substances.

												3 minute in-depth review of Dark Scavenger: 


YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Dark Scavenger Critique (Full Review) 

			Views: 816		

			An in-depth critique by SwashbucklingSir of the bizzare and witty Dark Scavenger, an old-school adventure with great humour. Dark Scavenger has been released on Steam a few days ago!		

Spoiler-free story impressions: Overall story arc is not very intriguing, since most of its depth and detail only becomes apparent during the end screens of the game. The motivation for progression stems from the little side stories and the overall brilliant writting of snippets. If you like bizarre writing along the lines of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or anything by Monty Python, you'll love Dark Scavenger.Graphics: Old-school vibe highly reminiscent of fantasy novel covers of the late 80s and early 90s. It does not look great, but it surely has character.Sound: The weakest link of the game. The effects are highly repetitive and there is a lack of variety in music. The little there is, is good however.Gameplay: Adventure point-and-click exploration mixed with classical turn-based RPG combat. The choices you make can influence whether you'll have to fight someone or you might have him/her on your side later on. Nontheless, the combat system gets repetitive later on, since once you figured out the weaknesses of the enemies, you'll stick to specific attack patterns that are most effective.TL;DR: Dark Scavenger is a bizarre and genuinely funny game with a playtime of roughly 5 hours. Afterwards it also features a New Game Plus mode. Worth the asking price!			"

												I cannot recommend this game more highly. It may not be suitable for those who like bells and whistles and constant blood. But for the discerning adventure/rpg enthusiast, Dark Scavanger offers a fresh and satirical take on the genre while casting eyes back to the days of early crpgs.The mechanics are simple, but beneath the point and click interface interesting choices can be made. Some choices are available depending on whether you have the right weapons, equipment or allies. You acquire these items by finding artifacts as you uncover the mysteries of the planet below. One of three aliens aboard the ship you reside – Kamaho an undead weapons master, Falsen a greenish trickster, and Gazer a mute and very alien alien – will forge the artifact into something unique.Story and writing are the main selling points of Dark Scavenger. I won’t spoil it by going into detail. Enjoy the humour, quirkiness and silliness of this inventive and imaginative journey that you won’t want to end. I wish more games were like this.			"

												This game in many ways reminds me of Zork minus the art work (now that will date me - Zork as far as I know was the first actual computer game; a text based choice adventure, played on a mainframe, back in the day when one needed punch cards and PCs did not really exist, circa early 1980s).  I digress.  Dark Scavenger is a bit point and click, a bit hidden object, a bit text based D&D choice driven adventure with quite a bit melee mixed in using the crafted weapons, items and allies one has managed to scavenge and a whole lot weird.  Odd characters, even stranger allies, and relatively conceited enemies make this game uniquely interesting.  This game seems simpler then it actually is, and dying can happen easily by making wrong decisions or choices.  Choices really matter, especially in combat where melee attacks are limited to what weapons one has available to use.  Hopefully along the way one has made the correct decisions on who to craft with, where one has looked for items, what information one has managed to gather and what action has been taken in a situation.  As I stated before this game seems far easier then it actually is and requires thought and planning to get through.  Though I did not pay full price, I would have.  The price is worth it for a game that is ... as Monty Python would say ... ""and now for something completely different"" because it is ""completely different"".			"

												Don't let this game's modest price tag fool you, what's offered here for $5 most games don't deliver at double that price. Dark Scavenger is a choose-your-own-adventure JRPG in which the choices you make will directly impact your experience, often making the game either easier or harder and sometimes downright impossible. Items you find while scavenging can be crafted into 1 of 3 types of gadgets (weapons, items, allies) which usually provide something of value although rarely you'll end up with a bricked gadget which is by all accounts useless. Much of the game's humor is achieved by offering the absurd or unexpected along with the occasional one liner which is tailored to the scene as are most of the dialogs in the game, you won't find any copy pasta here. Dark Scavenger is all about the choices you make; every battle, every room, and every dialog has the potential to alter your journey forever.			"

												Okay. Okay. Just finished the game not too long ago, but holy s***t! Dark Scavenger is one of those games that can make you laugh during the whole experience - whether it be the dialogue choices, your trio of constant compainons , enteractions with enemies and (potential) allies are what gamers will remember most. The gameplay is point and click with rpg elements; meaning you can choose navigation, finding clues to defeat enemies/bosses and whatever loot you find can be shaped into a weapon, item or ally (each with its own quirky title and definition). Towards the ending the plot does escalate but leaves on a promising yet somber note. All in all good game.  8.5/10			"

												I recommend getting this game, but definitely not at 7€ price, rather around-below 3. It would be a superb deal for 1€,  as the game is a little bit crude, but it was made with a lot of love and care.The game is a little weird mix of visual novels, point and clicks and choose your own adventures. Basically the game goes on a ~top-down map where certain locations can trigger choose your own adventure-type parts where depending on your choices can fight, avoid it sometimes, and/or find new items. Every time you move on from a smaller location (like a meadow with 3-4 hotspots) you're taken back to the ship where your 3 companions can craft an item from each piece of the loot you got. You'll get an overly scientific description for a weapon, a crazy one for a usable item, and a mute alien will play charades to explain what a summon would do. A golden axe can get sharper, can get reforged into a shield or made into a summon. The writing of this part outstanding, and there are a lot of weird items to get, like an item that stuns stupid enemies. Or enemies who have more than 10 words in their descriptions. There are maybe 5? type of resistance and weakness in fight, and in many story parts you'll need fire weapon to make light, sharp one to cut something, etc.The story has two warring factions + wild animals, corrupted enemies, sidequest-like unique NPCs, recurring boss-characters with whom you'll get some story - in some fights you can get adventage if you halt the enemies with talk.I don't think I'll try new game+, but while the game lacked the gameplay variety, it had a nice little campaign going on with enjoyable fights and interesting events inbetween (For example I used Your Mother to weight down a chair on a trapdoor :) ) - maybe I'll swing a few people to get this game during a discount, or if it will get bundled again.

												A great gateway drug to gamebooks, Dark Scavenger is a genre melting pot of visual novel, adventure, and turn-based RPG. Every room has new dangers, goodies, and choices to make, and each return trip to your spaceship lets you get some new swag that will help you in future battles.The battle system is on the Dragon Quest side of simple, but it's functional enough and the item/party member descriptions are great.

												Dark Scavenger is a real fun point and click rpg/adventure.  It's funny and most of the times lighthearted.  It's short (took me about 4 hours to beat) but has enough replay value for you to want to play it atleast 3 times over. It's very reminiscient of an old flash game in terms of layout but is longer, has much more content, and is obviously proffesional grade.  That being said I think for it's 4.99 price tag this it's a great buy, but it wont be your cup of tea if you're looking for a blockbuster.			"

												What I liked most about this game was the fresh mechanics. I was constantly pleasantly surprised that the game did not behave like I had grown accustomed to. The story made me feel, the encounters made me laugh and think, and all of the art was visually appealling. I would certainly recommend this game.			"

												I started playing this game with the expectation that it would be pretty ridiculous. My expectations were fulfilled, and I still had a lot of fun.If you like casual, comedic turn-based RPGs that remind you of those choose-your-own-adventure books (decision trees), then you will probably really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good - the artstyle is definitely not the best, however, it is stll nice and works well with the overall feel and atmosphere of the game. The music and sounds are decent. The story is okay, nothing too crazy. Your 3 teammates are available to talk to between missions, each with different personalities. My favorite is the alien who has no mouth, and communicates solely with exaggerated gestures.The controls are simple - you just need to click your mouse to select options in battle. The beginning of the game puts you in a quick, informative tutorial battle. The learning curve is minimal, and you are not really punished for dying because you can restart at different points and will even have your potion (refills over time) at refilled if you decide to retry your last battle.During battle, you can use different weapons (durability dicatates how many times you can use it), items, and/or allies to help you succeed. You can also use your fists to attack, which will not reduce any durability from your equipment. Next to your health, a potion that refills over time puts you back to full health can be used.After you win a battle, your enemies will drop loot. Then, you can choose to explore the area you are in before moving on to a new one. When you explore, many times you will come across an event and have to make decisions - potentially resulting in loss/gain of health, avoiding/not avoiding a battle, or trading/using an item to get a different one (doing this reduces your chosen equipment's durability by 1). I have noticed that when you move on to a new mission all of your items will be restocked and refilled.When you are done looting and exploring, you can choose to move to any applicable area (left, right, up, or down). After you select an arrow, you will be presented with your ship's room, where you can use your loot and give it to one of 3 crewmembers. This is probably one of the best parts of the game.Each Dark Scavenger specializes in different things (weapons, items, allies), and they can only be used once per room visit, meaning that you can't simply use all your loot to keep making weapons (if you have more than 1 loot per room visit).The funniest thing here is that the information your teammates will give you is based on their personality, so you have to decide who to use based on their responses, rather than knowing exactly what will be made. For example, if you have a broken sword loot item and hover over each teammate, they will tell you what they think they can make with it, but the rest is up to your interpreation - since the ally crafter has no mouth, he will use gestures to try to show what he can make with your loot (ex: he holds his arms out like a zombie = zombie ally | he nuzzles against you, making you uncomfortable = an ally that stuns groups).While exploring, you may be presented with the opportunity to use different things from your inventory (this is almost always the better option than just ""going for it""). For example, if you see a boiling pot of liquid, you can either try to scoop the liquid out with your bare hands (resulting in loss of health) or use a container item (ex: a potion or any other applicable item). The game does a good job of deciding what works and what doesn't, and this variety makes playing the game very, very surprising and fun.If you like casual RPG play with comedic elements, give this game a try.Recommend!

 ""Hey, Kamaho, what can you make out of this rope?""  ""Mmm, Homing Missiles? "" Uhm, okay, Get on it.""    Dark Scavenger puts you in the roll of a human(or something like that, game doesnt say) ""lost"" in space and you are being saved by 3 aliens who then sent you on a dangerous mission to help them out (what a save!!). Game combines Point-and-click exploration, text-based adventures and RPG turn-based combat and decision making but the main thing that grab me is the variety of tools given to you. Story While the writing is top notch, its focused on the moment so there isnt that big plot to follow( its just stuff given at the start of the game and then at the end) so you can just focus on your exploration. During your adventure you will get help from your 3 alien allies :  Kamaho - weapon crafter and fills the role of the generic NPC you often meet in the games( always serious!!!) ; Falsen - the master of puns( bad or good its all up to you) ; Gazer - alien without mouth but always seems that he is trying to talk. With the help of the gang( by making stuff for you while you do the fighting) you need to find a fuel source(well they found it but you need to get it) so they can survive in SPACE. The source is on a planet near you so they beam you down and you start your adventure. Gameplay Gameplay consists of Exploration, ""Crafting""/Equipment and Combat. Exploration The funniest part of the game. Now lets see what steps you can take while exploring : First you are in a room with several objects to interact with . Always be careful how you pick them because it matters at times ( Example : I crushed a cage with a bird inside because it bit me but on the next object I clicked I found bird food so I ended up losing an item). Once you click on an object you will enter the text adventures which often leads to decision making which includes dialogues or actions. For actions you will be mainly asked how to proceed : use your bare hands/body, use weapon/item/ally or go back.  Using the right KIND of equipment always lead to success while using yourself mainly leads to harm.Dialogues are weird because well... cant say really... it's just that often make no sense. Sometimes there is logic sometimes is completly random.Once you interact with all objects you found(some can be well hidden) you have to go to another room by clicking on an arrow(you dont need to interact with all objects if you dont want to risk it). But before you are send to the next room you will have to use the items you found which leads to Equipment and crafting making new tools for your adventures. Now lets start with equipment(or you can call them items/tools w/e you want since you dont really equip them as in other games) . There are 3 kind of tools on your disposal : Weapons, Items(consumables) and Allies. Each one of them got durability . Whenver you use them(combat or exploring), the items lose 1 durability unless its stated otherwise.I dont think I need to explain how to use them since each one of them got short and well written description though it needs sometime to get used to how the game plays itself but lets get on the more important part: how you acquire this stuff. Well, you give them to your allies on the ship.Kamaho can make weapons, Falsen can make items and Gazer makes you allies(dont ask how because I have a bit of a hard time imagining). You can use them only once per visit(aka you cant use 2 items to make 2 allies in 1 visit) so you have to pick wisely what you want out of each item(dont do like me where I decided to turn a sacred amulet into a weapon and ended up with a pointless stick). This trick gives quite high replay value to the game if you want to see what kind of items the devs got prepared for you. And once you are done crafting lets start fighting. Combat Combat is generic turn-based system. You need exploit the weaknesses of your enemies or die trying. One thing worth noticing is that not every item you use ends your turn(its show in the right bottom corner in a box if it ends your turn or not). I found the combat to be quite challenging because of the durability system so it requires some thinking in case you end up needing a tool for later. But stay calm, at the start of each chapter you will get back all the charges and items back to use so feel free to use them as much as you want. Save system is quite nicely made since it saves after each interaction so if you die during combat you will be put at the start of the fight unless the enemy got forms.. then it will restart from the last form( example : boss has 2 forms, you were able to reach 2nd form and you died so game will restarts from 2nd form). Replay value and lenght As said the game has a decent replay value ( 4-6 runs or a lot more if you want to find everything) and the lenght is able to allow that ( average 3 hours). There is a New Game+ that I'm yet to try so cant talk about it. Is it worth it? Answer this questions:Do you like text-based adventures?Do you like silly/random writing?Do you like challenging turn-based combat?Do you like replaying games?If you have 3 yes then go ahead and buy it. If not... you can still buy it and give it a whirl but I can say that its worth every penny . "

												Dark Scavenger is a fairly unique game and represents a hidden gem of the indie scene.  The main focuses of the game are on decision making, story, combat (a more fun version of JRPG combat style), humor, and loot. Loot in this game is not your regular loot, but more on that later.Each level is composed of multiple areas and (you don't need to visit every one), and each area has interactive objects that you can click on. This procs either combat, dialogue with decisions that have major impact, loot, or combination of those. A clever dialogue option and/or a smart use of your items, yields rewards, but  also keep in mind, if you don't focus on the game, you may get punished as well (don't worry, there is barely any memorization).Loot has a central part in  the game and after each area transition you get your friends (a skeleton engineer, crazy green alien in a suit, and an alien that can't speak) to make weapons, items or allies out of it. They each explain what loot will you get from them in their own unique way (remember the alien that can't speak?). It's not always obvious what will you get, but that's what makes the game even more interesting.All in all, Dark Scavenger offers a refreshing experience and a rewarding story if you enjoy games with dialogue options and relatively unique mix of gameplay elements.

												An absolute steal for $5.There is definitely a nod to old school RPG games here, but completely reinvented. I have never seen an inventory system like this before, and I was very impressed. One of the driving strategic impulses of the game is the conversion of scavenged loot into more powerful weapons, supplies, and even allies. Other impressive features include unique sentient monsters, dialogue/story options with consequences, and a completely glitch free experience.Well done!			"

												When I first saw a youtuber play this game one year ago, I found it to be quite intriguing and very much to my liking. More specifically, the gameplay and art direction. Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to buy the game myself and only bought it a few days ago upon discovering a location to buy steam cards.After finishing this game, I feel tempted to write a good review for it. Here's a few reasons why:Unique gameplay: The gameplay of this game is akin to a interactive book combined with a video game with the point and click exploration element added to the mixture. Basically, you click stuff, engage in battles and obtain loot. Loot can be used to craft special items and it also depends on the crafter you choose. Kamaho, the skeleton ""warrior"" will make weapons for you. Falsen, the green goblin looking guy will create wacky items for you and Gazer, the alien thing will summon or make allies for you. This adds quite a bit of replayability to the game (especially with the new game plus that allows you to keep all your items from your previous run). Choices that you make impact the game in small ways but never really diverge from the main linear plot line of the game. As such, making certain decisions may result in obtaining ""extra loot"" or just some extra details about the world you are exploring. Plot: The plot is kinda that a science fiction adventure. You are stranded in space after a battle with a mysterious creature called ""Den"" and wake up to find yourself in a spaceship with three aliens on board. The aliens request for your help in obtaining fuel to sustain the ship and you somehow find yourself accepting the quest. The rest of the game is just exploring the world to find the mentioned fuel. Apart from that, the storytelling sometimes takes on a dark humour like tone (with Juno (some random person you meet twice or thrice) lying dead on the floor in the next area with no prior explanation.) which could be quite entertaining to read. Overall, the storytelling is splendidly done to resemble an actual storybook and I find myself having no faults with it.Art:The artstyle is simply amazing. It resembles the artstyle of video games in the 1990s while also looking like a picture book. Keep in mind that my opinion about the artstyle is subjective as I really appreciate old school artystyles.Music:The music is quite fitting with the battle scenes and the game itself. Not much else to say about it really. (P.S. I can't really good a decent comment about music in general)The only con I find with this game is that it is a little too short and I would had liked to explore more of this world. Nevertheless, this is still a very good game and I would recommend you to try it.Rating:8.5/10			"

YouTube™ Video: Dark Scavenger: Impressions 

			Views: 277		

			Dark Scavenger: Impressions Dark Scavenger is a turn based, point and click RPG. We take a look at it's strengths and weaknesses as we explore what the game has to offer.		

Above is my video impressions of the game.Dark scavenger has an unique blend of point and click adventure games with a lot of RPG elements. The visuals is ""take it or leave it"" but the real stregnth is in it's writing, and characters. The humor is right on point, had a few genuine LOL moments, and it features a interesting dialog mechanic where it's possible to get out of some encounters through diplomatic means.Overall, if you are into unique and well written stories, strong characters, and don't care too much about polish dark scavenger is well worth the asking price. But if you are sensitive to presentation dark scavenger's debatable visual style might be a bit off putting.Strengths:- Great writing- Likable characters, even the villains- Genuine humor- An interesting conceptWeaknesses:- Debatable presentation quality- A niche game, some will really like it, some will hate it			"

												Point and click adventure with an interesting storyline. You're an alien exlporing another planet in the midst of a war. Your goal is to find something called a ""gissa core"" to power your spaceship. Different choices you make affect the game. Find items to create weapons, new items, or allies. Depending on certain choices, it may require some thinking and recalling information learned about the game's lore. Of course, you could just rush into battle at every chance, but that would use up valuable items. Your choice. Other battles can be avoided if certain items are obtained. Basically, a fun adventure game with lots of options.			"

Posted: December 16, 2015
												I've been meaning to write something nice about this game for a looong time. Let that sentence be your TLDR, or read for a while longer if it pleases you.Old choose your own adventure books were a sort of very early ""random"" generated adventure games where you would ""play"" a character in a story that progressed differently depending of your choices. The choices were not open ended, leading either to instant death, progressing in some way, or devious later instant death when you missed something important on an earlier page. The progression was linear, and while it branched somewhat, the roads taken would crystallize into one or two endings, depending on the length and complexity of the adventure. As with any genre of book, game or book/game hybrid there were categories of both comedy, high adventure, gloomy dunkelkeit and of course some smut <3Some books in the genre were single quest deals leading the player down exotic locales or dark environments. Others came in sets that followed a linear progression between books, each new installment assuming you completed the earlier ones.This game is very much the first cathegory of adventure book where the story is exotic, strange and stand-alone. The player faces off in space versus a cosmic monstrosity easily dominating them and taunting at their demise. In the nick of time the player is saved by three very strange aliens who introduces themselves as ""dark scavengers""; looters of planetary energy, forever traveling and therefore always looting. As their newest member (and the only one who can fight) you are sent down to a nearby world where planetary energy can be harvested. This is where the game begins.The game is divided into a series of levels that, in turn are divided into a set of ""rooms"", similar to an adventure book's pages. Each room has a couple of challenges for the player to attempt, yielding loot when successful and damage or other penalties when not. Items aquired can then be used to solve subsequent challenges, awarding the player with an ever larger array of solutions to problems. And what solutions they are! As for the first set of categories a CYOA could be mentioned to have this game is very much in the comedy section of things. Instances, combat, and even crafting your gear is all permeated with a stellar sense of humour that will have you staring at the screen in disbelief and glee. The world is interesting! The characters inhabiting it are funny! The comical timing is spot on! But aside from being witty, the game is above all else smart.Now how can I explain that..?*SEGMENT IS SLIGHT SPOILER OF GAME MECHANIC THAT IS FUN TO DISCOVER FOR YOURSELF*Well, for starters the game makes the best of its newfound tendency towards the game part of its Book/Game hybrid existance. Say for example that you face of against a bandit and combat ensues. Normally in an adventure game, and in some types of rpg's where the action keyword is absent from its genre title, combat would take place through the taking of turns, opponents slugging each other untill abilities come into play. So too here, but with a twist. Knowing the player can only experience the world through still images, items (used both for combat and environmental encounters) all react to the way a character looks. In his still picture, the bandit is jumping towards you with an axe in hand and with a crazy snarl on his face. In this case, the dentists drill will deal huge amounts of damage since his teeth show, the wind bag will stun him since he is up in the air, and the magnet will take his weapon, weakening him. Of course it would be silly to assume the bandit is always jumping in the air with his mouth open rendering him forever vulnerable to our very situational items. Lucky for us however the game figures its silly rules is better than realism it couldn't fake anyway :>*END SPOILER*Long, less spoilery story short; it plays around with genre conventions and mechanics as well as being genuinely humorous.Dark Scavenger is one of those games where you would like to see more of the world and the characters that inhabits it, but somehow know that to experience them in any other way than this specific game's would somehow spoil the magic. The game never lets itself get old and is surprisingly varied both in terms of difficulty, encounter types and tone. It leaves itself open for an impossible sequel but still somehow feels complete, like an expensive meal where the only regret after finishing it is not being able to have it again.Its like nothing. Costs basically nothing as well, so don't take my word for it. If you felt even a little compelled to check it out after reading this or the opinion of others I would say go for it! It will have you entertained in that ""ah good times"" way where you remember it later with a smile.Sountrack´s nice too. and FYI it is about 6 hours long.			"

												Not the worst game I've ever played, and the mix of 2D-adventure and RPG-lite isn't exactly common. But this game really bogs down thanks to the cumbersome UI - everything's point-and-click, and while that's fine for adventure games, it makes dialogue and combat particularly tiresome. Imagine trying to play Final Fantasy with just a mouse, no gamepad. Keyboard shortcuts really should have been implemented - as it stands, the game is just too lightweight to overcome the tedium of clicking.			"

												Game requires Adobe AIR.  Adobe no longer supports Linux and the installer requires root access.  Unfortunately, the Adobe Air install program doesn't seem to know how to construct paths in Linux and it fails-out.  I'm using Ubuntu so it's possible it might work under other distros but I do not recommend it for Ubuntu.  I want my money back.			"

												This game is a great blend of a choose your own adventure with a bit of strategy!  The dialogue and story is fantastic, it's witty and deep.  I played it straight through from the moment I started it up, then I realized what time it was.  I recommend this to anyone who likes a game that really pulls you into it's world.			"

												This game just didn't gell with me. You have some click-to-make a choice dialog boxes but I didn't see any lasting consequences -- at least not until I got bored and quit. It's a slow paced-game, kind of repetitive. You collect items which get crafted into weapons, boosters, and allies which you fight with -- all of the above have limited uses so you need to manage what you have to get more items.But the game never grabbed me. It seems slow paced, repetitive, generally unpredictable, and just not as well-developed as the other games available.			"

												Overturned my sofa cushions, found enough money to buy Dark Scavenger.  Let me tell you how it is:Picture this if you'd be so kind:  space.  It's unfathomably huge and mostly empty, but you've come across a place where in the background you can see a stream of stars.  Nearby is a sun pounding atoms together to make heavier and heavier elements and putting out the energy of 6 trillion nuclear bombs per second as a by-product.  A few hundred million miles off are some planets; generators of storms guaranteed to instantly pressure cook anything wrought by feeble mortal hands, but only tiny marbleized orbs from your point of view.  This is so real and awesome, you think to yourself.  How could it possibly get any better?  Well, maybe there's a barbarian with a giant axe.  And if that weren't enough, the barbarian is having a no-holds-barred punch-up with a robot micro-universe, the Xenomorph from Alien, and Jesus Christ if he were an alien with a super laser gun.  They are firing rays that go ""pew-pew!"" and there are explosions and a spaceship and a unicorn runs by!  You cannot believe that this is totally real and you are seeing it!  And what can you even do in the midst of such an amazing scenario?  The only thing a man can do:  swing his rusty sword for 5 damage.Dark Scavenger is kind of like that, but even better!  This game will take you on an amazing and hilarious adventure with an ultra-simple interface reminiscent of games like Dragon Warrior, Earthbound, and Pokemon.  Of course, without the limitations of old cartridges, Dark Scavenger is free to elaborate on its story and make sure you're never bored.  The graphics are static images, but look quite nice (I don't think the screenshots in Steam did them justice) and despite the simplistic nature of it all Dark Scavenger manages to create a game you'll never forget.  You remember playing those RPGs and getting a little giddy when you finally leveled up and unlocked an awesome sounding new move for your character?  You didn't even care what it did or if you could only do it a couple of times; you totally used that move on the next Level 1 Fuzzy Bunny you came up against.  Dark Scavenger's gameplay manages to capture that feeling in every single encounter.  Rather than leveling up and gaining better hit points or attack prowess, you gain loot.  But instead of simply strapping this loot on to your hurly-burly self, you give it to one of your three allies who will make you a new weapon, item, or ally to call upon.  Every one of these is unique and it never manages to get samey.  And as your allies tease you with what awesome choices lie before you, you'll find yourself in gleeful agony trying to pick your prize.  Each thing has limited uses, but can be used in combat for obvious reasons or choose-your-own-adventure style narrative pieces where having an applicable tool will give you the best rewards or the coolest outcome to your actions.  Thanks to this, nothing is ever useless and you never experience the grind of other RPGs.  Encounters come and go and don't get replayed.  Dark Scavenger is nothing if not perpetually fresh.So let's say I haven't sold this game to you yet.  Yeah, by passing up on Dark Scavenger, you'll save about 1/24th of what it takes to get a new release that's one of those comittee designed polygon orgies that's like a movie you press buttons to watch.  Or, you could buy this game that has the heart to make you want to replay it years down the line, the balls to ask a couple bucks for a mostly text-driven sci-fi fantasy adventure, and the kind of brain that'll give you disco dancing space goblins if you give it a chance.  I know where I'd rather put half of my lunch money, sir.Or, if you take the advice of some other reviewers, you could just watch a let's play of Dark Scavenger, since it's one of those games where once you've seen the whole thing there's only minor differences to see.  Fair enough.  But, hey, if you do that and you actually have fun watching, why not buy the game?  For how little it costs on sale, it's basically like buying the devs a beer.  And then maybe they'll make more!			"

												Its a weird charming little adventure with Wizardry style combat thrown in. Basically you progress through rooms, clicking on stuff that might get you more loot or attacked, or more frequently BOTH. The Loot you can throw at your friends on this journey, a skeleton warrior who can craft them into weapons, a weird green guy who'll turn them into items, or a horrifying alien biologist who'll turn them into allies. By the end of the game, I had an uzi that shoots bones? aflail that grilled my enemies (and healed me), a spear that can stab souls, a teddy bear so adorable that it'll paralyze enemies, a blanket that protects me from all harm, and a whole bunch of minions with rabies, a narcoleptic monster, etc. If I went through again and threw the items at different allies I'd get a completely different set of things that allow me to progress differently through the game.There's bunches of choose your own adventure style options in the game to resolving issues. You could brute force your way through them and heal up after, or use the variety of objects you've collected to solve them. At one point I sailed across a lake of acid on a raft crafted out of swords and javelins held together by mucus. And then I finished the game and OH HELL there's NG+ so now I get to carry all my items through and make new ones. This is ridiculous.			"

												Grade: C+/B-If you like old school ADV games with a bit of humor, this game is quite neat.   Ammong many problems with this game, it seriously need a better tutorial or at least a proper ""how to play"" page. For example, nowhere in the game explains how the save mechanics work. Basically, all your actions are autosaved, BUT, you can do ""manual autosave"" by existing the room and going back in again. But as I said, the game didn't bother to tell you this important feature, so I had to restart the whole area many times before I figured out the system. The low score I gave is also reflect upon the unbalanced weapons/items/summons, and low quality art, and also the lack of new elements in NG+.			"

												I actually really enjoyed playing Dark Scavenger, and maybe I had fun making silly voices too! I've never played an RPG quite like this before, it was different not having to attach with each member of my party and instead use them for single attacks. They can also craft awesome weapons to use in combat too!I got the game as part of the Jingle Jam (https://www.humblebundle.com/yogscast-jingle-jam) by donating.I apologise for the silly voices:

												""Dark Scavenger"" is a wonderful little gem of a game. It is well-written, hilarious, wacky and immersive. The story is good and I couldn't put it down till I finished it - roughly 7 hours of pure fun. I was initially a bit skeptical of trying a mashup of so many genres: hidden-object, visual-novel, rpg, choose-your-own-adventure, but it's remarkably well done and it just works! For it's low price and high fun, I can't recommend it enough.			"

												This game is a fun jaunt. I like the story. The artwork lent itself to the feel of the story (among other feelings I felt some nostalgic Heavy Metal-ish vibes from the art and story, sort of a post-apocalypse-or-pre-genesis-set-in-an-ambiguous-era sort of feel).The interface is simplistic, which works very well for games like this IMO. I beat the entire game in almost eight hours, but I think I could probably squeeze another two or three out of it if I replayed it making different choices.I'm not mad I spent money on the game. Good job!Thanks for reading.			"

												This is a very nice game. It's basically a choose your own adventure gamebook type of game with interesting and quite unique mechanics. It is very heavy on text, so you'll have to read a lot while playing it. The game asks you questions from time to time to check if you actually payed attention or just clicked through everything without reading. Like in a gamebook, the text is really the whole point of the game, so that would be quite pointless indeed. What is very unusual for a computer or video game is that apart from very few typos the writing is absolutely excellent. Neither childish, nor deliberately opaque, the author has a very enjoyable and literate writing style. The orthography and the grammar were also excellent. Why can't every adventure game be like this? The story is original and refreshing, and the game has a subdued kind of humour that mainly comes across in the quirky graphics rather than in the text. Playing through Dark Scavenger takes a couple of hours, somewhere between 5 and 10 typically. Having done this once, I don't think it is very replayable. You can always try to do better to collect all items and solve all the puzzles, but apart from this the story is very much linear. When you play it for the first time, a large part of the fun in Dark Scavenger is the fact that you often don't have the slightest idea what is going on. Once you finished it, you will surely have figured that out, so this excitement is also lost on later playthroughs.If you like adventure games at all, I really recommend buying and playing Dark Scavenger, especially if you can get it in a bundle or a sale for one or two euros.

												not bad if you can read even though it did't have any animation (at least it have pictures unlike some of those choose your own adventure, games with just text)it still was very entertaining to play not too much text neither and not hard to read neither.its a mixs of silly, fantasy,magic and sci fi .it starts very slow and boring but gets better and better then slow again and then better again.the choose of things you get to say is what most gamers most likely would have said in any of those situations.and the chooses do have something to say to the game play rare in games you can instant die from a decision but don't worry there are plenty of checkpoints (unless your gonna go pro and try to not die a singel time on your first try)even thougt you can't see any items you find, you will still get that excited feeling of finding something cool and usefull even if its just random junk because your allys can make them into random weapons,trinkets or even summon new allys from them like a necromanser or golemmanser you never know what it is before you give it to them (unless you give a broken crosbow to the guy with a crosbow then you get a crosbow obvious). also most trinkest has more uses through your adventure like you can use it to bribe people,a cutting tool,also your allys are not useless unstable potato heads like in most games where they get in the way and aggro powerfull mobs they are usefull unstable potato heads thats the best kind.if you need help for lifting something heavy, drinking some water for you to see if its poisonous, healing you, taking a bullet for you, attacking for you, sacrificeing them etc.the story is a little meh in the begining  and don't make so much sense but gets better and it makes you keep going because you wonna know what happend next like any good book and it makes you wonna explorerthe music is... umm.....unique..not bad but not super greatalso it made me wonna write a this review and i rarely write reviews... weird "

												This is basically someone's community college ""games designer"" homework.  It's not really a ""game"" as we see them in the 21st century.   It would have been pretty popular in 1985, though.     Unfortunately the technology industry has bumped up a bit over the last 30 years... and 30 years is about as far as this game is from being acceptable today.If you treat it like an interactive story, then it's a bit more acceptable, just worse in quality than contemporary interactive stories like the ones from Telltale games (to pick a prominent example). So, why does this get the thumbs down?- No options/settings configurable for modern PCs- Poor quality graphics- Little to no gameplay- Compares badly with other games in the genre, even at the same price points- No, indy developers do not deserve a break just because they're indy developers, bad products are always bad.Save your time and money.  Whatever you want to do with your time, this isn't it. "

												This is a difficult one for me, as Dark Scavengers simply did not cut it for me.I repeat: it wasn't good enough for me.Approaching the game objectively as possible, Dark Scavengers is a good turn-based RPG that feels as if it was designed to give you the meat-and-potatoes of its genre while forgoing a lot of the fluff turn-based RPGs are known for (grinding, turning in quests, messing around with level progression and so on). You basically run from room to room of each level, beating up enemies, clicking on environment objects, and navigating through chuckle-worthy dialogue, 'scavenging' interesting objects all the while. After each room, you will typically be brought back to your hub to make the scavenged pickings into either a weapon, item, or ally – this is the prize mechanic of the game, though it comes dangerously close to being a gimmick at times. Your crafting buddies give you no clear indication of what they'll make, and although there is certainly fun in this, you can't help but feel a bit cheated by this fairly unforgiving system when you realize that weapon you just made is practically useless.Thing is, it's hard to take any of the game seriously: between the story, the crafting system, and the writing, it all just feels like the snack-size equivalent of a good time. You go through it and you enjoy it for what it is, but leave with an empty, half-satisfied feeling.Why the hell have I devoted so many words to this five-dollar purchase? Just buy it if you're that ♥♥♥♥ing interested, look how far you've gotten in this review. It's five ♥♥♥♥in' bucks. You spend that much on footlong sub, minus tax, fatass. It's not that much. Go mow a couple lawns if you're so ♥♥♥♥in' money-conscious, Scrooge. Jesus. Just buy it. Buy it. ♥♥♥♥.Here, cutting point - if you like short, simple turn-based RPGs with decent, humorous writing and a charming appearance, buy it. If not, go somewhere else.			"

												Do you like quirky games? Do you have a sense of humor? Do you like music? Have fun with making bad choices? Want a short but really good game to play? Enjoy games with diversity? Then what are you waiting for, stop reading and buy this.			"

												This game got me interested with the unique art style, humor, and weird storytelling. The gameplay turned out to be really fun, with a wide variety of crazy weapons, allies, and items with unusual conditions for use. It's a really hard game to describe, but what is most important is the turn-based RPG combat and the dialogue system. It's a great game for casual players, but hardcore gamers will still get a solid 3-5 hours worth of gameplay out of it, with a New Game+ mode for those that want to try for all the wacky items. "

												This game was a pleasantly interesting surprise. I bought it on a whim and was not disappointed.It's fun making all kinds of different weapons from seemingly random junk all over the maps, and this definitely adds to the replay value. It almost has an old-schoolish feel to it.			"

												1.3 hrs in and I'm more entertained with it than some other games that I have ten times as much time logged into. It's a point-n-click game; story is the draw. I'm eager to continue playing. You scrap with ""the apex of eternity"" in the opening encounter and then wake to find that you've been picked up by Dark Scavengers. They enlist you to find a new power source for their (and now your) ship - they will aid you with equipment. Of course, you find the planet that you intend to drain of resources has a host of issues for you to deal with. The writing/lore is outlandish; the humor isn't forced (not necessarily effective, but it won't exasperate, as many other ""quirky"" games will). The art is very fantastic(al); I wish there was a gallery of all the images. That lore; I've yet to figure if the characters/creatures were ideas first and then illustrated, or if they began as doodles and then some background was affixed to further substantiate - a cosmic Zeno Clash is how I'd describe it all (though not nearly as ""*puff puff* Bro, wtf."").The system is interesting: There are different areas in each Chapter (i.e. Level). Upon entering a new screen, there is always an event. After the event, you click about the screen on highlighted points of interest; leads to more events. Sometimes you gain Items from these events; sometimes you can choose to lose(/use) Items (i.e find someone: ""My legs are busted, could you have one of your Allies carry me home? (Could you also have another Ally carry my items? (Could you also have another Ally carry my wares?))"") - there are choices to be made (usually either good or bad, but sometimes there is a third option); have yet to really come across any consequences (again, 1.3 hrs - a few screens into Chapter 2). Upon leaving a screen, you're beamed back up into your ship (which you share with three fellow Dark Scavengers). They can convert the items you've found into either Weapons, Items or Allies. Each of these have a certain number of uses before they are depleted; once you make it to a new Chapter, your Health as well as all charges of all equipment are recharged. DEFINITELY worth the sale price, and I've little doubt it's worth the retail price - length will determine that (there are multiple endings, though, so). I TOTALLY recommend Dark Scavenger.			"

												Really unexpected gem. It's a choose your own adventure story with an element of crafting and fighting (The crafting system is very neat). The art may not be the most beautiful, but it works and grew on me anyway. The writing is pretty good, funny and descriptive enough. Also, the game will tell you something that may seem minor but, 5 minutes later, asks you for that piece of information which will allow you to get a great crafting item. The main/semi-important characters are my favorite part; they're all interesting and have something special going on with them.If this game looks like it's for you then I definitely recommend it.Hope to see more from this developer.

												A sort of JRPG/point-and-click adventure with a unique mechanic that adds a good level of interactivity to the game. A satisfying story and constant stream of humor make this game one I'd highly reccomend!			"
