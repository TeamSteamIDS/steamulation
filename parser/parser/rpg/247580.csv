												Magicka: Wizards of the Square Tablet is a fun little tablet version of Magicka. I’m a huge fan of the magicka series, the main gimmick in it is you can combine elements to cause crazy attacks. This tablet game is focused more on the combat and offers you a side scroller adventure blasting away bad guys with crazy magic spells. The game has an in app store, but you really only need to buy stuff if you want to cheat, or just use cheatengine and give yourself a ton of points. PC gamers don’t pay to cheat after all, we are not lowly phone gamers. This is a fun title, and it unlocks at lot more items than you would get on the tablet version, but the game isn’t that deep. The multiplayer is really cool and this is a great port of a tablet game that is fun in short bursts.Watch the full review on ShotGaming.com Steam Shots EP125			"

												Magicka: Wizards of the Square Tablet has everything that people have come to love from the original Magicka. It has the awesome friendly-fire co-op action, the various spell combinations, and a few mild challenges to boot.If you loved Magicka, there's absolutely no reason to pass on this game. For the small pricetag, this game has been converted from a microtransaction payment option (on other inferior gaming devices) to a legitimate buy to play game. In short, it's an actual game based on the Magicka we love minus all the BS that mobile games offer.Content-wise the game is not actually very long. It's long enough for a day or two of fun spent with friends but when you consider the price tag for it, it's not so bad. What's even better is that there are no DLC in this game.It was definitely a fun little game! 4/5			"

												Played on Win8 tablet (i5, HD4000):No glitches or lags whatsoever, the game runs smoothly and great on 1080p (HD4000). The controls are staggering because the game reads the touchscreen as a mouse, and there's no multitouch support for the same reason, but that's not a huge problem. It's fun and plays nice on the go.- Works with touchscreen;- Doesn't support multitouch;- Requires a keyboard once to enter a name;- Runs smoothly.			"

												Another carpal tunnel creation from Paradox lol. This is pretty much just a cheaper version of Magika but with more annoying problems. Constant clicking off the screen will minimize the game, getting you killed. The teleport spell doesn't work properly, it just rubberbands you back most the time. Enemies box you in, making it impossible to move. Special scrolls only show an icon with no name, so its like a luck of the draw if you have all of them. Friends pick bad robes that continuously murder you. But all in all, if you can get it for cheap and can look beyond all the issues I listed, then I would say grab it. By the way, you think murdering your friends in Magika 1 was bad, this is worse lol.			"

												I thought this game was some sort of a terrible port. So I've heard from people. Actually it's pretty fun. The main concept is as is in original game - you combine elements into spells and kill stuff. This game's cartoonish graphics and easy difficulty make it a sweet little game to play when you are tired of everything else. I bet multiplayer is the core (couldn't connect to any server. Paradox, do you hear me?) of the game, but singleplayer campaign is neat too. It's 2D style make me think of it as of classical beat'em'up games merged with unique Magicka mechanics. You should try it. The only thing I'm not sure of is all those robes and staffs avaliable from the start. It would be cool if you could progress and spend ingame money on new and more powerful equipment. Thank you for your attention.			"

												This review is for the 2D casual action rpg game,originally released for ios and android enabled devices,Magicka: Wizards of the Square Tablet.The game was developed by Ludosity and published by Paradox Interactive in 2012 and on 31/10 2013 on Steam.PlotSince this game was ported from mobile and tablet devices the storyline is fairly simple and the plot is fast paced,yet innovative.Because this game is so small i will not spoil you the fun from discovering the magicks and secrets of Asgard.GameplayThe game utilizes the same old Magicka's element combination system in order to create powerful Magicks.Available elements are:Earth,Fire,Ice,Lightning,Water,Shield,and Healing.Those elements can be used offencively or defencively.They can be used individually and can be empowered by selecting the same element as much as four times,increasing it's intensity,or they can be combined in order to create incredible spells,called Magicks.Pros+Fast paced+Sharp cartoon visuals+Simple gameplay and storyline+Advanced fighting combinatons possible+Cross platform multyplayerCons-A few crashes-Unlockables already unlockedRecapNice,fun little game with sharp cartoon graphics and increasing difficulty.What more can you ask for?

												I'm early on yet, but, so far, I enjoy it. Casting spells is different, lightly challenging, and quite rewarding. Looks like a beat em' Up, but isn't....   4 player, Cross-Platform, is nice. Losing the IAP of the IOS version, is a +/-, depending on your take.  I see it as a +, since we get it all included!			"

												I DO recommend this game because it has hilarious dialogue and many fun times to be had in co-op, graphics are somewhat reminiscent of castle crashers. My only beef was the controls which are a bit clumsy to start with, but possible to live with if you don't mind accidentally murdering your teammates once in a while and having monsters chew on your face while you try to do a spell combo (can't actually move while a spell is equipped).

												So...I went on steam this weekend and found that Paradox, one of my favourite game studios, were having a huge sale. I went on, looking through all these great games, city skylines, europa 1-4, wizard wars etc. But then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted this little 79p game which looked like a worse version of Castle Crashers, I then bought it and did the following: *Logged in and crashed*Logged in and crashed*Logged in and crashed*turned fullscreen off, seemed to fix it*Learnt that everything is available to you from the very start, thanks Paradox, progression? who needs that?*Killed some things, bought a little follower guy who then subsequently died and left me all alone...forever*crashed again...am I imagining things?*c-c-c...CRAASH*Now I shall go forth and play Castle crashers, the better version of this IOS converted magicka game. But after my 1.something hours played on this thing...I kinda enjoyed it, so yeah...its okay I guess??(btw, multiplayer is horrific, don't try)5/fartWould IOS again			"

												O jogo é quase tão divertido quanto o Magicka original.Tem as mesmas combinações de magia e a mesma jogabilidade de quatro jogadores, mas vale essaltar que essa é apenas uma versão portada da plataforma móvel para o pc, entao não pense que o controle de Xbox360 vai funcionar aqui tudo é só no mouse mesmo. O multiplayer online funciona mesmo e tem pessoas jogando (mais até do que em outros jogos). Recomendo, mas foi bem mais vantajoso para quem comprou o game com desconto que custou pouco mais de dois reais.			"

												Magicka! For smartphones! On steam!But seriously, this is a very nice spin-off. And by spin-off, I mean 3D to 2D. It's the same Magicka that we already know, but kinda limited. There are some spells missing, and the game looks too basic for me, almost incomplete I could say. I haven't played Magicka for years, and WotST was a good comeback for me. It's for sure, a great game for new players, if you have some coins on a sale, but if you want some real Magicka, just check the two main games for some spell party. "

												Magicka iOS was... uh... something alright. It was okay on my iPad I guess, but not a really stand-out game. The PC controls make it very easy in all reasonable situations, but still kind of hard when the game decides to get unfair in high survival levels or with the bonus boss.Honestly there's nothing good about this game compared to Magicka though. Magicka is a great game, this is not. Go play Magicka instead.			"
