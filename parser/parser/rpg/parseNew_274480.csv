												I've been playing this game for a few years now, but it has only just become available on Steam.Don't let the rather unattractive visuals fool you (admittedly the screenshots look just terrible): this is the best action RPG out there.  Period.Drox Operative is actually and ARPG set inside a 4X game being played out by AI's.  You can influence events in a myriad of ways.  You create a ship, generate a galaxy which will have some number of races playing in it, and you can win by allying yourself with the victors, or if you are particularly bloodthirsty you can just♥♥♥♥♥♥everything in sight until you accumulate the points for a ""Fear"" victory.  Afterwards you can retain your ship in a newly generated galaxy.  It is so satisfying to play an RPG in a ""living"" universe rather than mindlessly grinding through the same old dungeon with randomly spawning enemies until you reach some boss.  One of the great innovations is that the modules with which you fit your ship do not go into specific slots, but instead there are ""hi, mid, low"" slots (much like in EVE).  So, if you want 4 lasers, you can do it.  If you want 5 reactors to give you very rapid cap recharge, you can do it.  You want 5 engines so your ship zips around the map?  You can do it.  Are you a Romulan who fantasizes about redundant cloaking devices?  Well, you get the idea.There certainly seem to be no other RPG's out there like Drox, so if you like space and you like RPG's it's a must-buy, but there is some room for improvement:  In my opinion the visual appeal of the game is non-existant, and staring at it for hours gets rather drab, but rest assured the great gameplay will keep you doing just that.  Though there is large array of loot you will find, I certainly feel that they could add many more modules which do a much wider variety of different things.Anyway, for $10 or $20, you certainly shouldn't regret this buy.

												Ever wondered what would it be like to play a typical 4X Space Strategy, but not as one of racial leaders, but as an independent mercenary? Drox Operative lets you do just that!Drox Operative is an action RPG with a good dose of space exploration. But where other space exploration games take place in static or semi-static universe, a notable feature of Drox Operative is that NPC factions expand and develop like races in 4X Space Strategy would: they establish new colonies, build ships and space stations, research new technologies and of course fight both neutral enemies and each other. This creates unparalleled feeling that you are adventuring in a living world, which constantly moves on regardless of your actions!In regard of RPG stats, Drox Operative does a good job of simulating that your “character” is a spaceship: character’s attributes are replaced by your crew’s expertise in various fields. Though the result is fairly similar in regard of distributing “crew points”, immersion-wise the system accomplishes its job.The equipment system differs from that of most RPG in that most of equipment slots (all except for 3 specialized slots based on your ship’s design, that is) freely allow to install any equipment of appropriate tonnage. Want to add an extra engine instead of your heavy laser turret? No problem! Have a medium ballistic weapon instead of aforementioned laser turret, which unlike the later you can install in place of your radar? Ditto! This makes your ship very customizable and allows you to adjust it according to your playing style (and re-outfit it whenever you feel like it).And the final unique feature of Drox Operative is crewmates. They technically function as equipment (occupying either the special crew slot, or the light slots), but unique in that they level up as well, improving the bonuses they provide over time.To sum it up, Drox Operative is a great game, and I fully recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs, space exploration, or both!

												If Star Control, Civilization, and Diablo had a baby, it would be named Drox Operative. It's a surprisingly fun yet incredibly deep game. You can lose and win the game a number of different ways and play it accordingly. Want to play by making everyone fear you? You can do that. Want to win the hearts and minds of the alien species? You can do that. Want to explore and blast bad guys? You can do that. There's a ton of gameply customizability options to make the game easier or harder or slower or faster. The graphics are a bit dated, but there's nothing that pulls me out of being immersed in the soap opera like politics that I was neck deep in. Tons of races and ships to get started and star systems to explore with random encounters and loot all over the place. While I was waiting for a Skyrim mod to download, I saw this on sale and I'm glad I picked it up because I had forgotten about my mod about 7 hours later when it was time to go to bed.			"

												I highly recommend this game. It may not be much to look at but it's one of those games where every galaxy you play has a different little story to go along with it. I love being able to observe (and meddle in) the wider politics of the  game world while slaughtering bad guys ARPG style. It makes the game into more than just an excercise in  loot gathering.The other thing I find important that this game has is an insane amount of character customization and different ship parts which unlock all kinds of cool abilities. There arwe an almost infinite amount of  possibilities for different builds you could do.One thing that's either a strength or a weakness of the game depending on how you look at it is the game is pretty unforgiving especially when you haven't designed your character and ship very well. It is the sort of game where everything can be going along fine and then suddenly you are swarmed by more than you can handle. Since this game saves pretty much everything and never lets you go back and reload a save older than the last thing you did death has some nasty consequences even on softcore difficulty, it makes it very satisfying when you find a build that finally is able to survive most encounters but it get get frustrating as well.Bottom line: If the concept of this game looks appealing to you at all - get it. It's the best ARPG I've ever played. "

												Basically, the game is Din's Curse..IN SPACE! with some heavy focus on diplomacy and politics.  The idea is that you are part of a group called the Drox Guild, with the goal of maintaining the presence of the Guild in the sector (the game world).  There are several ways one can win or lose, giving YOU the player the ability to choose how to win/fail.  Like the other Soldak games, this features the living world around you aproach to the hack and slash.  Quests have time limits.  Success or failure will cause changes to the game world.  That radiation leak on the planet won't fix itself, and if you leave it for long enough the planet can suffer more woes that you can solve.  But should you buy this game?Yes.  Yes you should.  Here is why:+You are a space mobster.  Really the game should be called Drox Moberative.+Technically infinite gameplay, just because you beat the sector doesn't mean you can't keep playing in particular in HOW you won the sector.  I got a ""fear"" victory while at war with two races and battled them for a good two hours to make little head way.+Decent gameplay.  Its a hack and slash, but it is tuned to make sense and it plays pretty well.  The battles are engaging and enjoyable, if not overwhelming at points.+VERY diverse worlds.  It is improbable that you will get the same sector twice.  In addition to simply having a random lay out, each system and sector have different moddifiers (more enemies, more agressive behavior, more traps) so you never know what you are going to get with your new sector.  On top of that, Mods Mods Mods.  Add more mayhame with mods+Easy to lose track of time with.  Not sure why that is a plus but what ever.That said there are some things to be desired such as stat point distribution, but most if not all can be fixed with mods.  Give the demo a try if you are still not sure.  It is much more engaging than one would think.			"

												Ever played a space strategy game where you have to colonize planets, trade and maintain a diplomatic relationship with other races and take care of your own people while doing so? Ever wondered what it would be like to be that random event that caused citizens to rebel, technology to be sold to your enemy, a race that you would like to be a friend but just won't listen because some element in the game says 'Hell no!'?Well in this game you can; This is a top-down space shooter, but around the player several computer players are playing out a space strategy game. You can befriend them, you can fight them, you can trade with them, you can support them in their war or colonization efforts, you are a Drox Operative. And the other races know that to have a Drox Operative on your side is the path to victory.The graphics are great and the player is allowed a reasonable range of customization to make it his/her own. Musical score and sounds a pretty good, as is the general feel of the game. I did have some problems with the keys though, and understanding what the game was about in the first place, but after 15 mins of just diving in head first I found it surprisingly easy to understand. As for the keys, would like a weapon group to be used for weapons; The only weapon that fires when pressing the mouse is weapon no. 1, although in all fairness I haven't been looking for it very hard, its probably in there somewhere.You can only have 1 ship (per Operative / Save slot ) and it is a persistant ship (and crew), meaning it carries over from one game into the other. A bit confusing is a game being called a 'Sector', which from what I understand is a galaxy, which happens to consist of...sectors...ya... Anywho, you can fully customize your ship to be a fighter, bomber, trader, colony vessel, or any combination you may think of. It grows in class as you grow in experience (and award points to a particular skill) opening more slots in your ship to install equipment in.All in all an original idea realised; A gem in any original gamers collection.

												Ok, Soldak we get it, you've got my attention.  You've shown me how unique an ASRPG can be.  And it's better with friends I might add!Being apart of a space illuminati wasn't in my expectations of exploring space, but man, this -- this is better.  Control the fate and destiny of entire races?  Or destroy them even?Choices.  That's the keyword for Drox Operative.  And damn guys..  Soldak executes this really well.Bravo.			"

Drox Operative is an action/ Shoot 'Em Up RPG that has a great deal of features that make it a very interesting game. Although these same features end up making it lose some of its replayability (a single game can take many hours). The gameplay makes up for the game's poor graphics.GameplayThe objective of this game is to pick a side and help them win. There are 5 ways to win and 4 to lose:- Military win or loss- Diplomatic win or loss- Economic win or loss - Fear win- Legend win- Bounty Hunters (loss)By exploring sectors of the universe you will find several new races, enemy ships, space wrecks, meteors, anomalies and planets. A fascinating aspect of this game is the fact that all planets have a gravitational pull: if you are close to them your ship will slow down. There are also wormholes that transport you to a random destination.You can help races by doing quests and help them destroy enemy ships. This does not make them automatically your ally. You can also do the exact opposite: manipulate, spread rumors, attack them to further your own agenda or by request of another race. Even if a race is your ally it does not mean they won't betray you down the road (although that also depends of the race's nature).You start the game by choosing a spaceship from any race: your choice does not make you an ally of that race, you're only choosing the ship you like the most (or the one with better stats).There are 6 stats to spend your points on.Each ship has 5 components: heavy, medium, light, race specific and cargo bays. All components have slots where the ""items"" such as batteries, pods, weapons, deflectors, crew, plating and fighters are placed.You can pay the crew to keep them happy. All ships have a specific power load (that can be increased). If there is any available power load it will increase the ship's regeneration rate. On the other hand if overloaded it will decrease the ship's speed, regen rate and repair rate.The ship is protected (depending on the items) with shields, armor plating and lastly structure. If the structure is depleted the ship is destroyed. Energy is used whenever a weapon is fired.There are also consumables to help you during the battles.			"

												Drox Operative is Soldak Entertainment's space ARPG in which you play the eponymous Drox Operative, a sort of mercenary. You are plopped into a procedurally generated sector where you must achieve any one of a list of victory conditions. Whether you succeed or fail (by producing a loss condition) the sector closes and you start the process again.The problems start with the foundation. The game is almost entirely created from code recycled from Soldak's older Diablo clones. Added to that old code is a shallow diplomacy system that any player of Civilization will recognize. Some of the phrasing used in diplomacy screens is identical to what can be found in Civilization 4 or 5. I don't think it's wrong to copy ideas, but there's not enough original creativity in the diplomacy system for my taste.GoodStable with few bugs, none of which break the gameMultiple paths to victory (clearly duplicated from Civilization but still interesting)Multiplayer works wellI like the cosmetic variety of ships, though for the most part, they don't play much differently.NeutralDated graphics, even for the release dateThe game is action-oriented. There's no story, and only a vague backstory.BadWhat my friends call an ""RNGesus"" loot system where loot drops are like lottery tickets, and most are losers.There is no difference whatsoever between victory and defeat in a sector, other than victory provides you with one or more boxes of random loot, Being random, the loot is mostly worthless.Code duplicated from Diablo clones means out-of-place mechanics like loot that ""drops"" onto an invisible surface and must be picked up manually each time.Inventory management is a central ""feature"". Much of the game involves sorting through a torrent of nearly identical equipment and crew members, then failing to sell the excess because the NPC factions don't have the credits to buy them. The game starts by starving you of inventory space, multiplying the annoyance.NPC factions are one-dimensional warmongers with the negotiation skills of Civ's Atilla the Hun. It is common to see NPC factions wipe each other out while still exploring the first system in the sector trying to make contact with one.While multiple routes to victory are possible, only military victory is reasonable in most cases. For example, if you want a diplomatic victory, you must achieve a military alliance with all extant factions. This is a feat in itself, since usually any aid you provide to one faction angers at least one of the others. On top of that, though, you must get the AI factions to ally with one another. The only mechanic provided for this is to visit planets of each faction and navigate through a ""rumor"" menu dozens and dozens of times until you improve relations, a very tedious enterprise that is costly, and must be funded by missions (which anger other factions) or hunting monsters for loot (which the factions can't buy because they run out of money).The monsters have a pathetic AI, and to compensate, there are endlessly spawning legions of them, leading to dull, repetitive combat with stupid but numerous and durable enemies. This happens regardless of how well civilized the system. I have seen systems lost to monsters after achieving victory, all because I took some time to organize my inventory.Yet another game with a point distribution system that has no ""respec"" mechanic but requires perfect planning, allowing you to play dozens of hours in a ship before realizing that your build is invalid at higher levels.

												Played this game for far longer than my Steam hours would indicate-one of the most engaging and fascinating games I've ever played. I spend hours and hours reading about and trying various space games and I keep on coming back to Drox Operative. It's like I'm playing Diablo but Diablo is happening inside Starcraft. Maybe it's not like that at all. God, I don't know. No other game is as good at making me feel very very strong and influential while simultaneously making me feel vulnerable, manipulated, insignificant and weak. Absolutely worth buying, absolutely worth playing. A masterpiece.			"

												My friend. Let me tell you about space. Space is out to kill you. Space has rewards in it. Space will turn on you in a moment's notice acting on the guise that it is your friend.Friend have I ever told you about interracial intergalactic relations? Space simulates sci-fiction stereotypes with 86% accuracy. You better get used to them as they represent the entire charm of this game other than our star pupil, diabloesque loot system. It does not care what you think. It will brag to all your friends even though it acts like a real load. I hope you're organized friend because space is not.Do not take zero gravity lightly. Random events send you hurling into farther reaches of space or even more in space then you currently are. A pseudo-space that is not space.You can't just win or lose space. Space is not some battle to be won or a prize to be earned. Space is a multi-faceted space chimera that chokes on such concepts such as linear gameplay and sandbox freedom. Space will move on without you unless you pause to take a look at it's glory. The glorious space.Stay in space my friends.			"

												If you are looking for a 4x space conquest game keep looking.  This game is a straight ARPG blow everything up and grab thier gear.  Kill, quest, and level up.  As you level you spend 'stat' points to upgrade your ship.  Componant slots open up and put gear into slots (many many dif combos) including crew members that level up.  Total mindless destruction.  Random rogue like loot.  Leveling up.  Respawn/random sectors.  Help the races or destroy them.  Blow lots of stuff up than blow some more stuff up.  If you want an in depth story dont buy this game.  If you want pretty graphics dont buy this game.  If you want mindless destruction after a long day at work check out the demo.			"

												I've been insane for this game since I tried it and realized what was going on: At first it just looks like Diablo in space; a solid space-spaced ARPG with enough stat-building and ship-customizing (with the random components from blown up ships, or scenario rewards) to keep you blasting for a bit. Fans of games like EV Nova might enjoy this game just for that.But there's more. Instead of being story-driven, the game randomly generates new quests and events as you play. An elite space monster shows up, starts gathering a fleet, and if you don't react, he might take over a star system. Then the monster starts sowing chaos on nearby colonies; they might contract a plague, get computer virus, etc. These events can also escalate if unchecked. I've seen empires lose planets to open rebellion. I've HELPED rebels escalate, and contributed to the creation of offshoot races!Also the various species - and your guild, the Drox - all have dynamic relationships. Help a race, they like you more. Attack them, they like you less. Help their allies, and they like you. Attack their allies, and you might earn more enemies than you intended. You can carefully nursemaid a sector-spanning alliance of friendly races for a diplomatic win... or watch the network of alliances fail like a house of cards if you bungle your relationship with one of the races. That might be a good time to switch tactics and go for another type of win.The various systems interact in what looks like a well-tuned, balanced way - no surprise because the game has been out for some time. The interactions give this game a nice emergent-gameplay edge that keeps things interesting, and there's nothing more hilarious than being a few planets away from a military victory and having the Drox Guild tell you that you MUST, due to Circumstances Beyond Your Control, ally with the race you've just been eradicating colony by colony from this area of known space.Highly recommend for fun ARPG-in-space with a sandboxy twist.Edit: There is an expansion out, which is not on Steam at the time of this writing. You can purchase the expansion from Soldak and apply it to the Steam version of the game to gain access to additional features. He's also said that he's working on getting it into steam. He's been providing Steam codes for anybody who purchases directly, and we can expect this to continue for the expansion.			"

Product received for free
Short Version: Diablo and Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby and stuck it in a rocket and sent it off to space where it was raised by FTL to appreciate the finer points of spaceship building and random events and run-on sentences.  Action-RPG and 4x-Strategy gameplay mesh well in Drox Operative, which is slightly dated but extremely enjoyable as a replayable grind-to-gear fest. Also:  'Drox Operative' is actually space lingo for 'Super Space Mercenary', in case anyone is as confused as I was when first hearing the title.Did you ever play a strategy game like HoMM and wonder why those 'heroes' were always hanging around in taverns waiting for someone to hire them before they'd lift a finger to help?  Well, obviously they were part of a secret guild of super-mercenaries looking to profit off the endless conflict... or at least that's the answer in Drox Operative, where you get to play as the side that always wins in a universe at war - the side getting PAID, by anyone and everyone!Drox Operative is an action-RPG that lets you control a mercenary ship plopped into the middle of a randomized intergalactic battlefield between a bunch of 4x-strategy AIs, where your actions will help decide the ultimate victor(s) - for a hefty fee, of course.  Instead of a traditional campaign, each mission in Drox Operative consists of a cluster of inhabited planets with the various races (humans, robots, bugs, lightbulbs, pet rocks, space orcs, etc - the usual suspects) all competing for dominance.  Your goal is to convince each and every race in the sector that they should be paying you and the Drox Guild to do all their dirty work, by any means necessary - and those means are completely up to you.  As a mercenary operative, you choose which quests to undertake, which planets to trade or share information with, and which alien races would be better off as allies or nuked into space goo.  You can impress, bribe, dominate, suck-up-to, subvert, or destroy any faction you choose, so long as once the dust clears, any survivors see the benefit - and necessity - of paying you for your services.  The Drox Guild will give you bonuses for fulfilling certain objectives in any given scenario (such as allying with one faction and destroying another), but you are always free to ignore these token incentives if you so choose - so if you reeeeally want to blow up those smelly space orcs in every map even when your bosses ask you nicely not to, there's nothing stopping you.The gameplay is a bit overwhelming when you first start, but once you get the hang of things, it can grow extremely absorbing.  Drox Operative plays much like other randomized action-RPGs, where the 'end-game' is to continue beating mission scenarios to get bigger and better ships and weapon loadouts, and take on even tougher missions with your newer deadlier toys.   You can customize your ship in various ways, going fast and full of lasery doom, slow and indestructible with more missiles than you can shake a space stick at, or anything in between.  You also get additional bonuses in certain stats depending on which alien race your ship originates from.  With many, many missions to undertake before you max level on a given ship, and 10 different races you can try (along with a shared stash to encourage building up an extra operative or three), there is an enormous amount of replayability in this game.Of course, while Drox Operative has a lot of ticks in the positive column, the game does have its flaws.  It should be noted that there is very little story to speak of; You are a super space mercenary repeatedly sent to randomized star systems to show off your guild's badassitude - and that's about it.  Also, as of this review, the game is definitely starting to feel dated.  The graphics, audio, and even the menus/tutorials all seem rather antiquated, reminiscent of games released a decade ago.  The gameplay itself still holds up just fine, but you should not purchase this game expecting anything close to current-gen game engines in the visual/audio department.All in all, Drox Operative is a fun, highly replayable game, which I would certainly recommend to gamers who enjoy freeplay scenarios in strategy games along with the endless cycle of gearing and grinding in action-RPGs.  At the base price of $20, Drox Operative isn't as cheap as I'd anticipate for a storyless action-oriented game that is starting to show its age,  but there is still plenty of content to enjoy in this game, especially if you can pick it up in a sale.

												A very fun Diablo-esque space RPG.You create your ship, then progress through the dynamically created levels gaining levels and items as you go. Once you meet one of the winning/losing criteria of the system, then you create a new system to explore. When creating a new system you can set the base level of the enemies in it, as such you can to an extent set your own difficulty level. Additionally you can set the size of the system, number of races etc as you can in many other games.If you're looking for a simple, but addictive, space RPG this is it.			"

Posted: December 17, 2014
												TLDR at end.I'm 8 hours in and truly enjoying this game.  It's actually been some time since a game sucked me in like this and to be frank I wasn't expecting it at all.  I won the game bidding during the holiday auction so it was free and it was the game I bid on after winning my first choice with the points I had left over. I was so wrong. This game should have been the first choice.   Heck I would have gladly paid for a game of this quality.Now on to the actual game itself.  The weakest points are the graphics and music.  Having said that , if you are playing an ARPG and expecting top notch graphics I thinjk perhaps you're unfamiliar with the genre.  The music itself is less forgiveable, though with a small publisher/development team I'm glad they focused on gameplay instead.  I can always play my own music in the background and turn off the music in the options, and I do. (A mix of several sci-fi soundtracks currently. )The gameplay is where this tirle shones.  Its an arpg true but you can navigate with WASD and fire in any arc around your ship. It plays like the winderkind love child of Diablo II and Space, Pirates, and Zombies, and Bounty Hunters.  Another title that's worth a look if you like this sort of thing.  There is a lot of customization available for engines weapons, etc. At first I didn't notice much difference in loadout honestly but as time went on the advantages and disadvantages of each become much more clear as you and your enemies get more powerful.  The expandable inventory if the cargo bay system is also a nice treat and a great way to deal with the looting issue of a full inventory. The overall metagame is what truly sets this apart though with consequences following your choices of who to help and whom to attack.  I allied early with the Shadow because they were at the time overwhelmingly powerful.  Thought I'd go for a quick win that way.  Well, I alkienated another race by attacking them on behalf of the Shadow and was never able to revcover their trust.  In the end I had to fight a long hard battle and do a LOT of diplomacy as they kept buying off my Shadow allies as I worked toward a Fear victory.  That's right multiple victory conditions exist here from diplomacy (which actually seems relevant for once in a game) to military conquest to  a mercenary route of making so much money that your Drox masters are uber pleased.  You can lose all those ways as well so take a look at victory conditios when you first start.TLDR:  Great game for ARPG, space opera, and sandbox game fans with unique and engaging systems that are surprisingly deep.  Graphics and audio dated and weak. I'd give it a 7/10 and if they remade this with a AAA budget I'd preorder. Something I never do.			"

												At the beginning, it is quite overwhelmingly complex. But after you understood it all, it's quite addictive. There is tons of equipment and races to choose from, which makes every playthrough really unique. And I gotta tell you, even if the graphics don't look so great on the screenshots, there can be quite awesome battles going on, which will fill your screen pretty nicely.Only thing that bothers me, is the sound design: The weapons sound... old/weird, the music isn't really fitting and the thruster sound of the ship can get quite annoying aswell. I suggest to get some music going in the background and then play away.I dumbed almost 5 hours in my first time playing this and I don't regret a single second. One of the most enjoyable games I've played in quite a while.Ofcourse it's recommended to get some friends to play with, but no one wanted to play with me (*sadface*) so I can't really say how the co-op works and if its any more fun (which, I presume, it is).Sorry for the butchered english, I'm not a native English-speaker (I don't think that's even a real word...).

												Don't let my play time fool you.  I spent a couple hundred hours playing Drox Operative prior to it coming to Steam.  The game is great for any action rpg fan.  As always Soldak took the genre and added it's own twist.  I have to say that this is the best SciFi ARPG to date.   It is a MUST BUY for any ARPG fan.   I belong to a popular Steam group that focuses on Action RPGs and out of 300 or so members Drox continues to be a very popular game, it certainly keeps in the top 3 or 4 of the games in our list.

												Update 25/11/2016: Nominated for my “Just 5 More Minutes” Award.I saw some footage of this game in January 2013 which was enough to tempt me into trying the free demo. My curiosity was piqued but I wasn't expecting much - just a bit of a time killer to tap away at and fill up a bit of the afternoon. I came away several hours later with the music stuck in my head, feeling as if very little time had passed, then went on to have a dream about Drox Operative that same night. I bought the game from Soldak's site the next day and have been playing Drox on and off since then without ever having cause to regret the puchase.It's a hugely addictive little loot-focused ARPG with a beguiling amount of depth. As most reviews have mentioned, the most compelling feature is the sense of a living galaxy going about its business in the background while you perform the basic functions of clicking, killing, looting, equipping and selling. Essentially the alien AI races play a 4X style strategy game against eachother (albeit in real-time) while you fly about attempting to affect the outcome, with the goal of satisfying the win conditions set by the Drox guild (such as uniting the AI races, or allying with the winner of an all-out war, or victory via exploration and volume of quests completed, etc.). After triumph in one sector, you move onto the next one - presumably a harder one, although the player can set the parameters for each randomly generated sector, including difficulty. Coop online play is possible, as well as 'Hardcore' (permadeath) mode which unlocks once you get a ship to level 25.Everything the player does affects the game universe in some way. Destroy a named boss monster and the planets in that system will become more prosperous for the alien races who hold them, giving those races more resources to build ships and advance their technology faster. Leave that monster to its own devices and he may form a fleet with other tough mobs, create malicious devices in space or perform acts of sabotage against the AI and their planets - which in turn leaves them crying for help from you, the Drox Operative, to solve all their newfound problems in the form of new quests. Performing a fetch quest to prevent a planetary famine may solve that planet's problem - or it might produce another fetch quest from that planet, as they ask you to help destroy their rampant 'super weed' created by the fertiliser you delivered. Failing to solve fetch quests involving riots and civil war may even result in the creation of new races, who splinter off from their parent race and colonise planets of their own, becoming a new force in the sector. Alternatively you might intentionally foment discord and quest for rebel ships in order to fulfil precisely that goal. Much of this sense of life and variety comes only through the flavour text of the quests, but it is all very cleverly conceived and the quests do all have real consequences for the calculations under the hood, for the prosperity and the military fortunes of the AI. If you get tired of questing and manipulating, then you can simply explore and leave the AI to tear eachother to shreds (albeit hopefully without triggering any of the Drox guild's failure conditions).My current ship, which I've been running a long time, is level 92, it's in a sector with 10 AI races all with their own grudges and friendships and problems, half of whom are at war with me and half of whom love me (and some of those that like me are at war with me anyway). The sector is so busy with catastrophes and weird developments that the events windows scrolls too fast for me to digest. I know I could fire this game up right now and easily lose several hours enjoyably.To be honest, I don't know enough about the ARPG genre itself to make a judgement on the game loot balance, the min-maxing potential, or the diversity of builds available in Drox compared to other games. It feels very deep in this regard - you have stats, racial specialisations, plus a great variety of shield modules, armour modules, instant hit weapons, aimed weapons, minions (drones), buffs, debuffs, hulls and miscellanous doodads (installed in modular fashion). However I don't play enough of this type of game to know whether Drox is really deep or my understanding of ARPG systems is really shallow. I'll leave that aspect for other commenters to examine. All I know is I'm still having a great time with the unpredictable outcomes and three- or four-way battles that Drox Operative sometimes throws up, over a full year since purchase. A special mention should be made of Soldak's excellent post-release support. The game has been patched regularly throughout this last year or so, while Soldak (creator of Din's Curse and Depths of Peril) has also responded promptly and effectively to community feedback and bug reports. Drox was a fully formed game long before its recent emergence from Greenlight onto Steam. Now it has the benefit of this wider exposure it deserves to be played by as many people as possible, because it's an unsung gem. Clever, addictive and great fun.			"

												If you are looking for nice little arcade game and a great pastime, the 3D Action RPG in Space, Drox Operative, is your choice.- Summary of the game's aspects [Remember that this is a indie game!] :Scroll down for the expanded review!Graphics: Fine.Sound: Fine.Music: You'll mute it after the first half hour.Gameplay: Fun and you can fine tune the difficulty extremely well, however, the game is extremely repetitive and really lacks depth.- Review:Drox Operative is great fun if you're not looking for great depth or hardcore experience.The only problem with this game is that you should NOT BUY this for any other reason than a nice little past time.It's VERY addictive for those who like the theme and genre, however it is EXTREMELY repetitive and has no depth at all, failing to satisfy any kind of gamer that isn't looking for a casual experience or a pastime.It's very fun to play with others, specially when everything goes to hell, but eventually the repetition gets to everyone.There's also an expansion pack for the game, which includes some content but does nothing to address the repetitive gameplay and lack of depth and lack of persistance.If you are looking for hardcore space games, or something in the lines of EV Nova, Transcendence and other amazing classics of the Top-Down and Isometric space RPGs, this WILL dissapoint you greatly - you have been warned!Past that, the game can be very fun.I must say it's amazing to see things go to hell if you don't manage your sector's threats. Have fun! :)- Conclusion:Nice, fun little game, that you should definetly try the demo before buying.			"

												This game is like Diablo in space but more amazing. Stages (sectors?) develop organically and your actions have a real effect on how the world's situation plays out. Quests are generated based on NPC factions' evolving needs and your success or failure shape overall who gets to live, die, become powerful, become friends or enemies. There is even a meta-game in that relations and power levels carry over somewhat between sectors in the same galaxy. Factions that start out as sub-races or rebel groups, if they survive enough, can become permanent factions in future stages. Starting factions can become extinct.Many ways to win a sector, many ways to lose. The game is challenging at higher levels and requires (political) strategy, not just fast clicking. You can freely customize your ship with any parts you meet the reqs for, and share equipment among characters via stash, which gives you great flexibility but also the potential to completely ruin yourself. Building up the ship is fun, but the more expensive your build is the harder it is to pay repair/replace costs when you die; fail enough and a sector can become unwinnable.This is a great, fun game but its weak graphics and difficult nature may be a turn off to many. I recommend it though for anyone who likes building up a character and testing it against random worlds full of monsters and rival factions.			"

												Some call this Diablo in space, some call it a sci-fi ARPG with a 4x game running in the background -- I call it a lot of fun. It is both of those prior descriptions, and a lot more. I have even more hours in this game than Steam reports, going back to the beta, and find myself coming back to it over and over again.It's got the crazy clickfest, inventory and item management and satisfying loot grinding of good ARPGs. It has a deep 4x system running in the background which you can directly affect, but you're still just one ship against fleets. It's got mod-ability, and even those tasty achievements.The Invasion of the Ancients expansion is highly recommended, as it adds a lot to the game, including ""chips"" for customizing your equipment, special racial services (adding slots for chips, lowering power consumption, etc.), additional playable races and sub-races, and more.Soldak has a great stable of games, and this is the best looking of them yet. Din's Curse and Depths of Peril are also a lot of fun, check them out as well!			"

												Honestly, I was actually a bit surprised over how much I enjoyed Drox Operative. When I first bought it I was a bit skeptical but since it was on sale, I figured I might as well give it a try as it did look fairly interesting. I can safely say that this game is a little known gem that I've found extremely enjoyable. From being able to subtley manipulate galactic politics to achieve your ends or even just directly attack your enemies , this game gives you several different ways to win.I would definitely recommend that people give this gamea try, it's worth it.

												This game is such a breath of fresh air and criminally overlooked. I just found out about it by chance aswell, but boy am I glad I did!It's a space ARPG within a randomly generated galaxy where AI factions play a 4X game. You can help the different factions, spy on them, sabotage, steal their stuff, try to form alliances or wage war - or just ignore them and go hunt monsters, get loot, improve your ship, trade stuff and become rich. And once this sector is done, for better or for worse, you take your ship and go to the next sector, growing bigger and more powerful each time.The game world actually feeling dynamic and alive is probably what fascinates me the most about the game, but the fighting, the loot, the diplomatic options, etc. are all very well done aswell.Highly recommended!

												Drox Operative is an excellent and unique ARPG, well worth your money.The Good:-Unique character development-Extensive variety of builds and ships, you can do pretty much anything you can come up with, and succeed.-Random area generation, each playthrough is different.-Built in mechanics to encourage you to play each round differently, without penalizing you for playing the way you want to play. (For example, the Drox guild will issue you a quest to save one race, destroy another, protect a specific alliance, etc, and you earn extra rewards for compliance.)-The graphics are no where near as bad as the screenshots would lead you to believe.-Easy to respec, making it almost imposible to permanently screw up a character.-Fun factor: this is one of those games where you look up and realize hours have dissapeared, and your wife is standing behind you nagging.The Bad:-Learning curve can be a bit steep, with spikes in difficulty.-Drox Guild quests can often encourage you to do the Exact opposite of what you've been working towards.-Easy to screw up a character, forcing you to respec.

												Great little Diablo meets Space RPG.  You fly around in a ship, earn levels, find and equip all different types of items and weapons, and kill lots of baddies.  My only complaint is the game gets pretty boring after a while.  The scenery never really changes, you fly around in a circle map/area that has randomized planets and such scattered about.  Warping between areas just brings you to a new circle random area.  The background colors change slightly but the content doesn't.Fun game and worth the price for a few hours of play.  I recommend playing Hardcore as there really isn't any other way to play these types of games!			"

												It's truly a gem. Just decent graphics and sound but the game is truly entertaining. It's a 4x (3x?) game.. (it's a cross between an Elite type game and a 4x) you are the captain of a ship and move yourself in an evolving universe full of sentient races that will ask you to help them in various way, you can truly change the course of events choosing what to do and eventually who plump for, but it's truly easy to keep everything under control (it does not stress, and the difficulty level is spot on); your ship will change even in shape, will get bigger and you will tune it with special things... shields, computers, missiles, escape pods, etc. it's easy don't worry) and will  At a game design level it's almost perfect; developers give you what matters most and take out the less important aspects that could alienate a lot of people. It's almost perfect. If you like the genre that's probably the best game. Looking forward to Drox Operative 2, in the meantime I have finally found something to play happily.			"

This review is a part of the Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Soldak Entertainment for providing the key for review purposes.Let me start this of by saying that I'm not exactly a fan of space-based games. I play it occasionally but never really sink in a significant amount of time into any given titles of the genre but after giving Drox Operative a try, I find it to be very accessible and, more importantly, highly enjoyable! Originally a 2012 title developed by Soldak Entertainment, came on to Desura and later on to Steam in February 2014. For an almost 4 years old title, Drox Operative still holds well against today's standard.You play as one of the ten races, each with their very own perks and bonuses, available to choose from and act as the guild representative in the galaxy. Your job is to conquer and sway the other races in favor to what the higher commands of the guild demands. Think of it as a hand that works in the shadows, controlling everyone in silence. Illuminati, anyone? At the start of each generation of Sectors, you'll be given specific goals from the higher command (for example, Destroy the Dryads, Keep the Cortex alive, etc.) and accomplishing this will net you rewards that you can use in your subsequent playthrough. So, kill, destroy, declare wars, persuade, spread propaganda, rally your allies, disrupt the economy or basically anything to get the job done! This is what intrigued me the most about this game, so much freedom in actions!Drox Operative can be a little bit overwhelming at the start, especially to the newcomers, but they really did a great job on the tutorial explaining the bits and bobs on how the game works and rolls out the game in a comfortable pace so that you'll be familiarized and settled before the game dishes out the advanced stuff. For the veteran gamers of this genre looking for a little challenge, they provide an optional advance settings at the start of each game (Hardcore, Semi Hardcore, Unlucky, etc.)The gameplay revolves around two main parts, one is exploration and the other diplomatic relations. Exploration is self-explanatory, as each of the generated Sectors are randomized, you have to venture out into the open space searching for new races, analyze planets, discovering jump gates, acquire better equipment for your ship and the more you explore, the more choices and options will be available for your conquest. Diplomatic relations, in the other hand, involves either making good terms with specific factions(doing quests, protect from hostile units, colonize planets, trading) or just do your best in abolishing your opposition, be it by rallying with your ally or just straight out declare war on them! Decisions, decisions, decisions.PROSHighly enjoyable and deep space action RPG that provides non-linear courses for you to ensure victory!Combats are fast and satisfying unlike a few others that I've played.Ships are fully customizable whether you opt for more firepower and defense while sacrificing speed and maneuverability or be a speed demon that you know you are and drop the heavy Armor Plating and equip the various weapons of war you'll find!Your ship will leveled up as you play and points are given for you to distribute in the many stats available, just like in traditional RPG, so customization is possible.The graphics, while nothing outstanding, are visually pleasing to the eyes (especially when ships blew up!) although the UI can arguably be better.From a technical point of view, Drox Operative runs great with a stable FPS all around, even during big battles, and I've not experienced any crashes or hiccups of any kind so far. Steam basic functionalities are also present and functional with the exception of Cloud saving.Replay value is extremely high as each new Sector is different when generated, with 10 races to choose from, different ways of achieving victory and the availability of online co-op can provide a significant game changer to the already great game.There's also a challenge mode where specific rules and modification to the Sectors are applied.CONSThe first time you clicked the Play button you'll be greeted with a text box requiring you to input a CD key, as per usual as any Ubisoft, EA or Stardocks games. Good thing you don't have to install anything though.A 100% achievement completion rate is possible but it requires a significant amount of time investment.The multiplayer scene is pretty much dead. I would love to try out the co-op mode but since not many of my close friends have it, I'm gonna have to miss out and joining a public game isn't an option since there's basically no one to play with.Quests sometimes are time-sensitive but the game fails to mention this. I've failed countless of missions because of this and failure means poorer relation with the said race.As a final verdict, Drox Operative deserves a solid 4/5. A satisfying space RPG worthy enough to be played for years to come!At a $20 price tag, it does feel a bit steep for a 4 years old game but if you have friends with similar interest, then it's definitely worth it! Likewise, when the title goes on sale. It's a no-brainer for space junkies to pick this up for a price less than $10.

												I want to like this game. I really honestly do. I love the concept. I love flying around in space shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥But honestly, this game fails on a lot of levels. It just misses the mark in a lot of glaring ways. 1) Scaling: I understand that a ""boss"" monster is gonna be tough, but when he's got 10x your health/shields/whatever and can do vastly more damage per hit than you can (to the tune of damn near 1shotting you), it just takes the fun out of it for me.2) Speed: Enemy ships can and will outrun your bullets; missiles i could understand, but bullets ought to be a lot faster than they are. Additionally, enemy ships (even MASSIVE boss ships) are capable of going WAY faster than player ship. They will go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ across the screen in crazy circles etc. making them unhittable via most weapon types.3) Energy: It is your enemy. Your ship will be permanently sucking wind. If i had most of my hardpoints dedicated to weapons, was cycling all of them on cooldown, and had no energy regen items installed, i can understand energy problems. That is NOT the case, a single decent laser will suck down as much energy as your whole ship can produce, including several installed energy regen devices. Get used to sucking down energy consumables on cooldown during fights.4) AI races: They basically all hate each other, and you. War is the default state in each sector. Someone will be mad at you virtually all the time.5) Victory conditions: Game has great array of victory conditions, several of which are nigh unusable. A diplomatic victory requires you to be allied with multiple AI races, who must be allied with each other. After playing over a dozen sectors, i've only seen 2 computer races allied once, and it didnt last very long before i got drug into the resulting war. Economic victory requires you to accumulate a ♥♥♥♥pile of wealth via quests etc. I've never been more than 1/3 of the way to that victory before the AI races have killed each other off and quests collapse in number. Simplest victories are to kill enough AI race ships/planets to become ""feared"", or ally with the dominant race and help them kill off everyone else.Bottom line is that i just dont feel at all like a ""hero"" in this game. AI ships play by different rules, allowing them to be much stronger than the game allows me to be. Not a very rewarding experience in a game that aims itself at being a fun shooting time waster.			"

												One time I was undecided if I wanted to exterminate some rock people or convince them to join the alliance I already had set up with the most powerful races in the sector. I could have just declared war and let the entangling alliances do the rest, but there was another sectore where I was supposed to protect them and couldn't, where they died before I could even find them. So I figured, let's try to even that out by not killing them all here. It might even take longer.Another time, there was a bunch of obnoxious computer programs that were at war with some space zombies and had been pushed to the limit by attacks from them and random space monsters. They didn't want to fight me just yet, so I strolled over to their planet and noticed they were dangerously low on health. So I casually opened communications, declared war on them, and shot my railgun at what was left of their bases. And then all of their stuff blew up.And just now I equipped a weapon that reduces the enemy's defenses, allowing me to easily land a follow-up laser blast or railgun shot for a ton of damage.Also sometimes there are planets named Porn. The jokes write themselves. Get a crew together and buy a controlling interest in the galaxy.Also also paralax scrolling with edited space telescope pictures is pretty awesome, and I say this as the kind of guy who has space telescope pictures as his wallpaper.

												If you're bored of the only options available in the world being ""collect 7 gnoll lungs"", try Drox Operative. If someone offers you a quest to collect 7 Draining Schistos scales, you're perfectly within your rights to use diplomacy to unite the galaxy in a military alliance to wipe the offending faction from the universe.The game is entirely based around your whims. You don't have to help anyone. One way to win is to simply obliterate every single ship in your path until the sector cowers at the mention of your name. Or alternatively, unite everyone to start a golden age of peace. Or perhaps you want to amass wealth enough to buy the sector? Or maybe it just amuses you to cause one of the unaligned ""monster"" races to take over a planet, then give them so much technology for free that they become the new powerhouse nation in the game, then unite with them to obliterate all the original factions.I've never really found a game that allows you to follow your whims like this before.

												This game doesn't seem like much at first glance, and the screenshots and video did not entice me, but I'm glad I picked this up. Other people described it as diablo in space, and not because of the isometric view. However, unlike any other action RPG or just rpg's in general, this is the first that truly made me attempt to balance my build, and I found keeping my ship balanced and functional a rewarding challenge. There are also a lot of different ways to set everything up, for myself I used a combination of rapid fire lasers, missiles, and fighters while slow boating, and unlike most ARPG's, it's very easy to get overwhelmed. The game is very well balanced and put together from what I've seen so far, and that goes a long ways.Visually the game can be run in 1080p, which makes a difference, and it can look better than the screenshots, but it won't impress anyone. It doesn't seem to have an ongoing story, but rather takes a sandbox approach with very loose winning conditions, ranging from economic and diplomatic methods to conquering and combat oriented methods. Controls for steering the ship aren't what I would consider intuitive, but they are easy enough to pick up using a mouse and keyboard.While the game does have a lot of depth with the political system and other functions, they don't overcomplicate the game, and as long as you make conscientious choices on your allies and enemies, the politics can be largely ignored, and the game plays very arcadish. If you pay attention to the politics and the goings on, it almost feels like the major factions are engaged in a basebuilding RTS and you are there to push whichever sides you choose (not like a MOBA though, they will conquer each other, had one faction out of the running very early in my game), and interfere or ignore as you please. As long as you don't need AAA graphics, or story driven plots, this game will give you a lot of enjoyment. "

												This is not a typical Action RPG. Yes, you go around collecting loot, killing things and completing quests, but that is where the similarities to ARPGs start to peter out.The massive variants of loot, for the most part, are good only for selling. Your ship doesn't have the inventory space or the level required when you start out, so monetise them.The in-game currency is VERY useful to achieve your aims of domination in every sector - money talks. Just like in real life, money gives the power to bend others to your will by buying them off. Whether for good or bad, it is always for the benefit of you and the Drox Guild. The horse trading goes both ways so you can take 'gifts' offered from other races if you feel it is to your benefit. Of couse, your next action might be to declare war on them, such are the political machinations of a Drox Operative. Refuse the offer and watch your relationship deteriorate.Killing and destroying is the typical means to an end. Kill to defend yourself, kill to find loot and gain XP, kill to complete quests and kill for fun. There are various weapon types to choose from but you may just go for the highest damage weapon until you find what you like. There are beam weapons, ballistic weapons, missiles, Electro Magnetic Pulse weapons and more.Questing is often an important part of the game, but not always needed. There are 5 different ways to dominate and win your current sector of the galaxy. Using your ship as a club to beat the races into submission will not require you to complete quests to ingratiate yourself with them, However, due to the various ways to win and lose your current sector, using quests to facilitate alliances or some lesser agreement is often the best move. Races can grow too powerful to deal with alone militarily, so maybe ally with another race or two?If you win your current sector, you start a new sector and new opportunities of higher risk and reward present themselves. Upgrading your ship is another essential goal, as it provides more inventory slots and better stats. Losing your current sector re-rolls a new sector. In this game, every sector pans out differently as the competing races vie for supremacy while trying to use you as a tool for completing their aims. On the other hand, they'll insult you and try to destroy you if you don't do as they want. Best to play them at their own game and use tactics like Propaganda, Espionage, Sabotage and Rumours to undermine them and weaken their grip on a planet/planets, and thus the system.The thought required for this game is quite amazing. So many ways for events to go down and the smart game mechanics make for political intrigue and lots of violence. For me, the way the races are doing what they can to survive, expand or conquer, while I'm trying to dominate is a fantastic game feature. The yelps of delight when a plan works out or the hunkering down for the long haul as a sector hovers in impasse really makes me want to applaud the guys at Soldak.There is a lot of content in this game and a lot to learn. It is a bit baffling at first, but well worth the time learning as it is a game of depth and rewarding achievement. A very different game.			"

												If you're bored of the only options available in the world being ""collect 7 gnoll lungs"", try Drox Operative. If someone offers you a quest to collect 7 Draining Schistos scales, you're perfectly within your rights to use diplomacy to unite the galaxy in a military alliance to wipe the offending faction from the universe.The game is entirely based around your whims. You don't have to help anyone. One way to win is to simply obliterate every single ship in your path until the sector cowers at the mention of your name. Or alternatively, unite everyone to start a golden age of peace. Or perhaps you want to amass wealth enough to buy the sector? Or maybe it just amuses you to cause one of the unaligned ""monster"" races to take over a planet, then give them so much technology for free that they become the new powerhouse nation in the game, then unite with them to obliterate all the original factions.I've never really found a game that allows you to follow your whims like this before.

												This is a solid space shooter with a lot of diablo/roguelike elements to it. The star sectors are randomly generated, and the various alien races play out their own real-time game of 'Galactic Civlization' while you run around choosing sides and playing kingmaker - or just explore and fight the various rogue vessels and space monsters that threaten the galaxy.The combat pacing is moderate, it's neither a twitch oriented bullet-hell game, nor is it slow paced. The strongest aspect of it from what I've seen so far is its very deep itemization system, with a vast array of different technologies and upgrades for your ship. Likewise its catalog of enemy factions and vessels is quite large as well, with new types and abilities being regularly introduced as you proceed through the game.			"

I particularly enjoy the addition of the Scavengers in the expansion, which by far have been my favorite race to play.  I look forward to unlocking their sub-races if I can ever manage to do so.Update 03/02/2015 - After 110 hours into this game, it is still one of my favorites.  I highly recommend any of the Soldak titles, which all seem to use the same engine.  The randomness of the game keeps it fresh, and the settings allow for a great deal of customization.			"

												Giant Bomb PC Gaming Hub explained it best; ""Space Diablo, but with consequences.""===Space Diablo===The game is an action RPG, that takes place within a 4x RTS Strategy game played by the AI. You are a mercenary in this galaxy, and your mission is to achieve victory in one of the following ways... By achieveing a Military Victory, by being allied with the last surviving race and destroying all your enemies.By achieveing a Diplomatic Victory, by uniting all surviving races in a single alliance.By achieveing an Economic Victory, by accumulating wealth for the Drox Operatives.By achieveing a Fear victory, by destroying all who stand in your way without mercy.By achieveing a Legend Victory, by completing assignments and missions given to you by the various races and exploring the galaxy.And finally by completing any and all assignments offered to you by your commanding officers in the Drox Operative's Guild.To succeed in these goals, you must travel the cosmos and upgrade your ship as you gain experience and randomly generated loot. ===Consequences===Here's where the game get's interesting... As stated, there is a 4x RTS Strategy game being played by the AI all around you. You, as a Drox Operative, are able to influence the empires in the Galaxy. You can instigate wars and end wars, you can aid ships and colonies in distress, you can even fight in wars alongside an empire. Everything you do in the game influences the galaxy around you in some way. ===Verdict===The game is excellent, and highly enjoyable in my opinion. I highly reccomend it if you're looking for a good Sci-Fi RPG. The game is also multi-player, allowing players to work together or against one another, so that's another plus in my book. The game is $19.99 normally, and I've seen the winter sale drop it 50% for it and the expansion.			"

												Hey, this game is cool. Imagine Diablo meets Civilization, set in space. It takes some getting used to - particularly with how fast paced the game can progress when you're screwing about, but once you get a hang of it you'll be hooked for days. There is an expansion available for the game already (although it only just hit Steam, Drox has been out for a while and I can't wait until it becomes available here too, but the base game is still a heck of a lot of fun so don't feel like you need to wait for the 'full package'. Thanks to the abundance of context-sensitive help you'll quickly get up to speed on the various dynamics, but I still recommend reading through this guide[www.stephenhornback.com] if you find things overwhelming - like Drox itself, the guide is not particularly pretty, but it's comprehensive and well designed. If you like unique, challenging action-rpgs you should jump on Drox Operative.			"

												This game is simply incredible. To start with the game is most generally an overhead realtime 2d space shooter. Think of games like Space Rangers or SPAZ. You can visit planets, there are hostiles and friendlies all over the map, and so on. Where the game radically diverges from anything else out there (to my knowledge) is in gameplay concept.Imagine a game like Civilization. But instead of playing as a civilization you play as a freelancer manipulating events from the outside. There are lots of ways to win. Ally with the strongest side and destroy everybody else? That works. Have all remaining races allied with each other (and you?) - that works. There are also some side ways to win like being enough of a bad♥♥♥♥♥that everybody becomes sufficiently terrofied of you, or enough of a hero that everybody becomes sufficiently respectful and inspired by you, and so on.This would already be a really fun concept but what takes it over the top is an awesome Diablo style loot system that somehow manages to constantly surprise you with interesting and unexpected items - so more Diablo 2 than Diablo 3 there.  I've played about 20 hours and feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of the game. Very highly recommended along with the DLC which substantially extends and enhances the base game.			"

												Steam can sometimes go weeks without a bringing a quality title to the store; but I have to say they made a great addition with Drox Operative. I knew nothing about this game when I picked it up, and I will say that I have been disappointed by the Steam impulse buy before. Not this time though. There are some downsides of course; the games production value feels quite low. The graphics are dated, and the game is sorely in need of a basic tutorial. If you can see past the graphics however, and its moderate learning curve; you'll see it is an excellent action RPG in its own right. It is remarkably deep; easily scales to be as difficult as you want it to be, and delivers on every feature the store page promises. I'll be honest; I really fell in love with the novelty of the concept. Instead of playing as just another 4x empire; you are a very small player in each randomly generated sector's galatic politics. You cannot take on any one of these empires by your lonesome; but through clever gameplay you can manipulate the entire galaxy and forge its destiny over time. With 5 different ways to win; this concept is awesome and incredibly addicting. Now it just needs more exposure so that cooperative games are easier to find/put together. I look forward to picking up the expansion, and maybe trying out Din's Curse as well.			"

												Unless you have loads of free time - don't buy it because it's pretty good.  It's been a fun game so far, although now that I'm getting farther along it is losing some of its lustre.  The only down side I've run into was spawning into a new sector and being completely surrounded and outgunned by a plethora of enemies.  I died over and over until the horde was drawn away by other things to shoot.  Then I limped around in a broken ship until I lost the sector.  Yep, you can lose a sector but keep going with the same ship and items.  Even though the diplomacy system is a bit weak it works better than most space sims with a similar system - becuase sometimes it actually WORKS.  I guess my only complaint is that once you get beyond level 10 or so the items you find beceome so varied and you find so many that you can waste a lot of time reading what each item does and trying to decide what to use, save for later or sell.  I'm sure with time I'll be come used to the item variety and know, much faster, what to keep and what to toss.  You can even put stuff in a shared ""stash"" so other ships you create can pick it up.  There are five ways to win a sector, four ways to lose and when the loss conditions are met you get a 10 minuite timer to rectify the situation - if you can - or just zip around and blow up more stuff for xp and loot before the time expires.You can often BUY your way to a win if you have enough credits - but not always and it's not always necessary.  So far each sector has felt different in the way things play out.  I even had one sector with all the races in the same star system - let me tell you that was a fast game because they didn't get along.  I had to spend about 30,000 credits (over half of what I had) to convince the last race to ally with me in the last 3 seconds so I wouldn't lose.  Overall this is probably around 8 out of ten.			"

												I love this Space ARPG! I've been playing it when it was available on Soldak's website, but now it has finally arrived on Steam. Off the top of my head there is:-Diplomacy-Co-op multiplayer-Ship & character upgrades-Loot!-Exploration-Multiple win & lose conditions-Quest generation-Hardcore mode-Random galaxies-Races trade and declare war on each other-Open-ended and dynamic gameplay-Pew pew lasersYou are a surviving member of the Drox race; former masters of the universe that are now extinct except for an elite guild called the Drox Operatives. The only goal is to achieve victory through any means such as Military (allied w/ the strongest race left standing), Diplomatic (convince the remaining races to ally with each other), Economic, Fear (destroy everyone) and Legend (explore all the systems, kill named monsters and never attack a race). It's up to you to back the winning horse in a galactic struggle, exploit their weaknesses towards your own gain or play as an altruist.It may not have the greatest graphics in the ARPG genre, but I promise it has great gameplay if you're a fan of isometric dungeon crawl-monster stomps like Diablo, Path of Exile or Torchlight, only with a 4X space twist!

Product received for free
												Before requesting this title for review, I checked first the store page, and from the video and the screenshots available there, I thought it would be some easygoing 'diablo in space' with some diplomacy. Oh boy, I could not have been more wrong!!!Drox Operative is indeed, at first glance, a top down space RPG shoot em up with some equipable items of variably quality (common-rare-elite-etc). But there is more than meets the eye in this title. Essentially you are a freelancer superspy and you can affect how each sector can and will evolve with your actions and choices! For a game that is quite old, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of courses of actions you have available in order to achieve your goals. First thing first, you are a Drox operative (duuuuh) that just finished the training and you enter your first sector to conquer! You choose your ship from a selection of 10 ships, each one unique as it represents each race that you can encounter in your playthrough. How you'll do that is up to you as there are 5 ways to achieve victory. Military, alliance with the highest power race, diplomatic, alliance with everyone, economic, make profit for the Drox guild in this sector, fear, to be dreaded by the factions, and finally legend, that is to do some heroic feats toward every faction like killing space monsters! Each victory has its own rewards and can be equally challenging to the other if you set it as a personal goal. The difficulty level can be customized in quite extremes, as before you start each sector you set your preferences in order to be generated! You'll be able to select from enemy starting level to sector size, speed of expansion for the various races, the number of the races, as well as additional difficulty setting, that becomes available once you achieve certain levels with your ship! When you conquer a sector you retain your ship and items and move to the next sector. Generally speaking, each type of victory requires different approach. Diplomatic victory means that you need to get along even with the most easy to provoke races (or destroy them) and cultivate your relations with each race to the point of them accepting you as an ally. However at the same time you must deal with any conflicts the various races have between them, this is usually achieved via options such as rumors or diplomacy, and you need to interact with each race for this to be effective! In addition you'll need to look for problems that require your attention for each planet, e.g.: X planet needs Y item in order to clear radiation, the cool part in this is that as long as the planet is radiated, certain effects apply, like reduced population growth, which in turn can result in an easy to destroy planet! Fear victory, perhaps the most rewarding and my personal favorite, requires you to do dreadful acts (such as sabotages or delivering nuclear weaponry) as well as daredevil hunting of named elite ships. When feared you will be able to make successful demands from the diplomacy screen and, if you achieve victory, you are give an extra item for each race kept alive at the moment of sector completion! Legend, on the other hand requires you to generally avoid taking parts in conflict and go for various objectives set by many races, usually destroying weapon devices or bounty hunting. Also there will be some random events, like ambushes or wormholes, to put you out of your way for a bit. As a final note in the gameplay section of the review, when you try some indirect action towards a race/planet (rumor/spying/propaganda) you are given 3 choices, depending on the funds you want to spend and success you want to have. However these two values are highly affected by your relationship with said race, so spying on a neutral race will have 75% success rate at max while on a friendly race it can go over 90%. Similarly there are penalties for hostile races!The game, while visually is outdated, still succeeds with its graphics as you'll be drawn to the enormous amount of choices a lot more than to the graphics! The music is nothing special but the sound effects are good and sometimes funny to listen to! (try espionage on a planet). The game is easy to learn, because it employs in game help texts instead of a pure tutorial level that pop at the appropriate time instead of flooding your screen all at once. Additionally there is a help screen with all the topics combined should you want to review anything. The controls are easy to understand and you can customize them as you wish. However the lack of an actual tutorial can lead new players into defeat as you need to be aware of what is happening between the various races at all times. Additionally the AI can be a bit meh, or make you wonder about the 'I' part, as it sometimes does unintelligent actions, like requesting a treaty while bribing you with 300 credits, and after you reject it can request the same treaty again bribing 100 credits. However this was not the norm. Also there are a few bugs or glitches, e.g.: X race requests me to steam Y tech for them, I ignore this and later in the game I steal from X the Y the requested tech (that they either got from spying or developed), and I complete the quest! Finally my biggest complain, I could not find any use for the various techs I came across the game other than use them as diplomacy trading chips. I hope that given this game is gigantic, to find in a future playthrough some use for them.Overall Drox Operative is a great game and definitely worth its price, as it can keep you entertained for extended periods of time! Also it is quite unique to what is has to offer, game features which I can't find a title that combines most of them and to such degree!-------------------------------------------I recieved this game by the steamified group.For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com "

												Hey, this game is cool. Imagine Diablo meets Civilization, set in space. It takes some getting used to - particularly with how fast paced the game can progress when you're screwing about, but once you get a hang of it you'll be hooked for days. There is an expansion available for the game already (although it only just hit Steam, Drox has been out for a while and I can't wait until it becomes available here too, but the base game is still a heck of a lot of fun so don't feel like you need to wait for the 'full package'. Thanks to the abundance of context-sensitive help you'll quickly get up to speed on the various dynamics, but I still recommend reading through this guide[www.stephenhornback.com] if you find things overwhelming - like Drox itself, the guide is not particularly pretty, but it's comprehensive and well designed. If you like unique, challenging action-rpgs you should jump on Drox Operative.			"

												This game is pretty great, but it's not worth $20. It is worth 5 tho.It's kinda neat in that it has a rich universe, but limited in the way you can interact with it.Factions can colonize, attack, defend, build ships, and so on. But not you. You can only interact with other factions. You're just one ship in a big sector of the galaxy. There's more missions than you can shake a stick at, plenty of monster ships to fight, and then you have to worry about relations with factions, and you'll probably want to have a good relation with whoever is probably going to win, because war is pretty inevitable, and you're bound to get caught in the middle. Pick the right side, or throw off the balance by messing with their enemies.			"

												You play an agent of the Drox Guild seeking to spread the influence of the guild throughout the universe. You're dropped into a sector full of different species, and have to make them all fear you, become a legend by destroying the most powerful monsters in that region of space, become an economic powerhouse, or ally with all the species in the sector (and destroy the species that won't).The developer, Soldak, is a small shop that keeps iterating on the same idea - an ARPG where the quests and adventures are the natural byproduct of a living and changing world that reacts to what you do in it. The all have a lot of heart and in my opinion Drox Operative is the best of them.			"

												Do not be put off by the simple graphics and retro music. This game has depth, action and shear fun.Your persistent ship keeps being challenged by random sectors, for which the difficulty is all up to you. Slow, casual grind or fast, tough games. The choice is yours.Plenty of classes, plenty of items, plenty of skill point decisions. This game is fantastic for any ARPG or space fan. If it had better graphics, it would be famous!Nice job devs!			"

												Genre: Space Action/Adventure w/ RPG ElementsPersonal Rating 7.5/10Drox Operative is an interesting game in that is has Diablo-esque elements that appear in the forms and grades of loot drops (ie different rarities). You take the role of a Drox operative playing the role of one of several distinct races. Your objective is to win thru several different ways such as an economic victory, diplomacy, military might, etc. You can set the game to have the play field small (such as a mere handfull of sectors) to very vast with dozens of sectors to explore. You start out in your 'Home' sector where you will encounter your first race. It is benificial to open up trade agreements with all you encounter at first; but as time progresses and lines in the sand are drawn you will want to work to forge an alliance with the most powerful factions.You gain influence with factions by completing quests for them, protecting their planets and ships from attack and trading w/ them. You also lose influince by trading and associating with enemies of factions. Quests can range from assassinitaion to ferrying supplies. Planets can come under all kinds of pressure, from disease/famine/unrest and riots/zombie appocolypse/etc. Each of these problems requires certain cargo to solve so as you pick up the quest you can search the network on where to find the supplies to deliver.One neat aspect I likes was the addition of random crew members. they can drop as loot and can be leveled up and assigned to your ship.The game has difficulty levels from 1-100 so to reach higher levles with your ship you will need to keep starting over in new sectors and set the diff to higher levels. You also can invest points into your command skill which will unlock bigger ships for you. I personally liked it when I was able to install my first Fighter Bay. I recomend doing ths asap because it really helps having them support your ship. And let me mention all the other types of customization, from EMP pulses to computer virus' to fusion and nuclear mines and missles to all kinds of lasers and beams just to name a few. The sky is the limit when it comes to customization.It's worth it to mention all the different encounter types you can come across, from Rogue Elite Mobs to wandering traders to abandoned ships to Minerable Asteroids and Rogue Comets and space pirates to name a few.If you like Dungeon Delving (albiet in space) and space exploration and hack and slash button mashing combat, I would recommend giving this a try either for yourself or a 4pack so you and your friends can conquer the stars together.

												TL:DR - If you love ARPGs and want to play a very unique interpretation of the genre, buy this game. It is wonderful.Drox Operative is a highly unique experience which is a rare feat in today's world of games that are immediately familiar and easily described as ""Game A"" combined with ""Game B"". Although not flashy, it has heart, creativity, fun, reward, and innovation in spades. The play is direct and simple as is typical for ARPGs but very deep and customizable, and the choices of what equipment to keep and what to trade away goes well beyond simply choosing which bauble has the biggest numbers on it. The best adjective I can use for this game is 'rewarding'. The experience of playing Drox Operative FAR FAR outstrips the moderate price tag that Texas-based Soldak Entertainment is asking for it.Drox Operative is a true hidden gem that combines 4x space, ARPG, and resource management into a game that is simple to play, hard to master and always evolving because of the choices you make. All of this combines to make a game that feels alive and dangerous in a way that other ARPGs just don't have. It is an unexpected treasure nestled in a hidden corner of a genre that has many fine offerings. The only disappointing thing about this game is that so few people know about it. With wider coverage this game would be legendary.If you love ARPGs but want something that takes the genre to the next level, play the free demo. Better still, save yourself some time and just buy the game. The galaxy awaits.Happy gaming,M13			"

												Drox Operative can be described as an Action RPG. It has all the elements of an action rpg, for example you have a character(ship) who has attributes that both increase the overall stats of the ships in obvious categories, such as damage, or speed, and which allows you to equip the items you loot from the dead, provided you reach the minimum level in the required stat. The items you collect from the vanquished correlate in many ways with the types of items you would find in an average RPG sporting a normal human(or whatever) character. You have weapons and armour. However, the ship nature of your main character quickly makes its presence known because you have alot of item types which you will not usually find in an average RPG sporting a humanoid.An Action RPG, but not as we know itYou quickly need to become accustomed to a range of items such as power plants, crew, thrusters, computers, shields(of the energy and regenerating kind), cargo bays, batteries etc. It's not difficult to come to grips with, it will just be quite unfamiliar for a while. The range of items is relatively small when you first start, but the variety builds up over time, so that you can make a ship built of quite an interesting set of equipped items. The flexibility comes from that fact that the item slots in your ship are only limited by the size class of the item. So you have light, medium and heavy components. And you can fill up those heavy components with any heavy components you want. Obviously some things are essential, but it’s not like you specifically need gauntlets of strength to complete your build. If you can’t find those Gauntlets of Strength, just put on another Helmet of Strength, or 6 helmets (you know what I mean).  As the item diversity increases you will find that that Heavy component power plant you absolutely needed might be able to be switched with a medium component solar panel, and some other heavy component switched in.Though I will say here, while this sounds great, you will be very limited in terms of choice in the early game. And by early game, I mean the first 20 to 30 levels. Manipulating the Galaxy for fun and profitThe game goes further away from the mould in its most distinctive feature, which is its constantly moving universe. The typical Action RPG has a level of random built into it. While it has its specific quests and overall story and backgrounds, the enemies are probably selected randomly from a selection of enemy types for the area. Drox Operative has no specific story or quests. It is a simulation of sorts, whereby a randomly generated galaxy will be built, and a selection of the possible aliencivs will be placed around that galaxy. The aliencivs will then start playing their 4X game, or in other words, they will start building their empires by exploring the galaxy for planets, building colonies and ships, possibly building alliances and killing each other. You are but one ship, but you are very powerful in comparison to one ship of an alien civ. You won’t be singlehandedly destroying large civilisations, but your help can certainly turn the tide. The quests you receive will depend on what the alienciv currently wants or needs, based on the random elements which make up the galaxy. So quests can be generated by war, where each side will ask you to help kill the other side. Or quests can be created because a plague has spread across a planet.To be fair, the actual task of the quests won’t set the world on fire. They are usually something like buy this item from this planet and take it to this planet. Or kill 4 of this enemy. Or kill this enemy until you find enough of these parts. The two part that differ are that you won’t get the same quest every game, and the results  of the quests are not predetermined. The first point, that you won’t get the same quests is pretty obviously explained at this point, but here I will explain the result not being predetermined in better detail. Of course the completion of a quest will result in such and such experience points and such and such money being gained, but it also affect relation points. You will gain relation points with an alienciv. But this also means you lose relation points with an alienciv that hates them. The aliencivs have relations with each other as well. So you may see aliencivs that don’t really like each other coming to like each other because they are both at war with the same enemy. And they like seeing the other civilisation killing their enemy.I didn’t mention this before, but the enemy ships are also a faction of sorts, the level of faction similarity depending on whether you have the expansion.  Without the expansion, the various monsters fight each other and the alienciv, they grow stronger by winning, they build various installations and make raids on the alienciv. This opens up another set of quests, which become more important as the game goes on, as the aliencivs need these various menaces taken care of. And if you(or the alienciv) does not destroy them early, they will become more powerful over time. With the expansion, the monster ships can also colonise planets and become another alienciv vying for control.Win or lose? It’s how you play the game!There are five ways to win and three ways to lose. You can progress towards multiple win states at the same time, but some win states are somewhat detrimental to getting other win states. Your every action can contribute to one or another win state. They can also contribute to a lose state. For example, if you are trying to be diplomatic and get everybody to ally up with you, you may end up provoking one alienciv while trying to gain the favour of another. You may end up with a win, but you may have had to kill off a number of aliencivs to accomplish it. And killing aliencivs doesn’t help with you legend status, though it certainly helps the galaxy fear you. And while it may seem that a military win, where you just have to be allied to the last surviving race, is easy, there are a lot of things that can go wrong. You can pick an ally, but end up losing them. And you will find yourself the only one left in the galaxy with that bitter enemy you fought tooth and nail to kill. You may be still alive, but your conquest of the sector has failed, and you will need to move on.The randomness can be highly customised by the player at the creation of the galaxy, with many features and elements able to be turned on or off. You will be creating many galaxies, because you will probably win or lose a galaxy in a few hours at max.I recommend Drox Operative. It has some polish issues, but it is certainly very unique, and worth perservering with. Also, it has online coop, and I assume that is fun.I certainly recommend trying out the demo if Drox Operative sounds interesting.			"

												At its simplest, Drox Operative is spaceship Diablo.  But the game is much more than that.  The AI is running a multi-party 4X game; the player acting as kingmaker or kingbreaker as necessary to reach his own goals.  Just reach your goals before the 4X game ends, even if it means betraying (temporary) allies in order to delay their victory.Just give the game a chance, as it can take more than one game for everything to click.

												Review: DROX OPERATIVEI used to love playing PC games in the 90's.. In fact, I thought games such as Commander Keen, Solar Winds & Blake Stone were really ahead of their time (And that games couldn't get any better than this).. Now I'm 32, balding, and ugly. But you know what? When I started playing Drox Operative, that childhood charm came back again. With Drox Operative. It takes Diablo + Galactic Civilizations, and it forces you to cream your pants every time you load a new sector. You know that joy of being completely overpowered just by picking up this random♥♥♥♥♥sword you were so lucky to have drop? Yea.. That's the feeling you'll get when you play this game.All of Soldak Entertainment's games have sucked, but this one.. This one is the formula that they should stick to and never do anything else. If you're looking for a game that forces you to not take a shower, or ignore your wife, or make you go to the store to buy that coveted 12-pack of Mountain Dew.. This is the game.My Recommendation? BUY BUY BUY!!!!!			"

												A very interesting premise where you are a mercenary and the AI empires are pretty much playing a 4X game around you, however there are some very big shortcomings.While the AI have not met other AI, they flourish. However once they meet, they will start sabotaging each other like crazy which gives planets everything from mutation plagues to mass insanity. At this stage every empire declines into its inevitable destruction.You can try stop it (Which feels more like handholding or babysitting), however it will usually only delay mutual destruction, not stop it. Also, once you start babysitting one empire, every other empire (unless they have allies) will hate you and declare war on you.Ship customization is also nice, but it would be good if there was more control over which areas of your ship you wanted to expand (More heavy/medium/light). Combat is unteresting but also gets repetitive			"

												I gotta say I'm impressed with the game.  It is an action space combat game where you fly around and target ships with the mouse and fire.  Thats basically the core mechanics.  There are races waging war and doing whatever around you and that is where the cooler features come into play.  You can use diplomacy to gain friends and exchange technology, manipulate races into warring with each other, use espionage and steal technology, wipe out planets, so one and so forth.  It's basically Masters of Orion but you control one independent ship rather than a series of planets and fleets. You can go around doing whatever you want.			"

												In short: Space Diablo.In more detail, Drox Operative is like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child result of a one night stand between Galactic Civilizations and Diablo. You have some interesting diplomacy options that allow you to protect yourself and the ability to sell stolen technologies tied in with a point-and-click, top-down, action-rpg. The mechanics are simple enough to learn, and ship configuration is a series of tough choices adding some good depth.Downsides of this game are that loot optimization is basically all you're doing, though it is very satisfying. Leveling starts slowing around level 15 and pacing in general can be quite slow at times (Especially when trying to convince 2 of your allies to ally themselves so you can win). Overall, the game is addicting and, most importantly, fun. If you like Diablo-style games, this is highly recommended. Less recommended to those seeking a Gal-Civ like game.			"

The game is a well designed with clear goals and the concepts are easy to pick up with a bit of practice. The control over the level and rules of each sector makes it easy to fit your style.This is recommended only to those who have the time to put into it. You'll be repeating the same thing over and over and over and over.Update: mods help reduce the pain.http://www.soldak.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=31 "

												This game has some cool ideas but some things kill it for me. First of all, while the game itself is easy to play, the learning curve is steep. I read some player guides for help and I STILL didn't really feel comf ortable playing. And the the most important reason: You start out with practically NO CASH and you are told missions raise cash, fine.  You get some missions and find most of them are in another sector and the ONLY way to get to the missions is to pay to use it (in game currency) Guess what? You don't have enough because you just started the freaking game! Note to all devs: if you make it a hassle just to play the game, you wont have many players. In summary, I can NOT recommend this game because the cool ideas are buried under poor design choices. Asked for a refund.			"

												I had a tough time really staying motivated with this game. Though I put in a decent amount of playtime, I didn't really feel that I'd accomplished all that much, and I didn't feel like pushing forwards. A friend and I played a handful of games, and ended up getting meeting three of the win conditions. The other win conditions seemed to involve a bit more luck, and seemed to drag on and on. In my view, although these games are procedurally-generated, the variables don't seem to produce anything particularly interesting. The best part of the game, in my view, is the way that your ship is constructed. Your ""build"" consists (for the most part) of which parts you install on your ship. If you want to be more tanky, put on more armor at the cost of firepower/thrusters/power. If you want to maximize DPS, throw on a second weapon. However, it's difficult to really feel that you've maximized your spots, and it's hard to plan when you really don't quite know what you'll find. However, I understand that planning in an action-RPG is not something that everyone is interested in doing. However, I like to do it in every one, to know where all my skills points (etc) are going. One quick fix that might improve my experience would be an outline of which types of parts can go into which slots. Is it possible to find a weapon in the green slot? Are there any super-powerful red crew members?			"

												Don't look at my ""hours played"", as I play offline mostly. Look at my achievements.If you're looking for a good 2D space combat game like ""Solar Winds"", ""Starscape"", or ""SPAZ"", this is not it. Keep moving.This is a ♥♥♥♥ing grind fest with a space skin on it, nothing more.Think Borderlands, with no plot. All there is to this game is grind for XP, grind for better random items, that's it. It also shows strong evidence of no playtesting. There's no attempt to make this game fun. Expect to get one-hit killed many many times when you get to level 50. It starts getting quite unbalanced about that point. I found an enemy that had health regeneration that was higher than my DPS, and I had put about 40% of my points into tactical (the damage stat).Also, it is not possible to max out your character, there are 6 skills, and enough levels + points to max out 2 of them, assuming you put absolutely no points into anything else.Graphics are pretty rough, which probably wont bother you if you're looking for a 2D space combat game, sadly however the frame rate stuttered quite often on my as of 2014 US$3000 PC.That may be your cup of tea, but it sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥is not mine.Avoid like the plague.

												OH GEE, DID THEY DROP THE BALL ON THIS ONE.So basically, the game has a ton of cool features: fly a ship around and interact with a ""Sector"" (more on that later), that lives/breathes/dies on its own, and where you are a sort of ""special agent"" working for a group called the DROX (basically, like the Illuminati in space), who only care about making money, and having control over everyone else in some sort of NWO bull shack scheme; but ulimately, as long as it profits them.So where does the game go so stupidly wrong?First of all, that you can fly around and affect the world is like Space Rangers 2.While the game boasts freedom, and has 20 times more options/features than Space Rangers 2, incuding a full-on Diplomacy aspect, it's really incredibly limiting.A total chore.The game all happens in real time. That can be pretty bloody annoying where you get 10 million pop-ups, which are basically galactic fires you MUST try to put out, so the DROX ""plan"" stays on track. Otherwise, you go to ""YOU'RE GONNA F ING LOSE in 10 minutes!"" countdown mode.Basically, the game tells you when things are so screwed, that you are going to lose the game...in 10 minutes.That's nice.However, to fix issues with other races killing each other (over the smallest, stupidest things), often involves doing quests for them. ""OK, so DRAAK says, go explore THAT PLANET, in THAT SYSTEM"", but it WILL TAKE YOU FOREVER TO FLY THERE.Not to mention all the hostile mobs that will spawn and spam you with their weapons along the way.GAWD, you fly sooooooooooooooo slooooooooooooooooooooooow in this game.Even with equipment to boost your speed, it's barely noticeable.The game is supposed to be in a galaxy, but it's really a ""sector"".If you lose, you are pretty much told you suck and can continue...in a new sector!Sectors are designed by mentally impaired chimpanzees.One of them, was literally a STRAIGHT F NG LINE.I now present, the DROX OPERATIVE rendition of the song: ""Dem Bones""""The A system is connected to the...B system,the B system is connected to the...C system,the C system is connected to the...D system,now hear the word of Soldak!""Also, your system radar is smelly like a dirty behind. You have to fly around forever to clear the ""fog of the star system"" to find anything.Even better, it only marks where you found planets and jump gates, and not stations, recharge stations (critical, because after firing like 10 laser shots, your ships out of power and it might say you recharge 2pts. per second, and your laser costs 10pts. to fire, and so in 5 seconds, you can fire. Meanwhile, you have surplus of power!....WHO DESIGNED THIS VOMIT PILE OF ORAFICE GUNK?).So, while you're spammed with messages from the AI nations, and all their problems, and unable to get to them all, and going to lose the game unless you...read the strategy guides? Well, any game you have to go online to figure out how to F NG play it, or read a plethora of strategy guides, hints, how to mod or to download mods (most are all hosted on sites that require you sign-up so they can sell all of your information like Facebook), well, then that game is a not a GAME but an AT-HOME WORK PROJECT.You can have more fun FAPPING to an Excel Spreadsheet than mess with this junk.And it's sad because they tried to make it real simple.Even has an option to use a Joystick.No, not for fapping, but controlling your ship.There is no auto-flight, but rather you must keep your finger pressed to move.You can't select an area of the map either. Only immediate objects to auto-fly/move/chug to them.That's totally lame.You will sprain your fricken finger and then your fapping-self (or your lady friend) are over for a good time being.Simple, cool things: it's like Diablo in space. Random, varied loot items drop to add to your ship's stuff.Of course, you're not equipping a dude or dudette, but a ship.But they catagorize ""equipemtn slots"" by stupid bleeding colors: Green slot, Yellow slot stuff, Red slot stuff, Orange slot stuff.For some reason, you can have Armor plates that are ""Yellow slot stuff"" but then others that are ""Red slot stuff"".I didn't notice any stack but then again, all the info is all over the place and game seems prone to stat bugs, who knows what I was looking at?You can get ""chips"", like ""gems"" to socket items, but the game makes it such a tedious, poorly explained chore, you'd think you just click and slide it in the thing, but no, that just can't be simple. LOL. One time, an item I was using I realized had an empty slot. I couldn't do it while equipped. I moved to my inventory...now it doesn't say it has an empty slot? WTH?So, you'll run into all kinds of junk like that.Endless trash loot. They have colors for loot type: Grey, Green, Yellow, etc. so that adds to the confusion.All that stuff sucks too. I've had Grey items 5x better than Green, Yellow, for example.Even on the easiest settings, you'll lose, die a few times, but mostly, you'll quickly find this game so frustrating, just trying to do 1 thing, when INEXPLICABLY, everyone declares WAR on each other AND YOU.And then you're going to F NG lose the game...in 10 minutes.Also, the more you level up, the less XP you get per kill and longer it takes, to where it becomes a really horrible grind.Especially for a single-player game.If this was a PTP MMO, this would make sense, even making travel SO SLOW THAT TURTLES WILL FEED BAD FOR YOU, it would all make sense.Instead, nah, they'd rather bork your experience by 86'ing all fun from this.""OH LOOK, COOL EXPLOSIONS! UH, wait? I did a quest to deliver a package to the Humans and the Draak and Dryad empires got so panty-knotted, even though my relations with them were high for all the quests I did for them, that they declare are on us? Just like THAT?! Uhhh. Is this a 'fun' game or just a tr0ll that polymorphed into a game? Why do I feel like reading junk mail will be more fun at this point?""*DROXXORED*			"

												I wish that I had played the demo first; I found this game disappointing.Based on online, gaming magazine reviews and Youtube reviews, I was expecting something similar to Space Rangers 2: Reboot or a 4 x game like either Star Control or Master of Orion 2. This game is neither of these things.You are the last of the Drox race, a once mighty Empire that was all but destroyed in a war. You only have one ship, you don't build more and you don't colonize planets. Your goal is to figure out which AI race will emerge as the strongest race and brown-nose them, by doing quests for them. A race might ask you to find a replacement power supply for a planet or smuggle in hand-held weapons, to quell subsequent riots. It sounds more interesting than it actually is, since it is just a case of buying an item from a specific vendor and then transporting it to the specific planet.Figuring out which race will emerge victorious is not difficult, since you have 100% intelligence gathering, regarding Empire strength. Some races lack social skills, or are fickle, or aggressive. I knew how the second game would play out, after losing the first. The race traits don't change between games, so that will completely kill any longevity. You spend most of your time flying around, at the speed of a snail, exploring derelict ships, in an attempt to uncover the fog of war. Random ships and races will attack you. Combat consists of spamming the 1 key because the other two weapons in the game are worthless, by comparison. Finding random loot and juggling items was fun in the first game but you figure out how to min / max the game in a couple of hours.This game was a waste of time and money, to the point that I highly recommend playing the demo or avoiding it altogether. I wish that I could get my money back. Play whatever is the best Space Rangers game out there.Master of Orion 2 is still the best 4x game ever:http://www.gog.com/game/master_of_orion_1_2Alpha Centauri is also an excellent 4x game:http://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri "

												Consider, if you will, the role that the Jedi play in the Star Wars universe, and the similar role played by the Sith.   Shove them in a blender with a little Privateer and a little Terraria and you have Drox Operative.    The entire point of this game is to be the most important unimportant person in the universe. The game itself is a 4x game that you aren't playing.   Sure, you can fight, trade, engage in diplomacy, and build up your ship, but the actual 4x game is being played by the AI.   Your job is to represent the mysterious Drox, a race with the goal of ensuring they can always manipulate each galaxy from the shadows.    Your ships persist inventory and stats similarly to Terraria and each time you fly to a new universe, you leave the old behind. The win condition is to ensure that the Drox are allied with the ""last man standing""; in other words, either help a race/alliance of races conquer the galaxy through diplomacy or war, or kill everyone in the game that isn't you.   Completion alongside special directives from Drox Command gets you bonuses to help you along the way in the next mission, and the level cap can take a small forever to reach.   Except at hardcore difficulties, death doesn't end the game; only having the entire universe hate the Drox and not fix that condition before time runs out can forcibly end a world. Unfortunately, while the replayability is high, the gameplay gets samey.   You *will* end up at war with someone, probably because of an ill-chosen alliance early on.   You will also see lots of space monsters, most of which are really just pirate ships, but some are irritiatingly biological for being in space.  The level cap is high but it's unlikely you'll reach it with one ship before moving to another.  The best way to deal with combat is long range weapons and kiting your opponents or shelling them from a distance.    On my nVidia 760GTX's in SLI, the ""advanced graphic"" option that creates a lot of pretty effects in space just reveals that the designers got lazy and made the ships partially transparent so it would look like they were ""in"" the nebulaic clouds.   TO be fair, this may have been a limitation of the dated graphics engine. Definitely a good game at the price, highly recommended for a game to go to when you want to be a manipulative jerk in a 4x game.   Don't get it and expect the second coming of the Starflight series, though.			"

												Not a bad game and it certainly has a LOT of potential. It would be nice if the loot wasn't so random; at least a percentage needs to be geared towards where you are and race specific. It is very difficult to ""upgrade"" because vendors options are nearly useless, which means you rely on ""drops"" for upgrades. Some of these, depending on your race, can be very problematic to procure. This is especially true for power...you either have too much or not nearly enough. Regardless. Minor issues overall. I've played about 50 hours so far and I can see myself getting bored pretty quick because it turns into a ""grind fest"", but so far it's been a decent game.			"

												I've never really paid much attention to this title, assuming (wrongly) that it was a lesser version of SPAZ. How I wish I had known what a gem this game was sooner! Unfortunatley, Drox Operative is mislabeled as simply being an ""action RPG,"" when in reality it is far more than merely that. This game is actually similar to The Last Federation in some ways; a 4X game that pits you with or against the computer players who are warring against or allying with each other. Unlike The Last Federation, Drox Operative has co-op.Yes, Drox Operative has dated graphics and sound, but the gameplay is unique. I can't think of another sci-fi game that plays even remotely similarly to this. Albeit, the price of entry is a bit high, but it's worth it. Still, I've seen it on sale, so if you have the patience, it might be worth waiting.			"

												I saw this game about a year ago and didn't get it until earlier this week...too bad I don't have a time machine! This game is pretty incredible. It's like a smoother version of Diablo II, in space.The coolest thing about it is that you are just one ship in a living galaxy. There are factions that are trying to control all of known space and it's up to you to choose how you want to influence the game world. It's pretty cool to have an ARPG that actually lets you roleplay and do what you want as opposed to just giving you linear quests.I got this game on sale, but I'd gladly pay the full $20 for it. I mean, if you're like me you probably have dozens of games in your library you haven't even installed, much less played. Buy this game, play it, and blow stuff up!			"

												It's a neat concept for a Diablo type game in space. You customize your starship with modules and then go out and kill space monsters for loot and experience points. When you levelup you invest in ability points like computers or tactical rather than strength or dexterity. Basic module types like shields, weapons, thrusters, etc exist, but there are a lot of other different types of modules, especially at later levels.You get quests, sell loot and engage in diplomacy with AI empires that are playing a little automatic 4x game. It's a nice touch because it makes the game world dynamic. In addition the quests you get are based on the state of the 4x game, and succeeding in them or failing to complete them in time have natural consequences for the strength of AI empires and the random monsters.There's also some depth to it because the other empires engage in diplomacy with each other and you can influence this by spreading rumors which change relations and supporting empires economicly.The developer of this game also made Depths of Peril and a few other similar games, so if you've played that you have a pretty good idea of the gameplay concepts involved. This is their best game yet though, I enjoy it a lot more than DoP and will probably play it in short sessions for a long time to come.			"

												Not a bad game and it certainly has a LOT of potential. It would be nice if the loot wasn't so random; at least a percentage needs to be geared towards where you are and race specific. It is very difficult to ""upgrade"" because vendors options are nearly useless, which means you rely on ""drops"" for upgrades. Some of these, depending on your race, can be very problematic to procure. This is especially true for power...you either have too much or not nearly enough. Regardless. Minor issues overall. I've played about 50 hours so far and I can see myself getting bored pretty quick because it turns into a ""grind fest"", but so far it's been a decent game.			"

												I've never really paid much attention to this title, assuming (wrongly) that it was a lesser version of SPAZ. How I wish I had known what a gem this game was sooner! Unfortunatley, Drox Operative is mislabeled as simply being an ""action RPG,"" when in reality it is far more than merely that. This game is actually similar to The Last Federation in some ways; a 4X game that pits you with or against the computer players who are warring against or allying with each other. Unlike The Last Federation, Drox Operative has co-op.Yes, Drox Operative has dated graphics and sound, but the gameplay is unique. I can't think of another sci-fi game that plays even remotely similarly to this. Albeit, the price of entry is a bit high, but it's worth it. Still, I've seen it on sale, so if you have the patience, it might be worth waiting.			"

												I saw this game about a year ago and didn't get it until earlier this week...too bad I don't have a time machine! This game is pretty incredible. It's like a smoother version of Diablo II, in space.The coolest thing about it is that you are just one ship in a living galaxy. There are factions that are trying to control all of known space and it's up to you to choose how you want to influence the game world. It's pretty cool to have an ARPG that actually lets you roleplay and do what you want as opposed to just giving you linear quests.I got this game on sale, but I'd gladly pay the full $20 for it. I mean, if you're like me you probably have dozens of games in your library you haven't even installed, much less played. Buy this game, play it, and blow stuff up!			"

												Ok now I'm not very far into the game, as I keep getting overwhelmed. It is my recurring theme that I try to bite off more than I can chew. But this is as the recommendations that spurred me to buy it suggested: a gem. It truly feels like a Diablo 3 like 2D space sim. There are lots of power ups, dropped loot, upgrades, you can launch fighters to assist you and such. So I'm just going to go back to playing now.			"

												Bought this on sale thinking it would be another game I play once and never touch again. I was wrong.The gameplay is simple and somewhat familiar as an ARPG. Kill, Loot, Upgrade. What more do you need? While the graphics lack in the ""pretty"" department, they more than suffice to keep the game running smooth while you blow up tons of mobs. Something perfect for when you really want to play a game but don't want to be online to do so.Give it a try! I'm glad I did!			"

												I suppose the idea here is that this is like playing a mercenary in a 4X game, while the AI handles the four x's. In practice this seems to work, there are AI civilizations fighting, colonizing and entering into diplomacy and you can influence and effect things, sabotage races you want to lose, or just join in an all-out fight, pick a side to ally with and destroy their enemies. Easy enough to pick up and there's depth to keep you playing. Its a really good idea, the game has a lot of charm, and when it works is a lot of fun. Diablo-like, this is a point and click shooter with a streamlined leveling system and crate-loads of loot.The trouble is its as buggy as hell, and at 2+ years old there really shouldn't be such blatant bugs. I keep getting quests to colonize non-existent planets, to destroy non-existent enemies and half the time complete quests I wasn't even set (which is a nice XP boost, sure, but confusing!) Imagine hunting a bounty in Diablo 3 having being told they are in Westmarch Commons. You spend an hour looking for them only to get bored, go elsewhere, and discover the bounty was actually in Desolate Sands.It looks like the main issue is that the game randomly generates each sandbox sector for you to explore, and simply gets muddled by the amount of random info. being generated. It means a lot of aimless wandering, and wiki visiting to find out where you are actually supposed to be. The other trouble is that it is very easy to win a sector (I hope it gets harder as I level up), I just keep buying victories, paying off the most powerful race to be my ally. I also felt the inventory options were limited, while these can be expanded, even when I had four cargo bays I was leaving a lot of litter spread around the galaxy (never mind the fact that none of the vendors ever have enough money to buy goods from you!) Add to this the fact that there are random wormholes everywhere. They always seem to catapult me to a part of the galaxy well above my current level and seem to be a random 'insta-death' function that you cannot avoid. Finally, I have scoured the options and menus and cannot find any information about how many experience points you have and how many are needed to level up. These are all very minor quibbles, but considering the number of indie Diablo-clones out there that are far more polished (and cheaper, or even free!) these add up to disappointment.Recommended with caveats and a hope that a future patch fixes some of these issues.

												Consider, if you will, the role that the Jedi play in the Star Wars universe, and the similar role played by the Sith.   Shove them in a blender with a little Privateer and a little Terraria and you have Drox Operative.    The entire point of this game is to be the most important unimportant person in the universe. The game itself is a 4x game that you aren't playing.   Sure, you can fight, trade, engage in diplomacy, and build up your ship, but the actual 4x game is being played by the AI.   Your job is to represent the mysterious Drox, a race with the goal of ensuring they can always manipulate each galaxy from the shadows.    Your ships persist inventory and stats similarly to Terraria and each time you fly to a new universe, you leave the old behind. The win condition is to ensure that the Drox are allied with the ""last man standing""; in other words, either help a race/alliance of races conquer the galaxy through diplomacy or war, or kill everyone in the game that isn't you.   Completion alongside special directives from Drox Command gets you bonuses to help you along the way in the next mission, and the level cap can take a small forever to reach.   Except at hardcore difficulties, death doesn't end the game; only having the entire universe hate the Drox and not fix that condition before time runs out can forcibly end a world. Unfortunately, while the replayability is high, the gameplay gets samey.   You *will* end up at war with someone, probably because of an ill-chosen alliance early on.   You will also see lots of space monsters, most of which are really just pirate ships, but some are irritiatingly biological for being in space.  The level cap is high but it's unlikely you'll reach it with one ship before moving to another.  The best way to deal with combat is long range weapons and kiting your opponents or shelling them from a distance.    On my nVidia 760GTX's in SLI, the ""advanced graphic"" option that creates a lot of pretty effects in space just reveals that the designers got lazy and made the ships partially transparent so it would look like they were ""in"" the nebulaic clouds.   TO be fair, this may have been a limitation of the dated graphics engine. Definitely a good game at the price, highly recommended for a game to go to when you want to be a manipulative jerk in a 4x game.   Don't get it and expect the second coming of the Starflight series, though.			"

												Explore a new sector in space.  Find tons of monsters and aliens.  Explode them all.  Find salvage to upgrade ship (and crew, even). Well, maybe don't explode all the aliens, some of them have money or parts or supplies for your ship.  Blow up the right things until your boss says you did a good job.  Move on to next sector, one slightly more dangerous than the last.  Repeat.I like how the universe evolves in a galaxy campaign depending on your actions in previous sector.  New subraces popping up or others going extinct.  Some races start to tend to align towards or (more likely) against each other.  But you can still change these trends if you focus on them.You can do the quests the planets give you or you can ignore them and go fight random monsters and pirates.  Or just go on a rampage against those energy beings that annoyed you in the last sector, seeking to wipe them from the galaxy for good this time.  But when the guild gives you a mission, well, sometimes you just have wipe out your closest allies for the good of the galaxy or the loot.  (Mostly the loot.)			"
