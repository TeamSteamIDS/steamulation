												Cthulhu Saves the World is an old school RPG where you find your party members and fight random battles with a turn based system. Part of the charm to this game is that it mimics the original Dragon Quest games in color, menus, maps and even the feel of the towns. If You've played Breath of Death VII, you've played this.After each battle, each party member gets restored to full health, including dead characters. Even if you escape, you get full health. This makes the game streamlined and easy even on normal (medium) difficulty. To compensate for this, the game balances out by powering up the monsters after each round. Their attack strength keep going up by 10%. It puts pressure to finish the fight fast. There is also no run, but instead its relegated to a magic skill given to one character. One of the biggest enjoyments that I get out of the game is the ability to chose one of two bonuses every time a character reaches a new level. Do you chose this spell or that spell? Do you want +20 Max HP and +20 strength or +10 Strength + 10 Willpower +10 Magic +10 Vitality? Even at level 40, the game still had choices for me.The challenge is in your MP / mana. You will get some back after each battle, but outside of an Inn or a save point (you can save on the fly too). You won't be able to refill your magic. On the surface, fighting and button mashing makes quick work of enemies. Deeper into any dungeon makes fighting difficult without using magic or techniques (both cost MP / mana). While battles are random, the dungeons have specific numbers of battles before the random battles get down to 0. So if you fight 20 random battles, you won't have any other random battles to fight. This works well, because you can go deep into a dungeon, have no mana left and need to walk back out of the dungeon. Having 0 remaining random battles ensures your survival. Since there is no sort of easy teleportation. A few dungeons force you to beat the boss and walk back. Luckily there is a sprint button to speed things along..Spells get upgraded by your choices when you level up. A lightning spell can go from X damage to Y damage when you select it maybe ten levels after you've earned the original lightning spell. There is a full heal spell that will not only give a character full health, but revive them as well. Making it easy if a character dies that you're trying to heal, well they're just resurrected! There aren't any items, but there are potions. You can't buy these, you need to find them in caves. They resurrect and give full health to any character. These are necessary if your lone healer dies. There is a health regenerating zombie though and a vampire sort of attack with another character.You can find 1-Ups that let you retry a fight that wiped out your party. I was a fan of this and I remember it from Final Fantasy Legend 2. You still get a choice whether you use it or just accept a game over and load a save file. There were plenty of times that I chose a save file over replaying a fight. You can save on the fly and there are save points that will do it for you. Usually before boss battles.You start out with the legendary Cthulhu, a squid monster with the power of darkness. He has a bold, comically evil personality that is one of the joys of the game. To balance him out, you'll come across six others that will join you. A happy healer named Umi that has a crush on Cthulhu. A talking sword named Stabe that offers some sage advice and wisdom. A necromancer / hot chick named October with a whip and damaging spells. I won't spoil the rest, but you get a sense of how quirky the game's personalities are. They each have input no matter how silly. The only catch to having a party of 7 is that only four can fight at once and you always need Cthulhu in your party since this is his game. If you ever get stuck deep in a dungeon with no mana, you can switch out your characters on the fly. The inactive characters still gain experience with the active ones.The humor really fit better with this game than Breath of Death which relied on video game references. Cthulhu Saves the World felt like it had its own jokes that fit with the personalities of the characters. Some were good, others weren't, but they still fit what the game is. I'm never a big fan of story even in role playing games, but I felt like what I did read was enjoyable.There is a combo system which I find it useful. Every attack builds a combo. There are special combo boosts and breakers that when used will multiply the damage by the combo, but reset the combo to 0. It would be more useful if these specials weren't already the highest damagers in general. You can keep using them to kill the enemies quickly without having to build a combo. Even the bosses felt like pushovers and I can tell I was underpowered for the bosses when each of my characters would level up twice with some bosses. Its just a testament to how easy the game is on normal difficulty. After playing through Breath of Death on hard, I didn't want to make that mistake again.For equipment, Cthulhu Saves the World is bare bones. You have a weapon and armor. No headgear, no accessory. Towns don't have more than a couple weapons and armor for your seven characters. Each character has one type of weapon and armor. None of these types get shared, so if you get a sword, you know only Cthulhu can equip it. If you get a Tome, only October can equip it as armor. There are a few treasures here and there in dungeons. Treasures do feel more rewarding to find in this game, because a lot of treasures in Breath of Death were jokes. There is no interaction with anything outside of talking to townspeople. Nothing hidden in book shelves and dressers, just jokes about what's really in them.The world itself feels big enough. There are around 15+ dungeons and 4+ towns. You won't get to travel the oceans or visit far off lands, but the dungeons are the real maps. Each dungeon feels big enough. There are mostly underground areas, a forest and the ruins of giant towns. You can tackle them pretty openly. I found myself wandering deep into an overpowered dungeon and I couldn't get out. I had to one by one grind through the limited fights hoping each fight would be easy enough for me to overcome. I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to be there at my level. Of course grinding through that made everything else a cake walk.The graphics are bright and beautiful and feel like they would fit in with the Super Nintendo era. Cthulhu goes the extra mile with what I can only describe as comic cut scenes going into certain sections. You still have traditional dialog beneath, but there are beautiful 16 bit style pictures over pictures that add to the jokes. The music itself also adds a lot to my enjoyment of the game.For those that complete the game, there are bonus modes. One new mode lets you replay the story on level 40 and another mode that lets you replay the game with different characters, dialog and bosses. It makes me want to replay the game in a new way. There is even a developer commentary (written) that you can chose to have on. It gives a lot of insight and rational. I found myself reading them more than I paid attention to the dialog.If you don't want to get too involved with a 40 - 80 hour RPG, Cthulhu Saves the World could be for you. With saving anywhere and refilling your HP after every battle, that makes for an easy game. Some people like easy! $3 is a great price for the content in my opinion. It also comes with Breath of Death VII in a combo pack for the same price. I feel like I got my money's worth with just this game alone.			"

												When first playing the game, the best aspect makes it's appearence quickly: The humor.Cthulhu is a real anti-hero who grumpily tries to save the world and he has a lot of funny dialogue throughout the game. The fact that he looks so uninviting also leads to a lot of awkward situations amongst the townsfolk, resulting in a lot of clever jokes. Along the way, he will also make allies who contribute in their own way, such as his obsessed groupie that sees him as the most charming person ever while he couldn't care less.During the combat, every monster has their own description with some funny line added to it. Townsfolk will usually react to whoever you chose to bring along. The dialogue between the characters are also my kind of tea, with lots of arguing and misunderstandings. The sprites in the game are for the most part well done. They can get somewhat repeatetive in the dungeons, making it a bit hard to remember exactly where you are. The rooms can look way too samey at times, so I have gotten lost in many dungeons, unable to find my way back to the outside. I thought the music was very good. It has the right atmosphere for each and every part they take in. I especially liked the male choir chanting inside the dungeons, adding a mysterious atmosphere to them. The town music is very calming and relaxing to listen to.I like that the dungeon chests actually contains good items. In other games, you literally risk your life for a potion that doesn't even restore half of what you lost to get to it. Here, you can get impressive upgrades and lots of money. It made treasure hunting worthwile and fun.The armor and weapon menus could definately have been polished. Comparing items is quite clunky, with you being unable to compare stats side by side. Anytime you buy an armor or weapon, the shopkeeper says ""Thanks!"" and throws you back to the option whether you want to buy or sell. It would have been better to be able to stay on the page you just purchased something. There is one huge flaw with this game unfortunately. And it is the combat system. Anytime the party has taken a turn, whether damaging the enemy or healing themselves, the monsters gets an increased percentage of damage. This number is quite high, around 10%, which builds up extremely fast. This forces you to use your strongest and fastest abilities, as otherwise you are going to end up in an endless die/revive loop where the monsters will get stronger while you can't keep up reviving your party members that gets slayed within one or two turns. It also leads to making many spells and abilities useless, since you don't have time to use them. One of my characters has so many spells that she never gets time to use. And it's not just one or two, she has about 6 different spells which basically spells ""Game over"" for me if I even concider using them. Their damage output is just too weak to compete with the monster damage output. So each and every fight, I am constantly casting the same powerful spell.It unfortunately leads to a lot of scrolling in the menu, as usually these spells are learned much later. So you have lots of useless abilities and spells clogging your menu, which you have to scroll through each and every time you want to use an ability or spell. I haven't found any way to sort the abilities and spells, which would have been greatly needed. As the combat is completely text based, there is also a huge lack of action on the screen. The monsters will just implode on themselves when they die and there's not even a picture of your members on the combat screen. Only when you make the choice to attack do you see their faces. Then the monsters just flashes when they take damage. The combats are very boring to watch, though thankfully you can scroll through the combat text quite quickly, ending some battles in seconds.After playing this, I understand why they have a system which fills your characters HP to max afte every encounter - otherwise they would never survive in this game! The game really shows you no remorse once the monsters have taken a couple of turns.   Forget being tactical, you simply don't have the time to waste. Forget about wanting to use a different spell than the fire one. If fire does 200 more damage than ice, you have to stick to fire. Each and every encounter. To me, the combat system feels like a filler into a very short game. I love the humor, I love advancing through the story and reading the dialogue. But at the eight hour mark, thinking about combat makes me groan. Same old spells over and over. No thanks. After eight hours of the game, I only enjoy it due to the humor and dialogue. But at this point, the combat system is so offputting that I am literally forcing myself to finish the game. So I honestly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It all boils down whether I would recommend the game based on the story and seeing as the dialogue only happens after encounters, then it will be a no.			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World(CStW) ReviewCthulhu Saves the World is a game starring everybody's favorite Lovecraftian abomination, Cthulhu. Stripped of his powers by a mysterious spellcaster upon yonder cliff, Cthulhu must set out on a quest in order to become a true hero so he can regain his powers and destroy the world after he saves it. Sounds crazy, right? Well, if you're interested in the premise, then it is well assured that the rest of the game is even better. I'm here to analyze the game and give my personal opinion on it, so if you're looking for a serious review, you've come to the right place. Let's start by looking over the story.Story:I'm going to just give you the Cliff's Notes version of the story: Cthulhu rises from R'lyeh to destroy reality. Sorceror robs him of his powers. Narrator tips off Cthulhu that he has to become a hero to destroy the world. Cthulhu begins quest to save then destroy world. After that, Cthulhu goes from town to town saving the populace from stuff, such as Nyarlathotep-controlled zombies or a demon-dragon in a volcano. While the title says that Cthulhu saves the world, he never really does so until the final dungeon, making the game more like The Adventures of Cthulhu the Hero and Friends. CStW's story has nothing connecting the various events that occur together, but since this game is a parody of JRPGs, it's just enough for a person to not question it.Characters:While the story of Cthulhu Saves the World may be a loose string of events that barely constitute as a plot, the characters can kinda make up for this. As per Zeboyd Games standard, the characters are rather creative. In the party you're stuck with throughout the game's course, there's the hero himself, Cthulhu, who is on a quest to restore his powers; The resident Red Mage, Umi, who has a crush on Cthulhu after he saves her from two slime monsters; Sharpe the living sword, who is only there because Cthulhu wants a huge sword like every other hero; The angsty Black Mage and gothic necromancer, October; Cthulhu's old alien cat friend, Paws; The senile White Mage on the brink of madness, Dacre; And the reformed demon-dragon, Ember. They're all wacky and provide the game with most of the humorous dialogue, but are the ones given most of the characterization, since they appear more than once in the game. Besides them, there's those three hero guys who only pop up twice and the chapter bosses who, besides Ember, who joins your party, only appear once. It's kinda unfortunate that nobody else gets any real characterization besides being a stereotypical NPC. However, the characters that do get some focus make the game much more enjoyable.Gameplay:Cthulhu Saves the world's gameplay is a refined version of Breath of Death VII:The Beginning's gameplay. You can choose to battle at any time and there are a set amount of encounters in each area of the game, like in Breath of Death. When you engage an enemy, you can attack normally, use magic or physical skills, use a Unite skill with another party member, or defend/dodge. As each turn goes by, enemies grow 10%, giving you a psuedo-time limit. When you win a battle, your health is fully restored and you get some magic points back. Despite sounding so simple, it's a welcome departure from the battle mechanics of other RPGs and makes for a fun, albeit repetitive, experience.Music:CStW's music is really good. Each track fits the feel of the situation it plays in, from the relaxing town themes to the action-packed boss themes, Cthulhu Saves the World's music is certainly notable among other RPGs.Graphics:Cthulhu Saves the World's graphic are an homage to the graphics style of early 16-bit era JRPGs like Final Fantasy IV and other games like that. However, they still manage to be well-detailed to the point where enemy recolors always have something besides palette that sets them apart from the opponents that came before them.All-in-all, Cthulhu Saves the World is not for everybody, but it provides hours of fun with its various references, fun gameplay, and unique charm overall. If I had to point out any major flaws, however, I'd have to criticize the lack of coherent and fluid story in addition to lack of characterization for non-party members. However, if you like classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Breath of Fire, etc. then Cthulhu Saves the World will not disappoint.Score:7/10 - GoodCthuhu's Angels Extra Mode Kinda ReviewCthulhu's Angels is an extra mode of Cthulhu Saves the World added in for the PC release of the game. It features October as she goes on Cthulhu's quest for him with three other (female) party members because... Hey, octopus/dragon/demon gods are generally lazy. Now, before anyone asks, I call this a ""kinda review"" because I'm not giving it a score, but I am going to go over the altered story and added characters while giving my opinion. That being said, let's get on with it.Story:In Cthulhu's Angels, October the super-angsty necromancer has fled to that place where Cthulhu washed up in CStW because everybody in her hometown mocked her for studying the arcane art of necromancy. There, she finds a holographic projecter that Cthulhu contacts her with,telling her that he was stripped of his powers and needs her and three other ladies to become heroes for him because he's off doing who-knows-what in who-knows-where. Along the way, the Narrator keeps messing with the party, doing things like bringing a bridge to life as the boss that replaces Star Terror, the second boss of CStW. And, yes, I said ""replaces"". This is because the story is a rehash of CStW's, and a poor one at that. But hey, this is a parody game. Keep that in mind throughout the whole thing.Characters:Now, Cthulhu's Angels adds some new characters to the party. First, Elona/Elonalina from those random hero group replaces Umi as the first party member, and is a rehash of Dacre gameplay-wise. Then, Umi replaces Sharpe as the second party member and is a direct clone of him in terms of gameplay. And by the way, this isn't the Umi you all know and love, this is her silvery-haired evil side brought upon by her trying to wield Sharpe, who is now her weapon, and a cursed sword. Kinda like what happened to the Masamune in Chrono Cross, the ""sequel"" to Chrono Trigger. The third and final party member, Molly the Were-Zompire, joins where October would've, and is a replica of Paws in terms of gameplay. She's from one of Zeboyd's other works. Now, in terms of other major characters, Cthulhu becomes mission control, the Narrator just messes with the party, Ember doesn't do any fighting and is just there as a means of flight, October is left unchanged, Paws is killed right after he says one sentence, and Dacre... I won't spoil what he does.My Opinion:Cthulhu's Angels feels like a poorly-done ROM hack of CStW, with characters being replaced left and right. It follows the exact same path as CStW, and just feels like a boring rehash. However, the ending was one of the most insane twist endings in any video game I've played, so there's some redemption to be had there. But in all seriousness, this extra mode left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, with only one dungeon changed, all the bosses altered in some way, and if it isn't already blatant enough that Zeboyd just took CStW and changed it slightly, I dare you to try entering the first bonus dungeon before visiting the first town. See what Umi, who isn't even in your party at the time, has to say. All-in-all, I felt like I was just playing an amatuer's attempt at a ROM hack. But please, don't let my opinion on an extra mode keep you from buying this game. The main game itself is well made, and this mode is just an extra unlocked after you beat CStW. So if you don't think this mode seems interesting, don't play it. You've still got a bunch of other modes to mess with besides this one.			"

												Cthulhu.... saves the world! Did you just read it wrong? You might think, what the f*** is that? The answer is simple really, it's a name of the game you definitely should own.Where is the logic? Who cares, the game gives you so much more ( except the logic bits of course). This is by far the funniest game I have played, which is also so cheap. For the first 4 minutes I couldn't stop laughing. It wasn't just the character lines, but also the art. You don't get to fight a crab or seagull often right? As soon I got laughing at Cthulhu and his jokes I started playing the game. Controls for the game are very easy and all you need to do is run forward, find treasures and kill enemies, thus saving the world. Since this was the first time I have ever played anything like this, I really enjoyed the level up system, you get to decide what's better, a skill or a stat. The other thing that I personally enjoyed was music. God, I thought I was watching an anime from 90s. It's just so good. Sound effects are nice too, I mean you can't over do them in this kind of game. The graphics... I am not too sure what to say here. The graphics are understandable from the first glance, so I think that's a very good point. There were some problems thought. I had a few crashes on my windows 7, but none on XP. Crashing without a save would mean that you need to start where you left off. Thank god, this game supports steam cloud, unlike some other high end games. Also, there was this one time when I ran another game while I was playing CStW, I am not too sure how that happened. In overall, I would highly suggest that you get this game. To some it will be a new experience, but to most it will be quite nostalgic. And common, wouldn't you want to fight a dolphin or kick some arrogant hero's ♥♥♥? I'd say that the steam price for this game is quite fair!			"

												Definitely exceeding expectations. I thought that gameplay looks terrible and the title is just wrong. Two weeks ago I launched the game to convince myself, how bad this game must be. I was wrong on so many levels. Game mechanics are solid and RPG elements are simplified, yet well designed. Biggest selling point is the theme. Lord of insanity and saving the world just sounds strange. Authors used this setting to make hilarious and remarkable moments. Cthulhu is loveable character; he just wants to destroy the world, to do so he must become true hero. This makes no sense... actually most of the game doesn't make any sense and that is a good thing, because almost every dialog makes me laugh. Big thumbs up.			"

												The music of this game and the funny plot where characters insult each other, and the funny descriptions for each of the monsters truly make this game an enjoyable experience to play. It's  8 Bit / 16 bit joy that will remind you why retro systems were so fun back in the day and the funny translations of RPG Games, except this is original user generated content.Its only a couple of bucks for the game but it often goes on sale for next to nothing. If I had the chance I would pay at least $9.99 for it. It's very entertaining. Just be sure to initiate lots of random battles to beat the boss in each scenario. The further you get the harder you have to think because the screen layouts become more complex.			"

 ""Cthulhu Saves the World: Super Hyper Enhanced Championship Edition Alpha Diamond DX Plus Alpha FES HD - Premium Enhanced Game of the Year Collector's Edition (without Avatars)."" Cthulhu Saves the World (CStW) is a classic 2-D turn-based role-playing game (rpg) developed by the company Zeboyd Games with emphasis on combat mechanics and tactics.   Atmosphere & presentation: + The 16-bit-style and general layout of the game provides a retro-feeling. + Amusing implementation of the squid-faced, winged god created by H. P. Lovecraft.+ Each track fits the feel of the situation it plays in. + Various entertaining allusions and references to rpgs from the ‘90s.  o Relatively short game that can be finished within a few hours. Combat & gameplay: + Fast paced battle system with round-based combat mechanics. + Easy character development with branching level-up system. + Employs an interesting combo system with multi-character combination techniques for special attacks.o Party size is limited to a maximum of four characters.o Next to the protagonist there are six recruitable characters.o Encounters in an area are limited (with a manual option to have additional encounters).  Characters & story: + Witty dialogues between the characters offer high quality slapstick humour.+ The protagonist has the potential to become a cult figure.o Lack of characterization for non-party members. - Lack of coherent and fluid story telling.- No voice acting during the entire game. Summary: Zeboyd Games successfully continues with CStW its charming and light-hearted work within the 2-D rpg genre. In comparison with the first project, in form of Breath of Death VII: The Beginning, there have been some improvements regarding the combat mechanics, depiction of the protagonist and overall presentation of the game. Trivia: Cthulhu is a cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft and first introduced in the short story ""The Call of Cthulhu"", published in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928.

												I’m a sucker for Cthulhu, so this game was a no-brainer, especially at its low price and the fact that it comes with another game. This game has a humorous spin, having Cthulhu being a “good guy” makes for a fun story. I also must praise the fact that they introduce an RPG mechanic that literally EVERY RPG should have: once you beat X amount of enemies in an area (and it’s always reasonable), you can turn off random encounters for that area. It’s brilliant, and alleviates one of my pet peeves. I would recommend this game if you don’t mind “bad” graphics and/or indie games.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Cthulhu Saves the WorldDeveloper:  Zeboyd GamesPublisher:  Zeboyd GamesGenre:  Classic-style RPGGeneral ImpressionCthulhu Saves the World is an intriguing 2D classic and almost JRPG-like experience, peppered with spoof segments. The game does feature H.P. Lovecraft’s most famous creature, but within this storyline it is mostly set up for comic relief. I did enjoy the gameplay as it is reminiscent of so many other titles, but what really kept me playing it, was the amount of parody that can fit in a rather small game. It’s anything but simple though and once again it proves that appearances can be so deceiving. It has plenty of replay value and a price tag that is justified.Strong Points+ Interesting setting and use of humour.+ Steam Trading Cards.Weak Points- Unbalanced difficulty scale.- No Steam Achievements.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												As a guy who wasn't big into RPG games, I'm happy to report that Cthulhu Saves the World is a very pleasant experience.A simple, yet funny storyline, solid gameplay mechanics, phenomenal art-design & great (albeit a bit repetitive) music, Cthulhu Saves the World is a game I recommend to everyone if they just want a fun game to play.Definite must-have.

												I may have only played an hour and a half of this game so far but I am really enjoying it.  I'm chuckling heaps :).  I'd probably take this game in small doses as the constant battles got a bit monotonous for me near the end of an hour.  I've had no problem with the game and my laptop's pretty slow and handles it just fine which is awesome.  It's also a pretty game.			"

												You are Cthulhu, and you must save the world. What do you want more? This game is hilarious, and it's also a well-done RPG. You must explore the world, defeat monsters... and each monster is unique, and comes with its own original joke! One  example? The Seaghoul (undead), surprisingly only the 7th worst pun of the game. And the swordsman, looking for a man with six fingers (got the quotation?). In the meanwhile, you level up and you build  an amazing party, with a groupie, a sword... I mean, a giant sword. You will see. And surely there will be no cats in your party! That would be silly. It took me slightly more than 10 hours to beat the game at Normal. There are many other difficulty levels, and you unlock things as you beat the game. But even with the 10-ish hours it will take you to beat the game once, it will be more than worth what you pay for it!Have fun!			"

												If you've ever enjoyed ANY old-school RPG, you owe it to yourself to check this out.  Not only is the mechanics and gameplay top-notch, but the story is great, and it's packed full of poke-at-it's-own-genre humor.  The hard work and love of the developer is apparent in every aspect of the game.  I also highly recommend going into the options menu and selecting ""Developer Commentary"".  This places question marks around the world, that, when read, provide ""behind the scenes"" insights into what the developers were going for.  For 3$, this comes bundled with Breath of Death VII, another game that pokes fun at the genre, whilst still being up-to-par.10/10 would recommend.PS:  You can walk under bridges.  (Exceptionally rare for this type of game)			"

												Playing ""Cthulhu Saves The World"" makes everything different in a good way. It's a 2D RPG game for all Lovecraft fans with  really interesting story in behind. Killing monsters isn't the only thing you're doing, there is a party system which allows you switch between a lot of characters you want to have in your groupie. The game has it's own sarcastic wit, main characters and narrator are kept in touch.Story- 10/10Graphic (8*16 bit)- 10/10Gameplay- 9/10Replayability- 10/10 + bonus content, Cthulhu's AngelsDo yourself a favor and get this game.

												I am primarily writing this review due to nominating “Cthulhu Saves the World” for the Steam Award’s custom category “Best use of an Lovecraftian Mythos in a Turn Based Comedy”. This little gem is a top down turn based rpg reminiscent of NES/SNES generation RPGs. The game opens with Cthulhu rising from the depths of the ocean with the intention of destroying the world. Unfortunately for Cthulhu a mysterious stranger seals his power away until he proves himself a true hero. This sets Cthulhu on his quest to nobily regain his powers so he can then complete his initial goal of destroying the world. All of the side characters are very entertaining including: “Sharp” a talking sword, a cat from outer space named “Paws”, the ever optimistic “Umi” who wants to marry Cthulhu, “Goth” an edgy necromancer who can’t control the dead, and a couple others who were not in my party. The dialogue between these characters is very tongue n cheek with some genuinely funny moments making the story very amusing at times. Another great bonus to this 6 to 10 hour games is the price. It retails for $2.99 bundled with”Breath of Death VII”, but I think I bought it for $0.99 on sale. The only downside is the turn based combat does become a little repetitive by the end. All in all, it is a dirt cheap funny RPG that harkens back to the classics NES titles like Final Fantasy and Zelda. So join Cthulhu quest to save the world, so he can regain his power, so he can well destroy the world. "

												An important thing first: This is not a bad game and it is worth its money, since it's pretty cheap.However, an even more important thing is the question: Is this game worth your time? And now after having finished it, I would say ""No"".In general this is a little RPG, resembling the old SNES-RPGs or games from the RPG-Maker, in terms of gameplay and graphics. You wander around, engage in some random fights (which become pretty repetetive), go through dungeons and level up. The Main Character is Cthulhu who wants to have his power back and the only way to achieve this is to become a hero (instead of destroying everything, which would be what he is used to normally). Well this sounds funny and some of the dialogues you will encounter are funny too, but I never really laughed about them and at some points the jokes seemed a bit forced. Well the humuour mostly is nice, some clichees of games are ridiculed and your companions will sometimes drop some nice one-liners too. And ""nice"" pretty much sums up this game: it's just nice, overall mediocre. Besides the original starting point of the story the game isn't special in any way.Maybe if you happen to be one of the rare cases of people who really do not have one single game left to play, you may pick this one up and play it. I started it and as a result finished the game. I didn't have a bad time playing it, but the 7 hours could have been spent much more wisely.			"

												Skip to the bottom for a summary.Gameplay- Pretty typical JRPG as far as gameplay goes. You have your party and you explore dungeons, towns, and the overworld. As with most JRPG’s you can find a wide variety of armour and weapons, each with their own special abilities. The only feature that separates this game from any other JRPG is its combat. It is turn based, with the unique twist; after each turn the monsters slowly get more powerful. Ultimately all this normally does is forces you to use the spells that cause the most damage, and subsequently use up the most of your magic points. After the battle is over your characters will regain full health and a portion of their magic points back. This at first is pretty fun, however after a few hours you will only be playing this game for its storyline, as it is pretty repetitive. Also, each area has a predefined amount of monsters you can fight, which for me really encouraged exploration as I wouldn’t have to fight endless enemies. I would definitely recommend turning on the developer commentary as it is always optional to read, and is usually funny/insightful to read. 6.5/10Sound- Really not much to say here, some catchy little tunes and mostly generic sounds. 5.5/10Graphics- They are stylized to look retro and I believe it works out pretty well for the most part. The overworld and towns always look pretty good, and handcrafted. The dungeons on the other hand look all pretty similar and boring. The monster sprites however are beautiful. There are many, many monsters in this game and they all are unique and awesome! 7/10Storyline- This is what makes this game rise above other similar games. This is an epic tale describing Cthulhu's struggle to regain his powers, and to do so he must become a hero. This is a very original idea, and was wonderfully delivered. Cthulhu is a great anti hero. All the side characters are well thought out and enjoyable. This game is funny, and is able to remain so for the entire game. This is by far the greatest aspect of the game. But I do feel as if the combat and exploration sometimes was not broken up enough by story bits. Honestly I would have preferred a shorter game that focused much more on the story than anything else. 9/10Summary- What a wonderful little gem, and an addicting one at that. Despite the generic gameplay, the storyline rises this above most of its competition. The graphics achieve what they set out to do, as does the sound. Pros +Story+Art Style+The Developer Commentary Neutral-Sound-Majority of the Gameplay and CombatFinal Score- 8/10Recommended Purchase Price-  Full Price (At the time of this review only $3.00!)			"

												This game is... surprisingly very good. It's a steal at such a low price!I didn't expect much from what seemed like a budgetware rpg title, no matter how infamous the titular name was. But believe it or not, there's some real meat and potatoes to this rpg. Essentially, Cthulu is trying to be a hero to undo a spell cast upon him. Due to the curse's weakening effect that is preventing him from destroying the world, he must redeem himself as a hero to get the chance to be his old self again. He soon meets up with other allies, such as a groupie of all things concerning the ocean, a talking sword, and so on. The story is surprisingly funny and well written. There's not an over extending amount of dialogue, but enough to get the point across and there's some very amusing chatter by Cthulu (who plays a pompous windbag of an elder god if there ever was one) interacting with his party. The towns are all named after Lovecraft locations and there's numerous references throughout the game that will appeal to fans of his work. Combat is decently tough. Each round, the enemy does more and more damage, while you can build combos and similarly thrash them. Either way, you must win fights quickly. Cthulu and his party recover after battles quickly, but they can't take a lot of punishment during. Fortunately, you have a fairly wide array of chosen abilities, including the ability to make your enemy insane, so he fights poorly against you. I enjoyed the strategy needed to win some random encounters, although you can certainly just blow through some of them. It can get grindy at times, but it won't be the sort of thing that requires you to spend hours simply leveling up. There's higher priced RPGs out there on Steam that might look fancier and come from bigger names, but they've got nothing on Cthulu!			"

												A SUPER HYPER ENHANCED CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION ALPHA DIAMOND DX PLUS ALPHA FES HD-PREMIUM ENHANCED GAME OF THE YEAR COLLECTOR'S EDITION REVIEWJust kidding. Well, sort of...The mastermind behind this project is none other than Zeboyd games. If you don't know who they are, head on over to zeboyd.com and check them out. Don't worry if you get distracted by their overwhelming awesomeness, I'll wait here...Cthulhu, a cosmic entity from the Lovecraftian universe, aptly named the Cthulhu Mythos awakens from a deep slumber only to be immediately confronted by a wizard that seals his powers. As told by the narrator at the start of the story, the only way this peculiar (and reluctant) anti-hero can reclaim his power is by becoming a ""true"" hero.In a proper satirical format that will quickly become prevalent throughout the story, Cthulhu wastes no time in breaking the fourth wall to engage the narrator. This may not be in good taste for everyone but I found it particularly amusing and was hooked right away. A decisive victory for the Great Old One degrades into a parody of the popular cult classics and a grand 16-bit journey ensues. Right from the beginning, Cthulhu is assaulted by a motley crew of... interesting companions from a blue-haired damsel in distress who becomes obsessed with and deemed a ""groupie"" by the lord of insanity after saving her, to a sentient sword known only as Sharpe, the master swordsword.The modernized old-school graphics are as delightful as the quirky personalities given to each of the characters as the colors strike the perfect balance between vibrancy and gothic horror derived from this comical tribute's namesake. To think, the developers went as far as to add so many distinct and eye-catching layers to their map design was immensely impressive. Cthulhu Saves the World is a prime example of why I love retro styled RPG's - J and otherwise - with their charming, creative pixelated designs. The sprite work for the laundry list of enemies and NPC's alike is also worth mentioning because if that is something you look for in a game and admire the attention to detail that pixel art requires then you certainly won't be disappointed.So, you installed the game and started a new file but before you know it, you've reached the end. Depending on your play style, you may burn through the whole thing in the advertised 6-10 hours; I on the other hand, stretched it out to about four times that, sitting at a final tally of about 24 hours, enjoying every minute of it.Hold on a second because if just like the Great Cthulhu you hunger for more don't worry, the gameplay itself is expansive and flawless offering several different modes to explore and master making it incredibly versatile and providing loads of replayability. So go ahead, play to your heart's content because the character interaction and the hilarious dialogue are endlessly entertaining.The faster pace and the enemy encounter limit (controlled manually through the ""Fight"" option in the menu) are a wonderfully dynamic solution to the traditional 'grind' that some might find irritating and time-consuming. Let's face it, the constant interruptions when all you want to do is get from point A to point B can frustrate the hell out of the best of us, we've all been there. This feature in my personal opinion is one that I think is woefully underutilized by many developers out there because just adding this one simple feature and handing the player that choice gives them a much-appreciated sense of control over their own experience.A simplistic menu system is always a welcome sight which Cthulhu Saves the World graciously provides because a clunky, needlessly complicated GUI can easily turn an otherwise perfect game into an absolute nightmare. Seamless and responsive the menu amounts to exactly what it needs to be handing the spotlight over to other areas of the game that would benefit the player, like the branching level-up system that gives you a choice between a set of predefined parameters. When I saw this, I couldn't help thinking about those old branching adventure stores that use to be popular in the 70's and 80's.It's hard to imagine that such a great game could be paired with an equally epic soundtrack but you'd better believe it is because the OST is OVER 9000! Gordon McNeil's brainchild will make your ears bleed and undoubtedly drive you so blissfully insane listening to it that Cthulhu himself couldn't do a better job. Just to prove how awesome they are Zeboyd is giving it away completely Free on their site, so what are you waiting for? Get over there!Not only does he teach us all that everyone has the ability to turn over a new leaf but Cthulhu proves that even though one is deprived of their devastating, insanity-driven cosmic power, it is still possible to dish out a proper beating and make some new friends in the process.

One of the biggies is random encounters. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to explore an area to its fullest and having to fight with monsters every few steps to do so. THIS game has a limited amount of random encounters. Hit that limit and there are no more tedious battles in that area. And if you're like me and love to level level level, there's a fight option in your menu so you can battle with enemies as many extra times as you want. I read some other reviews and some people were complaining about the fight option in your menu. Really??? It's a GREAT option and if you don't want to use it, then don't. Another nice feature is that after every battle, your health points are restored. Only a few magic points are restored so you have to strategize when using skills/spells but MAN it's nice not have to worry about healing after every battle. This game is also cleverly written. I have laughed (loud) more times than I can count. It pokes fun at common RPG elements and the characters in the game are great and hilarious. One word of advice, play on easy or prepare to spend a lot of time leveling. All in all though, this game is super fun and since you can save pretty much whenever you want, I can play it here and there when my schedule allows. Try it!			"

												In Cthulhu Saves the World, you play as Cthulhu, (big surprise!) who got his powers taken from him. To get his powers back, he must become a true hero. So, you must go around and generally be a good guy, and maybe, one day, you'll get your powers back so you can finally destroy this puny world.As you can probably tell by now, the game is really silly, but in a good way. It's pretty straightforward, too.It's a casual RPG, without crafting, bactracking to visited cities/cleared dungeons, even without grinding (at least on normal and easier difficulties).Basically you just clear dungeons, go to the next city, buy some gear, listen to other people's problems, and help them, by clearing dungeons. You also have a few optional dungeons, but It's probably wise to play them anyway as they commonly contain some good loot that you can't find anywhere else.Battle system is alright for the most part, you have a certain number of random battles in most places. When that number reaches zero, enemies stop attacking you so you can finally explore the dungeon in peace. (You can also use the ""Fight"" option from the menu if you'd like to level up some more). As for the fighting,you have some status effects that you can cast on your enemies (silence,blind,poison,even insanity that makes them more vulnerable to damage and also changes their sprite. Neat!) You regenerate all your health at the end of the battle, so no need to bring hundreds of potions/hamburgers/stimpacks on your journey. What you don't regenerate at the end of the battle, is your mana points, so don't waste them all on some magikarps that attacked you, because you can immediately get bonked by a pack of gyaradoses not long after, you know what I'm sayin'?  (you regenerate MP in towns and in special places in dungeons, so don't worry)Still not convinced that you should buy this game? Well, how about I tell you, that you can play as a walking giant sword? Or as a demon dragon? OR as a green cat-like alien? If that didn't convince you,then I don't know what will.Seriously though, buy this game. It's cheap, it's commonly on sale with an other similiar RPG in pack, and it has trading cards, so you can make a badge out of them, and possibly get an emoticon of a happy Cthulhu. How cool is that?Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn...			"

												Got this game because Cthulhu is in the title and am pleasantly surprised by how solid the story and mechanics are. Lots of referential humour keeps the entertainment level up, the characters are all individually developed in a way that is wonderfully refreshing, and the fact that after every battle your regain ALL of your HP makes this a low-stress RPG that you can tootle around in for a relaxing bout of gaming.

												Being a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos and an avid reader of many of HP Lovecraft's works, you can imagine my surprise when I found a Cthulhu-themed game on Steam and iOS. Having wanted this for a very long time, this game is a surprisingly pleasant pi ss take on the both the Cthulhu Mythos and the RPG genre in general.In Cthulhu Saves the World, you play as none other than the Elder God of Madness himself, Cthulhu. Having all of his powers taken away by a powerful wizard, Cthulhu sets out on a journey to become a true hero and save the land in an effort to regain his powers, so he may use them to destroy the world.The game plays very similarly to that of Final Fantasy, Pokémon or Shin Megami Tensei, so people who are familar with those games, or turn-based RPGs in general will feel right at home playing this. With a wide variety of skills and enemies, Cthulhu Saves the World plays out like a comedy, but feels like an adventure all the same.			"

												Repetitive gameplay. The game is a standard JRPG built around humor, Cthulhu, monsters, satire, irony, whatever you want to call it, it can only go so far, but if you're making players walk through lengthy mazes that aren't challenging, but time consuming, then the game time isn't worth the cutscenes. I think if this were a little funnier I would be ok with watching a video of all the non battle parts of the game. The bosses aren't even fun. Bosses are supposed to be challenging and fun. This game isn't terrible, it just isn't well rounded. No puzzles... It's hard to enjoy repeating battles over and over when that is all the game consists of. Perhaps if there were puzzles in the temples going on, it would break up and overlap with the turn based battles and make everything more fun, but you can make it through the whole game blindfolded, seriously just keep mashing A and keep walking in directions until you make it to the boss.The game has some length, but if you don't care how it was made, don't turn the commentary on, it gets kind of annoying honestly. Overall score: 4.0/10 (Not that it's not worth my $1, more that it's not worth my 4 hours... :/ )			"

												It's hilarious - the writers knew what they were doing. Unfortunately, as a game it's just ♥♥♥♥. I would elaborate more on this, but I'm afraid it's impossible. It's just a ""press enter"" simulator all the way, where you grow a beard fighting annoying trash mobs 90% of the time, being mugged every 3 steps you make. The boss and mini-boss fights are not better: you will most probably drop dead on the first try, but after understanding easy strategy against each of them you will pass without bigger problems.It's better to watch gameplay videos on youtube, I can't recommend anyone to play this. It's annoying and most of the time - boring. Enter enter enter enter enter enter enter enterbackspaceenter enter enter enter enter enter""heh""enter enter enter backspace			"

												The question you need to answer before you sit down to play Cthulhu Saves The World is: what are your tastes in humor? Do you like stories that poke fun at the trappings and cliches of their genre while reverently following those cliches, for good or ill? Did you think Shrek was a fun ride but could have name-checked 1930s horror literature more often?If so, Cthulhu Saves the World has plenty to offer. Otherwise, you probably don't have to keep reading, since the game lives and dies on its gags.If you're looking for more cerebral references to Lovecraft's work, you won't find much to work with here: the inspiration is pretty surface-level, beginning with town names and ending with boss battles with (twee parodies of) shoggoths. It all adds up, essentially, to one long schtick contrasting the Final Fantasy atmosphere and plot with the Lovecraftian setting elements, seasoned with JRPG lampshading.While the jokes are shallow and unambitious, there certainly are a lot of them -- this is a game where every bookshelf has an amusing book to examine and every NPC has a snippet or two of tone-appropriate dialogue.The actual gameplay is standard turn-based material, with the extra wrinkles of an ""insanity"" status effect that invites good or ill depending on who it affects and a gimmicky but engaging combo mechanic, which, combined, provide a little thought to the usual ""buff-debuff-sword-fireball"" litany and carries you from one comedic scene to another.If you've read this far, you can probably already tell that Cthulhu Saves The World has something to offer, and at this price point, that means I can recommend giving it a shot.

A Paladin's Steam Review: Cthulhu Saves the World. Perhaps the Last jRPG I’ll Ever ReviewGenre: 2D jRPGDeveloped & Published by: Zeboyd Games Platform: Windows only. Business Model: Duo Pack PurchaseCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay ThoughtsCthulhu Saves the World is a game about Cthulhu, the great dark lord of the sith, a being so terrible that just being around him makes everyone go insane. So, how does one stop such unstoppable madness? Have a stranger zap his power away. Then make him become a true hero and his powers will return to him. Yeah, the plot is rather...unexplained. But that’s not important because we have madder things to deal with! Like groupies, heroes, undead monsters and Cthulhu saving the world. It’s a pretty fun and funny time, with plenty of references to go around. This is a 2D jRPG with a minimal upgrade system for armor, weapons and skills. Combat SystemCthulhu builds upon the combat system designed in Breath of Death VII. Refining the lightning-quick turn-based combat to a new level. Now, there’s a new system called Insanity. When enemies become insane via certain abilities you can use, they take and give out double the normal damage. It’s a tricky trade-off to make sure you don’t accidentally power up an enemy before you can strike a killing blow. There’s also retries to start a battle over if you messed up too badly and some tweaks to status effects to make them more useful. There’s also a fairly basic upgrade system. Everytime you level up, you get a choice of abilities to select and hopefully improve your combat performance. (Though I get the feeling that the wrong choices could really hurt you without you knowing it). Weapons and armor can also be upgraded from the shop and loot found in the world. There’s usually only a couple of choices per weapon and armor “level” so it comes down to what stat you prefer the most. BoredomI found that after 10 hours, the combat system was becoming too dull to work through. Half the battles were a cakewalk and the other half the difficulty would seem to suddenly spike and I would die repeatedly. It didn’t help that there was a constant rinse-and-repeat of entering battle, select the same combo of attacks and win/lose. Which has made me realize that perhaps jRPGs as a genre aren’t for me anymore. I used to enjoy them a lot when I was younger. Now? I find the repetition tedious. It’s a case where minimal visuals may have worked against the game, because there’s no interesting eye candy to watch. It’s a trade-off. PC SettingsCthulhu is very well optimized and won’t strain your system at all. Crashing and bugs should be rare as well. The devs clearly knew how to make a polished jRPG. That being said, the game only supports 1280x720 and 640x360 in addition to fullscreen mode. Frame rate is also capped at 60FPS. There aren’t any other visual settings to be found here. There’s also no mouse support but that’s largely unimportant. Remapping of keys is here as well as support for controllers. Separate volume controls exist as well. Largely bare-boned and mostly I just miss resolution options. Outside of that, it’s just fine. Final ThoughtsI want to like Cthulhu Saves the World. I really do. But I think CSTW has indicated that the jRPG genre might not be for me anymore. The premise of Cthulhu stripped of his powers until he becomes a great hero is very amusing. But the game’s dry combat system is simply too boring for me to enjoy it. Especially when I take the experience grind into account. That all said, if jRPGs are your kind of genre, Cthulhu Saves the World is well worth checking out. Especially since it’s a combo pack with the other well done jRPG, Breath of Death VII: The Beginning.

												Celebrating its very-well received outing on Xbox Live Indie Games, Zeboyd Games has given PC gamers the chance to enjoy its lighthearted RPG, Cthulhu Saves the World, with a number of gameplay tweaks and some new features.The Cthulhu Saves the World is a very enjoyable romp with an appeal that spreads across the RPG spectrum thanks to its retro graphics, finely tuned battle system, and well-written humour. One of a number of games that hark back to the retro days of gaming, Cthulhu Saves the World is very easy to pick up and play. Players take control of the mighty Cthulhu himself, but unfortunately a wizard has sealed his powers and the player must help Cthulhu get them back. Doing so requires Cthulhu to become a true hero, and thus he embarks upon a very tongue-in-cheek quest that ultimately leads to him saving the world, picking up a number of entertaining allies as he goes. The controls are simple and work equally well using either the keyboard or a gamepad. Players will find their time split between the first-person, Dragon Quest-esque battle screen, and the standard top-down view when exploring dungeons, towns, and the world map.   The battle system is a fairly simple turn-based affair at first glance but contains a surprising amount of depth. Enemies gain strength with each passing turn, meaning that players will need to consider the most efficient ways of winning battles. Simply grinding out basic attacks is rarely an effective tactic, and players will be required to use the full array of abilities that Zeboyd Games has provided. In addition to the various damage-dealing attacks, players can inflict various statuses, attempt to draw enemy strikes onto specific characters, or link up with special Unite moves. The party, which consists of up to four characters, is fully healed after each battle and returned a small amount of MP, allowing the leeway for these random battles to employ tactics rather than being simple distractions. If the party should get wiped, players do have to option to retry a battle, provided at least one of the 1-ups that perform the same function they do in platforming games is in the party's possession. Being able to retry battles, along with saving anywhere, combine with frequent MP restoration points to give players feel little frustration at an unlucky wipeout or a simple misjudgement. Dungeons themselves are generally good fun to explore, although they do have some flaws. Most have a large number of paths, so those who enjoy investigating will find plenty. The flip side of this, however, is that dungeons often just feel too long and winding, not helped by the lack of indicators that progress is being made until one is almost staring it in the face. There's not too much in the way of puzzles outside of route-finding, but this is a point in Cthulhu's favour as any extra tasks would easily become bothersome in the current dungeon designs.Random battles take place in both dungeons and on the world map, occurring at a steady enough rate to keep things mixed up without becoming an annoyance. Each dungeon has a limit to the number of random battles that are faced, allowing those who want to find all the loot to do so in peace.  The underlying story itself isn't anything particularly noteworthy. Plot points are often skipped over and the game really could have used more content in the story, plus more fleshing-out of the world. It is pretty clear, however, that the story is not intended as one to be taken especially seriously, with the fourth wall easily dismantled within the first thirty seconds. This is all to Cthulhu Saves the World's benefit, as where the game shines through is in its humour and tongue-in-cheek references. The well-written humour fits nicely into the dialogue and descriptions to ensure the game remains light-hearted and entertaining.After completing the game players can play it again at one of the other levels of difficulty or try out one of the bonus modes, each of which adds something extra to the core game. Players' choices include a score attack mode that rewards players for defeating bosses while underleveled, a go-it-alone mode, and finally the Super Edition also includes the Cthulhu's Angels mode, which sees Cthulhu delegating the world-saving to an all-female party with new dialogue, characters, and abilities.  Naturally, the visual quality is limited by the sixteen-bit format, but Zeboyd Games has done a very good job of making the artwork attractive. Dungeons are all unique and interestingly designed. The various characters and enemies share in the variety and have clearly received a lot of love, taking differing degrees of inspiration from other sources, but all giving their own little twists to breathe a bit more life into the world of Cthulhu. On the music front, a very good job has been done that complements the retro graphics, adding further to the charm introduced early on. The tracks all do a great job of livening up the dungeons, world map and battles, and never become grating even when repeated. While limited in number, the sound effects also do a nice job, notably those in the battle system that augment the satisfaction of a highly damaging attack. Even before considering the ridiculously low price point, Cthulhu Saves the World is a very enjoyable game. While there is obviously some room for improvement, the humourous retro appeal negates any impact the flaws might have made quite well.			"

												Pretty good turn-based RPG for those that are the fans of the the NES-era type games, the gameplay is that of a regular turn-based RPG, walk around and get a random encounter, the usual, but in this game you only have to fight a certain amount of enemies in every area then after that for that specific area you don't have to fight again unless you choose to from the pause menu if you're in need of experience points. Also has a good overworld and environments and plenty of explorable dungeons with good items inside, and the story is pretty original and top-notch if you ask me. Cthulhu loses his powers and has to save the world to become a true hero to get his powers back just so he can destroy the world. Very interesting indeed, and the games got a great sense of humor. Your party consists of a weeaboo who somehow finds Cthulhu good-looking, a living sword, an emo chick who praises Cthulhu but is also a necromancer, an alien cat, an old healer with alzheimers, and a dumbass of a dragon. That sounds like an anime plot. Anyways you can only have 3 party members to help you out at a time like your typical RPG. So I very highly recommend.			"

												As an ardent Lovecraft and RPG fan, I whole-heartedly recommend this game.If you're familiar with Breath of Death VII, then you already know what this game is like. If you're not, read on...CSTW is a light-hearted homage to both the classic JRPG's of yesteryear as well as H.P. Lovecrafts work. In this game, you play as Cthulu, cosmic horror supreme, who undergoes a bit of a dilemma: rather than destroying the world, Cthulu is tasked with saving it (hence the name.) Along the way, Cthulu encounters many different characters and locales, many of which are pulled straight from Lovecraft's stories. Some help and join you, while most just want to fight.As for the core gameplay, it's traditional turn-based RPG fare. You choose your options, watch everything unfold, and go for it again. There are plenty of characters to mix and match for your active party, all of which obtain their own unique skills and abilites. The level-up system from BoDVII is back, giving players a choice in how they want to build their characters upon gaining a level. Simple, but it adds a nice sense of strategy. The good ol' ""stand next to a save point and grind out all of the battles in an area until they're gone"" strategy is still the best way to break the game, so that's nice.Overall, the game is fun and quirky. It's not very deep, and especially with the Diablo III's and Skyrim's and WoW's out today, CSTW might seem a little too simple. But RPG's started somewhere and this game does a fine job at looking back lovingly.If you're a fan of either classic RPG's or Lovecraft, this is a solid buy.			"

Cthulhu Saves the World This game is great. It can be very involved. It is done in a retro style, so some may not like. The game is excellent in all respects. This game is quite similar to Pokemon. It tells an interesting story. There is a large variety of levels. When you start to play it, you cant stop, will engage you for a very long time. If you have not played the game a retro, it's worth a try, you might like it. Dont waste your time just go to play it :)			"

												It's a great game. Funny story, controls are what you expect from a classic rpg and bonus story Cthulhu Angels is very good to but just end up running the game for a second time. What I really enjoy is some of decisions they made a full heal after every battle and certain number of random encounters per area. Some caves will have 10 encounters and after that you can enjoy the rest of the cave without being bother by fights unless you want to be you can go to main menu and select ""Fight"" and it will give you extra encounters you want. If your a fan of classic RPG's I highly reccomend this game.			"

												I enjoyed this game. Its reasonably short about 13 hours to complete, although I think I didn't complete all the side dungeons so that might lengthen the game a bit.  There are also harder difficulties as well as different game modes. One mode which I just started has a similar storyline but with a different person as the main character. Therefore the game does have some replayability. This game plays like a classical Jrpg game but it also makes fun of a lot of cliche moments and game structure issues that you may know of if you have played a few jrpg. The storyline is basically a comedy having Cthulhu save the world so he can just destroy it later, but with the combination of comedy as well as the characters the game does seem to motivate me to keep playing at least for the first play through. Also you only had a certain amount of random battles per dungeon which was a nice touch. With this said, the game does have its faults. I played the game in normal mode but before this I played in hard mode. This mode was very difficult even at the start of the game, and not difficult in a good way. The random battles were incredibly tough and I found myself losing a lot. I felt like I could have played it on hard mode even with the difficulty level but the grind just seemed that much more tedious even with the random battle restrictions. Every battle just felt like it took so long and you were continously saving because of the chance that you might lose the next fight. When I started playing in normal mode the game got a lot easier but even still, especially about half if not more into the game the random battles got pretty difficult which I didn't like. I was hoping for difficult bosses which I did get at the start of the game but I actually found as the game went on the bosses got easier. Maybe I was over levelled I am not sure but the last boss seemed like a breeze even though I was have troubles with random battles before getting to the last boss, so that was annoying. You did get 1 up items which basically allowed you to restart a battle which was nice but still didn't help the difficulty that much. Overall I think the difficulty should have been more directed towards the bosses and not so much the random battles. Overall, the game was good short comedy rpg that I found myself laughing out loud a few times. Besides the difficulty issues I didnt find much else that was wrong with the game. Some advice, if you want to get some extra laughs turn on the commentary option at the start of the game.  "

												To start off, just wanted to point out that this is my first review so apologies if it won't be as in-depth as probably other reviews but I'll try my best. c: To take in consideration:This game was bought by me when this game was in a bundle with Breath of Death VII. The people who created a game decided to make a sale which was the lowest sale they have ever done on their games. That being said, I did purchase this game for €0.24 ($0.26 & £0.17) and I will make reference to it in the review.Storyline condensed by me:You play as Cthulhu, a fictional deity created by H.P. Lovecraft in his story appropriately named: ""Call of Cthulhu."" In this game, Zeboyd Games (the creators) took a different approach for this character and with Cthulhu being basically the lord of insanity instead made it so that his powers have been relenquished and for him to obtain them back he must become a true hero which plots you into an epic quest in an open world where you meet characters to help you on your journey, dungeons to explore and towns to visit.Pros: This game had very hilarious and witty dialogue that did very excellently at what it was marketed for. (a parody RPG)                Various references throughout the game which would give a throwback to those familiar with old-school RPGs will make you chuckle and enjoy the game even more. That being said, you don't have to be an old-school RPG gamer to understand the references but the game will become more enjoyable in a writing standpoint if you are. The game had very polished visuals that truly did take you back to old 8-bit to 16-bit 2D RPGs such as Final Fantasy, DragonQuest, Chrono Trigger, etc. For a new game to use this style, it'd truly fit in to the library of the genre no matter past, present or future. The soundtrack was excellent and tracks are highly memorable, catchy and is a true tribute to 8-bit to 16-bit RPGs. As well as that, the soundtrack is kindly provided onto Zeboyd Games's website listed here: http://zeboyd.com/2011/01/11/cthulhu-saves-the-world-free-ost-release/ The gameplay is the traditional turn-based combat and depending on how you take a stance on that, it may be a pro or con for you. The game is even better though in the gameplay as it gets rid of most of the annoyances from other old RPGs that people would have issues with such as back-tracking, grinding, EVEN saving or any other minor annoyances by adding different capabilities such as being able to save any time, not being required to grind as much (although you could) and even having a random-encounter system whereby if you defeat a certain number of enemies in random-encounters, it will eventually stop and therefore you can explore even more.Cons: Considering this is an RPG, and an old-school styled one at that, it will most likely not greet players new or those who dislike this genre because it is as what it's written. This game and the gameplay still has the traditional random-encounters, turn-based combat system and is true to that sense and considering the game throws a lot into the mix, a lot of players will be put off had they bad experiences with these games or plain dislike them. Like other RPGs, especially JRPGs however, the same problem lies in that the game is a bit too linear. Getting to and from places seems too quick although given the game, it's price and it's stance. This is not so bad. The difficulty is quite high and impressive. This game is definitely suited to fans who are more oriented towards this game genre and newer places will have a difficulty with playing even perhaps at Easy difficulty. This won't be so bad if you do have prior knowledge with RPGs but it does cause quite a problem when it comes to newbies.In conclusion:This game holds up and will hold up in the forseeing years to come and I only wish that Zeboyd Games would get more publicity with their games because they are quite good especially for those who love turn-based old-school RPGs. Heck, the only reason why I found out about this game was from it being a sale and it definitely needs much more publicity. I'd hate to see it stay an underrated great game. I loved the game and am now cordially introduced into the amazing developers that are Zeboyd Games and are excited to see the other additions they give out and their other titles.This game receives a rating of: 8.5/10 for those familiar with the genre, especially the old-school RPGs. 7/10 for those who want to try a new RPG genre that can be compared to other RPGs and a starter to the genre. If you can get past the repetitive nature of the turn-based RPGs and enjoy the genre as well as the story, dialogue and soundtrack within this game then you will definitely enjoy it.Thank you very much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.~Raphy <3 c:			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World is an ode to the classical Turn-based RPG genre which we had back in the days of the NES, Except that this game was actually made in the modern days. Is that bad? Absolutely not. This game will you provide with so much fun and hours of gameplay, that it is well your money.The main thing that makes this game infamous is the amount of randomness. This game has hilarious dialogue, from breaking the fourth wall to references to just random insanity. At first it seems a bit akward, having Cthulhu talk to the narrator. But trust me, that is only the beginning.The story also makes zero sence, but for a game like this it doesn't matter. Cthulhu basically loses all of his powers, and to get them back he needs to be a good guy and save the world. Strange considering Cthulhu his goal was to destroy the world and now he's doing the complete opposite.Characters will join you, most of the times for no apparent but hilarious reason. Those characters reign from a skeleton to a flying sword to a girl who, for some reason or another, fell in love with cthulhu. Makes sence? No, but this game doesn't need sence to be awesome.And now you might think, is this game only randomness and does it fail on other mechanics? Actually, no. The gameplay will remind you of the classic RPG's which is, in my opinion, still a very great mechanic up to this date. And Cthulhu Saves the World does not dissapoint with this mechanic. The music isn't bad either. To be honest, the normal battle theme sounds suprisingly good.I would advice this game to anyone, even if they are not a rpg lover. This game has 4 different difficulties and several unique modes. 1 gameplay of the game already gives you several gameplay time, reigning from around 6 to 10 hours, so just imagine how much time you will spend with all the modes included within this game. And you know the very best part of this game? Look at the price.How do you even? All this content for only that price? Come on, buy this game already, you know that it's worth it.			"

It may not be the best of RPG's, but it has very few faults. On top of that, this is only half of a two game pack you get when you buy it! Definitely worth it, in my opinion.Review

												This one has it's pros and cons. The fact you need to have Windows Media Player installed on Windows machines to keep it from crashing during intro leaves a sour taste, but you really just need a particular .dll to get around that, instead of installing the whole program. If you can look past the standard, repetative jrpg-style turn-based combat mechanics, you're golden. Because it leaves you with amusing dialogue, tongue-in-cheek Lovecraftian references and a pretty fun and unique story. Overall, it's well worth the money for any fan of the Lovecraft genre looking for a funny new take.			"

However, the more I played the game, the more I started enjoying it and really loving it. It's a fun way to spend an afternoon, and some of the bosses are really quite hard to pass.

												A parody of Lovecraft's masterpieces. It tries to be fun, tries too hard sometimes.If you can bear with the spoiler amount in the title itself, I can summarize the topic as an evil thing loses its powers and tries to regain them by trying to be a nice guy once in a while. A santa with alzheimer, A mermaid with legs, A kitty who is actually an alien, and a hovering sword comes to his help. I did not finish the game yet, I am about to, but I dont think the other characters will be exceptions in terms of weirdness of the cast. Not really well thought or something, and mostly just interesting for the sake of being interesting. The story revolves around our hero, there are some 4th wall breaking moments etc. But actually let alone a few interesting lines in the graveyard, writing gets dull too easily. Do we need such a title? Parody is basically a thing which is pointed towards too overrated things. At least that is what I am used to. Lovecraft is one of the milestones for western horror genre, if not one of the founding fathers. Nobody reads him too much, nobody mentions him too much, and in gaming, in movies, in books etc, actually if there is a thing, it is underrepresentation. So what is the point of taking a demigod from his book, and ridiculing him? I am not sure.I am playing this with developer commentary. He seems like a fun guy. I enjoyed my time with him. And I actually think that this notes could be included in Narrator versus Cthulhu dialogue lines. A missed opportunity.Music is mediocre. Good for a while, gets repetitive too fast. Does not get annoying. Nothing to shame upon, nothing to praise.Okay, so what about gameplay. I am not that familiar with this kind of RPG titles, so my comments would be coming from a rookie in this genre. But I seriously dont think that having an algorithm as simple as the following for winning is a good sign:-Press enter repetitively until all of your enemies die or one of your guys get about to die.-Heal, if there are more than half remaining, nuke two or three times.-Repeat.RPG side is  a bit lacking. With each level, you choose an ability out of two for each character. The maximum level is 30. So There are 2^30 ""setups"" for each character. This is not as good as it sounds, since most of the upgrades are just basic stat upgrades. Mechanics of the game is not well explained, I still did not understand what is making them insane is doing. I dont know whether water attacks work more against fire-like enemies. I am not sure what each Stat is doing, but I am only guessing. And enemy explanations are nothing more than ""witty-oneliners"", so there are a lot of missing things here.Other than that, getting interrupted by random encounters is just too disorienting for my tastes. I played Pokemon before, so I know that this is WAD, but I think experiencing this to the point of forgetting where was I in levels with labirynthine designs  with no minimap, remembering it in some 10 seconds, then getting disrupted again... Till getting angry, is no good design.There are potions. They resurrect or fully heal your party members. Especially for the Ape Princess, use of it is definitely needed. There are enough weapon finds out in the wild, so I did not spend almost any money.  Imbalance? I think so.There is a 1UP mechanics which helps u to ressurrect at the same point....But I did not use it as well. Since it basically works like an autosave feature, but a limited one, so instead of using it, I just kept saving and reloading (savescumming) almost infinitely. Since most of the fights were pressing enter repeatedly, not saving does not help the feeling of thrill, only frustration. So 1up was a mechanism which is meaningless. Items were kinda ok, and they allowed flexibility in pressing enter countlessly strategies.Most of the boss fights were just holding on type wars. Nothing is different except they got 20000 HP this time. Have 1 or 2 healer, nuke until done. A dumb but sadly a valid strategy for almost all of them.If I were not obsessed about finishing the games I started, I would ve abandoned this borefest waaaay too earlier than this. I pushed myself to enjoy it, I am at about 8/10 of the game now, and I guess I will finish it in 1-2 days time. But I wanted to warn all fellow gamers that, times have changed, and being retro is not a virtue of its own. So I am writing this review after I became sure that this will continue like this.Writing may be interesting for some, but if I want to read a good story, and only that, I should not be using Steam for that.

												Cthulhu Saves the World is an RPG with new twists on an old formula. If you haven't already, you should look at my (or any) review on Breath of Death VII by the same developers prior to this game. Cthulhu Saves the World does a lot to expand on that. For those of you who don't want to bother looking at that first... well get ready for this review then.Cthulhu Saves the World has all your basic RPG stuff in it, leveling up, equipment management, going from town to town, talking to people, random encounters, spells, a four person party... all that good stuff. And the story, basically, is that Cthulhu has had his powers taken from him. In order to restore them, he must become a hero. Of course, being an evil creature such he, this makes for some goofy situations and banter between characters, the narrator, and Cthulhu himself along the way. So what makes this game stand out exactly?Well, if that premise of playing as a reluctant hero isn't enough, consider some of these things. The combat consists of a basic attack, technical attacks, and spells. Technical attacks and spells take MP. Using most moves will result in your combo going up, based on the number of hits. There are some moves that are very powerful or very useful, but may break this combo when used. There are also a few moves that are combo finishers. This means that the higher the combo, the more damage these moves will do. This is very useful to take advantage of on bosses. There's also a status effect in this game called insanity. Generally, moves that cause insanity will be quite powerful, and enemies that are insane may increase your stats a bit based on your passive skills. However, insane enemies tend to do more damage as well, so it can be a risky trade off. Another neat thing is that, upon leveling up, you can choose to select one of two available upgrades. They might be increased stats, new moves, enhanced old moves, passives, or any combination of the choices. This gives some good replayability and customization options. To really appreciate this game, you have to look at where it shines... convenience. This game is clearly designed by people who know how annoying RPGs can be, and they have taken measures to try and lessen the natural burdens of the genre. One way is simply allowing you to move around faster at the push of a button. There's also the ability to teleport to any city you've been to at any time, which is really nice for fast travel. The fights can move along quickly, which is nice for grinding. Animations for attacks are short, enemies are still images, and the display gives you fast information. After a battle, you will have some MP restored, full HP restored, and all party memebers revived... provided that you won. This makes it very easy to keep moving forward. No need to hoard healing items, use up MP on healing outside of battles, or travel back to healing areas. But by far the best addition is how this game handles random encounters. You see, every area has its own set number of random encounters. This means you'll find battles randomly that many times in the area. Once you've fought that many battles, the number reaches zero and you will no longer encounter enemies there randomly. This allows you to focus on your exploring, which is super nice in the mazier places. However, if you wish to grind in an area even after all the random encounters are up, you can! Simply go to the menu and select the option called fight. Then you will get to find a battle immediately without walking around randomly. It's the best of both worlds and I really love this feature.The art style is cool, basically a 16 bit type of representation, more or less. Colorful areas and monsters, plus I really like the neat attention to detail with the in-battle backgrounds that change depending on the area and terrain. A nice touch that made me get a little more into it. I can't speak for the music since I had the sound off while grinding and watching stuff... so sorry but... grinding. Some of the dialogue can be pretty funny at times. Sometimes not so much, but it depends. There's even a cool mode you can turn on to get little notes from the developer in the game about its development. It's neat! Also, I'd like to bring up that there are some fun bonus modes to try out here too. I personally really liked the Cthulhu's Angels bonus mode, which is almost a totally new campaign aside from many of the areas and enmies reused. New story and dialogue, not to mention new characters, made it well worth going through. However, there are some bad things about the game. The extra modes are among them. The higher difficulties are just more frustrating, as is highlader mode which only lets you use one person at a time to fight. These seem more like filler modes than actually being more conent, and for a game that's designed for the ease of use, making harder modes seems a bit counterproductive. But it's for more harcore players I guess. The other issue with the game is that, while it does try to fix the natural burdens of classic RPG design, it simply treats the symptoms rather than curing the problem. Basically, while it does make those aspects more enjoyable, it still has them.In the end, Cthulhu Saves the world is a really fun RPG for those who like simpler RPGs and want a smooth experience with a classic feel. I can only seem to find it in a package with Breath of Death VII for 3 bucks, and even for just this game, it's worth it. If you want to know more about Breath of Death VII, check out my review of that (or other people's reviews) and see for yourself. It's basically the same as this, but smaller and a little less polished. I'd say that if you get the pack, play that first to really appreciate the changes in this one. It's a pretty good deal for what you get. Cthulhu Saves the World gets an 8/10 for being a solid classically styled RPG with some great innovations to make the old formula much more enjoyable.			"

												Pros: Great story with hilarious dialogue, awesome graphics, great soundtrack, and pretty great gameplay with plenty of epic boss battles. Cons: No map(which could get you lost a couple of times, even went backwards in the level a couple of times without realizing it, although the developer has flames placed to show you when your close to the exixt, they can ONLY help you find the exit)In the end Cthulhu Saves the Word is a really good game, the only exception is that it's easy to get lost due to having no map. It's defiantly worth the money. 9/10			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World: Super Hyper Enhanced Championship Edition Alpha Diamond DX Plus FES HD - Premium Enhanced Game of the Year Collector's Edition (without Avatars) is a very fun game that exceeds my expectations. As the 142 runner up in the 2011 game of the year award, I feel that it should be very proud. Pros:+Decent graphics, although I had to turn texture detail down a bit, ant the anti-aliasing was difficult to configure.+The gameplay is very simple to pick up, as it only took 18 hours of various Reddit PDFs to get down to the nitty-gritty with it.+This game contains the only known footage of Cthulhu facepalming, which is invaluble to many hardcore followers.+Before its release on Steam, I clocked 7,000 hours in it, requiring me to hire people to remind me to eat and drink.+AAA graphics exceeding that of BO3, max settings.+Heart-wrenching story leaves you wanting more to the very end.Cons:-Even with Crossfire SLI, the animations were a bit too much to handle. My Titan X cards running overclocked were struggling to pull the load above 20 FPS.-There is no resolution setting above 2048x4096, which is very dissapointing, making it difficult to read the text when playing it on my 12K 90"" flatscreen.-The lowest settings look awful, and it is my only option, otherwise, the game crashes.-It seems that the microtransaction for the avatars is broken, as that is the only thing between me and owning all of the DLC.Overall: 7.825/10. The story is well written, and cross-refrences with The Dunwich Horror reveals that no bounderies are overstepped in the plot, and therefore, the canon remains intact. The graphics are amazing, and the photorealistic rendering payed off. However, the game runs slower then a whale on land. Perhaps it is due to my mere 128 gigs of 2400 mhZ ram, but something leads me to believe that that will suffice. The soundtrack is OK, but it seems that the devs forgot to turn down the DUNGEON_VICTORY.OGG by .23 decibles, because Sony Vegas revealed in post-production that the volume was simply too loud. The controller support is fantastic, and the only drawback is that my Xbox One Elite controllers wireless dongle failed to connect properly. If the devs prove able to fix these simple bugs, then I would have no problem upping their score to a maximum of 9.735. Lovecraft would be proud. Lovecraft would be proud.			"

												This game is the reason why I love indie JRPG's. Its funny, engaging, and visually attractive. The controls are tight and it doesn't feel like the many JRPG's that are out there.

												Cthulhu Saves the World is a love letter to the SNES-era turn-based jRPG. It maintains the turn-based formula and SNES graphics, but streamlines all the boring parts (like healing outside of combat), makes combat more interesting and faster, gives each character an advancement choice at every level up, and most importantly, the game has a great sense of humor. This is very much a SNES jRPG, so those who hate the genre should stay away. But those who ever liked the genre should grab this, especially when it's on sale for a dollar along with Breath of Death. (BoD is not as good or as funny, so if you are going to play both, play BoD first.)			"

												This game took everything great about Breath of Death and made it even better. Every mechanic and detail has been improved in this game. This is a must buy for fans of early JRPGs. Lots of jokes about other JRPGs, mainly from the NES and SNES eras. The battle system is fast paced and everytime you level up, you have a decision on what type of upgrade you want for each character. The game will last at least 7 hours without doing sidequests. If you do the optional stuff you can add another 3 hours. There are also other game modes to extend the playtime even further, including another storyline to play. The extra storyline is worth playing and can add another 5 hours to the game. Also, make sure you turn on the Developer Commentary option. It adds a ton of unque insights into every part of the game.			"

Note: TL;DR at the end of the review.Story & GameplayThis game is amazing and the price tag is great! The story is hilarious with a great turn based fight mechanism, with a large variety of parthners with different weapons and specialisations this game is amazing! There isn't really much I can say about it but the story is innovative, funny dialouges and a large variety of attacks, weapons, unique effects for every level (unlike pokemon and a bunch of other 16-bit games which just up your stats).VisualsIt's a 16-bit game.OtherIt has controller support, and some gameplay mechanics that can really help in speeding up the game (a lot of 16-bit games are boring because of the slow walk speed or the slow turn based fighting as I've found) and as mentioned before every characters have new unique moves meant only for them after every level up. The algorithm automatically makes you fight more difficult enemies no matter the area so you don't have to waste your time grinding.You actually have to use your potions in this game, with challenging boss fights and a variety of abilities this games rating is:Rating85%TL;DRPros:+ Not monotonous like most turned based games+ Great story!+ Funny so it's basically made for casual gamers+ Hundreds of weapons, attacks and more+ Lengthy story+ Support for different controllersConsWhat?

My favorite is the Swordsman's description: ""Looking for a six-fingered man."" This is a reference to ""The Princess Bride,"" which is the best movie of all time.

Although in those days he was quite a rabble rouser, now apparently he has decided to not cause trouble anymore and fly the straight and narrow. I'm proud of him.

												Cthulhu Saves the World takes Zeboyd Games' previous title Breath of Death VII, an already charming and enjoyable old school RPG, as a template and improves every aspect. It's very much a loving tribute to both Lovecraft's fiction and the classic RPGs it follows so closely, and the game itself is really rather great. Combat is turn and menu-based and unlike some games in a similar vein once you get the hang of it the combat is capable of being very fast-paced, a big bonus given that no one wants to spend an entire game just being bogged down by unreasonable or agonizingly slow random encounters. This is furthered by the combo system in combat which makes for an interesting mechanic, and generally made more engaging due to the branching levelling system for Cthulhu and his party members with which the player can to some level customise the character's builds shaping their role in combat. Some of the dungeons can be a little confusing to navigate (the alien spaceship in particular is rather horrendous), but it is an RPG after all. Of course the main appeal of Cthulhu Saves the World over other RPGs is the story and the sense of humour, and pleasingly it's a riot. The sense of humour is very self-aware and totally unafraid to ridicule itself, the source material and the genre it lies in, with narrative quirks and violations of the fourth wall all over the place. This is also apparent in the developer's commentary which can be enabled, in which the devs are refreshingly frank, honest and frequently as funny as the story's  dialogue, making it well worth turning on. The Cthulhu's Angels bonus campaign meanwhile re-uses the vast majority of the main game elements essentially treading the same path, but the differing narrative and cast of characters remarkably manages to make it seem like a fresh experience all the same. Essentially this title is an engaging little classic-style RPG wrapped in an aesthetic and sense of humour that makes it all its own, and is more than worth the miniscule price tag for both this and Breath of Death VII in a double pack.

												Definately a legit oldschool-style RPG! Despite being considered a ""parody"", I felt like it was more of just a humor-centric, solid RPG that could have stood next to the original Final Fantasy 2 (IV), and certainly anything older. Infact, it has more character interaction, overall dialogue, and improved game mechanics. Pretty sure, unfortunately.It's a solid game if you're into the time-period and Genre. If not, whatever. If you don't know, I don't know. Psyched about ""Cosmic Star Heroine"" after seeing what these guys can do. It's more late SNES style graphically, like Chrono Trigger for instance.			"

Not reading any of his novella may remove from some of the comedy, but it would still be rather hilarious if you didn't! It's not only hilarious, but really fun! Earthbound-esque dungeons(Easy to get lost in, and no real way to easily find where you have to go), and rather fun twists on the RPG genre. And also, it's now on sale! Not only that, it comes with another one of their games! I reccomend this game to pretty much anyone.			"

 Cthulhu Saves the World Cthulhu Saves the World is JRPG, released in July 2011. Developed and published by Zeboyd Games.I bought this game in the double pack for very cheap like 0,50$ and honestly this game is absoluty worth that price. The game has a good art style and a lot of humor in it and references to other games.You play as Cthulhu who lost his powers and needs to be a hero to get them back. in your journey you will meet all new friends who will help you in your journey. Graphics wise the game looks good in a 8/16 bit style. The characters look good and the game has a nice art style. and it works really well with the 8/16 bit style. The gameplay is fairly standard JRPG. The combat is pretty basic but i does the job, the combat is pretty fast and there are no animations. You will get more players to put in your party up to 4 of them. On your journey you will get a enjoyable story and gameplay experience.I really enjoyed this game and i do recommend it. The gameplay is fun and the story is hilarious. The price for this game is cheap and I hope you pick this up, The double pack is worth it aswell.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, And checking out my Profile for more reviews.

												Got this as a gift since I'd been curious about it, and while it certantly amuses? The actual 'Lovecraftian' references are pretty thin, and the gameplay falls prey to the same mechanics it tries to make fun of, though thankfully only near the end of the game; namely massive HP creatures that require a damage/combo race to beat. While it makes a stab for being replayable with different game modes, I can't say it really stands as a replayable game. Still, for its price, it makes a great gift and at least improves on the style of game it attempts to emulate save for the aforementioned.			"

												Just completed this game and I have to say that it was a very enjoyable game and for the price that you can buy this game for it’s definitely worth the money. The difficulty of the game was in my opinion just right and this is coming from a person who is not very good at RPG games.The most enjoyable thing in this game for me was the interaction between the characters because the dialog was very humorous and it made you really like each of the characters in your party.The soundtrack is also pretty epicThe only negative about the game was that it was very easy to get lost in the dungeons in the game because most of the corridors look the same and due to not having a map you can end up getting lost very easily, but this still doesn’t take away the fact that the game is very fun "

												I'll admit, this was an impulse buy when the combo pack dropped to $.99; however, I'm not disappointed at all. This is a fantastic game. The storyline is amusing, the dialogue is witty, the combat system is really good. I had a ton of fun playing through this. Though it only took me a few days to finish the initial playthrough, I skipped a few optional bosses (including the mega-boss in the Cave of Destiny), so a more adventurous player could find a few more hours of gameplay tucked away. Beating the game also unlocks Highlander and Cthulhu's Angels play modes; which allow you to play through the game with one character, or a team of Cthulhu's ""groupies"". All said, this is a fantastic game and I would not have been disappointed if I had picked it up at full price. Give it a go.			"

												This game is a great twist on the Lovecraft Cthulhu lore. It's quite light-hearted and has some moments of being self aware also (Cthulhu talks trash to the narrator in the introduction and also comments on the fact that you can save anywhere- ""What is this? A First Person Shooter?"")It's a very simple and straightforward RPG in the style of retro and vintage 16 bit turn based JRPGs. There are tons of random encounters and there is a bunch of level grinding involved with multiple characters joining your party. The grinding could be a bit annoying at times but there is enough variety in enemies that it never gets too boring.All in all, if you like old games, funny games, simple games or RPGs, this is a game for you.

												I absolutely love this game, in my opinion this is one of Steam's better RPG's that aren't multiplayer; and now one of my top 5 favorite games. The reason why I think it's one of Steam's better RPG's are because it's not just kill this thing, talk to that npc, leave the town. It has story, sometimes harder to find then what most RPG's give and I like it for it. Most of the bosses tie to Cthulhu in some way, may that be rivals, enemies or the most random things that're possible. Another good thing about this game would be the comedy. This game is based around comedy in my opinion, and the story is perfect for the humor level. 10/10 better than Starbound.			"

												This is one of the few indie games I have played, And I think it is absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack - amazing, spot on OST for an RPG. The dialogue - funny, sweet and clever, I have wanted to read each bit of text in the game, the alternative developer commentary also gives some good insight as to how each dungeon was made, or the design of certain enemies and boss battles.The combat - Very good. Turn based. Any encounter can be your last. Save often, stock up on potions, choose upgrades wisely, and be ready to have some MP. Enemies can range from 2 at a time, to 6. Possibly more!Never have I played an indie game like Cthulhu Saves The World before. Seems to be overlooked in every perspective. I would have payed more for this had I known of it before. I picked it up with another game made by the same developer in a bundle for only £0.29. Massive, massive well done to the developer for the design of the game and composition of the amazing soundtrack. 10/10, don't miss out on this game!			"

The story is solid and very humerous (but not so much that it takes away from the story.) and the gameplay is just like the old JRPGs that were so incredible on the SNES. That cannot be stressed enough. The fact that it also includes Breath of Death VII as well is amazing. This is a steal at $3, and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something retro. The games contained are easily worth $10 or more.			"

It's a parody of most JRPGs on the NES/SNES and immediately causes you to laugh with it's tongue in cheek humor.The game is also fairly technically sound. The game is a lot less difficult then most JRPGs, which is perfect for most players not used to grinding for hours.

												Cthulhu Saves the World is a parody RPG where you get to play as Cthulhu and drive your enemies insane.If that and the cheap price tag weren't enough to convince you to buy and play this now, keep reading:The gameplay of Cthulhu Saves the World is based on classic JRPG mechanics such as random encounters and turn based battles. However this is mixed with more modern design elements to proved an improved, compact, experience. Battles can move very fast with minimal time wasted on attack animation and a very quick and responsive interface. There is also the combo system to add an extra layer of depth to your decisions in combat. Plus each area in the game limits the total number of random encounters, so you won't be stuck in an easy area forever if you have bad luck (There is also includes an option to force encounters in case you feel the need to grind past the limit).This parody RPG is filled with humor in its dialogue and enemy/monster description which will keep you entertained between battles. The game will only be around 5-7 hours for a normal play through, so if you want a classic JRPG type experience but don't have the 50-100+ hours to spend on a more traditional game, this is a great alternative. However, if you want to keep playing there are several alternate modes such as the score attack mode to test your skill, or the Highlander and Cthulhu's Angels modes to provide different experiences.If you liked Breath of Death VII you'll probably love this, and even if you didn't, you may still enjoy Cthulhu Saves the World due to its improvements in mechanics and visuals.

												In the same vein as brother-in-arms Breath Of Death 7, CstW lampoons old 16-bit RPG tropes in a story that has you playing the bad guy. Cthulhu awakens to bring chaos and insanity but immediately has his powers removed by some goody-two-shoes jerk. So begins a quest to regain his powers and bring ruin to those who would oppose him.In terms of BoD7, CstW is everything that was but made bigger and better. The sensible additions BoD introduced such as limited encounters are still here, but the whole thing feels like a more complete package overall with sidequests and party construction. The humour remains consistently funny throughout and the joke never seems to wear thin, with enemy descriptions being a highlight of awful puns and one-liners that will make you smile and groan in equal measure.

												Cthulhu Saves the World serves as a great tribute to classic JRPGs and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. It's funny. It's weird. It does what it sets out to do very well but it doesn't hold up quite as well when viewed simply as an RPG. Repetitive battles are to be expected but the combat does start to feel very sloppy as you progress through the game and realize that most of your moves will become obsolete. The story also does not do a lot to drive the player forward through the adventure. RPGs are time consuming... So in order to be worth your time investment, all the elements of an RPG (the combat, the characters, the story) need to work together to enrich the experience. Cthulhu Saves the World provides bits and pieces of fun but never really delivers a full and satisfying game. For a memorable retro RPG experience, it's best to look to classic titles such as Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.			"

												The developer question marks around the game are pretty cool, they tell you what the devs intended to do, didn't do, couldn't do and why and provide context to how the game was made. This is my favorite feature of the game. Otherwise, I think it's average for a modern take on an RPG. I know I won't be able to finish it without feeling I'd be spending my time better with SNES and Chrono Trigger. That said, the developer commentary has kept my interest so far.			"

												Really nice little RPG with a lot of humor and Cthulhu as main character. It's a bit short (~7 hours for the main story) but still enjoyable. The level up bonuses are damn good since you can choose beetween 2 ""upgrades"". Also the unlockables modes (like Highlander, Score, etc..) are a nice addition to the game, even if I think it's just here to give a bit more challenge.You should definitely try it c: "

												This game offers very little besides the wacky title.What passes for a story is Cthulhu going around doing heroic things in his own way, which is sometimes something funny like saving innocent zombies from the thing controlling them but mostly things like returning a lost dog or healing an illness  by finding magic water. There is very little cast development, the characters stay mostly one dimensional and while the character concepts like a talking sword or an alien cat might seem interesting at first, very little is done with them.The music is nothing worth remembering, not even the final boss theme was that catchy.The dungeon design is bad, the only puzzles are barriers that can be opened with a button press and a falling/rising water level. The levels are designed to make the player get lost, probably to extend the short playtime, if you want to find the right way, take the path that looks the least like it will lead to progress.Of course, the graphics are also nothing noteworthy, they go for a ""retro"" pixel style, but this is just an excuse for being lazy with the graphics since they are nowhere near actually good looking detailed pixel art like: http://i.imgur.com/buH9JjF.gifThe gameplay is one good aspect, you are often in danger of dying and all of your HP get's refreshed after each fight, even if a party member dies, thus making even a victory with only one fighter left standing worth it. The only thing to look out for between fights is the MP count, since it isn't completely replenished. This game also makes buffs and debuffs useful, even in non boss fights. You still have a lot of skills you rarely or never use though. The danger of loosing is sadly undermined by being able to save anywhere, although this might not be the case on harder difficulties.Like any jrpg though, fighting get's tedious after some time and since there is little else worth looking at in this title, I suggest you avoid it.

												This game got pretty good ratings in international reviews by both players and professionals. I like the Lovecraftian mythos, I like SNES style RPGs and I don't care whether it's indie or how good the graphics are, when the gameplay works. Therefore, I bought this game with some expectations. You certainly guessed it already: This game sucks hard! Or to be a bit more diplomatic: I really don't understand what's so great about this game. Sure, the idea is funny and maybe the story is interesting. But that's it! The combat is boring, tedious and repetitive. All you do the whole game is follow the linear story path, talk a little and fight. Oh, and there is the fighting. Did I mention that? Combat takes like 95% of the time, so it's really hard to get into any kind of story.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Hahahahaha this is a bewtiful japanese rpg!I think this game can have lots of fun for his jokes,for the enormous amount of citations and for the game like that does not stop until you finish it feeling you not satisfied.I'll be honest when they gave me the thought did suck but I changed my mind when i start to play this game.The game has 3 difficulties, very very different from each other but the thing that got me stupitio more, and the game has a great storyline which honestly I did not expect.the game starts as a normal RPG game: with a pause menù bulky and with an initial dialogue too long but the wait will be rewarded when you start the actual game.scenarios are very different and although it seems the game is very long dale 5 to 8 hours of game time, but I restrain myself in telling other not to spoil the surprise.I hope you enjoyed this review and thank you for your attention.

												Ironicly, the title says all. The demon of insanity saves the world, with some friends! But not with yours.Cthulhu Saves the World is an old school based RPG with dynamic combats and a revisited gameplay.When you think you've seen everything in all RPGs, you're wrong. Cthulhu will show you some skills you've never seen before, and for a small, tiny, microscopic price.In this game you can create your own party of 4 characters, choosing between around 9 to 11 characters, each with different classes and abilities, you will have to try them all out to find their best skills to beat the bosses.In combat you can fusion with one of your party to create a unique powerful skill that can be as useful as useless, you will need to study every single detail to make the game easier.The story is counting many dungeons and villages which all have an event (zombie apocalypse, diseases, thieves), 2 sub dungeons to farm your experience if needed. Also, there's a limited number of random battles in a dungeon for you to fully  explore it after. But don't worry, in the menu you still can choose the ""Fight"" selection to battle and earn experience.The dialogues are funny and maybe for the first time in a RPG you're gonna read every single sentence.Finally, when you end the game, bonus modes and challenges can be unlocked to extend the gameplay.However, the ""Cthulhu Angels"" is the same story but with different characters (only girls.) and a different dialogue.Also, with the graphics, I was hoping for some chiptune music but the game has a quite disturbing music that comes over and over and sometimes in an inappropriate time.The game is a little too easy, especially on ""Normal"" which I did my 1st run today. The final battle wasn't so epic as in an old RPG game. I mean, a final battle should take around 10 to 30 minutes to make it. This one can be made in 3 minutes, even less. (In Normal Mode, I repeat.)Anyway, for this price you can't refuse to play this game, if you like RPGs or not, this one is made for everyone: for beginners as for harcore gamers. When the old RPG was too epic, Cthulhu gives some insanity to make it funny and it works.7.5/10 phrlyegxcr			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World plays much like the old-school NES and Super NES party-based RPGs, where you control the individual actions of a party of characters in battle.  However, unlike a lot of RPGs, it doesn't bog down in a ton of statistical details and lots of different kinds of armor and weapons.  Certainly, there are upgrades as you go along, but you don't have to buy a helmet, breastplate, greaves, shield, and boots to defend your character well; it's very much a pick-up-and-play type of RPG.  This isn't to say it isn't challenging, however; later battles may drive you nuts until you find just the right party and strategy to succeed.  The story is also engaging, and there is a lot of humor throughout.  Some conversations are downright funny, and even the narrator gets involved.  Character profiles are also winners.  One boss is literally a black hole; the profile says, ""Now we're just getting silly.""  Don't let the low price tag fool you; Cthulhu Saves the World is a great game.			"

												To start with the game is fun. Great humor, but the combat system gets very boring, very fast. You use the same 5 spells divided amond all your char more or less constantly, simply because it's the most effective. In a game like this, the combat system MUST be a lot of fun. But it's just to trivial. Avoid it, or get it dirt cheap.			"

												Awesome little RPG that looks old-school but plays like an inspired, modern, and fun game designed with worthwhile mechanics. The music is quaint and reminds me of the ""good old days"" as do the sprites; however, the combat is thought-provoking and well done. It inspires you to win in as few turns as possible by increasing monster difficulty as time wears on and increasing rewards the faster you win. Dialogue is generally funny, cheeky, and satirical.Pros:Awesome mechanics like teleporting out of dungeons, tactical combat, and anytime fightsGreat dialogue and characters, found myself laughing regularlyGreat character progression by choosing how you level upComplex dungeonsOut-of-the-box Controller SupportCons:It's an oldschool RPG, so it takes a certain type of playerSprite graphicsRepetative (although good) musicFresh and fun oldschool RPG. Don't expect to take it seriously though. This comes in a dual-pack with Breath of Death VII. Although the games share similar mechanics and motifs, something about Breath of Death didn't give me the same charm that Cthulhu did. I'd recommend playing Cthulhu first and if you really liked it to then go through Breath of Death for more of the same; however, if you can only play one of the two, this is it. A			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World (CStW) is another tongue-in-cheek turn-based adventure role-playing game (RPG)--dear God--based on H.P. Lovecraft's short story, ""The Call of Cthulhu."" Similar to the Penny Arcade's third Rain-Slick of Precipice and Breath of Death, CStW utilizes the same Zeboyd's engine that continues to pay homage to old-school RPGs. If you enjoy good classic fun and love to sit back on the couch with a controller, CStW is a game for you. The story, humor and sense of adventure is a wonderful gift to casual gamers.			"

												Thankfully this is a rather short RPG because I don't see how anyone could tolerate it much longer than that. Pretty much every dungeon is exactly the same, big sprawling maze with random encounters and the occasional chest. The hardest thing about the game is finding the next level of the dungeon, really. Mobs generally aren't too tough and it's easy to be overpowered in this game. The bosses are kind of a joke; even the final boss took practically no effort at all. The story kind of stops caring about a quarter of the way through the game and there's no sense of atmosphere at all. It's not even that f funny, either. There's some jokes but they're far too infrequent for it to really be a comedy game. The last dungeon has a big difficulty spike which is a bit unwarranted but even then, hopping into an optional dungeon and then back into the last dungeon basically destroyed all the challenge I was having. It's just... bland. I don't like RPGs in general and only got this in a bundle, and it was short enough for me to not get bored of it, at least. I wouldn't call it ""bad"" for what it is, but I certainly can't say it blew me away or anything.			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World is a mediocre RPG as a whole- unfortunately, the the parts that shine are the quicker parts of the game.The humor is spot on, with a lot of amusing results for those players willing to search everywhere and interact with every object. Exploring a new town was the high point of the game for me. The music was pretty good too, though dungeon backgrounds resetting after every encounter was annoying... more on that later.The boss encounters are alright, there are some neat ideas but ultimately I hit on a no-healing strategy that crushed the back third of the game- difficulty was shallow and predominantly based around keeping the enemy strength from ramping up- all battles basically must end in 5-8 rounds at most, or enemies are too powerful to overcome as they gain 10% strength after each round. That's not too interesting, that just means go all out every fight!And that's what you have to do while exploring dungeons- go all out every fight and ignore healing. The only sustain you have is tied to your MP, and encounters are limited per area, so as long as the full party doesn't wipe, you're fine. Restoring to max HP just doesn't work.Dungeons also all feel exactly the same. Sprawling mazes that take way too long to navigate through, gold and XP feel worthless with the way they're curved, and equipment is scarce and usually obsoletes whatever you just bought. The menus are clunky, especially when it comes to equipping or checking character abilities.I will probably replay for the bonus mode with new dialogue and the like at some point in the future... after I'm no longer burnt out on labyrinthine hallways with a too-slow movement speed, even while running, filled with mindless encounters.

Sadly though, this game is not very Lovecraftian at all. Some familiar names pop up, and conditions like the ""Insane"" effect try, but if you're looking for a good Call of Cthulhu-esque game, this is not it. Like I said, gameplay wide its pretty solid, with only some minor balancing issues. But story wise this games falls flat for me, and thats really what  I was looking for in this single player experience.			"

												Old school final fantasy gamepley, which is enjoyable to most, not really my cup of tea. However, Lovecraftian games are always my weakness. Sadly though, this game is not very Lovecraftian at all. Some familiar names pop up, and conditions like the ""Insane"" effect try, but if you're looking for a good Call of Cthulhu-esque game, this is not it. Like I said, gameplay wide its pretty solid, with only some minor balancing issues. But story wise this games falls flat for me, and thats really what  I was looking for in this single player experience.			"

I find myself laughing out loud and smiling frequently. This game makes me really happy. I feel as if I hit gold within my first week of being on Steam, and now there won't be any game out there to meet my expectations after this. The dark humor and silliness of it all is fantastic. It reminds me of Phantasy Star and Sword of Vermillion with an epic soundtrack. Thank you Devs, I am absolutely smitten by Cthulhu.			"

												Gameplay's pretty much equal comparing to Breath of Death VII, except with a new story and new additions such as the insanity system. Both games come in a bundle and, if caught on sale, can be bought for ridiculous prices.Pros:- Catchy soundtrack!- Tribute to the 16-bit era, plus a comical side;- Hero Cthulhu!- Insanity system is a great plus!- Sprites are well designed and make for some good battle scenery;- A demonstration that a good game doesn't need great graphics to be fun!Cons:- If you don't like 16-bit games, stay out of this one. Kind of stupid not to like them anyways.			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World is a game that plays and feels like Final Fantasy Mystical Quest. Well, except that it brings its own innovations to the table - the Unite attacks (which are awesome) and the round-based combat system (which pretty much limits the amount of turns you have to defeat your enemies). You'd expect a bland plot and forced humor; this is not the case. It's an amazing game with surprising depth in the gameplay; not just a tribute to the old JRPG games but a good game on its own - something the guys at Ubisoft should take note of when making something like Child of Light, a game that looked fantastic yet lacked in every other department.Limiting the amount of random encounters (after some fights they become optional) reduces the padding combat that plagued early Final Fantasy games.Another unexpected strong point is the soundtrack - a mix of JRPG-inspired 8-bit tunes with 80s heavy metal sounds just epic.I definitely recommend this game to every fan of the classic JRPG genre and Lovecraft mythos who also likes to have a good laugh. Well done, Zeboyd Games, well done indeed. Luckinly, I also have Breath of Death VII in my library to play after I finish this one. But I'll watch out for your other games and new releases too.			"

												I'm a big fan of JRPGS, however, since nowadays I'm a PC gamer, it's hard to find traditonal JRPGS. Cthulhu Saves the World is one of the few on Steam, and it's great. The price is stupidly low (it's like 3$ for two games), and you'll easily get 6 or more hours out of it. The game plays like an old Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy. You traverse an overworld, find towns, dungeons, etc, etc. The game itself is fairly linear, with a couple of side dungeons spread over the world. What makes the game unique in mind is the battle system. While it may look like nothing special, it's actually quite unique. Each turn that goes by the enemies all have their attack increased by 10%, what this means is that you'll quickly be overwhelmed. This means you have to stratgeize how to defeat the monsters in the quickest way possible. You won't be mashing 'attack' throughout the battles in this game. Dungeons can often be really maze like, which is a pain, but it's not a major problem.			"

												The Empire of Tamriel is on the edge. The High King of Skyrim has been murdered. Alliances form as claims to the throne are made. In the midst of this conflict, a far more dangerous, ancient evil is awakened. Dragons, long lost to the passages of the Elder Scrolls, have returned to Tamriel. The future of Skyrim, even the Empire itself, hangs in the balance as they wait for the prophesized Dragonborn to come; a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand amongst the dragons.It's rly good, buy it.

(This was written before the old recommendation system was updated into the review system we have today, so I was more limited with what I could write about this game and took on more of a tone where I was trying to ""sell"" this game to people. I plan to eventually write a proper, more long-form-ish review of this game whenever I can work up the drive to do so. So yeah, just take this ""recommendation"" as just that.)Okay, so we've got an RPG where you play as Cthulhu where you have to save the world in order to get your power back so you can destroy the world....Are you still here? Okay, fine. The game also has a pretty nice degree of customization that basically allows you to make each character fill whatever kind of role you like by choosing a skill to learn with each passing level....What, you want more? How about the incredible soundtrack you can download for free on the developer's website? What, am I the only person who cares about those things? Did I mention this game has a great sense of humor? Because it has a great sense of humor. Aside from the occasional references to games ranging from Final Fantasy to Bad Dudes, the game is filled to the brim with flavor text that always has something amusing to say about whatever it's describing. Need I say more? Yes? How about that there's another game just like this one packed in with it? And they're only $3 together? GO BUY THIS NOW OR CUTOFF FU			"

												So, in hypocritical style, after recommending Breath of Death as a fun, satirical take on classic RPGs, I am NOT recommending Cthulhu Saves the World. ""Wouldn't a game whose premise involves the lord of annihilation and suffering plunged into the role of saving the world be worth a token recommendation because of its novel story line?"" I can hear folks asking me. ""Wouldn't a game by the same developers as Breath of Death be similar?""And the answer is a resounding 'YES' to both. Both games are nearly identical when it comes to level design, character progression, combat mechanics and funny/corny dialogue. I think the only difference is me - I'm clearly suffering from some sort of comedy RPG overload.This game has been sitting in my queue, unfinished, for at least a year now. And everytime I try to pick it up again, I am immediately turned off by the repetitive combat, grossly oversized dungeons and scarce loot. I am just not ready for more of the same. However, I still think the purchase of the bundle is COMPLETELY worth it. Maybe if you play Cthulhu Saves the World first, you'll have the experience I had playing Breath of Death (Read about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989795433/recommended/107300/).

												Hilarious, great for the price, and just flat out fun. Turn based combat, familiar to Final Fantasy games, you know, the good ones. The level up system is neat, the comedy pokes fun at other RPGs in the genre and even unexpected games like space invaders. Worth the price completely. Even if you're unaware of Cthulhu lore (like myself) this game is fully enjoyable. Plenty of content, and even some replayability. The game goes on sale for under $5 all the time, it should be a crime to give up a chance to play it.			"

												Like Breath of Death, you can get this game for super, duper cheap and like Breath of Death, it's worth every penny.  This game has several play modes for crazy replayability, a polished combat system focusing on quick decisions, but also risk reward mechanics, such as making your enemies stronger but weakening their defense, and a story that is both humrous and endearing.  It's the Cthulhu mythos and all things lovecraftian made into a quirky Jrpg and the result is pretty amazing.  Also, this game has one of the best things in any Jrpg.  The ability to avoid random battles.  If you fight a certain number of battles in any dungeon, then you stop getting into random battles.  You can choose to grind and fight more, but this feature makes the game so much more enjoyable than your standard Jrpg.  Must play.			"

												Nostalgic convenience.  Certainly brings back a lot of the fun of 16-bit RPGs, but includes a lot of nice additions that many of those older games did not such as being able to save anywhere at any time, conveniently placed restore points (especially before boss battles), ability to ""one-up"" if you die and want to try a battle again, free inns, able to warp to any town at pretty much anytime (even from dungeons), limited number of random encounters, and a run button.  I wish all those older games had these features as it pobably would have saved my parents from yelling at me to hurry up as I'm trying to fight my way back to an inn just to save my progress.  CSTW is really geared towards the fun aspect of these older RPGs.  Combat is overall simplistic and I found myself settling in on the same attacks over and over.  This may turn off some players but I didn't mind it too much.  There are some attacks and ""team-up"" attacks that I did not use at all or maybe once.  Some parts of the game aren't explained very well such as the ""insanity"" mode that some attacks will cause.  When I used it, the monsters caused more damage, but also took more damage from player attacks.  Apparently this mode can also unlock special attacks from certain monsters.  The monster's picture will also change slightly to show that it is ""insane"". There were a couple of nit-picky items that did not affect gameplay a whole lot but I thought were a little annoying.  First of all, the animations during the battles was very minimal.  The monsters did not move and only flashed when hit.  You can see your character's attacks in the form of a swipe or some kind of spell effect, but that was about it.  Also, some indicators on character status during fights would have been nice to show if they were poisoned, stunned, etc.  The game will tell you in the text box if a character's status is impacted, but its so easy to just click past these messages from habit that its easy to miss.  Overall this is a good game that took up about 20 hours of my time.  There were still some optional dungeons to complete and I may still do those.  If you like old-school RPGs or want to take a break with something more casual, then I would recommend this game to scratch that itch.  Plus you can get it on sale for less coin than what you probably have clinking around in your car's cup-holder.			"

Unfortunately this game seems to be the latter.I chuckled a few times at the inside jokes in the openning segment, but the RPG elements are too dull/tired for me to endure to get to the only semi-humorous story.3/10(This is exactly the same review as I wrote for Breath of Death VII because they are basically the exact same game.)

AUDIOStockVISUALRPG MakerDIFFICULTYToughVIBEcheesyCRAVINGcringeON SALEdon'tPROS: Writing an anti-hero is a bold choice. (Too bad it failed.) Battling itself is not that bad, takes an Earthboundish sort of approach. Overworld graphics are tolerable.CONS: I'm shocked to see how many people are praising it for its humor and story, and then I remember the current state of the film industry. I could not tolerate any text that popped up in Cthulhu Saves the World; It is the 9gag of video games. The dialogue is complete and utter trash. I've never been subjected to a more hideous form of unfunny. Every line of garbage uttered by the protagonist and the insufferable mary-sue anime girls following him made me writhe in discomfort.WORTH: please stopOVERALL: My health issues coincidentally took a turn for the worse around the time I bought this game.

												With so many classic 16-bit RPGs on Steam trying to capture the nostalgia of the 90s, it becomes difficult to discern the fun ones from the awful ones. This is one of the latter.Gameplay is pretty self-explanatory for anyone who's played a turn-based RPG. The problem with this game is that it doesn't do anything particularly well to make it stand out from the crowd: generic monster types, humour that doesn't amuse, and a boring plot prevent this game from becoming what it could have been.

												Highly recommended. It's an old-school 8-bit RPG with alot of humour and a classic vibe to it.The only cons I have with it are the lack of some options (you have 3 graphic options: fullscreen and 2 fixed window resolutions) and the inventory/party menu that takes a while to get used to.8.9/10			"

												This game is for all classic RPG lovers. This game is as simple as brilliant. You find yourself as the mighty Cthulhu, weakend by a strange magic, seeking for glory and honor to get your powers back. Can you rescue the land from the ultimate devil? All in all its fun to read the dialogues of the characters and to drive the story forward. The combat can be challenging if you are tired and just want to smash some random buttons, so be carefull. For the hardcore gamers there are some fine brutal modes which can make your playthrough to a pure mess. Good luck dealing with them! The playtime is around 10 hours depending on how much you explore.			"

												First of all, I have to admit this is my very first time playing something like this, and I found out it's not my cup of tea. So if you're into retro 2D RPG games, this review won't be to your liking either.Gameplay is pretty simple and the story does show a lot of fun. However, battles are overly simplistic and get rather repetitive pretty quickly. Story wise it's not very interesting. There is some funny interaction between the characters but I get the feeling it's merely the required minimum. The game is praised for it's humor. Let's get this straight: it's not hilarious. I didn't laugh, I didn't even snicker. It's just amusing. That's all. And not good enough to keep my attention/interest after the battles failed to do that as well. I guess it's similar to the situation when one types ""LOL"" constantly without really ""Laughing Out Loud"".Bottom line.If you're not into retro 2D RPGs you'll get bored. If you're into retro 2D RPGs maybe, just maybe and if you have pretty low expectations from a cheap game.			"

												Significantly better gameplay and humor compared to BoFVII. The game is longer than BoFVII but this also brings out some of the core problems with the gameplay. Bosses are true damage races because their damage increases in percentages per turn, leaving you to spam your most powerful skills until either you or it dies. The new ""Insanity"" ailment is supposed to add a layer of tactical depth to your skills but I ended up not even using them much since it has unpredictable (and often negative) results. Normal monsters are also frustrating since later in the game they get gobs of HP, often out damaging you while eating your attacks.If you have played a JRPG before you will find humor somewhere in this game for sure. Be prepared for some rage; all the difficulties are stronger than they admit, but nothing grinding can't fix.			"

Time of completion:: 6 hours and 3 minutesDate of writing the review: 04.March.2015Difficulty I played at: EasyMy YouTube channel:  link  My rating: 5/10===========================I want to start off by saying that never before this game have I played any sort of top-down game, let alone a top-down (old-school) RPG like this one, so I hold no nostalgia factor for games like this one. This is from the perspective of a man who has been PC gaming since 2002 (was 10 y/o) and is just introduced to this type of RPGs.It's very difficult to give a good game a downvote, but even if everything else is done great, if your main mechanic (the combat) is done poorly, then the game loses all it's value and becomes bad and frustrating.Let's begin with the praises first:As I mentioned, most aspects of the game are done great, we will start off with the:VisualsThe art for the characters is great, when you see emotion, the picture changes according to the mood of the character. There is lots of variety between most of the monsters and you don't feel like fighting a different version of the same creature over and over again, even through some are just re-skinned and re-colored.SoundGreat ! Music is awesome and the sound effects while fighting vary from each-other.StoryAgain, great ! I love how you are a hero, but also not. You want to be evil, but you have to do good things in order to be able to do bad things. I know, right ? Mind=blown. The ending is very disappointing though, I really hoped that the opposite of what happened to happen.ControlsOh thank you, thank you, thank you for adding a sprint button, also thank you for making the ""attack"" command to be the default one. That helps with spamming ENTER in order to get out of the garbage fighting system as fast as possible....and now the bad...LengthI wish it wasn't this long honestly. Every dungeon frustrated me and I blitzed though it as fast as possible. I am so glad I chose the easy difficulty, otherwise I had to spend a lot more time planning my moves and forget where I was going by the time the fight is over.The other and most annoying thing is how the combat worksWhenever you are in a dungeon (or outside one, doesn't matter) you will constantly get interrupted by random encounters. For some it's possible to spam the ENTER key in order to pass them fastly, but for the later ones that option goes down the drain.Picture this: I am happily strolling down a dungeon, thinking of how to reach the end, I see the layout and think of the best path to take.... and all of a sudden.... BAM! A RANDOM ENCOUNTER. These things can take 5+ minutes. You have to concentrate, think of your best powers to use, look at your MP, HP and stats, look at the monsters' stats and so on. You get so involved it the fight that when you finish, you completely forgot where the hell you were going and forgot your plan completely.So you set off again, walk a bit, find the way and BAM! AGAIN A RANDOM ENCOUNTER. This repeats 30 times, making you walk the same path 30 times, seeing the same thing over and over and over(x27) again. This is not fun, it completely ruined the game for me. Exploration is out of the question in this game. I cannot enjoy the look of the dungeon even, if the gameplay constantly gets interrupted by random encounters.That is why I don't recommend the game and I am sorry I bought it (only for 31 cents, but even free I wouldn't have played it if I knew how bad it was). It's a shame really because the game does everything else fine.			"

												This isn't an actual reviewim ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I'm trying to write a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing speech for school, but OH LOOK, there's no data. So I guess I'll spend a couple of hours searching until I finally find a very not trustworthy source, but fuuuuuck it, who even cares at this point. So I take it, but guess what??? That sure isn't the only data I need. And this isn't some well known ♥♥♥♥ that takes a couple of seconds to look up, this is obscure ♥♥♥♥, so you will asbolutely NOT have an easy time finding ♥♥♥♥. So I Google this new thing to find a certain percentage of whatever, and whaddya know, instead of getting the actual total number I'm looking for, I get ♥♥♥♥ing billions of ""TOP TEN DISEASES NOT YET CURED! YOU WONT BELIEEVE THIS!"" which is ♥♥♥♥ing cancer. But I keep searching, cause I need good grades to get a job I wont hate. So I keep scrolling, until eventually I find something. I click the link, and after reading through a ♥♥♥♥ing library of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I finally get to the conclusion, which says ""the answer is, we don't know..."". So I ♥♥♥♥ing lose my ♥♥♥♥ and realize I need to calm myself down somehow. And look at that, the next article is BUZZFEED. Now, I dunno about your thoughts about Buzzfeed, but I ♥♥♥♥ing despise them. So I decide to go on there and just trash talk Buzzfeed on the Buzzfeed website to raise my spirits a little bit. But oh yeah, you need an account for this ♥♥♥♥. So I abandon my morals and try to make an account, and notice I said try. Because nope, it won't let me. It said ""you have now made your account"", and I was so ready, but then I had to login again for ♥♥♥♥ing who knows what reason, and it just said ""please input a real username and password"", as to mock the living ♥♥♥♥ out of me. So ♥♥♥♥ing Buzzfeed has managed to tilt me even more, and now I find myself in a situation where I will spew literal fire if I don't get to vent somewhere, and this was the first place to come to mind. I'm better now though, thanks for reading. I've only played the game for like 3 minutes or something like that though, so I dunno ♥♥♥♥ about it.			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World is an interesting game.On the outside it looks like a simple turn-based rpg trying to copy classic rpgs like Dragon Quest, but with much more cheesier and non-proffesional graphics.But this game is a gem. On the inside it all comes together to make a very entertaining game.It has several innovations: Everytime your character levels you get to choose the improvement the character gets, you can only fight a certain amount of monsters in an area before you stop randomly encounter any more(with a option to keep fighting if you want), you get combo points for hitting enemies over time which you can then use on special moves to do large amounts of damage which when combined with the fact enemies get stronger every turn means each battle goes by pretty fast.Long story short, if you like old rpg games like Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy then this is a good buy, especially with the cheap price and being bundled with a similar game.

												I don't want to write a negative review, as this game looks very promising, yet that is all. It LOOKS promising. I wouldn't know, as I wasn't able to play it. Everytime I launched, the game would initiate into it's cinematic backstory, and then right after the slide that says Cthulhu will return, the game stops working. I don't know if other people are having this problem, or not, but until then I can't tell anyone in good concious to buy this.			"

												Both of these games uses the battle displays from ancient rpgs, think Earthbound, Shin Megami Tensei, or a numbered Phantasy Star (not online, the original games). Both of them rely on pretty decent jokes, although Cthulhu, being the second game they made, takes the ham way higher, and as a result is mostly funnier. Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.The game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.Although if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.In all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade,  ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.

												You get to play as Cthulhu.That's the only pro, and its just barely a pro, since that also means that you can be defeated, which...well...defeated Cthulhu's ideal purpose (which is to say, a mental assalant that cannot be killed and is barely seen. I'm very defensive over this as this game to me does Cthulhu wrong. Yes, there is a way to do him right and many games do it, but this one doesn't.)Behold: its an 8-bit game. More and more I'm starting to find this art style to be absolutely lazy. You got games like No Mans Sky that exists with its amazing colors but this one? This one settles for blocks.Right so its alot like Earthbound Zero.EBZ is very very hard, and is an RPG.CSTW is very very hard, and is an RPG. So whats the big deal? Well, at least in EBZ there's a clear ""hey you're not ready for this area"" line, in the form of the town Snowman, where you get terrifically powerful Wolves that you can't kill. Its its own area, right? But CSTW is like ""hey look you were fighing level 2's in this cave system, so here's a level 8 enjoy""However, and this where the differences start: EBZ has a great story.This one does not.It came bundled with a second RPG in the same art style that I refuse to look at.Lovecraft fan or no, give this one a miss.4/10			"

												This JRPG doesn't really do anything of value; while it does include some anti-frustration features, and pushes the difficulty curve fairly high, unfortunately on the whole the game is pretty much rote and boring; the storyline is weak, the game tries too hard to be funny and falls flat as a result, and it breaks the fourth wall constantly with very weak breaking-the-fourth-wall humor. An all around meh from me; you've played many better JRPGs, and there are many better games out there. This isn't worth your time.			"

												this is very similar to Breath of Death but with a few new features- you can fly and teleport around the world and swap around which characters are active per fight.  They've also improved the graphics a little, but the story and characters just aren't as good as Breath of Death's.  Wandering around a quirkily rebuilt post-apocalyptic world with a girl ghost hopelessly enamored with a mute depressive skeleton was more fun than this game's cascade of pop horror/cat owner references and boring protagonist.As with Breath of Death, there are a lottttt of pointless battles and exploring that are a pain to get through.  But my biggest gripe is that while Breath of Death's boss battles were fantastic and the one really enjoyable part of that game, Cthulhu's bosses are lame.  It's very easy to build one set of characters for disabling/aoes (for trash mobs) and another set for groups heals/combo builds (for bosses), which (at least on Medium) made every single fight in the game a breeze.

												Painfully cheesy dialog.  Ho-hum level design and battle system.  Mildly charming and interesting artwork.  Overall, nothing special about this old school JRPG except a kinda neat level up mechanic where each level the player is presented with a choice that affects character progression.  For example, choose between gaining a lightning spell that does light damage to 3 random enemies or a lightning spell that does heavy damage to one enemy.  Played through about 40% of the game before I quit from boredom.			"

												Nothing makes Lovecraft roll in his grave more than this game. I got it, expecting it to actually be clever, but soon found myself wallowing in misery and disappointment. It's supposed to be humorous, but the humor boils down to making silly faces and putting Cthulhu into only mildly ridiculous situations. There's a bit of fourth wall humor, but it's far from adroit. In addition, his out of character reactions only left me cringing. This is a god who makes people insane just by being seen, but here we have him idly chatting with mermaids. It's not funny, it's a failure to draw comedy from an emasculated creature of pure destruction. It's saddening that the only way they could conceive of a Lovecraftian comedy was to completely change the very fabric of what the elder gods are. The only relation this game actually has to Lovecraft's works is in name alone. You could name all of the characters and places differently, it would still be the same game.Gameply-wise, it's as bare bones as an RPG can get. There are no mechanics we haven't seen since the 80's. Every battle can be won by mashing the fight button, and there's a good chance you won't have to grind either. Some of the maps are too long, and the encounter rate will have you groaning over the tedium of having fought this same enemy fifty times in the past twenty minutes. I explored most (I say most because toward the end I just wanted to finish and be done with it) of this game's maps, and there are very few secrets to encounter. In fact, there's very little to the game besides the main quest. There's a few game modes to unlock, but I haven't bothered playing them because of how soul crushing the main game is.If you're an appreciator of Lovecraft's work, or if you think comedy should be witty, or if you like innovative RPG mechanics, this is not the game for you. You're better off spending your money on a hamburger, at least it won't leave you starving and depressed.			"

												Cthulhu Saves the World is an old-school JRPG, and by old school, I mean they ditch all modern innovations, ideas and sensibilities the have accumulated over the years. Which is the point, sure, but it just doesn't add up to much these days, unfortunately. The quirky humour occasionally hits its mark and the characters are, at first, a bit more interesting than the usual JRPG trope characters. However, there doesn't seem to be any more to them except the very superficial quirkiness.Gameplay is the usual old-school JRPG stuff. That is grind. Lots of monotonous grind. In the most baffling design decision I've encountered in a while, your party is completely healed after a won battle, but your mana is not restored. It might not sound so bad, until you realise that without Techs and Magics, your party is consistently and constantly getting beaten. So now you either: A) have to backtrack to a place where you can restore your mana orB) win fights without using mana. Which is not happening, not after the first area or so.Granted, the ability to save anywhere and start random fights almost anytime from the party meny are appreciated, but in the end you still feel like you are wasting your time. The jokes, characters and settings are interesting enough to hold your interest for an hour or two, but eventually the monotony of the gameplay and the frustration of the difficulty curve eat away at your enjoyment.

												This game was painfull to play. I sort of expected that from the price and screenshots but I thought I would give it a shot anyway and I was sourly disapointed. I got to level 20 by spamming the enter key during all fights, speaking of the fights they have tried to do the same thing as Pokemon (And I'm sure a lot of other RPGs) Where all you need to do is walk to find a fight. But who wants to spam the enter key 50 times, every 30 seconds of playing a game? At least in Pokemon you had to walk in long grass... All the dungeons look exactly the same and the whole layout of everything (Menus, battlescreen layout and anything that you need to interact with at all really), are a mix of pointlessness and confusion. I mean, why is ""Chat"" an option on the main menu? It would make sence if it was an online rpg, but all it triggers is the same conversation with an npc/party member, over and over again. Don't get me wrong I could never make a game at all and for that i respect the efforts that must of gone into this game, but it just wasn't fun to play. At all. I disliked the whole half an hour that i played this. I wanted to find quality in this game but when I couldn't I decided to look into other games of the same producer and I found that ""Breath of Death"" was almost exactly the same. The same layouts, the same everything with an exception to a few different enimes and npcs. I was pretty much playing the same game, so it gets a strong No from me. Do not recommend.			"

												I'm a funny guy. I tell all my friends all the time the trending jokes ((also known as memes to the initiated) my wife's son talks about. I heard of 'Lovecraft' a little bit ago. Strange folks, those Lovecraft writers. Anyway, I thought this 'Cthulhu' was supposed to be a monster? How is he going to save a world? This game's plot is seven kinds of wacky, and I think this stab at 'random' humor is supbar at best. He's not even a monster. He's some little pokemon thing. Next time you want to honor Robert E. Howard's literary works, aka, the 'Lovecraft' genre, do it some justice. This isn't even a horror game! I tried to move onto the beach but kept getting killed by snakes? That's stupid.			"

												Don't let the title or the picture fool you the very first time you gave this a glance. This game is AWESOME!It is very clear that the makers of this game have spent significant amount of effort into what this game is today. Not only is the playthrough well-thought out, several features such as the ""No random battles"" after you have done a stipulated number of them is a genius addition to the old-school RPG genre the likes of earlier FFs. Another feature here is the streamlined levelling system that allows player to easily understand and still make relevant choices in building their character. Along with that will be the reward/detriment effects that come into play should the battle be prolong. All of these, inter-alia, are solid design choices that separates this game apart from the rest.Coupled that with funny dialogues, characters and a multitude of monsters you come accross throughout your jouney is simply remarkable. With a small price tag that also gives a bonus RPG that is itself a stellar addition to any RPGer, this game has definitely exceeded my expectations.If you are not a fan of old-school RPGs, that leaves you 99% of the time looking at pixelated towns, characters, monsters however, do not expect this game to be otherwise. If you are one however, not having this is simply ftaghn! Get one right away !8.5/10			"

Evil Cthulhu wants to destroy the world, he finally wakes up after centuries of sleep, but a strange sorcerer defeats him and strips him from his power.To regain his powers, he must become a real hero.I am not that really fan of RPG's though i have finished some, not too many, i loved the mechanics of this one, the dialogues are quite fun too, decent graphics and fun little soundtrack, and i just played it for a bit.Definetly the first RPG ill finish in the last 7-8 years.

												Fan's of the old Dragon Quest and Phanasty Star games rejoice! And even if you haven't played them, this is a very fun and easy to understand game. It has great RPG elements, an easy leveling system, a good story, and great humor. You'll find yourself chuckling more than once at this game's quirky take on the God of Insanity. And even after you complete the story, there are plenty of bonuses and collectables to play and get. I haven't played it's counterpart, Breath of Death, but if it's anything like this game, which I have a feeling it is, it'll be a real fun time. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants hours of fun.			"

												Cthulhu Saves The World is basically Breath of Death VII with a Lovecraftian theme, some minor gameplay additions to add depth, an expanded scope, and some bonus modes. This might sound like a negative statement, but I view it as a positive one. Breath of Death VII's forumla wasn't broken, so there was no need to try and fix it. Once again, the combat is quick but challenging, all the classic JRPG elements show up to be satirized, and the writing and humor take center stage. And most importantly, it executes all of these things well. When you consider that this is in a double pack with Breath of Death VII for a mere $3 when it's not on sale, there's no excuse for not taking a chance on this game. Must-buy.Two final thoughts:1. Bring on Cosmic Star Heroine2. I'm not afraid to admit that I have a crush on October.			"

												I liked this game - another Steam Sale gem.It is reminiscent of the old Zelda and early adventure based 2D games.The dialogue is funny  - you are Cthulu, who is trying to become a hero so he can regain his dark powers back from a wizard. You start out on your quest and pick up random party members along the way. (Umi even has a crush on you)Each area has a specific amount of ""fights"" that you must win to clear and continue. (Lobsterats!)As you level up you are provided with two choices on stats upgrades so you have a very basic way to guide how you want your character to progress.Overall, it was fun and witty without a lot of stress.

												CStW certainly gives a bang for your buck; at a mere $3 when not on sale, I can easily recommend it for it's humor (and if you so desire - challenge). You play as Cthulhu, stripped of his dark powers by a mysterious foe. The only way to regain them? Perform great heroic deeds. So begins the misadventures of Cthulhu and his colorful band of misfits you pick up (or groupies as I took to calling them). The game itself is not demanding on your hardware, as one might expect from a retro RPG. The combat is fluid, simple, and rewards your choices - on higher difficulties it can be utterly unforgiving, reminiscent of much older games. And as I’ve said, the game has a great sense of humor about itself. Personally, I found myself compelled to continue playing solely to see what the next joke may be. Grade: B. A solid game that will last you anywhere from 5 to 9 hours on the first campaign, with a few extras to boot. Humor and Combat are it's strong points; the plot is a parody more than anything.			"

												Overall I felt that Cthulhu Saves the World is a weaker game than Breath of Death VII. Zeboyd's first game was more of a genre parody of JRPGs, while Cthulhu feels like a Lovecraft parody that happens to take the form of a JRPG - and not a very strong parody at that. It's silly Lovecraft, and not a clever overturning of Lovecraft's themes and conventions (like Breath of Death was for JRPGs). But that doesn't mean it's not funny and enjoyable. The fast levelling and combat did a good job of keeping me engaged, and the game is that kind that's short in a good way, so that it doesn't overstay its welcome.

												Fantastic little RPG! It's packed full of fun characters and environments, with an enjoyable battle system and level-up system to boot! Its presentation is great too with appealing graphics and some great SNES-era style music. In addition to all this, the game has great replay value with various difficulty levels and game modes, and some other neat features such as character bromides, a bestiary and a full developer commentary. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the exceptional writing in this game. Most RPGs fall flat on their face when attempting humour. Cthulu Saves the World is one of the only RPGs I've played that succeeds at being funny, even hilarious at times, with well-written dialogue and great comedic timing.For only £1.99 or less (I got it for 50p in a sale) there's really no reason not to own this game. I really can't recommend this one enough. Pick up Breath of Death while you're at it.			"

												Harking back to the yesteryear of the early 90's, Cthulhu Saves the World is a 2D RPG that comically parodies the age old genre while faithfully remaining true to its roots as well. An indepth leveling system combined with luscious 2D pixel art go well with the tongue in cheek styled humor of the antithetic Cthulhu who has been placed in the titular role as a ""true hero"" (against his will, of course). Along the way, he'll come across unlikely allies that will join him in his journey to save the world...only to destroy it with madness upon regaining his stolen power.I bought this in a bundle with Breath of Death VII for only $3. However, that deal may expire soon. Even still, this game is well worth the asking price of a measly 3 bucks and a true treat to any that yearn for a RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously or wishes to go back to the 90's, if only for just a little while.

												This game is a for sure buy for anyone who loves the old 16 bit style rpg's and also for those who have a great sense of humor! I would say overall I would rate this game a 9.5/10 its that good! The story is pretty good for a indie game and the combat system is very much like the old school games. The graphics are beautifully done for a 16 bit game and it reminds me of many rpgs from the snes! The soundtrack is also supurb it makes me want to keep playing even when I know i have to stop. This games dificulty is just right thats all I can really say about that since there really is nothing to discuss. The characters are funny unique and interesting and how they react to the things happening always gets me laughing!			"

												Fantastic little RPG! It's packed full of fun characters and environments, with an enjoyable battle system and level-up system to boot! Its presentation is great too with appealing graphics and some great SNES-era style music. In addition to all this, the game has great replay value with various difficulty levels and game modes, and some other neat features such as character bromides, a bestiary and a full developer commentary. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the exceptional writing in this game. Most RPGs fall flat on their face when attempting humour. Cthulu Saves the World is one of the only RPGs I've played that succeeds at being funny, even hilarious at times, with well-written dialogue and great comedic timing.For only £1.99 or less (I got it for 50p in a sale) there's really no reason not to own this game. I really can't recommend this one enough. Pick up Breath of Death while you're at it.			"

												This and Breath of Death VII are two games that demonstrate an absolutely simple but at the same time revolutionary concept for JRPGs and gaming in general that I think more big time companies and other indie developers should take up on while still making games of the calibur they do now.In short, I speak of shortness, but not being cut off. A game that doesn't ramble, but tells its story and gives plenty of stuff to do along the way without feeling rushed. Cthulhu Saves the World does this within each of its campaigns but provides plenty of enjoyable replayability in its multiple game modes, unlockable content, simple on the surface but deep under the skin combat systems and absolutely -awesome- wit and charm. And to think, this is a game about an Old God trying to regain the ability to destroy the world and he's the protagonist! Maddness :O			"

												Play as everyones favorite Lovecraftian god on a quest to presumably eat everything in this cheeky homage/parody (homarody?) of 16 bit era RPGs. Overworld gameplay is reminiscent of Final Fantasy 4+5 whereas the battle system is from first-person perspective, ala Dragon Quest and Earthbound. The game is pretty much set for the sake of speedily getting through battles rather than focus on cinematic 3D nonsense with overlong special moves and junk (I'm looking at you as if I were some disappointed yet still encouraging teacher, Final Fantasy 7), which is definitely a plus since the game's quirky humor and characters are quite enjoyable.

												This is a pretty bomb-♥♥♥ game.  At first glance it doesn't seem like much more than a mildly cute JRPG/Lovecraft parody, but once you get playing it reveals itself to have some pretty awesome mechanics that you don't see in your average RPG.The battle system is the main thing I want to talk about.  Functionally, it's a straightforward turn-based system a la Dragon Warrior, but some standout tweaks turn the battles from ""standard grind"" to ""every battle is a fight to the death.""  Enemies are generally capable of dealing out significant damage, and they grow stronger with every successive turn, pushing you to try and find the quickest way to dispatch them before your characters get wiped out.  The inevitably heavy damage would be almost unbearable in any other game, but CSTW balances it out by restoring your characters' HP to full at the end of every battle so you can get on to your next near-death experience.Character builds are somewhat unconventional, as well.  Rather than simply picking up stat gains with each new level, each character gains one or more new abilities that either grant them stat boosts or a power to use in battle.  Very often, the game lets you choose between two similar abilities, allowing you to customize the character's skillset toward your playing style while keeping true to their theme.  These aren't your old-school Dragon Quest spells, either - while some will feel familiar, I can't say that any other game has let me pelt my enemies with starfish or drive them insane with the caress of my noodly appendages.The Insanity mechanism is an interesting gimmick, as well.  At its core Insanity is just another status ailment, but where it differs from its predecessors is that the effects vary from monster to monster.  Some weaken under its influence, while others simply grow more vicious, and you won't know which enemy types have which response until you've already driven them insane.All in all, the graphics and jokes are a bit hokey, but the gameplay and general silliness make it well worth a playthrough.

												This is a pretty short humorous rpg.  But it has a lot of replay value various difficulty modes, with bonus stuff like Playing through as a different character, playing through at lowest possible level(only fights you get into are mandatory ones), and a super hard optional boss near the end that would make the final boss wet his pants, even in easy mode, etc.  If you like old school classic with a twist, this is a must buy. You can't go wrong with two games for 2.99(Breath of Death VII is included with it and it is very much alike.), which is very cheap even though it is not on sale.			"

												While the game itself may be considered short, or simplified by some, that is simply not the whole story. Cthulhu Saves the World is the quintessential RPG, in compressed format. While it may be shorter in terms of length (and due to the ability to run, and the fast scrolling text), it is indeed a complete RPG from start to finish. It is humorous, has a solid base of systems, and provides all of the satisfaction of a more drawn-out rpg, in less time. All in all, a fine investment of time and money.			"

												Very fun, albeit simple and very linear turn based RPG. There really aren't any special missions, mini-games, crafting, or other, later RPG game elements, but that doesn't mean this is bad. What this game does have over others is its uniqueness that I've yet to see, if not just heard about, in other games:When you arrive at a new area you have a number of potential random battles to be fought. Once you fight them all you don't have to worry about getting harassed any more! But, if you so choose, you can always instantly get into a fight with enemies, regardless of that ""battles remaining"" number. This is helpful if you needed to level grind a bit, for example.Winning a fight against your enemies instantly heals your full party to max health. That seems odd at first, but there are definitely a TON of very strong enemies that can kill you from full health very easily. You do NOT, however, restore your mana fully, but only to a very small extent. The mana is a much bigger deal because you primarily use ""skills"" and ""magic"" more than you would on basic attacks, which tends to be the common thing in older turn based RPGs.Branching level ups is a fun system that is somewhat in other RPGs, but more so seen as a type of ""skill tree"" that you see instead, and thus you can't remove and reallocate any point. It's interesting forcing your mage type characters into a fighter role sometimes, for example. The game definitely offers a variety of physical and magical attacks for each character, too, regardless of their normal intended archetype.That's really it, for the most part. There are secret dungeons, which is always a nice thing to have, and the other few unique game aspects, some of which I may have forgotten at the moment, but the game is hands down a great purchase, fully surpassing the ""bang for your buck"" considering the price tag of $3 which also gives you Breath of Death VII to go along with it.

												Plays like a early final fantasy RPG, I think. One might say that the characters are one dimensional and not illustrated well, that gameplay is grindy and that every area is a freaking maze. Or, one might enjoy the satirical humor of the different characters, take screenshots of the hilarious signs, gravestones, and drawers, or get a kick out of different ways to build the characters (there is a physical and magic split for almost every character, and the physical path for the ladies is OP.) The game can be quite long (10+ hours), and grinding through the mazes does get tiresome, I do admit. However, you might enjoy playing through the main story and the extra modes if you feel like replaying through an old school RPG.			"

												Madness and Glory to the great Cthulhu! Cthulhu Saves The World is an excellent, quiet well designed game that is a definite throwback to 'old-school' RPGs while being quite accessible to new players. I certainly enjoyed it, and if you can get in the double pack alongside Breath of Death VII it's a steal. Only problem I found was that the dungeons were far too long and confusing, and you might be put off in trying to complete some of them. Still, the particular mechanic of having a limited amount of mandatory dungeon battles is practically a(n old)godsend as it allows gamers of different types to approach dungeons how they wish, to a certain extent. If you can take your time with the game, it will reward you. The director's commentary is always a nice treat as well. Pros: Solid Humor, references to RPGs and Lovecraft aplenty, large world to explore, good variety of foesCons: Long, somewhat steep difficulty, dungeon design confusingly, MADDENINGLY tedious.Overall: 4/5			"

												Cthulhu is a parody that manages to succeed not only with its humor but also with its gameplay.  It manages to capture the essence of old school JRPGs while avoiding some of their pitfalls.  It's got the music, the graphics, and the interface that we all remember, but with the added bonus of capping random encounters in an area.  Leveling and encounters are fast, without fiddly little things that can bog a game down.  Besides that, you can't beat the price.  Hours of fun for less than a dollar - sign me up!			"

												I personally do not know much about Lovcraftian lore, save what I have gleaned from an alll-night session of Arkham Horror with friends. Prior knowledge is not needed to enjoy this game though, important information (Cthuhlu is an elder god who cares little as to the fates of humans) is quickly explained and then pushed to the side as the jokes roll in. Four chapters in so far, and the laughter has not subsided. They come in the conversations between party members, the descriptions of the enemies, and in the insanity bestowed upon ones' enemies. The gameplay is a fairly simple turn-based RPG, with options chosen from a menu. The story is simple too: Cthuhlu is leading a bumbling (or maybe I'm the bumbler?) group of adventurers in order to become a hero so he may regain the power to destroy the earth. Currently it is less than a dollar due to the steam sale, but I believe it is worth the mere three-dollar full price. Zeboyd Games have created a delightful game that will keep a player entertained for as long as one is playing it.			"

												Bought it on sale for no particular reason, but honestly it's worth every cent, full price. Basically it's a typical low-bit turnbased RPG, starring Chtulhu. The storyline doesn't make much sense but it's very good build and detailed. The characters do have some depth in the story and the level-system is quite interesting as you can choose your level-up bonusses which consist of stat boosts or abilities, giving the game an extra replay-value. If you're experienced with turnbased RPGs the game will be rather easy to understand and it'll be a fast playthrough. But even for experienced players it can provide a challenge. - Only bad thing I can say is the lacking of achievements, which for some might be a small buzzkill. Not for me though!			"

												This game is in the style of NES-era Final Fantasy and RPGs of that ilk from the 8-bit era, and is quite faithful to the spirit of the those early console games. It features the same interface as 'Breath of Death VII' but with slightly different gameplay; 'Cthulhu' seeming to have a higher frequency of meandering pathways and passages, and resultingly being somewhat laborious. I definitely prefer 'Breath of Death VII' for the gameplay, but I have to say 'Cthulhu' does have some pretty good schtick for a genre send-up. Still, a fun game. Verdict: [ 7 / 10 ]			"

												Overall I felt that Cthulhu Saves the World is a weaker game than Breath of Death VII. Zeboyd's first game was more of a genre parody of JRPGs, while Cthulhu feels like a Lovecraft parody that happens to take the form of a JRPG - and not a very strong parody at that. It's silly Lovecraft, and not a clever overturning of Lovecraft's themes and conventions (like Breath of Death was for JRPGs). But that doesn't mean it's not funny and enjoyable. The fast levelling and combat did a good job of keeping me engaged, and the game is that kind that's short in a good way, so that it doesn't overstay its welcome.

												A very good funny game, for a buck this was kinda fun. It was definitely a humerous game and the gameplay wasn't bad but it was a bit tedious. I really dislike having enemies that randomly attack you every five seconds. Plus its a different system of play as you should be more focused on how to do the most damage to enemies in the fastest way possible or you don't get enough rewards after. Plus 2 of the side characters you get are almost completely useless which is kinda lame. Still, for the buck I paid I'd say it was worth it even for the tedious moments.			"

												To me this game was only playable on 'Easy' because it does not feel balanced at all on the other settings, and it plays like a rogue-like even though it is not actually marketed as one, and so if you want a new rogue-like game you should look into this. I like that you can play with a controller and that you can save at any point. The storyline was quite cool. I highly recommend having a pre-mission backup save reserved, with all your consumable items unused. There is virtually no loot in each level and therefore you won't find any additional healing items apart from what you are already carrying going into the level. One thing I really did not like about the game was that it occasionally sends these boss-type enemies at you, with huge amounts of health. Apart from that an 'OK' game, certainly worth the currently low price.Post-edit: oops, this was supposed to be a recommended game (with a caveat), thanks for commenting - it made me aware of it by looking at my review.

Sure, you'll buy it for the humor, the Lovecraftian references, etc, but I think you'll truly enjoy the gameplay, the batte system, the various character powers -- the whole thing! Personally, I'm not as high on the writing as other reviewers, but it's fairly clever and still worth a chuckle here or there. Fun concept? Check! Executed well (rather than the fun concept being an excuse to produce a crappy game)? Check! Get this game -- especially for the ridiculously low price!			"

												Do you like Lovecraftian stories and funny puns? Are you up to find all the hidden jokes of this game? Bought this game for 1€, best one ever spent. The combat system is fairly simple, yet combat itself is often a challenge when facing bosses. Choose one out of two lvl-up boni when gaining lvls, become a menacing fighter, a powerful sorcerer or a generalist. Cthulu saves the Worl is a great game, that makes me wish I had paid more for it.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. It cuts right into that nostalgic part of your heart, without coming across as hokey. It captures all the redeeming elements of the 16-bit RPG and makes them whole. There's also something quite Pratchett about the humour. All very over the top and wonderfully meta in moments. The HP Lovecraft references are fully fledged, no half measures.			"

												Another humorous gem from these developers. Even if you're terrible at turn-based RPGs, you should drop in to play just for the silly writing. Who knew that Cthulhu was the most protagonistic antagonist humanity would ever have to deal with?For those more concerned with gameplay mechanics, you'll find a rather tactical turn-based and combo building system. Each level up matters a lot, so think before you pick a particular upgrade path. On higher difficulties, things will become frustrating if you didn't psychically choose the upgrade paths that the developers made mandatory, so don't feel bad about playing on something lower than the most hardcore of options for this game.

												I bought this game for 50 cents on the Winter Sale mostly from money I got selling extra seasonal trading cards.  And let me just say: Underpriced.  Any game where the characters routinely talks to the narrator and has an enemy with an outfit made almost entirely out of belts is a good game in my opinion.  It even had a second game included after you beat the first one called ""Cthulhu's Angels.""  A lot of people like to talk about if they could forget the game and go back and play it again, that they would.  Well, Cthulhu's Angels lets you do that.  It is mostly the same maps and paths, but with new characters, dialogue, Narrator bashing, and even a new story while holding true to Cthulhu's drive to be a True Hero.  Only better because it involves an all female cast.The only drawback is the lack of achievements, so I didn't know if I was done with the game or not.  But that isn't enough  to bring it down from the only rating that it deserves:10/10			"

												Extreme humor and no 4th wall to speak of, Cthulhu Saves The World, along with Breath Of Death VII, are some of the most FUN RPGs available on Steam right now. I mean it. Cthulhu, the embodiement of evil, rises from the sea after aeons of slumber to finally destroy the world... only to find out someone was already expecting him, and loses all of his mythical powers. He wants to destroy the world, but to do it, he must first recover his powers... by saving the world!Aesthetics of old, with a modern twist. Story is as great as it's absurd, it manages to improve on the classic gameplay. You'll really wish they had these simple - yet effective - features back then: they managed to COMPLEMENT the experience without disrupting it, not even a tiny bit. Oh, this also applies to Breath of Death VII.Comes with a bonus campaign (unlocked after you finish the normal game) with an entirely different take on the original story, ""Cthulhu's Angels"": what happens when the main character already knows the story (since you finished the game with him) and is just too lazy to go through it again? Everything derails into a fight for control over their own DESTINY.Definitely recommend. But play Breath Of Death VII first.			"

												I didn't think Cthulu Saves the World would suck me in like it did.  The concept seemed a bit novel to me, an old school snes style rpg with Cthulu as the hero.  And the game was so cheap, I figured what the hell.  And I loved it.  From the very beginning the game pulled me in and I didn't want to stop playing.  It was funny, the characters were cool, I liked the overarcing plot, all the Lovecraft references, all the references to old school RPG's, the little facts about the enemies as you fight them, the ability to clear an area of enemies, the counter to let you know how many are left, the button that lets you just start a battle so you can easily level up your characters.  I loved this game from beginning to end.  There is no reason this shouldn't be in every steam owners collection.  Even if you think you won't like it give it a shot.  It's so cheap you're not really going to lose out on much if you don't like it.  Although I honestly wouldn't be able to understand why someone wouldn't love this game.			"

												The Good: Great use of the license, funny dialog, amazing music, varied graphics and environments, lots of attacks to learn and party members to findThe Bad: Graphics grate on your eyes after awhile, gets very hard, random battles bring the experience down a lot, doesn’t require much strategy to win battlesThe Cthulhu series from H.P. Lovecraft hasn’t seen much love in the form of games, but indie developers Zeboyd picked it up and turned it into a whimsical/parody 8 bit RPG and it’s done very well. You play as Cthulhu and pick up many party members along the way, but the whole point of the game is the great dungeon crawling that harkens back to the 80′s. You can attack like any RPG, but you have Tech attacks which are more powerful, magic, and then you can Unite with other members to combine devastating attacks. There are a ton of different attacks you learn when you level up, and you get a choice between two different things to level up with either stats or an attack, so by the end of the game each member has a huge arsenal to use.The game is very close to the mythology with bosses that are from the story, towns named after the exact towns from the stories, plus the art style matches. The music is amazing with sweeping orchestral scores (in 8-bit midi audio mind you) that really moves you and sounds great. The story is hilarious with Cthulhu trying to redeem himself and become a true hero to raise his city of R’lyeh, but his interaction with characters in the world is really funny. Of course the game wouldn’t be complete without a huge over map to explore that has some secret dungeons, plus the environments and dungeons vary with lots of loot and chests to find.However, the game’s biggest flaw is the extreme difficulty later on in the game, as well as the constant random battles which really drag the experience down. The devs tried toning this down by disabling random battles after you do 25 of them, but you will probably go through a dungeon before you hit that number. I also didn’t like how if you don’t level up high enough the end boss is impossible to beat, but each dungeon just really racks up the difficulty and requires you to grind a bit to get through the dungeon. I also didn’t like how you don’t really need a strategy to beat the enemies because you can just use the same one over and over through several dungeons. This causes the feeling of repetition to set in and makes you want the game just to end a little faster.While the visuals are nice and give you a feeling of nostalgia they don’t look good in HD and the lack of battle animations, and everything that goes along with 8-bit graphics grates on your eyes after awhile. However, the Cthulhu license is rarely explored so any game to do so is welcomed, but this game is probably for hardcore RPG fans.--Score: 8/10			"
