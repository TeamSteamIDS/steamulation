												Uninspired grind grind grind grind.  After a few hours of almost nothing but killing goblins, boars and bears I'm giving up.  I have no clue what the point of the story is supposed to be, what the world is, why I should care, and my character is already level 10.  Maybe it gets better later on, but I couldn't bring myself to kill the same dozen infinite-respawning bears again and again to find out.			"

YouTube™ Video: Ravensword: Shadowlands - RPG Indie Game 

			Views: 5,211		

			Ravensword is known as one of the biggest and greatest RPG games on smart phone devices. Does the PC port hold up with it's updated graphics, control scheme and price point?		

As of late we've seen more and more smartphone games get ported over to PC, with mixed results. This is because they're usually saturated in heavy microtransactions, which are very common on the smartphone marketplace. Rarely do we see a port and not see microtransactions, Ravensword: Shadowlands is one of these examples. The PC Port itself is a mixed bag; it improves its graphical fidelity with improved textures and post effects, re-bindable keys and an improved control scheme which is vastly superior to its smartphone counterpart. That’s where things end; the UI cannot be customised and is very clunky as it's made to be used with limited screen space. Everything in the menus can only be done through mouse clicks, leading to frustrations after continued use.Animations are clunky, actions feel unresponsive, combat and movement inputs override each other causing unrealistic actions, such as performing an attack followed up by a roll which shows a standing attack animation but you move as if you’re rolling. The RPG elements are very basic, all the talents, stats and gear are simple increase X or Y with no real flare to them, there are no tough options and it’s hard to see your character truly progress.For $15 it’s a hard sell, its smartphone equivalent is $7.50 and I think that price should carry over to the PC platform. While it does change and improve on its smartphone build, it falls a little short at its current price.Though it's currently on sale so it may be just what you're looking for even with all its faults. Play for a couple hours, have a laugh or two and move on.			"

												This is a difficult game to recommend for everyone, but it certainly has its audience, so let me start by saying:Ravensword: Shadowlands is a game for you if you: Are in the mood for a light, simplified RPG with limited customization and options Are not scared by less than stellar graphics Can tolerate a bit of grindingOn the other hand, if you are purist of the genre or have very high expectations, I would not recommend this game to you. You'll only get frustrated, or bored. And life is too short to be either.Ravensword: Shadowlands is a simple game, with simple aspirations. The world is built with thick, not too careful brush strokes, and the story follows the same pattern. Still, it works, and that's as much as you can ask of it. The gameplay is kind of barebones for an RPG, with a small skill tree where most branches aren't really needed. Also, you'll find places where difficulty spikes are big, seemingly to encourage longer playtimes.However, there are interesting ideas in the package. And the game is pretty optimized for a casual audience. The quests aren't overly long and can be easily followed, inventory management is reduced to a minimal expression (only weight can give you some problems from time to time) and the world is attractive enough to keep you engaged for the relatively modest amount of hours you need to dedicate to the game.I am recommending the game based on the premise at the beginning, and also because, for me, it filled a very simple place in my library: a simple distraction from more complicated games. Sometimes, that's exactly what's needed.			"

												A skyrim type experience for mobile games, but not worth any price for PC. It's hard to get a skyrim-type experience for your smartphone. This title does an excellent job at being that, but bringing it over to the PC was a mistake. Why the heck would you pay for this game, with sub-par gameplay, graphics, sound, length, and combat, when you could just go get skyrim. I'd definitely reccomend this on your andriod or Iphone. Your computer? No.			"

												What is this game with the generic fantasy RPG name?  - Shadowsword: Ravenlands- Swordlands: Ravenshadow- Landshadow: SwordravenThat last one sounds pretty cool.  A heroic raven with sword-like tallons darkens the lands with his terrifying shadow!Ravensword: ShadowlandsNote: The exact events have been slightly altered for the sake of sarcasm.The games starts with a cut scene, ""A great war has been raging in the north lands for centuries.""  [Very long awkward pause while the camera drifts over the landscape.] ""The dark elves have retreated to their last remaining fortress.""  [Another pause with the camera looking at a tower within a fortress.] ""The great mage summons his army to battle."" [A guy with a staff stands on a tower.  Super awkward pause.  More standing... A breeze makes the guy's cape slightly billow.  End of scene.]A soldier with a sword appears and I'm a bird [could it be a raven?!] flying over his right shoulder telling him what to do.  [Actually no, I'm not a bird.  I'm a flying camera.  The options are first person or awkward-over-the-shoulder first person.]  I enter the battle with sword swinging.  [Wow, combat is really clunky.  How do I hit things?  The elf has to be directly in front of me?  What's going on?!  Thankfully these 3 NPC soldiers can kill stuff.]  A big ugly troll enters the battle.  [These graphics a pretty ugly given how detailed they are... and it's not just the troll.]  I run away because I can't see what I'm doing ... The tower explodes in a small puff of fire and the cut scene tells me everyone is dead except one person.  [I wonder who that could be...]I awake in a room.  [Look it's me!]  There's a woman near the fireplace.  The scene goes exactly like every other scene where you awake with a woman in an RPG, which is notably different from the version seen in movies. [Wow, this woman is hideous!]  ""Clean yourself up.""  [I start fiddling with my face... like my hair, beard, jaw size and eye color.  I didn't see the plastic surgeon but he's got to be here somewhere.  Too bad he's not a very good one.  I can be super ugly or slightly more ugly with a painted on mullet and beard.  I choose the bald, shaven look.] I am now a member of their guild, which, with the addition of me, has 3 members in it. [So... this lady finds a random dude in a pile of dead bodies, brings him home, cares for him while he's unconscious and fills in his guild membership form noting his main attribute to be ""Not completely dead.""  I don't think I want to be in this guild.]I visit the guild leader, who is even more ugly... ""Blah, blah, go visit blacksmith.""I walk around the town talking to people who try to sell me things I can't afford.  At least the blacksmith is attractive, and by that I mean normal-looking.I'm sent off to visit a wizard in a cabin.I shoot a few boars by constantly running backwards and waiting for the boar to be right in front of me.I enter the cabin to find a tiny guy in a glass bottle with a stopper in it.  I'm amazed that he's a great wizard.  [This is evidenced by what must have transpired:  1) the dude shrunk himself, 2) he teleported inside a bottle that clearly has a neck too narrow for him, 3) he levitated a cork into the top of the bottle, and 4) he waited around in the bottle hoping someone would stop by to help him.]  He asks for my help to get him out of the bottle by collecting something from a nearby cave.Quit.Exit.Uninstall.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!There. I hope anyone scrolling through will realise that buying this game is a bad idea, let me explain why...First off, the game seems to have a nice charm to it. I got it in a humble bundle (April 2014) and got some suprisingly bad games with it, although some were ok. It reminded me of games I used to play when I was a child with its slightly poor graphics and mediocre AI, so starting off was a nice experience. The feeling was stripped from underneath me though however when the quests started. The quests don't tell you enough on how to get round and where to go, I ended up lost and confused. A lot of the time I would go into a place that was way too high of a level for a starting character, so in my genius, I googled what I had to do. But what came up shocked me. As I said previously, I bought this game on humble bundle so didn't buy this game individually or sit through the most arrogant of trailers. Because it turns out this game is a mobile port. Things began to make sense; This explained everything. I thought about reviewing this game for what it was before realising that it was not a mobile game: It was a steam game, so I shall review it as a steam game.The second thing that decided to creep out from its bug infested rock was the head bobbing. When holding nothing in your hand, to to auto holstering after time or unequiping the actual weapon, there is absolutely no head bobbing. However when you get a weapon out your head decided to go crazy, as if the character is headbanging with a anvil cellotaped to his head. When you draw an arrow the crosshair moves around steadily but still weirdly enough for it to be off putting. None of this is the case though on horseback. You can run about as you please without any bobbing and have perfect aim. Not a great start.This paragraph will be kindly donated to all the bugs I found after 2 hours of playtime, let's see, shall we?1. The title screen will sometimes not load any buttons 2. Arrows will sometimes stick to the bow and decide never to fire3. Axes and swords will stick sideways in the hand4. Arrows will clip through objects5. The sky will sometimes go completely black6. With a shiled equiped, It sometimes doesn't want to appear/ be usable7. Sometimes sounds will forget to play when using weapons8. Sometimes animations forget to play9. Sometimes runes don't do anything10. Some small obsticles cannot be jumped over although in third person it shows them going higher11. Some obsticles can be walked though completely (Trees, big rocks etc.)12. The shadow only shows the arms and weapons13. The loading screen plays bow sound effects14. With a bow equiped, after a loading screen your bow appears to be drawn but isn't15. Enemies can get stuck on small objects until you look away from themNot sure if these are bugs...1. Blunderbuss will have a fiery sound effect whilst reloading2. Blunderbuss also creates a fireball whilst reloading3. NPCs will only speak their first line of dialogue and use text for the rest4. The axes hit range is crazily high5. The character cannot move for around a second after they are hit whereas the enemies can6. When swimming, third person shows your head below water, first person shows it above7. The fire rune has shown no difference to using nothing to me8. The head bobbing I spoke about earlier9. ALL THE FLAGS WAVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS10. Some chimneys have fire coming out of the top11. Teleporting to a place on the map will sometimes take you to the other side of the place that you clicked12. The only way of a horse is to change the camera view and then the horse disappears The game seems to be copying greatly of Skyrim and I want to judge it against that because Skyrim basically owns this market anyway. I will some up everything about. Graphically it is okay and i am sure it could benefit from a HD graphics mod but I am still okay with the graphics. The sound, despite buggy, was quite nice. Grinding for XP and money was way to easy but levels didn't make enemies any easier to fight. After 15 minutes I had the highest level armour I could find (Despite the trailer showing better) and also the best bow and axe I could find, but my newly aquired levels didn't change much. Overall I am going to give this game 3.5/10 as It really didn't uphold any of my interest for long enough to see it get any better. I got this game and others for 60p but it is shocking a mobile port would ask for £12.			"

												-Generic RPG, don't know about tablets but PC Players have higher standards-The game is part of a series on tablets and it seems to be somewhat cheaper there too. Ravensword is generic, contains mostly empty non-detailed areas, boring fights and a lot of grinding - feels like a mmo without other players. Hidden extras, secrets and puzzles are non-existent (beside maybe a small cave or two). Exploring the landscape is ultimatively pointless. The music is ok, graphics are ugly. Open-world though you have to grind first to survive the higher-tier areas. Gameplay is absurd - you slay trolls and giants but the tiny crabs completely own you. Story and characters are forgettable. You're some male looking for a sword to slay a demon.Rather buy or play some more Skyrim (or Fallout or Baldur's Gate or Witcher or Isaac or Terraria or or or) and if you hate Skyrim you'll hate this game anyway. Ravensword is a waste of your playing time and money.			"

												OVERALL: 33%Gameplay & Controls: 2/5 ♥sGraphics & Visuals: 2/5 ♥sMusic & Audio: 1/5 ♥sIf I were to review Ravensword as a parody of the RPG genre, I would have to actually recommend it, as some facets of the game are so bad they're actually entertaining. However, seeing as this is a very serious attempt by Crescent Moon Games to break into the PC gaming enterprise, I have to give an honest review of the title, which is that this is the by far the most generic RPG I've ever played.-Gameplay & Controls-The gameplay is by far the area of the game with which I have the most qualms. Ravensword is essentially a hack and slash RPG, a tried and true formula, except in this iteration the hacking and slashing makes absolutely no sense as far as hit points go. While your first attack might take off 25% of a wild boar's health, your next strike will bring your foe down to zero, a skill for which I'm sure Robert Baratheon would have been most grateful. Yet all the clever Game of Thrones references in Westoros couldn't excuse just how imbalanced a fighting system exists in this game. Another aspect of the combat is the sneak system, which allows the player to get close to hostiles without disturbing them in order to land an attack for bonus damage or to steal items from enemies. However, the sneak system seemingly absorbs your character's energy at random; since energy is required for attacking and dodging, becoming invisible (oh, did I fail to mention that you inexplicably become invisible when sneaking?) might leave you questioning just what you can actually do now that you're hidden. Also, sneaks sometimes fail out of nowhere, disturbing your quarry and causing them to attack, and the best part is that the criteria that have to be met to cause this to happen aren't explained at all. So...thanks for that, Crescent Moon. I could also swear I've played about every quest in the story so far in one form or another in the other RPGs which reside in my library, which again brings up the issue of just how generic this game remains.-Graphics & Visuals-For the most part, the game looks like an oddly rendered MMO from the early 2000s, so if you're into playing that sort of thing solo and can handle the color pallet consistent with the rest of the series, you might actually enjoy Ravensword. Despite having improved textures when compared to its mobile counterpart, they don't provide an appealing atmosphere for a PC game; the outlandish and somewhat cartoonish buildings worked for its predecessors, but they don't work here. Also, I'm fairly certain the majority, if not all, of the NPCs are white. You're able to design your character's face, which allows for limited customization, although there are no feminine options so don't expect to play as a woman. You can give yourself Deadpool eyes for some reason, however, which I guess Crescent Moon thought was the next best thing.-Music & Audio-Ah, yes, the audio. Let's talk about the sound effects prevalent throughout Ravensword. The Prologue remains my favorite quest so far, as you start in the middle of a battlefield consisting of about ten people while the sounds of hundreds of screaming men and the clanging barrage of clashing steel assault your ears. That and the bizarre, almost comical grunt the player character makes when he jumps sum up the awaited audial experience rather nicely.-Final Thoughts-As my girlfriend pointed out, there's a squiggly line between raven and word, and the title could really be either Raven Sword or Ravens Word. That's honestly the only thing that interests me about this game.			"

												Ravensword: Shadowlands is a very dumbed down Skyrim clone.  It has it's moments of fun and you get to fly cool mounts eventually, but it has a lot of problems.  I still want to play it, but will need to remember to SAVE OFTEN!!!  You die a lot and get stuck in the environments. Graphics are a mess in some places and it really takes away from the atmosphere.  Trees, rocks and plants will be floating in the air, tears in the buildings, popup everywhere, etc.  Some textures just don't seem finished.  Music, sound effects and voice acting are all done well.  There are some cool enemies to fight.  I love the skeletons!  Character models and animations are okay.  I give this game a 5/10 because of the cheap price and it can be fun to play!  ONLY purchase if you are the kind of player that is very forgiving of glaring flaws and can still have fun with mediocre games.  This was one of those rare games that I played from start to finish without any breaks!  I liked it!Pros+ Open World, free-roaming exploration+ Unlimited ammo for bows, crossbows and guns+ Has horses and flying mounts+ Decent graphics+ Nice magic effects+ Has quests+ Can keep playing after the main quest is completed+ Has some cool bugs and glitchesCons- Small area maps- One town with minimal shops- Not many hidden areas to find- Not many different weapons & items- Same mounts throughout the game- Floating trees, rocks, plants, etc.- Death animations could be better- Not many magical spells/runes- Small amount of quests- No ending?- Has many bugs and glitches- Game seems unfinished			"

												A bad game - not a broken one, but a bad one. Sub-par for PC because it was made for a tablet, where it looks like an actually nice game. Usually I write longer reviews but here it seems pointless. It's like a B, or C-movie - it's working it has everything (loot, dialogues, quests, magic, ranged, melee) and has some nice ideas, but afterall everything is delivered around the minimum level. The enemy soldiers die in such a weird, funny way during the prologue that it only misses a Wilhelm-scream to make it so funny that I would laugh - this way I was just giggling.  Food for thought: it's a little sad that a tablet-game from 2013 works better and is more enjoyable ported to PC than some recent games that come out of Greenlight, which were done with PC in mind at the first place. I feel a little bad for setting this as not recommended, as this is still leagues above the endless numbers of soulless platformers, voxelgames, cubegames and games that end up being free on gleam after days of release just to make some revenue on cards.Not recommended at the end, as the content is way less than one would expect from a game that costs 7€ (even during the sale as it is now, no discount. Dishonored is actually cheaper than this at the moment) - if you are still intrested in the game and some giggles on awkward gameplay, if it would be accessable for 1-2€ I would encourage you to go after it. It's not terrible, it's just far from being decent.			"

												Do not go in expecting Skyrim and you won't go out completely dissapointed.It is a nice little action game in the spirit of Crusaders of Might and Magic. It is relatively short (5-6 hours), but that at least means you will not have enough time to get bored with the simple gameplay. All in all it is a fun game for spending a few mindless hours after a hard day in work.That being said, there is probably a reason why a lot of people feel being ripped off. I would blame it especially on the features list on the store page - richly detailed world? I would say that about Planescape Torment, not this. Hundreds of items? I don't think I have used more than a hundred during the game. Lockpicking and pick pocketing has practically no use in the game. Decision based, multi-part quests? Again, do not expect any depth here. And the reputation system is in the game just for the sake of there being one.Turn down your expectations and you might actually enjoy the game for what it is.

												I've noticed that in the PC gaming community, any game ported over from android is generally disdained as beneath them right from the game's inception. Iesabel was another perfect example of this. Games ported from android are shorter, smaller, and simpler, but that doesn't mean that they can't be fun and provide a few hours of enjoyment. I enjoyed this game all the way from the finish. It was far from perfect and had some texture glitches, (nothing game breaking), but the story and soundtrack were good, the combat system simple, the controls spot on, the landscapes beautiful, and the enemy variety interesting. It's basically a budget elderscrolls. Some of the keys can be rebound, but not all of them and that was a big negative for me. Other than that, there's not very much to complain about here for the price.			"

I understand it's a mobile game, but if you didn't play the mobile version, this is still worth a buy in my opinion. The game just needs controller support, and probably more attack styles, but overall I'm enjoying it.			"

												OK.So I finished the game..... Well first of ,it is not Oblivion or Skyrim, but it wanted it to be so bad. the quality of the game is super bad visually and all graphics from 2005.But... this is a game for a mobile, and it is unity, so to see this much world and details, I am surprised. For me the game is not really boring, the combat is slow, AI stupid, but I don't know, I enjoy going places and finding quests, secrets and killing monsters.The story is really cool, simple but entertaining simple level leveling up, not many things in it.You can be a warrior, archer, or like warrior /archer/magic guy, if you like to use  just magic more .I myself went FULL warrior just hHP and damage.A overall a nice little game, maybe the shortest RPG also, I have 7 hours, was level 28 I think If you want an rpg and have nothing to play only this, give it a try I enjoyed it			"

												Great and beautifull game. Nice graphics which is improved when you compare with the mobile version. Nice climatic music, and a lot of fun. I tested this game on Windows and on Linux both running very good. Game have one error with controller. On both systems if you have controller connected to computer the game have some issues, but anyway this game should be played by the keyboard and mouse like all other games of this style. "

												Holy jesus this game is horrid. Do yourself and everyone else a favor: DON'T BUY THIS STEAMING PILE OF MONKEY VOMIT. It is not worth $3, much less $15. If it goes on a $0.99 sale it MIGHT be worth it otherwise, NOPE. The game goes as follows pay $15, begin game with high expectations, see the extreme lack of anything you would expect of a decent game, figure meh atleast I can turn up the difficulty, turns up the difficulty to max, still three shot everything, beat the game in like an hour and a half, sigh dejectedly, put a pike through your computer screen. Final Score: -10			"

												Once you get past the UI issues and menu bugs, you are left with a still rather ininspired and largely unplayable game. I've played better RPGs in a web browser. Clautstrophobic environments, dated graphics and a poor control scheme take away any enjoyment you might get from the simple combat.			"

												This game fails in so many levels I don't know where to begin.It has all the bad elements of Skyrim and goes on to become worse:1. Story: There is pretty much zero story for an adventure game. Well this is pretty much okay if the goal of the developer is to make players assume their own roles and weave their own story, but truth to the matter is, there isn't much to work on your own story anyways. The only interesting part was one particular quest in the beginning where  you were ambushed in a store after a woman persuaded you in and thats about it. The main storyline is cliche and straightforward that creates no memorable experience whatsoever (as far along my playthrough)2. Gameplay: Wobbly and out of proportion bad. Skyrim was bad as you could just smash things and that is pretty much the only strategy. Suffice it to say that it is even worse here.3. Exploration: Starting out the world seems pretty vast and lush, however that starts to prove itself wrong as you discover that it wasn't as expansive as it was supposed to be nor was there much freedom to explore. There were only few sidequests, which was to be expected out of an adventure game, but it felt mediocre.I've played bad games and forced myself to finish it. For this particular one, I do not have such a resolve.			"

												There are a lot of mixed reviews about this game and how terribly expensive it is on a PC.  Give me a break.  This is a game somewhere between Baldur's gate and Dragon Age.  Keep in mind, those games new on a PC were $40-$50.    The graphics in Ravensword are not cutting edge 21st century, and there aren't hours of audio and video cut scenes.   Having put all that down, for $14 on Steam int's a very fun and utterly playable game with a very large world to explore.  It feels a lot like WoW without the idiots, I mean, other players, LOLS.   I find it funny that guys who are bragging about their gaming rigs being so up to date, and I assume, expensive can be so boorish when reviewing a relative bargain. Also, I find the fight dynamics pretty cool.  You have to carefully time your striking and parying attacks to best defend yourself while dealing out maximum damage to the enemy.  Much more dynamic than games where you just hold down the ""kill"" button and hope the enemy's HP gives out before yours does or turn based RPG's.  It's fun, it's enjoyable, it plays well on modern CPU's with not so modern graphics cards.  I do wish I could propose to a couple of the NPC's too.			"

												It's like someone had played Elder Scrolls: Oblivion for a few hours and then commissioned some low budget developer to come up with a similar game. The ambient background music, the lockpicking system, skillgains... Yeah, it's like a crude police sketch of Oblivion.Looks aside, the game is a very straightforward fetch quest with generic monsters and hardly any content plot-wise. I don't hate it. I might even like it because I'm easily amused. But I wouldn't recommend Ravensword: Shadowlands to anyone, because there are so many RPGs out there that are much better. Even if they're ten years older. Why waste your time playing this when you could play some similar RPG that's much more enjoyable when it comes to combat, puzzles, level design, NPCs and dialogue? Unless you've already played every other game in this particular genre and there's nothing else left...			"

Nice RPG with pretty cool stuff in it like a sorcerer stuck in a bottle \'cos his spell backfired on him ! lol and a quest to help him out of the bottle ! The graphics are amazing for such a low priced game. I expected a cool adventure and got one ! So much to explore and fun to have in this game ! I just started playing this game and it looks awesome ! I\'m looking forward to playing this game for awhile !

												Don't buy this game unless the following is true, you can't play skyrim for any reason at all, but you would like to play it.This game is a poor mans skyrim or a young mans skyrim. Skyrim is better but it's rated M by ESRB so some people may  not be able to play it and it's more expensive... well not really anymore, just buy skyrim when it's on sale if it's otherwise to pricey.Ravensword is a fun game, it;s more creative than Skyrim, but overall a much lower quality game. It takes a bit of grinding here and there, some of the game mechanics are a little glichy and     the story, well the story is half decent but by no means original.So at the end of the day, I f there is a reason you cannot play skyim, whether you can't play M game or you computer is not good enough, then yea I would recomend this game. If you already have played tons of hours on skyrim and just want something a little different, then buy it, the overall gameplay is quite fun, but there is not a lot of content, I have beaten this game 3 times on my computer and once on my iPad 2. I have about 20 hours acording to steam, so that means it took me about 7 hours to beat this game each time. It has a short story and few side quests, once the game is over you can buy a house and join one of I would guess 4 or 5 guilds and then there is darn near nothing to do.To give you and idea of the quality / size of game, my iPad 2 can run it and yes, it is on the app store... Well I am not sure if it's still there but I would not be supprised. I would recomend this game very strongly to someone who is looking for a game of this style for there mobile device.Btw Falcon is op and alows you to skip large parts of areas so you don't have to kill stuff the whole way. It's kinda cool, but also takes away from the game a little.In the end I would recomend this game.6/10I only give 6/10 because the quality is poor, however the gameplay is quite fun.			"

												The game itself plays like what could best be described as what you would imagine Skyrim, Oblivion, and so on to play like if they'd been made about 7-8 years sooner. Combat  is a chore as the hitboxes are often dreadful, requiring you to massively overlevel and grind for gold so that you can finally win a fight by being completely and totally immune to the damage your enemies output. The game itself is poorly optimized for PC, running far worse in certain areas than games of much higher quality and detail ever would, and also looks rather poorly to boot. The art is about 5-6 years out of date for the genre, and honestly gave me the impression that it had been made in that time period rather than December of last year. Quests often leave you wondering what it is you're actually meant to do and the quest markers are often incredibly useless as they only indicate the (massive) general direction in which you should be heading to eventually reach your destination. On top of that, the quest log often leaves out important details, such as what it is you are actually meant to do. The story is sub-par at best, being incredibly cliche and not very fulfilling whatsoever, and is even less logical for about 80-90% of it. On top of that, the main story is basically all there is to do in the game, there are no side quests continued outside of a few that will last for about 30 minutes total. Combine all of this and you get a game with a poor story, out-of-date graphics, an INCREDIBLY short play time, high difficulty curve, (as a result of bad hitboxes and many, MANY combat bugs that commonly appear and make it so that your weapons do not work for a varying amount of time) that is crippled even further by the fact that very little to no play-testing seems to have been done, as the game is riddled by bug after bug continuing through every area and very rarely not requiring a load up of the last save, which, without any form of auto-save function, could easily put you back a frustrating amount of time.Overall, I'd give this game a score of 2/10.

But what it always does is causing the player to move at about 200mph hundreds of meters forward. Same thing happens to enemies when you get close to them...UPDATEAll i had to do was to set the launch option LC_ALL=C %command% and all of the problems were gone.			"

YouTube™ Video: Ravensword: Shadowlands PC Review - JumpToGamer 

			Views: 7,795		

			Ravensword: Shadowlands has long since dominated the RPG genre of iOS and the Google Play store, but how does it fare on the PC?		

You may have heard, or even played, Ravensword: Shadowlands before. It has been out for a year already, and was primarily developed as a mobile game for Android and iOS devices. That didn’t stop Crescent Moon Games from porting it over to Steam via the Greenlight program. Boasting improved visuals and a new control scheme, Ravensword Shadowlands should serve as an improvement, right?Well, I wouldn’t necessarily say that. Let me get this out of the way: Ravensword: Shadowlands isn’t a terrible game. It’s playable, and in some instances, enjoyable. It’s just not a very well developed game at this point in time, and many of it’s core mechanics are very clunky. There are some very large design and technical flaws within the game that need adjusted in order for a more enjoyable experience. I’m sure that most of these issues stem from the fact that Ravensword: Shadowlands started out as a mobile game with the PC support being more of an afterthought.The premise isn’t too revolutionary or enthralling. You fought in an epic battle between what amounts to humans and elves, when suddenly every soul on the battlefield perishes except for you. Confused and injured, you are taken in by a local town to start questioning why you’re still alive, and what’s going on in this crazy world. It’s not really revolutionary, but it serves as a way to get you to explore the game world. There are several side quests as well, but none of these are really worth mentioning.Ravensword is also a very short game. You could run through this game in probably 5 hours on your first run through, and still see most of what it has to offer. The areas claim to be large and open, and while that is true, they’re also mostly empty with the occasional enemy scattered throughout. The enemies, however, are extremely well designed and varied. There are what look like giant Javan Rhinos in one of the starting areas which sort of confused me, but was impressive nonetheless. Later on, you’ll find yourself surrounded by dinosaurs such as raptors and pterasaurs, and maybe even on the back of one. While it’s strange that you go from fighting goblins to endangered rhinos to extinct animals, dinosaurs are pretty cool and it’s nice to see them represented.The combat is extremely basic. Melee combat is difficult because of awkward and inconsistent animations, while ranged combat fares much better. I spent most of my time with a strangely overpowered crossbow that outdamages even the strongest sword in the game. The nice thing about the combat, though, is that the skill system is reminiscent of Elder Scrolls. You’ll get better with weapons the more you use them, and you’ll be able to upgrade different attributes of your character among leveling up. While not nearly as in-depth as a dedicated PC game, it would be a nice touch on a mobile device.The biggest problem for Ravensword, however, is the amount of technical glitches and overall lack of polish. It’s hard to recommend a game when animations will stop for no reason, interrupting the flow of combat. Or when you accidently double tap one of your directional keys, causing you to roll to your death. Sometimes the sky will turn dark on me, or my crossbow would stop working until I reset the game. Situations like this happen very frequently in Ravensword, but many times they are more entertaining than detrimental. I was very amused when I noticed that enemies will walk right off the edge of a cliff if I can coax them toward me, or that enemies will walk right into water, and then follow me as I float above them. Even the user interface takes some getting used to as many of it’s windows and objects are obtrusive and ungainly; obviously from Ravenswords mobile development.In terms of presentation, it doesn’t look exactly terrible. Some animations are rough, but the environments are pleasant and colorful, if not a tad empty for my tastes. The lighting is impressive for it’s engine, yet it’s not advanced enough that it will make low-end machines struggle too much. The sound, on the other hand, is a mixed bag. Many of the voices sound as though they were recorded in a closet with a paper bag over the microphone. Some soundtracks are much too loud and dramatic for their areas, while others do a good job at conveying the large, open areas. The sound effects are grating, and you’ll hear too many grunts, squeals, and clangs should you decide to play Ravensword.Ravensword: Shadowlands is a mobile game stuck on the PC, and that is precisely the problem. Many of the issues stem from the fact that Ravensword seems to be a mobile game first, and a PC game second. While some aspects of the game are admirable, the short length, glitches, and simple gameplay drag the experience down.			"

												There was some promise to this game, but it just fell totally and utterly flat. One of the main selling points was ""an enormous environment"", but there's one city, a couple of fields, a few mountains and a marsh, basically. The main storyline (to skip a few details) was horrendous - you spend 90% of the game looking for a sword that's less than a minute away from where you start the first bit after the tutorial, because it's the ""only weapon that can kill the final boss"" - and then when you DO fight the final boss you don't actually need the sword (I killed it literally using just the fire spell). The character writing was just as bad as the questline, but what really got me was the seemingly random inclusion of voiceovers. If all the characters had voices, fair enough. If none had voices, fair enough. If the ones in the main questline did but everyone else didn't, fair enough. What actually happened was that most characters will mumble ""hello good sir"" at you, and then some characters, completely at random would have one line mid-conversation which did have a voiceover, and the majority of the dialogue is just subtitles. The sidequests basically aren't worth doing either - there's no REAL benefit to them, and the reputation system seems entirely meaningless because it affects nothing.Even the gameplay was poor - melée weapons are fairly standard but a couple of hits from any weapon will basically kill you. Ranged weapons are far more powerful, but the aiming system's not brilliant, and the spells mostly feel useless apart from the one or two quest-related instances where you need them. The game feels unfinished too - there are LOADs of bugs that have just been left in - there's a lot of falling through the floor, occasionally a weapon will ""jam"" and not let you hit with it until you save, exit and re-enter the game, enemies get stuck on all sorts of items.Again, on the whole it really falls flat. There's definitely potential for it to have been a good game, but it feels totally unfinished. The major positive part of the game is that there are inexpicably dinosaurs roaming about a couple of areas (I'm not even going to try and justify them being there) and you get to ride one of them, but even then the controls are clunky.tldr; don't bother with this. Play something from The Elder Scrolls, or The Witcher, or Fable, or even a Lord of the Rings game instead. There is no aspect of this game that can't be topped by one of them.			"

												Really not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Really makes you want to play morrowind, or one of the elder scrolls games. You have to take it for what it is for sure, but for 99 cents I feel like I got my moneys worth 7 hours of game time I am happy for sure. I was able to do a few side quests and the main quest. The story isn't ground shattering, but it's not bad at all. I am off to play morrowind though haha this game has got me really big into it again... so thanks for that.One less backlog yeahhhhhh			"

It is quite bare bones, minor detail, and the gameplay is average, but not broken. I feel like this was a good first step into game development, and I hope the dev gets a good idea of what a game needs, and how to polish it.Making games is NOT easy.Worth $1 - $2, but no more. Reminds me of a beta-version Morrowind.			"

												This is not a terrible game, and on a phone (it was originally for iOS) it would actually be impressive. However, when you port something like this to PC, you invite comparison to all the other open-world 3D RPGs available on the platform (Elder Scrolls, Witcher, etc.), and in that regard there's nothing this game does that you can't find being done better somewhere else. The $15 price tag is a bit much for what's offered here, as well. Still, it kept my interest long enough that I completed the main and side quests, I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes, the combat is fun (if a little too simple) and it has moments where, even with the lower-res textures, the game still manages to look pretty. Plus one quest lets you ride dinosaurs, which should count for something. I can only recommend this if you can get it on sale/in a bundle and you can't get enough RPGs.			"

												Ravensword: Shadowlands is essentially an Elder Scroll's clone which is buggy simpler yet fun. You play as the lone human survivor in a war between the humans and dark elves. After a few quests early on you are informed that your destiny is to obtain the runestones that will unlock the ravensword and use that to save the world from eternal darkness.  The plot is nothing special and unfortunately the gameplay doesn’t fair much better. You can fight with various weapons both ranged and melee as well as spells later on. Each attribute and weapon increase in their properties as you use them (for example armor attributes increase when hit). The weapons are all different and have pros and cons to each. The hammer may deal the most damage but it is slow and leaves you open. The combat itself consist of hitting the enemy and hoping you hit harder than they hit you. If you do die there is no penalty except for loading you last save but you can save at any time. Leveling up is rewarding because you can spend points on passive abilities as well as base abilities. The games length is decent being around 8-12 hours depending on if you want to do all of the quests and has some fun moment most involving slaying giant beast. Considering it is an indie game and is an overall good experience I would recommend this to anyone who wants some fantasy and questing. Just don’t expect it to be Skyrim.			"

												I have played two hours and yet I am still bored. There's nothing in the environment, and the graphics suck for a computer game. This would be a so-so mobile game; one you buy play it for a bit and then forget it's installed on your phone, until one day you're like ""Oh my, what is this?"" then you're like ""Oh i remember this; Why did I stop playing this? Oh that's right, it's dull. (kinda feels like staring at a wall dull),"" then you go ""why do I have this installed?"" and then delete it and always regret buying it.It's not to bad. Ok story, at least so far. Game play is so-so. Anyway the graphics need improving, and might is suggest adding some voice actors or audible dialogue. I would say the game is a 1/5 if I wanted to be mean, but I'll be fair, SO it gets a 3/5, or 60%, or 6/10, or D-. It's an ok game, but don't except a whole lot out it, or you'll end up eating a jar of ice cream, curling up in the fetal position and crying yourself to sleep, for a couple of days.Once again I say it's a 3/5.Have a nice day.

												Update: 8/03/2014I beat this game on android before school ended this year. It was fun from start to finish. The story isn't really exciting but the beautiful enviorments and dinosaur riding make up for that. The game itself is a quick playthrough maybe 5-10 hours, depending on if you want to do the few side missions.After beating the game (and fiding out how to get out of the map) I still would recomend the game.Only downside is I wish there was some replay value.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is an amazing game! After playing it for a while you can tell it has been influenced by The Elder Scrolls series. The graphics themselves are amazing and remind me very much of an Oblivion like game. You can steal like in TES (the elder scrolls) but there isn't as much things to take. You get to customize your character but it isn't nearly as in depth as Skyrim. Same goes for the upgrade/stats/abilities. The game has a difficulty meter so you can make it easy or extremely hard depending on your skill level. Also there is a very good diversity of enemies and things to kill. I recomend this game to anyone looking for a fun and great looking RPG. Also this game was made for smartphones and transfered onto the PC with a few additions.			"

												From what I can tell, the reason people don't like it is because it's a really old styled game. Especially for the time it was made and even more so now. It's very slow with the animations and the machanics and the voice acting is very limited. In those regards, it becomes kind of boring. So, why do I recomend it? Becasue it's actually a good game with a good story. True, it's very slow and you have to force yourself through the beginning, but, it has a lot of potential and I could see it turning into its own series of two or three games at least. It's a very common story but that also bodes well for it because it uses a formula that not only has been proven to work but has also proven to still be enjoyable today. It feels very much like the elder scroll series but I think that works very much in its favor. I'd recomend it if you're bored and not too picky about the graphics. If you're looking for something to occupy your time and is affordable, then play it. If you like the elder scroll series, play it. Just don't get too hung up on the particulars or else you won't be able to enjoy it. Keep an open mind and you'll get a pretty decent expreience.			"

												I only have four complaints. ONE: The voice acting is HORRIBLE, TWO: Some enemy placement is a little odd, such as where you can get overwhelmed alot, THREE: The difficulty slider is like a bathroom faucet it is either hard or too easy no inbetween, FOUR: the game promises updates, but that was three years ago... over all i would give this a 3.5/5, its basicly skyrim for people who cant: run, afford or play because of the mature content in it. its a fun game but no use in getting this if you have skyrim.

												This game feels like a mini Skyrim. With guns.It's really not as bad as some say it is, at least for me. If you're looking to play a small RPG just to kill some time, this might be fun, but we clearly can't compare it with the big RPGs like the Elder Scrolls franchise for instance.			"

												Well, how do I say this in a polite way? Let me think…Ah, now I've got it!What the hell is wrong with that game?! W, A, S, and D do nothing most of the time. Neither do all the other keys. Hitting foes with the sword lets you fly across the screen – which would be okay, if you'd still be able to hit them, I guess, but it does nothing to them.Let me quote Dewey from ""Malcom in the Middle"" on this: ""I expected nothing, and I'm still let down.""My advice: Stay away from it… Please do.

On the PC however it's competing with the likes of Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, you name it.I could have spent more time with Ravensword, but that would take time away from exploring Morrowind's amazingly realized world, or touching up my hair & makeup in Skyrim. All Ravensword seems to have is the terrible combat.I couldn't stomach even 30 minutes of this game. The entire time all I could think is ""Why?""The same could be said about videogames in general.

Its enjoyable, textures look good, and although its a recycled story, its not bad. Most people think because this is a port that it is bad. This game is great, and I will be getting it on my iPod Touch soon. This game is worth the price. I seriously recomend getting this game.			"

HORRIBLE.Music is O.K.Voice acting is horrible. There is barely any of it too.Combat is okay.Menus are kinda cheep and crappy.I got this in humble bundle, Infact I bought humble bundle because of this ( oh, and that bridge game which I've yet to try. ).I wanted to try this alot because IMO, there aren't many good RPGs that are elder scrolls-like ( and I was dissapointed with skyrim and TESO ).After playing, I thought it must be an early access game, but upon looking at the store page in shock it was not. I thought if it was atleast early access it might get better down the line as I'd like this game to be better but it just isn't and doesn't look like it will get much better.			"

												Essentially it's just a poor man's TES. There's no mod support, the combat is very bleh, the graphics are bad, the controls have some serious delay and response issues, but it does manage to keep a decent fantasy setting in an open world. If you can't run TES or have an extreme hankering for a similar game then this might get the job done. Personally the entire time playing it I kept thinking ""I wish I was playing Oblivion right now"". It's very very generic and while perhaps it was cool on a phone or tablet or something, it just doesn't fit well on PC.			"

Ravensword: Shadowlands, a full review First off, sorry if you find any typos in this review. It's late, arround 2/3pm and I've spent quite some time playing this extrodinary game.I did not bought the game, I won a giveway and I was rather skeptical at first. Screenshots seemed generic, dated graphics even for a 2 year old game (review written in 2015)... overall a generic and dull game.If you reconsider playing this game, you must know that  Crescent Moon made this game. And if you googled it CM produces Android games. So yes, this is a Android oriented game although with some minor changes. You can feel that while looking around with your caracther, the sensitivity is very low. Even if you play with a mouse (that you shouldn't) you have to go the settings and change the sensitivity to the maximum. Even so, it feels slaggyish (smooth but slow). But no biggie.StoryHeavily inspired in Elder Scrolls. Not a rip-off, but it is those kind of RPG's that you must go looking for person X then X tells you he's only going to give what you want if you do some hard work and turns out you some out-of-the-league champ that survived a war where everyone died except you and now you must follow a profecy because you a chosen one thingy. Resemblences? But it has his funny moments. There is lot of references from Elder Scrolls in dialogues, very funny. I felt lost after my first quest but i got around within minutes. Those who never played RPG's before may feel confusing.GraphicsWell it's a Android oriented game, right? Don't expect much it's a mobile game. I bet my AGP nVidia FX 5200 can run this. Don't expect Skyrim graphics...expect Morrowind look-a-like graphics.GameplayBesides the fighting system I don't have anything wrong against the gameplay. It's clumsy and need to be perfected. The map seems a little small but hey, mobile game right? Cities seems okay but there is some parts of the map that is mostly wide open. Runs smooth, there is a caracther creator, perk system, you can ride a horse, lot of weapons, you can be a mage, ""karma""/reputation system... I can carry on with this list...MusicIt's not bad! I personaly enjoyed! Very climatic.Why it has so many dislikes, should I be worried?No not at all. This game IS fun. People thought this would be somekind a new Elder Scrolls competitor-look-a-like-but-with-small-prices game. You pay what you get for. It is normal people complain and downvoted this game. We are PC players we demand better and more each game. But some games don't starve for that need. Some are just indies making a life for it. Like this one. Think of Hotline Miami with their 2D'd graphics and his sucess. OverallSimplistic, enterteining and amusing. Good bargain, need some minor improvements of course but I hope you guys out there buy this game and support the creators so they can make another one even better and complex. Babysteps!

												Awful. Boring story, boring dialogue, very little voice acting and even the voice acting itself was bad, no replayability, no care for any of the characters. I played the main quest from start to finish, beat a bunch of sidequests and I'm pretty sure I have endgame gear too. This game was devoid of any roleplay or engrossing world, it felt like an alpha. I know this was a phone game ported to the PC, but my god, this was just horrible.On the plus side, I really liked the mounts (FLYING MOUNTS, WOOHOO) and the skill system idea was great! The problem is, at around level 24+ nothing can stand against you, at all. That is bad, because after the main quest you can keep playing... but why would you do that? The side quests are boring and mostly unrewarding (except for the one where I got a flying mount). There are no further challenges I can even find in the game, everything I sneeze at dies. Very short game, the world is very dead with little people to converse with meaningfully.I feel nothing for any of the characters that I met, that either lived or died. There were no choices, there was no roleplay. Not even the reputation matters, nothing changes when you max it. It was just a short grind to get accustomed to using all manners of weaponry, then everything fell when I hit it just once. Oh, and the whole dodging thing? Bad, especially the fact that you can't turn it off. I died many times by double tapping one of the strafe keys. So yeah, thanks for that.This game could be improved so much. Better dialogue, better voice acting, more content beyond endgame that actually serves as a challenge, more gear/spells... it was just really, really short. I have no desire to replay this game, I really hope the developers will learn from this porting, and get a feel for what is commonly expected of from RPGs. Just a little more care in crafting the world and story, especially dialogue, would have improved this game a lot. It felt awkward playing through this, and I can't recommend anyone buy this game. People are giving this game away in fact, so if you MUST play this, you can probably get it in that manner. I really wanted to like this game, and I almost did at the beginning, but playing it killed me inside.WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTOh, and the final boss? What a PUSHOVER! Us gamers want to be CHALLENGED, and a wimpy imp-like boss is our challenge? I beat him in less than 30 SECONDS. Bad, very very bad.P.S: Might want to fire your level designers. I found multiple holes in areas where I could fall through the world and die. One such area is that shadowrealm near endgame, two holes where you can meet your end.			"

												This has actually held my interest surprisingly well; it's basically a TES game with most of the story and production value wrung out of it, which leaves a fairly fast-paced slash-em-up which actually manages to be entertaining. Frankly, I probably enjoy it more than I do Skyrim: the interface is actually reasonably competent on PC, there aren't slow-mo kills slowing down the action needlessly, the lore is kept to a minimum, and its content is actually well-paced and isn't overused excessively. It's certainly not a perfect game -- it has a LOT of flaws -- but at its core lies a competently executed fast-paced slash-em-up RPG, and I can honestly recommend picking it up (at the right price).

Also; dinosaurs? Are they for real?Honestly, I wouldn't mind if they succeeded making an oblivion ripoff with skyrim graphics, but it's not. Not even close. Not even a bit like close. Far away is too close too.If you watched the trailer, that's not really how the game looks. The game controls are much fooped up so now and then and  well, the graphics aren't right.

												Ravensword: Shadowlands is a 'decent' alternative to Skyrim, although it's got a lot of negative things about it, for one, I personally didn't like the 'combat'. It's great if you're still stuck in the 2000's. The graphics aren't that good. Graphics aren't important, but playing a game like this requires at least a little bit of good graphics. Some of the enemies will just stare at you, and for the big beasts they're health is very low, and it took me approx 10-15 seconds to kill it. They need to be a little harder.It's a great game if you don't have enough money to purchase TES: Skyrim, but I don't think that this game is worth $14.99, I got this game in a bundle for $1.00 so it was a great deal and I couldn't pass the opportunity. Overall I'd give this game 5.9/10Reminder: If this game isn't on sale, don't buy it!			"

Blew me away in terms of what matters the most in a game, gameplay! Very fun and easy to learn combat, and simple leveling up system (no crazy skill trees/forests) may turn some hardcore skyrim fans off, but I really enjoy this game. Has an old school feel that I have been wanting for a long time now in a 3d arpg. I have played better rpgs in my day but Ravensword is quite refreshing. I wasn't looking for a 200+ hour epic like skyrim (already have that) so this game fits the bill,. If your looking for a lighter, or more casual, old school, arpg, buy now.

												Warmly recommanded! A casual yet fun subpar open-world RPG. Especially good if you do not have tens of hours to spent diving into the land of Tamriel. Pros:+ You can fly on a giant eagle given to you by a waterfall!+ You can also ride pterosaurs. I mean, do you have to read more?+ You fight giant carnosauts with a crossbow and a sword. Still not convinced?+ Fireball spell is actually a firethrower+ Runs on low-config old machines+ No game-breaking bugs+ All the boring parts of an open-world RPG have been ripped off the game+ Skill progression is rather entertaining+ Nice landscapes+ Beautiful music+ Ennemies attacks are nicely animated (especially the Raptors)+ Easy grinding+ Most voices are convincing+ You can be everything at once (mage, warrior, thief)Cons:- No depth in universe and in story- Very limited loot- Maps are empty- No proper dungeons- Lack of challenge- Ennemies are all of equal strength more or less- It is NOT Oblivion or Divinity II or Two Worlds or Risen or Gothic. Nothing of that kind here. Verdict: A casual, low ambition game, yet seriously fun. Short and fast-paced. And dinosaurs! And flight! Long version: This game is hard to judge. In every aspect, it tries to remind to you of Oblivion, especially in the first city, where the music is almost the same. And yet it is highly delusional. This game is a CASUAL open-world RPG. Seems paradoxical? Sure it is! A few examples: All merchants buy everything you have to sell at the same price. Lack of immersion, for sure, but it's fast and efficient. Houses are closed if there is no quest inside. People have no name if they do not have something to sell or some quest to give. Maps are quite simplistic, with no caves, no dungeons, only a few wandering ennemies that you can kill at will. They happen to respawn near instantly, but as they are very passive, it is only a massive grindfest. So, this game is subpar in every aspects. Everything is simplistic; but everything works as it supposed to do. Some landscapes are really nice and charming (the Terraces, for instance), music is nice and epic, fighting system is good, skills are a constant fun to improve, etc. If you can explore the different regions in any order, the game is quite linear in the sense that you have nothing to do in the so-called regions except a meagre handful of straightforward quests. This game provides a chep yet solid fun, which will content every one who like to hunt Raptors in the swamps with a magical sword and the sound of drums humming in the air.  "

												Ravensword: Shadowlands would be the product I think of if Skyrim and Vanguard Saga of Heroes had a drunken one night stand that gave birth to a baby.. with a turd born in it's mouth. Yes. A turd. In it's mouth.I started this game thinking, ""well okay. It has mixed reviews but the few good reviews it DOES have, paint it in a decent light.""  The first thing I notice is that the game refuses to play at the resolution my monitor has... and freezes up my entire system forcing me to force shutdown the desktop. Now, being the forgiving type when it comes to games, try this game again after I restart. This time it lets me play at the resolution that I want.At this point, you'll notice that I've played less than an hour, as that was enough for me to deduce that every two or three minutes some form of profanity would be leaving my lips if I tried to play any further. Therefore my review will be based on the 40 or so minutes that I spent wanting to slam my head into my desk while trying to kill wild boars and goblins. You'll also notice I said ""trying to kill"" and that is because the controls in this game are so laggy that I spent half the time swinging a sword into nothing even though I was aiming at the enemies. The NPCs in this game start off as voiced characters, which would have been a plus to me, had the voice actors not quit mid dialogue, forcing you to read their walls of text. I assume they quit, as the only other scenario I could think of is that they had a sneak peak at the combat in this game and slit their wrists in defiance, refusing to be part of this monstrosity. I should also add, that while the graphics were somewhat decent, and the bodies for female npcs were worthy of a ten second glance... once you got up to their face it reminded you of someone who has been hit in the face with a hot cast iron skillet... multiple times. The male faces? Not much better... nor their bodies for that matter.. and yes, I looked.The storyline, from what I saw, is incredibly dull, consisting of ""you could be the key to blah blah blah, go find this person and do what he wants you to do so he can send you off to this other person so he can do the same thing"" Only I never got that far because I fell out of my seat laughing at the first guy... claiming to be a powerful wizard, yet trapped inside a bottle. By a spell gone bad. Yup.. the mighty wizard's spell backfired and trapped him in a bottle.This all being said, there WAS one good thing about this game... I got it for free. I'd only recommend this to people who had masochistic traits.			"

												Generally a weak storyline out of the gate but given it lets you roam pretty quickly I doubt it is the kind of game where it is going to matter much before getting lose in side-quests(which is not a bad thing). I would have kept playing but the controls are the clunkiest I've ever used, sensitivity changes on the mouse seem to have next to no effect (fast then slow then fast then slow; seemly randomly) and the collision detection is awful, I had arrows stopping in midair for no reason at all. The part that really kills the flow of the game is the fact that you can't just use keys to go through menus and are stuck clicking on everything (with the mouse that can't seem to figure out how fast it has to go) which is slow going to say the least. The graphics were alright, nothing great but not the worst and easily overlooked by comparison to the control issues. If the controls and menu navigation were patched then maybe I'd consider playing again, overall just glad I didn't spend much on it thanks to the HB.			"

												I shoulda scrolled down before i went. ""YAY INDIE DEVELOPER LETS SUPPORT IT."" nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I forgot i had played this on my phone, and while it can be ... enjoyable on the phone, it is a absolutely wretched PC Port. there is no reason to actually own this on the PC, as you get a much better, smoother experience from a high-ish end smart phone or tablet. At least i personally thought so. On PC, it's clunky, and horridly ported. It just has no reason, nor any possible way to justify double the price tag than the android market price. I've literally never wrote a review, never wanted to return a game, even with some of the crap i've bought, just because... Someone had made the time to make the game, and it runs... This is just... I shoulda read. Yes, it runs, yes it will play, but why you would waste time looking at upscaled graphics that belong perfectly on a smartphone/tablet, I have no clue. From what I can tell, there is no change from the Mobile to PC version, there are no grahpic updates, there are no gameplay updates, there are no bugfixes, there is literally no reason for the upscaled price. The interface is wretched, the entire thing is just wretched on PC.... On mobile, totally great. Please don't buy it, just get it from the Andriod App store, and actually enjoy it how it's meant to be enjoyed.			"

												Absolutely terrible.  I got it for about $1.50 through Humble Bundle and still didn't feel I got my money's worth.  The writing is extremely awkward, the graphics were basically phoned in, and the mouse was far too sensitive, eventually making me queasy.  A terrible game all around.The one part I did enjoy was the unintentional hilarity of giving a black haired character this ridiculous white beard, which nobody seemed to notice.

												Although It looks alright at first glance, when you actually play it, it is not at all impressive. The world is fairly small, but the trailer leads you to think otherwise. The graphics are VERY outdated, and they should at least create a patch to enhance the graphics. I've already beaten 3 quarters of the game in about 12 hours, which isn't very much gameplay at all. I would only, ever, recommend this game to someone if they wanted Skyrim but their PC couldn't run it, and they couldn't afford it, which even that is highly unlikely since Skyrim is only $20.00 and you can get it on other consoles. The voice acting is terrible, and the combat sucks. They try make the trailer look good, but they couldn't even pull that off, since they show the terrible graphics in the trailer. There isn,t a whole lot of customization options in the game, except for choosing what armor you want to wear. The story is not at all good, and all in all, this game is just a wanna-be Skyrim ported from iphone to the PC. I recommend you use your $6.00 on something else.			"

												Should you buy this game?Well that all depends on what you are looking for, if you compare Ravensword to other games in the Open world Action RPG Genre such as Kingdoms of Amalur, Two Worlds, Gothic Series, Elder Scrolls Series, it falls extremely short in many aspects.In a game like this, you almost expect interactable loot items in the world, see a potion? take it. Not in this game, in fact the only interactable loot objects are stuff you can steal from people's houses...which is pretty much limited to silverware. And while yes, you can technically steal from people's houses, don't think you can build a roguish character, that will keep you busy for all of 5 minutes, and make you want to shoot yourself because it's that bad.The spell system is so bad that you pretty much can't be a mage, you get a grand total of about 5 or 6 different spells, powered by runes, which are underpowered.If you are looking for a hack and slash RPG, you might not mind this game, the combat isn't anything innovative, but if all you want to do is kill bad guys, it might keep you entertained for a few hours...just do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS IT GOES ON SALE!

												The game was promising at begining but later turned out to be a flop. The controls for this game are ridicules. In mid fight if you hit  2xW  or any other movement key you roll in that direction, so if you just wanted to flank an enemy or two of them you roll over and got delay (when you roll you need half a second to  stand up and half to orient your self to see where you are facing) during witch enemys hit you hard like there is no tomorow. The camera is the worst. You can chose to play first person but if you cary a shield you cant see half of the screen. If you play ""3rd person"" your charter is on far left side of the screen and it makes fighting hard. You need to predict where enemy will be to be able to hit the enemy.The description of items is laughable. There is none. No tutorial what so ever. Only on begining you get basic the movoment and camera setting. Map is beyond bad. It is so confusing. If you press M and then press inventory the map disapears. If you press loot it disapears. Way to many texture in game.  You cant pass thru a giant gap in marketplaces to loot a chest.The only good thing is lockpick. But even there there is no tutorial you just do it on a hunch, Similar to Skyrim. There where to many things that make the game not worthwile to play so I stoped after around 4-5hours on friends account and a hour on this.			"

												A greatly simplified action 'RPG'. You level up, increase stat points, not really any special skills. If you don't need shiny graphics, this game delivers some interesting and diversely themed locations to fight various monsters in: jungle with dinosaurs, snowy mountains with trolls, forest with goblins, deer & boars, plains with bears, caves with elves, tropical area with crabs and flying (i guess dinosaurs?). Combat is simple, you can block and attack with melee, or shoot with a bow. You can also equip a rune to 'shoot' elemental damage. There are both first and third person views available.I really enjoyed this game for it's simplicity. Nothing new I had to learn, no lore I had to cram my head full of in order to understand what was going on. No complex combat systems or complex item/equipment stat balances that required hours of deliberation to max my stats. (Each unique area: this gear sucks, this gear also sucks, this gear is good, this gear is the best) It was just an adventure with real time combat. Yes the graphics are very sub-par but I didn't need that, it was still fun to explorer all the unique environments. I played this almost exclusively for nearly a week until I beat it. (about 10hrs to finish) It was just so easy & simple to get into after work when I didn't have hours to invest in a deep, involved, time consuming RPG. Totally worth it on sale at 80% or 90% off.

Everything in it was 'cheap' - the animations, the models, the interface design, the intro you can't skip, the way you talk to npcs or sell items was simply awkward and annoying.""Minutes LaterWhen I got my hands on the first bow and left the city to hunt - that's the time it began to be a real fun!All the systems such as TES:Morrowind-alike skill system and Fable-alike (more or less) reputation system and the open world were simply awesome and nostalgic.. so nostalgic I already forgot how bad the other aspects were.""My Personal Rating""Graphics: 4/10UI: 2/10Gameplay: 7/10Music: 5/10Features: 8/10			"

												For a port of a mobile game it isn't all that bad. It obviously does not offer the experience you might expect from a full fledged game but it nonetheless offers an enjoyable, though short RPG adventure.The game does surprisingly well in many departments. Each environment (though the graphics still suffer from their (former) mobile limitations) are pretty and unique. The soundtrack is surprisingly high quality and pleasant to listen to. Combat is simple but satisfying, and the game offers a generous amount of quests to complete.There are still some aspects in which it falls flat, however. The developers attempted to add a variety of playstyles, the only practical of which seems to be melee (there are stealth and ranged options. No magic). Stealth just seems useless and your character moves painfully slow whilst sneaking. Bows do what you'd expect, though they won't give you much of an edge as your enemy soon closes in to kill you. The game is also extremely punishing in difficulty unless you manage to get very good gear early on. There are horse mounts in the game, which are not all that useful since they are quite slow and can rarely be used in most areas. Finally, there are quest markers, but they don't always point to the right location. Sometimes it will tell you to go through a door, then tell you to go back through that same door again. This makes finding the quest locations very difficult, and the quest descriptions are often too vague to be of any help. The game has it's fair share of bugs, but only one of which I experienced was game breaking (I just loaded a save from a minute ago and fixed it though).It's a decent sized RPG game which, for a few dollars less, might be worth a buy.

												At first, I thought, Oh snap man, it's a Skyrim I can play without WINE.  I was pretty much completely wrong, but that isn't to say the game is bad.  It's decent. Plenty to explore - I didn't really pay attention to any story...wasn't good enough to keep me interested apparently when it came to story lines.It's an alright RPG, but... it feels like they just ported the Android game over to PC and then called it quits.I hope that isn't the case, because it is a decent game.

												An old RPG gem. It has all the elements of a really good game. It has a great scenario, excellent gameplay and all. The only thing that is not good enough is the length I suppose. For anyone it could be completed within a day if he got the hang of it easily. If it had more length, it would be awesome. :P			"

												I put this off for too long. I did alot of considering and i have decided. I recommend this game. I do! its a fun game, and intresting. I wanted to make sure i finished it and had a full valid opinion. And i sunk more hours into the game then i had first wanted. Its a little bit addicting (like good rpgs should). Ok lets just look at the reasons i did this, and my connections with it.THINGS THAT IT DID RIGHT:if you're reading this review you probally have a general idea of this game that'd be easier, but if you dont its an open world RPG- similiar to the elder scrolls series, which it gets compared to alot.(ill talk more on that later) So here is somethings i thought they did right:-big and diverse enviroments. I say big because its not HUGE but its not small. Its a small open world, you can wander around exploring and find a bunch of things! probally a good 2-3hours if you wanted to WALK the whole way. If you're new and just started playing, play for bit and you will get nice sense of scale. Each area of the map is very diverse from the next.-varierty of enemies. as i said up there; its alot of areas to explore in Ravensword, each different area has a different certain type of enemy to correspond with. The massive mountains of the Ice Lands Harbors a diverse Ice Giant Race. I stumbled upon a dinosaur infested jungle and even a crypt full of skeletons.-Orignal Engine, and a nice feel. Very true it feels like a elder scrolls game (there is even a super ridiculous skyrim easter egg too) but it has its own feel and you will get adjusted to it fast. You'll be upgrading your 20+ skills you have at your disposal, Changing from the many, many of the standerd weapons (axe,sword,bow,halberd,great axe, etc) and throwing spells in no time.-Story was very generic.BUT ! THE REASON THIS IS ON THE RIGHT LIST is because i thought about. it was the usual you're the only one who can save the world, so go save it type deal. But at least i understood it. I knew what i was doing, i knew what going to do what quest would yield, i knew who was who (no matter how flat and dull they were). Sadly some games dont even convey that, they just push useless characters and a story on you; you cant even understand. At least i actually understood and had an idea. I even caught myself looking for more lore to explore, and even thinking about in-game events for hours on end. So i guess theres that.-Predictibility. it had to be said. this game is laughable predictible. this could be a huge downside, but the predictibiliy is actually a great comic relief.(not that the game takes it self TOO seriously) but you can honestly guess an entire quests storyline as you play it< or even before you play it. I found that i at least guessed CORRECTLY the outcome of like 6 quests before even playing them. im not even going to count the number i guessed while playing them. You can literally tell when someone about to betray you, or if something a setup, or if its and immediate fetch quest(ill talk much about that later). But when you just want a game that you can sit down and play on a saturday and wont have to ride a emotional, stressful, roller coaster game(like heavy rain or something like that) then this is nice. a nice relaxing rpg experience- All around it was just fun! RPGs get me in the first place. I just love leveling up, getting stronger, and stuff in that regard. And this game delivered that. If im not laughing at the god-awful voice acting, then im out sneaking in goblin fortresses and getting new gear,( CRIMSON VEST IN THE FORT 2nd BEST ARMOR IN THE GAME SPOILERS), or collecting more magic, or doing many of the side quests which help alot in growing and segways to the next area nicely and smoothly. I found my self at some late game areas early, and got some really nice levels from it, which really helped me at a boss fight.  And i found myself coming back after-school really wanting to play this game. and i put alot of hours in.but its time, lets look at all the bad things. . . oh boyTHINGS THAT IT DID WRONG:alot . . . a much alot-The Voice Acting. Lets get this out the way first please. RIGHT AWAY after you finally get in the game you can tell you're in for a treat. The first few people you talk sound like they recorded this on a busy freeway in Chicago. Its complete♥♥♥♥♥ And they even game a few people the exact same sound clips, SOME DONT EVEN TALK AT ALL (for the better?) its laughable, maybe even annoying, but the good part is, you dont have to listen to any of it! (except for when your in 1 of 7 cutscenes in the game) you can just skip it all and still understand wtf is going on, because my good friends. . . Predictibility-Horribly weak carma system. i would've liked it better if they just didn't include it. You have Reputation. Which goes up and down depending on what activites you participate in. your rep is normal when its at 300 or something like that. doing bad things takes that number down to the negatives. so if you steal a Dechanter (which are everywhere) your rep would be something like 165. they have titles too, like 300rep is normal, 100rep is like crimnal, 600rep is like knight, stuff like that. BUT IT DOSEN'T AFFECT ANY OF THE GAME! THE REP DOSEN'T MEAN A THING. BECAUSE the only rep you can actually be, is normal, or higher (300 or higher) because let me tell you. there are an abundance of things you can do to lower your rep, give♥♥♥♥♥♥responses, beat up the wrong people, STEAL ANYTHING AND EVERYONE'S EVERYTHING (there is a high chance you will get caught but if you dont you rep wont go down). and the second your rep goes to crimnal, every knight in town (which there are 983 around every corner) gets a amber alert and come charging for you. when they catch you they throw you in jail. which you must sit and wait for your rep to go up; it goes up by 50 like every 30 seconds; you must wait till your rep goes back to 300. im sure you can see when this gets troublesome. If your playing through the game like a badguy and your rep is about -600 . you'll be waiting for OVER 12 MINIUTES in jail! AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. they will take your hard(?) earned rep and you cant do a thing. if your in the main town you WILL get caught by a gaurd, and he will send you to jail. WHICH YOU CANNOT LEAVE FROM UNTIL YOUR TIME IS SERVED. punish players with in-game obscurites, not TIME! i dont want to wait in jail in VIDEO GAME. THATS NOT FUN. THAT REALITY. real-life punishments in a video is unacceptble. BUT, there is an easy fix. just play through the game with normal it dosen't mean sht anyways.-Exploits. Im not gonna list them because its kinda OP. but ill say this one, you can JUMP over anything. like you can go to any wall, and hold foward and keep jumping and parkour over EVERYTHING. not gonna lie it saved me alot, helped me alot in the hard areas, but i had to make this a bad point because i used it moderately. but i can imagine people beating the game in like 3 hours because of this.-Name. what name? YOUR NAMELESS IN A TEXT RPG. YOUR NAMELESS? WHAT? at least give us a set name, so we know who we are! OR AT LEAST LET US CHOOSE OUR NAME IN A TEXT RPG! YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE IM SOME SUPER IMPORTAN HERO; THE ONLY ONE TO SAVE THE WORLD, AND YOU DONT EVEN KNOW MY NAME? its really weird and really unengauging.-The ending, the final hours of the game? completely terrible. and unacceptable. you leave for the last area only when you get there to fight endless annoying♥♥♥♥♥foes, your at THE WORST POSSIBLE MAP IN THE GAME, you have no sense of direction,i dont even know if i beat it legit, i wondered around untill i fought someone who looked important, then i beat him, then you get teleported back home. the ending was bad,THEY DONT EVEN SHOW A CREDIT SCRENE!ending was bad, arrupt, and all around left a bad taste in my mouth. just like this review's ending;i recommend this game its fun, dumb, and like a cheap blend of Skyrim-Darksouls			"

(it disapears every time you change screan(go to inventory for example) or when fighting etc etc.Sad cos if the creator gave it a litle more time it could be an awesome game to play. but this game made me wonder if the people that start making  games even test em!1/10 Fallen Dissaproves!

With the price drop it actually might be worth it.  But be warned, it's a pretty bare bones rpg where you can finish everything in 8 hours if you take your time.  But hey, its only 7$.Basically play it, garner enough enjoyment in your time in game that you are at least slightly amused, and move on.  You will quickly forget it however.			"

												Bad port of a portable game, I think controller support would help a bit.

I played this quite a bit on my iPad but I was hoping for a better port than this, it just seems like it's a lazy way to try and make money off a mediocre mobile game. You would be better off spending your money on an Elder Scrolls game and get a quality game for $5 more with better everything and more content.			"

												I could only play it for about 29 minutes before the bugginess started to annoy me. As there is no controller support, if you even dare to leave your controller plugged in the camera will rise upward and cause a freeze. Even if you unplug the controller you must exit out of the game, restart Steam then you can play without interruption. I always have a controller in because there are games which simply easier to play with a controller over a Keyboard/Mouse combination. So this is an infuriating issue, one that should of been fixed as soon as it was reported. Until it is, I can't be arsed to discover if this game was worth my money or not. I will change my review when the game is updated and the lingering issues patched.			"

												I would give this game a 6.75/10Recommended for some, but not for all.Pros:-Graphics are nice. Not amazing, but time was still put into textures and environments.-The music surpassed my expectations for a game at this price.-The weapon system has some nice features, more than the minimum.-So far I haven't found any game breaking glitches.Cons:-Objectives are unclear, leaving you feeling lost at many points.-Animations are simplistic and unrealistic.-Not much effort was made to make this a successful iOS port. The controls feel clunky at times, as if the game wasn't designed to use that control scheme.To be fair, I did not compare this game to others like it on the market. I only analyzed the content of this game and gave it a rating based on its performance as a game. Don't buy this expecting it to be the next Skyrim. If you're looking for a decent game to play around in though, you might enjoy this one. I would recomend reading other reviews before spending money on it to see if it's something you really want.

												Okay I've played the first bit and have already given up. I was lucky to get this for practically nothing due to Humble Bundle, I paid $1 for 4 games so (this is just a guestimation) I may have payed like 20p for this game, so I shouldn't really complain.My first thoughts are... generic storyline that is similar to Skyrim? I'm not too sure. The controlles are alright but the combat seams way too clunky for me. I'll try and force myself to play some more and see how it is but for now this is all I have on the game after playing 20 or so minutes. I'll add more soon.			"

												I got this game for free by using a website that gives away free games for watching videos. I played the game for about 2 hours when I got it. It was a pretty good game for those two hours, but I found better games to play so I never beat this game. About 5 or so months later, I decided to finsih this game. I was not disappointed. The game brought a pretty good level of dificulty and if you like Syrim and this game is ever on sale for over 40% you should definitly pick it up. Don't buy at full price, it just isn't that great, and $15(I forget how much it costs) is too much for such a game.			"

												Calling this a budget Skyrim is an understatement. That said, the game isn't without merit. The best thing I can say for it is that the game doesn't wear out its welcome. Where it becomes an absolute chore for me to finish sprawling RPGs like an Elder Scrolls game, the main quest with some extras in Ravensword: Shadowlands took me about six hours. The combat mechanic is simple, but that's no different than most ARPGs. The screenshots posted are representative of the in game graphics, which look two console generations old at this point, but definitely not an eyesore. My biggest complaint is the plot. It is not at all compelling and the dialogue is painful. The main reason I finished this game was to take it off the pile. If your PC hardware is very oudated and you are unable to run Morrowind or Oblivion, or you are just looking for a short ARPG fix, you will probably get you $7 worth out of it, but you can definitely find a better game if you are willing to wait for a sale.

												It's entertaining enough for a couple bucks. I don't see what all the bad reviews are about. It's a basic RPG you level different skills like swords or bows or magic by using them. You spend points on attributes and things like silent hunter for stealth or a walking faster skill which is nice. Basic normal rpg stuff. The typical side quests like find my missing brother or bring me 8 bear hides. The main quest is pretty generic so far hunt down pieces of a magic sword to I'm assuming eventually put it together and kill the big bad guy at the end and save the world. Honestly it's a fun little old school no surprises rpg that you can kill an afternoon with and for $1.74 that I spent on it it's perfectly fine.			"

												I don't know why so many people say this is a bad game. Sure, I'd be disappointed if I had paid $15 for the game, but it only costs $7 now, and I got it on sale at Humble Bundle for $0.99 back in May, so I think I got a great deal on it.There's plenty wrong with the game, but nothing that really kills the enjoyability of it. No, it's not Skyrim. It's a mobile game that has been ported. From what I can tell, there isn't even any major expansion in this port, except for one additional step in the main quest and actually having to aim in a bow competition, which is fine at the current price. If I'm wrong about this, someone please let me know since I've never played the mobile version. Most of the problems can be traced back to Unity. Some of the glitches can hinder gameplay, like getting stuck in the environment, which only happened to me once, so it's important to save on a regular basis, especially before and after doing something dangerous or challenging.The basic gameplay was enjoyable for me, and I liked the straight forward quests. I would like to see more quests added to expand on the game. I really liked that the best gear is found, and not bought, although, you may need to buy some gear so you can survive to get the better equipment later in the game. On a first play-through, I kind of like a little bit of grinding, whether it's for experience or for gold, but in a shorter game like this, it would kill replay value.Basically, don't expect this to be Skyrim because it's not. Personally, I would hate to try playing this on my phone, so I'm glad I got it on PC. If you can't accept that it's a port of a mobile game, of course you will think it's lousy.I give it about 7.5/10To the developers: Cards and achievements would be nice, along with at least a list of quests to make sure I got them all covered, unless the quests were the achievements, which would also work.

												I have had this for a very long time, yet had never installed and tried it.  It came with one of the many Humble Bundles I purchased.  When I saw that there was no controller support, I immediately dismissed it (I play with my laptop hooked up to my TV, so it is much more convienant for me to use a gamepad).  It also looked to me like a bad Elder Scrolls, Gothic, the Witcher, or Two Worlds ripoff.  Today I decided to go ahead and give it a shot, and I am actually glad that I did.  The art style is a little bit different than Oblivion or Skyrim, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It grew on me rather quickly.  Again, having next to no great expectations (and that COULD be why things turned out as they did), I was actually impressed with things from the start.  The combat is just a notch above hack and slash, but with a bit of (somewhat picky) Elder Scrolls thrown in.  It can seem sluggesh, but once you get the hang of it then it is pretty satisfying.  I have only begun, so I cannot judge the story or dialogue so harshly yet, but it isn't terrible so far.  The more I play it, the more I see things that I like about it.Considering I had no intention of buying this might factor into my impressions (again, I have not played for very long at all--I did see enough to know that I want to see more that it has to offer, and that is actually saying something compaired to most things I have played lately.  My review may change as I progress, but as for now, I recommend this game.  There is something about it, despite how I know it looks, that is compelling.  Even though I was irritated by not being able to use my xbox controller, once I got over it, the controls really weren't all that bad.  I had to switch ""use"" with ""jump"" but hey, at least it let me do that.  :D  Surprisingly, a lot of the games I have been playing recently don't give you the option to, but that might be because I have been playing a lot of Early Access games.To conclude, give this game some thought and research before you immediately dismiss it.  I'm not sure offhand what the price of it is, but I don't recall it being  all that high.[edit: At the time of writing this, it is $6.99, and that isn't on sale or anything.  I haven't a clue as to the length of the game, but even if it ends up being rather short, that seems like a generously low price.]			"

												To be honest, I really did not enjoy this game. Though I usually don't base games on their graphics or sound effects; I do have to say they were quite poor for an MMO/RPG game. Of course I wouldn't be to critical on that, considering it was made with Unity. However, I was expecting better from the game for the price, though it is not really expensive. The game experience as far as the combat was acctually quite enjoyable because you acctually get to dodge attacks and aim at your target, unlike games where combat is only clicking spells or weapons. The ""spells"" in the game were unfortunatly not really spells, but were in fact rune stones that must be equiped by the player to use. I was also disappointed by the fact that the fire rune stone was extremely weak and drains your character's power far to quickly. Though the quests themselves were moderatly entertaining; I felt they could have been made better. Some quests are also to an extent, irritating to accoplish because they are not always visible on the in game map. There are also many other bugs in the game that I found such as my crossbow stopped working and I could no longer use it because of the bug. I tried buying a new bow and various other things, but it did not work. Clearly there are many things in this game that require improvement and is unfortunally not a game I would recommend to play.

												Disappointingly my five minutes with this game were enough for me to never want to touch it again. Movement is unresponsive and just dismal, it really feels like your head/neck is stuck in the one spot. Combat (at least with a sword) is shocking. Graphics are average (think somewhere between Gothic 2 and 3) and the dialogue system is slow. The only positive thing about my experience was that I had no issues going into window mode. Obviously as all this is only from five minutes of the game things might get better, they were bad enough however for me to not bother to find out.			"

KNOT (the k is on purpose..) worth it. I wouldn't pay free for this game. They tried to make an App into a real game.    1/10 (just to be nice)			"

												I'm sure everybody told you this is a good game and bad, so i will give you a recipe for pancakes instead:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon white sugar1 1/4 cups milk1 egg3 tablespoons butter, melted1. In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.			"

												It is a great RPG game for the price.... if it was 20 dollars than nahh but its 7 frickin dollars. It may not have a powerful storyline like bethesda's RPG games like skyrim and oblivion but it is totally worth the money asked for purchase. I found it fun but idk it may get boring after acouple of weeks but you have to put your heart into it and play it right because it isnt a bad game at all but I totally think its worth the 7 dollars and like I said if it was 20 or 30 then I wouldn't really mess with it until a sale or something but the gameplay is great the graphics are great everything is great except the main quest it still needs work and the last update they had was december 2013 soooo cresent moon just told ravensword 2 to screw off basically but it is still fun and entertaining			"

												Do I recommend this game? Read Below:Well, it's enjoyable if you go in knowing that it was ported from mobile.I played this on my tablet, so I knew that it was quite good and offers the best ""Skyrim""-like experience on the mobile market. It was ported to the PC rather competantly but the settings left a lot to be desired. I'd have loved to have seen many more options. But hey at least you can change resolution and key binds.Very rarely does this game drop below 60 FPS for me and playing with keyboard and mouse is SO much better than the touchscreen.It's like playing Dead Trigger 2 on PC, it just plays, runs and feels better on PC despite being designed primarily for mobile users. But never really shakes that ""mobile"" feel.So again, do I recommend the game? Yeah, it's enjoyable and good to sink a good few hours into, so you definitely get your moneys worth.But do I recommend BUYING the game? Yes. For £5 you can do a LOT worse and this game offers more hours of enjoyment than most other games of it's type and price.Cresent Moon Games, keep making great games and please, please, PLEASE add keyboard(and partial mouse support) and gamepad support to future games on mobile devices. I love playing games on my Android TV Stick.			"

												This game is overall a bad attempted port from a mobile. Being able to complete the game IN ITS ENTIRETY in 20 hours... Well, it doesnt come close to the level of depth i want from an RPG. The controls are glitchy, the game is grindy, its just plain not fun.			"

												Terrible game. Much worse than playing Morrowind. Targetting for ranged attacks are horrible! Game isn't enjoyable. There are a lot of bugs. A large rat couldn't find a path to me over another dead rat. Lots of pathing issues. No autosave function as far as I can see.			"

												Porting a bad mobile phone skyrim knockoff to the same platform as skyrim seemed like a good idea at the time?I got this game for free in a humble bundle.Games like this are the reason steam had to add an option to hide games from your library.			"

												This was a game i used to test my graphics cards on Linux but ended up playing further, I really enjoyed the gameplay, amazing graphics, really enjoyed the vast monsters, and updated weapons, lots of interesting quests and hiddden chests and then realised i could fly that was awsome. So any one wanting a relaxed game this was one of my favourites. It was not a big game but worth the price and I am checking out for other games from theses guys A+++++			"

												Pretty bad RPG. It's a mobile port and feels like it. Game looks about equal to morrowind, which game out in 2001. Towns have 1 guard on streets and 1 person in each building. Even in a tavern where you would normally see people and get quests, there's only 1 single person whos the owner at the bar. Each character has like 1 line of spoken dialogue and the rest you must read. Each area on map is the same boring open area with 2 different enemy types, usually animals or something generic like skeletons. Storyline is super boring and run of the mill. There are hilarious things, like how passageways to new areas and caves, are presented as empty rooms with no exit on the other side, which is just lazt programming. There a random spikes in difficulty, like having to fight multiple trolls at once that stun and can kill you in 3 hits. In these cases you never know if you need to grind higher levels or need to get better gear. The leveling system is bad. You gain levels, attributes, talents, and then you also get skills in things by utilizing them more, like bow weaponry, but it continues to have a higher ceiling as you level, and you keep reaching it. But it's never explained what exactly being 45/45 means for damage, etc. especially bc you also have talents  and attributes that boost it. Everything you need to buy costs way too much, even simple potions. There is really no magic at all. It's just a bad rpg, although not broken. 5.5/10.			"

												In all honesty, this really isn't that bad. I mean sure, it's pretty clunky here and there, it's not so tightly woven, and really, this could have been improved a smidge for the steam pc version. I think what many who are reviewing this so negatively are failing to realize or remember, is that this is actually a port. This was originally an app game on Amazon Apps and Google Play, not only that, but it's a pretty old app, a fair few years old. And as we all know, app games have come a long way since then to now. But still, if there may be any updates (hopefully) in the future, I would hope that this game would be updated,  revised, and expanded upon. It's not a bad premise in story, it's your basic medieval fantasy theme, and it's got all the basics of an rpg on set. It would be nice if this game were fixed up, but given what it was before steam pc, and how old it is with how limited it was when it was only in app stores, it's understandable as to it being the way it is.It's not the best, but I'd hardly label it the worst. I've seen worse than this, a lot worse. Some even here on Steam.It's pretty traditional, but it's still pretty good. As long as ya realize what this game essentially was before hand, it's actually not so bad			"

												I probably would have recommended this game as it was my only real RPG outlet when I used Linux exclusively, but it's hard to recommend an unpolished game that hasn't been updated since 2013.Everything feels slow and clunky, and the NPCs literally have no soul. They just stand around. The world doesn't feel alive in the slightest.It's also incredibly short. Look at the hours I have on record for this game, and yes, I've completed it.Honestly, if the developer cared enough to release regular updates, I'd probably change my opinion. Just go buy Morrowind if you don't already own it. The combat feels just as stiff, but at least you get an expansive, beautifully animated world in Morrowind.			"

												I can't tell you about the actual game. But the things I experienced leave only one conclusion: Complete garbage. For years the game has been in a bugged state. Mouse constantly pulls upwards and the character jumps rapidly arround the map with a click.			"
