												With a game like this, a game that seems like it should be so good, it's difficult to tell from reviews alone whether or not it's worthwhile. I knew going in that the game had a lot of negative reviews, but it was impossible not to at least give it a try and I'll admit, I really, really wanted this game to be good. I mean, it just sounds like it should be awesome. It's basically like Terraria, a game I currently have nearly 2,000 hours of playtime in, with the ship-building mechanic from Space Engineers, and set in a richly detailed steampunk world of floating islands and flying sky whales. There's no way this isn't the greatest game ever made. Right?Sadly, it's not the greatest game ever made. In fact, it's not a great game at all, or even a good game, or even a mediocre game. Windforge is a game which is fundamentally, fatally flawed. By way of explaining how, and because lists are easy to write, allow me to present to you The Top 3 Things Wrong With Windforge!3. The GraphicsHere's the thing about the graphics: some of them actually look amazing. The flying whales and the krakens that live in the lower regions of the world, and the larger objects like the giant balloons and clocktowers, are all lovingly rendered. The watercolor background is pretty nice too. It's obvious that the developers really worked hard on the graphics. So what is up here?It looks blocky and awful, like my house is built from stacked up lincoln logs. This is because there's no blending or tiling with the graphics, which is weird because even Starbound and Terraria have that. Also, there's an awful lot of these blocks. In Terraria your character is three blocks tall, and in Starbound it's four. Here? Freaking eight! These blocks are tiny is what I'm getting at, which makes construction and destruction a massive chore.What else makes construction a chore? The painfully bad attempt at 2.5D graphics. Everything is in this weird 3/4ths view which I'm sure the developers thought was just so cool, but really it just gets in the way. It's hard to know what block you're digging at with your jackhammer when you're mining, and it's hard to see what you're doing when you're building on a ship or a home base.Also, what's with my furniture? It looks like it's just painted onto the wall instead of actually sitting on the floor.2. What Do These Numbers Mean?I'll admit, math was never my big thing. I mean, I'm not completely stupid with numbers, but it never came as easy to me as other things. That said, what the hell do these numbers mean?My ship's mass is only 524, and I have 1,389 vertical thrust, so shouldn't I be able to move up and down fairly well? No, I can't. For that matter, why is my vertical thrust only 1,389? My three propellers provide a total thrust of 13,500 (4,500 x 3), so how is that counteracted so greatly by a mass of only 524? And shouldn't my bouyancy of 30,000 totally cancel out the mass issue anyway? Honestly, it wouldn't be that big of a deal if I just knew what these numbers meant. Is my mass 524 kilograms? 524 tons? Who knows? The fact that there are no units given for these numbers just makes them all feel arbitrary.And no, I'm not so stupid that I can't figure out adding a few extra propellers will let me move again, but I shouldn't have to guess at it. And if you DO want me to have to guess at it, then why bother giving me the numbers at all? It's not like they matter.This issue doesn't only affect airships either. It's also a problem with armor, weapons, pretty much everything. Earlier in the game my character picked up a set of bronze full plate armor. I was excited because it gave her 30 more defense than my old set of leather-bronze bandit armor, so I put it on and went out to fight some people, and noticed that the bandits who were previously dealing 46 points of damage a shot with their pistols were now doing... 46 points of damage a shot. Seriously, what the Hell do these numbers mean?!1. MovementSo, if I was designing a game about floating islands and airships, and I had to name what I thought would be the single most important aspect of the gameplay, the one thing that I absolutely had to make sure I didn't screw up no matter what, I would have to say that would be a good jumping mechanic. I mean, we're dealing with a game world where one missed jump means, at best, you fall and break your everything on the next floating island down, or at worst you fall all the way into the planet's core and burn to death. That's not a pleasant way to go.That said, this game has what might just be the worst jumping algorithm of any game I've ever played. You move too fast, and it's too hard to control where you end up. Even walking is dangerous, as stepping off a slope means the jumping algorithm takes over and sends you rocketing over the nearest ledge straight to your death. I found that latching my grappling hook on to the ground was a necessary step whenever I was near a ledge, so that when I fell I would at least be able to stop myself.Oh yeah, and let's talk about the grappling hook. I'll admit it's fun to swing around on and feel like I'm a steampunk Spiderman. Even so, the grappling hook isn't much better than anything else. It's too fiddly and too slow, it never seems to connect when you need it to, or else it connects to the wrong thing. Even when it does connect right, it's too unpredictable; sometimes you just stop and hang there, and other times you spin around at high speed, usually straight into your airship's propellers.That brings us to the last mode of movement: airships. Airship movement is... passable. It's a bit wonky sometimes itself, mostly due to inertia and the difficulty of making yourself come to a complete stop. (Seriously, Space Engineers had the inertial dampener system for a reason, Windforge developers.) Also, my ship felt like it had a weird desire to keep drifting upward which always made it very hard to dock properly. Of course, there's also the weirdness of the numbers which I mentioned before, where you always seem to have either not enough thrust so you can barely move, or else too much so you rocket across the map with a slightest touch of the buttons. It's a good thing repairs to your airship are free, because you will crash into things constantly.My Rating: 2/5 BADI find that the games I give a rating of 2 out of 5 are generally ambitious failures, and this is no exception. It's clear to me from the detailed nature of this game that the developer really wanted to do a good job. The artwork is great, aside from the afore-mentioned problems. The game world is very interesting and well thought out.It's just a shame that the game they built around this concept is so poorly built. Like Dr. Frankenstein before him, the developer brought his creation to life as a shambling mess that can barely function and will probably end up being the death of us all - I know it's sure killed me more than a few times.Original review posted here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com] "

												This game could be soooo good,  but the movement, controlls, and buidling/minig are all terribly frustrating in a not-fun kind of way.  It's such a good concept, but Devs aren't focusing enough on game play details.  Every negative review I read on here before buying is correct.-Character control is terrible.  It uses an acceleration based system that doesn't accelerate fast enough and acceleration doesn't go away fast enough.  So, if you tap a key to move left, about 1/2 second later your character shoots to the left and slides to a stop.  Good luck trying to navigate all the cliffs and islands with this terrible movement system.  It really doesn't make sense that the devs sit around testing this game and think to themselves ""yeah, these controls are really good, everyone will like this.""  Maybe they just got used to how bad it is.  I have spent way too much time trying to get used to the♥♥♥♥♥♥controls in this game.  They need to go play terraria (or any other successful side scroller) and see how responsive that is and match it.-Because of the 2.5 D and the fact that there is a weird generic non-tiled overlay on the edges of what you are mining,  when you mine to your left you cant see what you are mining.-2.5 D is cool in theory but makes building and mining pretty frustrating.  I'm not sure what they can do about it at this point, so I'm just trying to get used to it.- Way too easy to make a fortune by selling random crap blocks.-Crafting UI needs work, and more sub-categories.  Pretty much everything is categorized under Misc. or Building.- Frequent crashes losing hours of progress (remember to save...).Those things may not sound like a big deal, but they make the game really difficult to play and suck the fun right out of it.  They have more work to do and as it stands I would not reccomend this game.  If they fix the above things, it would be as fun as terraria, with an awesome spin.			"

No, don't buy it. It isn't worth it.. It's buggy and unfinished.They gave up. They will mostly never update the game because they ""have bigger projects now"". They ran with the money and thats all. 1 euro is enough for this game. Hell even free.			"

												Steampunk?YES.Custom-built airships that you control and fly yourself?YES.Terraria ripoff?YE-well, okay.Combining them?YES YES YES.This game?NO.I have no idea what the hell happened! This idea is everything I'd ever wanted to see in a game! But the artstyle is just so jumbled, the controls are awkward, the semi-isometric view is distracting and it just boils down to an unpleasant experience. It's a major disappointment for me.I'd love to see someone tackle this idea again, and do something better with it. But as it stands, I just didn't like this.			"

												You get to build your own airship piece by piece and then fly it around.  If that sounds good to you then you should get this game.Other good things:  -The materials you make your ship out of determine its durability and maneuverability.-There is a story and an endgame, but you can keep playing after you've finished it.-The materials you make your equipment out of affect the stats of the items.-The grappling hook is fun.-The late-game gas makes for some tense exploration moments when you have to get out of your ship.-Increasing your stats gives you very useful perks.-You have one chest of infinite holding and can place access points to it anywhere which makes item storage very simple.  Some may view this as a negative.-Ramming other ships is super fun.Bad things:-The controls take some getting used to.  Everything has some weird kind of intertia to it, plus every ship I made had a tendency to drift.-The view makes building a pain.  Foreground blocks can obscure the view of background blocks that they are not actually covering which makes it difficult to tell if your ship is airtight.-There is only one method of fast travel and it is not very useful.  You will spend a lot of time just flying from one location to another.-Building a stationary base is pointless.  The lack of fast travel means you would spend even more time just travelling to and from the base.  The power system in the game doesn't really update properly in a stationary base so it is hard to get power to devices without using a lot of generators.  It's even harder to get a stationary base airtight partly due to the view but also because you can't tell if the generated background blocks are blocking gas or not.  The item chest makes it so you don't need an area to store items.  I understand the point of the game is to build flying bases but some people would probably like to have a stationary one as well.-Monster spawning can drive you nuts.  When a kraken spawns right beside you while you're looting a ship and you don't notice it until it has rammed a hole right through your ship and then you kill the kraken and just finish repairing your ship when another spawns right beside you and does the same thing.I played through the game twice to get all of the achievements and enjoyed both playthroughs.

												I just completed this game and felt like I should chime in on what I liked and disliked.At first I felt like this was going to be like Terraria, it is and it isn't. It's very much its own game, themed around progression through crafting.The setting is unique, in that it's flying ships and floating islands. The ships vary from houses to battleships. There's different factions in the game but there's no way to increase or decrease your standing with any, which would have been a nice feature but it's also not necessary. The cities are very unique but in their uniqueness I'd also complain that they're really hard to navigate at first as they have an almost randomly generated feel.. I have no idea if this is the case as I know the bulk of the game is procedurally generated but it wouldn't shock me to find out this is the case.The world itself is massive, by the time I had completed the game I had been through roughly half of it.. I say 'been through' but for the most part I didn't explore half of the areas I went into and just sailed through them quickly on my way to places. I bought every crafting recipe I came across and still had about a hundred that I hadn't discovered also.The downsides to the game in my opinion, were that I started skipping vast areas of the game because it felt like it was just going to be more of the same.. I'm sure I missed things, there's likely entire types of generated structures that I didn't stumble upon but after I had explored a few areas of each type it felt like the rest of the areas were going to be like that and there were a huge amount of them.The game also makes itself too easy on you. There should absolutely be difficulty settings, it feels like the game itself is stuck on easy for this type of game as it has no death penalty in the slightest. You lose no gear when you die, you don't have to retrieve corpses or craft new gear.. essentially after you've upgraded your gear to the next tier there's literally no point in going out and mining that type of metal again, especially in the late game when you're mining the zones seem to throw abundant amounts of low level metals at you that barely serve a purpose.The game also instantly hands you a 'radio' which is a no expense, unlimited use, get out of jail free card. It's ridiculous. It says it wont work 'if it's too dangerous' but in my experience dangerous in the radio's opinion is indoors or while actually falling. Some of the funnest experiences I had in the game involved not using the radio and grappling onto passing ships or whales to carry me to other places or to hijack the ship completely as my own. I can understand there being situations in the game where you're stranded and you need a way out, but I'd like to bring up the point again that there is no death penalty in the game. Dying serves exactly the same purpose as the radio and it's always possible to die. There needs to be a penalty for both or at least difficulty settings that add such a thing.Another issue I had with the game was that you spend a large amount of the game learning to craft 4 exotic materials. They appear to be the highest grade materials in the game, but through playing the game I never had access to the materials as I never gained the materials to create the furnace required to make them. I checked the forums and this issue was listed as fixed but it absolutely wasn't.It feels a little silly to complain about this, as the materials I did have access to made me incredibly overpowered by the end of the game anyways. The final boss battles were amoungst the easiest I've ever had in a game as the damage was just practically non existant. I'd like to pat myself on the back for some clever strategies on some of them but at the same time I almost feel like it was possibly poor design and incredibly poor AI that made it possible.These points aside, I found the game genuinely fun and I would recommend it. It has it's flaws and it took a while to grow on me but after it did I was sucked in for a few solid days until completion.			"

												Great game, if only it didn't crash after a white screen with no errors. Not to mention that the developers completely abandoned it a year ago. I really liked this game... while it was playable for me.Edit: I'm going to review the actual gameplay, Props to Mr. Cheese for pointing my flaws out. The setting and the atmosphere are what make this game. Being able to build a sky fortress out of Balloons and Propellers make you feel awesome, not to mention the different layers of the world that make the game exciting. What made the game not reccomended by me:Me and others have had the white screen crash, that appears when you start the game every time, making it unplayable. If you think it's worth the risk, pick up the game. If it works, you will not be disapointed.EDIT # 2: Okay, so I got the game to work, it must have been an update that windows ran, the only time I'm genuinely happy that windows auto updated, really. I'm keeping the not reccomended because of that: it is NOT optimized well, the frame rate drops regularly, but the game is still good.			"

												You will not regret buying this game! Very interesting world. Great gameplay. The mining is a pit finicky but other than that it plays very well. The airship mechanices are amazing! I wish starbound had the same depth for the ships as this does for the airships. If you want a game that lets you build, maintain, and upgrade your own fleet of airships in a sidescroller steampunk world then this is the game for you! This game does not hold your hand, you have to use your brain. I have found many modern gamers take issue with this fact. I say to those people that they need to play blaster master and many other classic games. Modern games hold your hand too much so this is very refreshing.Graphics rock, flying whales which you can harvest rock. The ship to ship combat is awesome. Just don't fall out of your airship, it is a long drop!!			"

												Windforge is a lot of fun - i've been following the game for a few years now, having played it at PAX 2013, and the alpha as a kickstart supporter.  As an open world game it's a lot of fun - you can build and explore as you want.  There's all kinds of different creatures, environments, etc. to explore.  There's also a fantastic variety of weapons, building blocks, ship parts, etc. to use in the game.  So it keeps you interested.  I haven't played all the way through the story, but it's pretty interesting as well, so you can at least have some objectives and targets in the game, if it's too open world.  It can be challenging at some points, building ships that can try to take on skywhales (good luck), but after time you get better and better at building things - think about Skyrim, the first time you fought a dragon you probably died and by the end of it dragons were no problem, right!  For people who like minecraft, but want something deeper, and with a story, this is a lot of fun.  I also really like the art style throughout the game, it's not pixel or super simple like minecraft, but much more artistic and colourful.  I'm hoping that if enough people buy the game, they add the option for multiplayer - I would love to set up a server of Cordeus, with friends who could build and play all together (imagine a ship with 4 people on it roving around the planet!).  Overall, highly recommended!			"

												I keep seeing people say that this feels like early-access, and I agree. The inventory system is a joke, crafting is clunky, enemies often randomly despawn if you so much as blink, temples are annoying as all hell...But... good lord do I love this game!It caught my eye early-ish in development and seemed like an interesting premise, but the not-so-great reviews when it came out made it seem like quite a let-down. Seeing it in a bundle, I went for it, as I was curious.And despite its faults, this game would be worth full-price.The whole ""the ocean is the sky!"" concept is great fun. The music is beautiful. The crafting, despite its clunky nature, is quite nice. But more than anything, what really makes this game stand out is its absolutely amazing atmosphere.I can't remember the last time a game drew me into its world as efficiently as this one has. From the forested skylands of the mid-realm, to the airy plateaus and meteor showers of the upper realm and down to the downright alien poison gas-choked lower realms, I haven't had this much fun with exploration in a long time. Good job.It's not without its faults; far from it. But as far as I'm concerned, the good very much outweighs the bad and the ugly.Devs are still working on it, so some of the issues may yet get resolved. If they don't, I do hope they learn from their mistakes in the sequel (and I do hope they make a sequel).			"

												Most of the negativity surrounding this game is based on its unrealised potential. And to be fair, Windforge is not a game that could be considered ""complete"" - there's numerous areas it could have done with more work, from story to the conspicuous lack of multiplayer.(Ok, there's a pretty prolific bug that might kill the game before it starts up as well, but for the sake of argument we'll ignore that.)But despite this, despite what it never quite had, Windforge is a phenomenal game, and it's a true testiment to its solid design that it still achieves what many other full games fail to.Ostensibly, Windforge fits into the same genre as games like Terraria and Minecraft, but whereas those sand-box world-builders are divided into sections of ""building bases"" or ""fighting badguys"" (and very little inbetween) - your building efforts directly correlate to combat-success, because you're building flying bases.This, coupled with a solid crafting system that never sees older materials being upper-classes by newer ones (Early-game Iron is often a component for more resilient later-game alloys as an example), the enjoyable combat and movement, with the added aesthetics of stunning visuals and an amazing soundtrack makes Windforge the sort of game you can easily sink tens or hundreds of hours into.And it has to be said, Cordeus (the world of Windforge) is one of the best realised game worlds ever. Mechanically it gently encourage the player to up their game and rebuild their ship/gear through the environment alone. Falling meteors in the upper atmo? You might want to protect your hydrogen balloons then! Poisonous gas on the lower level? Pack an air purifier and/or breath aparatus.It's amazing how the game can flip from platformer to near-lovecrafting survival from one zone to the next, though of course, a skilled player can often play around these, but it's nice to know there's the option to craft a solution as well.I don't disagree that this game could have been more, but even with what you've got, it's a worthwhile experience.So if, like me, you're looking for something different, give windforge a go, but if you want something that's highly polished and can be played with mates, maybe give it a miss.

												Windforge is another entry into the gaming genre I'll call ""2-D world-mining-sandbox"". In the past few years this genre has really exploded after the success of Terraria. So what does Windforge bring to the table that could make it really stand out? The graphics are something to behold, at times they are glorious. There's also the fact that instead of building a small base like in many of the games you can build air-ships that you can actually pilot around the world of sky islands. However right now the game is really held back by the controls.The first notable difference between this and other games of it's type is the perspective. It's got a titled perspective that gives the blocks a ""3-D"" view, even though the characters and gameplay are still 2-D. It really makes the looks stand out when compared to the others of the type and is very distinctive. The tile sets are also very comprehensive allowing things to really be customized. There exists a type of ""fog of war"" that covers parts of islands that haven't been explored. It uses a generic tile and pastes it areas that haven't been explored yet.The graphical choices have lead to some clunky gameplay that really needs to be refined. The shape of the tiles can make it difficult to know exactly which one you're mining(or building) at any time. When trying to do things like clear tunnels though land it can be quite annoying; you end up having to just hold the mouse button down and hover over the whole area hoping to knock out the one that's blocking your way. The fog-of-war patterns can also be sorta confusing as they're not always clearly defined from the other aspects of the game. You can easily think you're jumping to safety only to find what you thought was a solid wall was really just a fog-of-war pattern that covered empty space as you fall to your death.The combat in the game is another major difference between this and other sandbox world-mining games. The player driven combat is more ranged based. You'll be using guns most of the time and firing and dodging bullets is an important part of gameplay. However the bullet speed is very low, so don't expect much challenge in this department. It's very easy to simply hide, shoot, hide and defeat almost any enemy on foot. You can also do the tricks common to this type of game such as building a wall that prevents enemies from reaching you, but allows you to shoot through if you want to further reduce the difficulties.The airships are what really sets this game apart. You can create airships of many different shapes and sizes. You combine balloons, engines, propellers, guns, controls, and design elements as you wish. It allows you to truly create some airships that are beautiful, functional, or even both. The air combat can be a bit rough at first, but it gets better fairly fast. It's a lot more enjoyable than that of the player character. Unfortunately you do still have to get off the airship to gather resources or strip defeated enemy airships of their parts, and the clunky character controls make that rough.In the end the character controls simply kill this game. They're just too floaty to find enjoyable. The grappling hook(which plays a major part of a game involving sky-islands) just makes it worse. The thing moves so slow it's almost nearly useless when you need it to save you, and a pain in the butt when you don't. The physics are okay in the airships, but once you get on foot they get really strange. Your character can swing around at insane speeds sometimes and other times will just fall straight down. The character controls lead to many deaths that really felt cheap and like true time wasters. So in the end right now I'd say to give it a pass, I just can't get past the character controls. Some of the airship parts I got a glimpse at makes it seem as if they get really cool later on. I mean there's giant grinders you can attach to your ship to grind up the sky islands from the air. How badass is that? Multiple types of ship guns to take down enemies of types. Giant sky whales to really test your airship in battle. I just wish the ground play was  a bit more together and didn't make me want to pull my hair out.  Maybe they'll work these things out and focus more on the things that could make this game cool. Increase bullet speed and other factors to make ground combat a challenge. Rework time wasters by making ground mining faster and movement tighter. Rework grappling hook all together. Then you'd have a game based on fast bullet dodging reflexes on ground and air with tight movement, would be a great game and really different from the others in this genre.			"

												TLDR: DO NOT GET THIS. The game is stupid hard near the end, physics are glitchy at best, and the devs gave up on the game. What more do you need to know?I bought the game a couple years ago, it was fun for a while untill it became a massive grind. I would spend hours upgrading my ship just to go into the gas layer and get insta-killed by a squid. Half the times I would lucky enough to kill a squid or whale it would just fall out of the zone leaving me with no loot. The temples are easy enough if you can spam healing items to walk across the traps. The bosses at the end of each temple though are impossible to kill unless you are able to use the guns on your ship.I left this game three weeks after purchase and waited for it to get better, since then, they have only updated it a couple times with a changelog you could fit on your phone screen.

												I think there's lots of potential here, but the fundamentals are not in place. Too much of the basic mechanics is awkward. For example, the player moves quite fast, but this makes precise positioning difficult. But to move downward through a hatch you must be EXACTLY in the right spot. If you don't stop precisely in the center, you just run right over it. There are too many hatches in this game to sit there fighting the controls trying to get through each one.Another very fundamental mechanic with problems is block placement and destruction. They've opted for a 2.5D isometric presentation here, which looks good in screenshots, but causes difficulty during play. Every block is something like 1x1x4, which means they overlap one another and it's hard to pick out exactly the one you want to break, or to place one in exactly the right spot. It's just very confusing compared to the true 2D of Terraria.At this point I have to recommend NOT to buy this game. Once these fundamentals are addressed, that will hopefully change. There's a lot of potential here.			"

												Windforge is a game that is simultaneously the best and worst kind of game I've played.ok, let me elaborate.It's an amazing concept: this gaseous world where you build your own steamships and go across it and hunt (or save) sky whales and other cool stuff, and don't even get me started on the gas layer!the execution is, lacking, to say the least. The game seems to crash more and more the more I play it, not to mention the complete lack of dialogue or proper aerodynamic physics (shape of your airship doesn't matter as much as it should)if the devs were to come back or, hell, even sell the rights to another developer who would fix the bugs and all that, they could make the game a really good buy. that's it. all they need to do is make the game FUNCTIONAL. unfortunately, that's too much to ask.tl;dr it's a great idea, but horribly executed, so only give it a try if you're willing to put up with A *LOT* of flaws for the sake of a few awesome ideas with potential			"

												If The Beatles had made Windforge, they'd have titled it ""Terraria in the Sky With Diamonds.""*  You mine a lot of resources; you craft a lot of armor, weapons, and tools; you kill a lot of bugs, dragons, squid, and people for profit; you buy and sell with various traders; you build lots of airships (because there's never any reason to build a house).  Now it's no Terraria, but it's fun enough once you get used to some of its quirks.Ways in which Windforge distinguishes itself:• It has a nice stat leveling system that allows for customizing your character's abilities, though the goal is to eventually max out every stat.• Building airships is actually pretty fun.  And because no single ship is right for every situation, you'll build several.  Will you go with a slow, highly armored gunship that doubles as your base of operations, or something small and speedy but defenseless?  Will it resist acid or fire?  Will it float!?  Testing and refining your designs is almost worth the price of admission alone.  I think.  How much is this game again?• It dares to go against politically correctness and encourages whaling.  Take THAT, you animal rights fascists!• Features a hyper-realistic** prison break simulation.• Likely no other game allows you to fall so far, for so long to your death.Anyway, if you loved Terraria, you won't regret buying Windforge.* To be honest, diamonds don't factor into the game much.  It doesn't have to make sense.  The Beatles were doing a lot of drugs at the time.  Just go with it.  The diamonds aren't used for crafting anything, but you can sell 'em for a quick buck.  You'll make most of your money through selling off the parts of ships you've pirated and dismantled.  I guess they could've called it ""Terraria in the Sky With Pirate Scrap,"" but that isn't as fun to hear when you're tripping balls.***** Not really. Vaguely.*** This review in no way should be understood to endorse tripping balls. "

												Good concept, poor execution.Start with Terraria, then add a plot-line, high-res graphics, and cool concepts like airships and sky whales, etc. From there, take away usable controls, tolerable interfaces, decent animation, functional map areas, etc.Getting around the place is a pain because inertia is handled poorly, so you feel like you're on skates sometimes, and jumping feels very awkward.The interfaces are similar to what you'd find in other games of the genere, and they're nicely drawn, but they're ergonomically frustrating. You figure them out after playing with them for a while, but they seem to have only the bare minimum of functionality required to use them. Why can't I use the mouse wheel to change between items in my hotbar? When I craft a workstation, why do I have to place it in my hotbar and then select it and use it in order to place it?The character animations look pretty damned stupid, (this is common for games that try to use hand-drawn art, but in this case it's exaggerated because the guy re-orients his limbs and torso to look at the cursor and ends up looking like a marionette).The maps are sort of ridiculous. Yeah, you're way up in the air in a world that apparently has poisonous gas instead of a surface. The game autosaves from time to time, so if you manage to fall, you'd better just break out and load the last autosave immediately. If you let it go for a screen or two it's going to save while you're falling, and your descent is going to pass several screens and end with your doom. You don't respawn either. If you die it's game over, and you can load a save. It does keep 2 autosaves, but it seems like a far better solution to just design sane areas.Hit boxes are almost like an experience in coin flipping, which is exacerbated by the fact that your weapon fire is not precise, so even if you manage to aim perfectly at the high speed critters that are whipping back and forth again and again like ducks in a shooting gallery, you have to fire three or four times to get a straight shot, and then the bullet has a 50/50 chance of passing right through the thing. You think I'm exaggerating? Try mining something. You stand right next to a stationary object with the jackhammer out and you place the cursor over the tile you want to mine. Something else gets torn up, probably in the background somewhere, and you have to creep the mouse around in circles until you find whatever bizarre sweet-spot the tile's hit-box is on. Want to mine the tile immediately beneath that one? Well, you can try moving the cursor straight downward, but honestly it's a crap shoot. You may or may not end up mining the tile you're after.In any case, considering that Terraria sells for $10 at full price and $2 on sale, I'm sort of miffed that I kept this $15 turd on my wishlist for so long. I was excited when I finally got my hands on it, and pretty badly disappointed when I finally played it.			"

												This game was a lot of fun while it lasted, and has a feature that as far as I am aware is 100% unique. You can build your own ship however you want, outfit it however you want and fly it around an entire planet. That alone is worth the buy if you're after that. The reason I don't recommend it though is that it was completely dropped by it's developers while it was still in early development and as such was a huge disappointment. It's unpolished and pretty broken in places. If you get it, expect about a week or two before the novelty of flying about gets old.			"

												I don't know what happened with this game - back in the day it used to work. Was wonky, but workedToday and a few weeks ago I was trying with a new character, and I couldn't even finish the tutorial - at it's end (?) my ship blows up and flies away from the screen - in my previous save I arrived at the crash site without my ship (including the tutorial-NPC on it), in my latest save I can't even leave the screen/location (but my ship apparently did) because I get an error message about failed to load the tutorial NPC. Pressing map button and then returning to the game continues it, but if I would leave the cell of the location, it throws me back with the same error message to the same autosave. Screenshot[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]  The game starts, but it's not playeable at all. Which is a pity, because designing own ships, attacking others flying ships and dismantle them to make money, hunting flying whales for their meat (it's possible to make their carcass into ships) was just badass. The 2.5D block placement is really painful, and I'm sure that the grappling hook shouldn't be treated as a rigid object because I can use it as a pogo-stick to go superfast on various terrains, but these half-broken features gave it charm. But today there's nothing left from the charm, as it simply breaks at the start.  I think I tried it with 5 different characters, different classes, absolutely new saves... Don't buy this game, especially that it's development ended, it's abandoned, and it's broken beyond being enjoyable :\			"

												Pros: + Extremely vertical and varried world. If you fall, you could end up falling for miles+ Decent exploration. You never know what you will run into.+ Airship battles+ Abandoning your airship to sabotage another from the inside.+ Fire system. It can spread, and take out your entire ship if you're not careful.+ Sky whales. Enough said?+ The most terrifying underworld I've ever seen. Honestly, I don't think I can ever go down there.+ Grapple hooks. Better swinging mechanics than most spider man games.+ Using animals as parachutes. Not that I would do something so cruel...+ Allowing you to attempt to fix your airship while in free fall, instead of just saying game over.+ Allowing you to get stuck in areas if your ship gets shot down and you don't have another+ Hijacking other ships.+- Ship Ammo at first is hard to come by, but it did lead to the most epic demolition derbys ever so I'm not sure thats a con Cons: - optimisation is a bit meh. It dropped into the single digits on my nvidia770 during a few of the scripted sequences. Specifically the ones where a lot was happening, buildings turning to sand and such.-  Loot system can be a bit mean when I spend forever shooting a crazy armored guy with my weak gun and he drops a walnut to congradulate me.- Camera doesn't zoom out as far as I'd like when flying airships. I've hit more buildings than I can count because of this. Overall: Way better than they get credit for. Not many games let you fail as hard as this one, and even fewer let you manually climb all the way back up every time you do.			"

												This game surprised me. Literally out of nowhere, with a huge amount of content. Where did they hide it for all this time?It's got some incredbile vibes. The world is atmospheric (ha!), with skywhales floating around peacefully, pirates ambushing travelers, wonders and many many dangers...The process of building and flying an airship is pure joy. Having a grappling hook right from the start, also, opens up for a lot of cool moments. Disable that ship engine? Grapple over to it, knifing the crew out, and start stripping it bare for repairs after the fierce battle... then jump out as the last engine of the flying carcass dies out to a fire, barely managing to rappel yourself back to your shipIt has some quirks. Hit detection is a bit off. There's some evident screen-tearing when moving on foot at high speed, and the occasional crash paired with the not so generous autosave makes for some frustration (thankfully, you can save anywhere)It is incredibly open, which means you'll both be able to screw yourself over completely by going almost right off the bat in areas meant for waaaay higher levels (the death penalty is simply respawning in town, which considering the size of the world, is both good and bad), leaves you with almost no direction whatsoever after the small tutorial... but that also gives it that incredible exploration vibe. This world is brutal, huge, and beautiful. Expect to run away often with barely any ship leftHopefully, this will be patched to solve the issues. But I do highly recommend it, even in its current form			"

												This is a game that really hit a lot of spots for me. Floating islands, leviathans in the sky, design and pilot your own airship, with a formula like that how could you go wrong? I'd argue that in a finished game you probably couldn't but this is far from a finished game.A kickstarter project that perhaps overestimated how far it would be carried there are a lot of features that simply haven't made it into the game yet. Crew, additional enemies, actual decent levels of character customisation and AI mechanics that aren't stupid among them. Multiplayer is said to be implemented in the future and I would wait until then before you buy Windforge. As it stands, the game is clunky, both hard to control and hard to move around in. Random encounters seem to glitch in and out, perhaps spontaneously combusting off of screen and crucial NPCs have a disturbing habit of dying. Indeed, my starting tutorial NPC threw herself off of my airship like a lemming.			"

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/windforge-first-impressions/Sure, the game looks like a ripoff of Terraria or Starbound, but its actually quite fun, even if its fundamentally the same as the others.This, however, does not come without some issues. For one, it's very difficult to tell if you're actually destroying anything because the cursor is kinda difficult to see and there's little feedback from drilling something. That'd be my primary issue with the game. Other than that, the game is quite fun. There's plenty of exploring to be done and things to be built (and destroyed!). The game even has a quest system, which I didn't really feel was necessary, but it was a cool addition anyways.I can recommend the game, but be prepared for a few technical flaws.			"

												It started as a game with very high hopes, an extremely unique engine, and of course, none of what most people hoped it would become ever materialized.  Call it the fault of the early days of early access, I've got all these games in my library, I'll keep buying them regardless, but Windforge just sort of...  Came and went.  Content would have been great, but the pseudo-random nature of the game is not only unintuitive but tiresome.  Nothing really feels complete or fleshed out.  Just like all the rest, we can all get misty-eyed on the promise of what stuff could've been, but really, I never really got the impression that the developers of this game really had a lot of interest in their own project.  Ever.  Oh well.			"

												The game had a lot of potential but it just falls flat. The story is aweful [and ends extremely ubruptly], the map is both large enough to be annoying to get around and small enough to not provide a lot to see, the skill system is pretty heavily unbalanced. I will give it to the game that it's main focus, the ship building, is solid, and killing that killing a space kraken, hollowing it out, and building a ship in it, is very satisfying.

Product received for free
												I got this for free ages ago, and it's basically been collecting dust in my Steam collection.  A few days ago, I rectified this, and was not disappointed.One of my main highlights went something like this:- Explore the upper third of the map- Get blown to bits by a meteor storm- Somehow survive the onslaught- A sky whale rams what's left of the ship- Fall through the ship to my doom- Continue falling, somehow hitting nothing on the way down- End up suffocating to death in the lower atmosphere before I even hit the ground10/10 would choke on volcanic gases againThere is a story, but it's kind of inconsequential aside from collecting things for recipes to improve your ship, which all goes towards swashbuckling adventures, airship battles, sky-piracy, whaling, and exploration.Also the king is non-binary, being referred to in dialogue as ""ze"" and ""zir"", which is rarely seen in video games.

												I'll start off with this:   I absolutely love windforge. The game is absolutely stellar.  It is set in an open steampunk world where you can explore the skies and find so many incredible things hiding around.  However there are a few reasons I can't recommend this game without seroiusly considering its cons.I'll start with the pros.Pros  The game looks very nice.  It's not fantastic by any stretch, but the graphics fit fairly well.  It has some excellent music.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, doesn't contain that many songs.  It's got a fairly deep crafting system.  There's a whole load of stuff you can make, from fire infused gatling guns, to   sausages you can beat people with.  Airships are completely customizable.  You can make it look any way you want, and still be relatively functional.  There's absolutely no limits to the ship building system.   The grappling hook is so much fun.  Leap off your ship and sink your grappling hook into the one your boarding, swing up onto deck, and take out the people there with your custom made weapon.It saddens me to bring this part, but here are the cons.Cons The game world is made up of zones, which become fairly cramped as your ship grows. Many zones have no reason to explore.  They lack a landmark and are rather boring. The character devopment system could have been done better.  It's not terrible, but by no means is it adequate. The story is cliche and bland.  It's there, and it guides you through the world, but it isn't that fun. It's not really an RPG at all. The world and the lore is so interesting, yet the game lacks the depth to bring it to fruition.As much as I would like to reccomend this game, I can't.  Unless you are looking for a steampunk game where you can board ships, build ships and explore the world, I would recommend against buying this game.  It feels like an unfinished product compared to many great indie games that exist out there.  All of this being said, I look forward to playing the next game that is released by Snowed In Studios.  I hope they can fix the issues that plagued Windforge and compound on its successes.			"

Obviously it will have a few bugs, as it just came out recently, but you can look past it if you try.Definately worth the price, 8.5/10			"

												Well, I first came across this game when browsing projects in kickstarter, and I immediately felt attracted by it's original ideas. Ok, isolated, each of them are only reinterpretations of other ideas previous games already implemented, but I'm talking about the whole thing.As any other sandbox, Windforge is all about exploration and char development, with the innovative difference of being around steampunk themes. Cave exploration, a wide variety of weapons and building materials, different kinds of enemies to fight, random encounters, farming, skill training, crafting and alike, it's perfect if you like to explore and collect.Other distinctive characteristic of the game is the ability to build fully functional flying machines, and attach them with everything available, from turrets to spiked blocks, which can also be your home, if you wish so. Flying mechanics are also clever enough to make you spend some time figuring out the best design for your airships. Also, caves in Windforge start to collapse once you reach the dirt layer, so you need to watch where you're digging. Besides other interesting details, soon after starting your exploration through the world, you'll find yourself collecting resources and piece-by-piece building your flying fortress to triumph over enemies in the skies (which goes from air pirates to flying whales).The only bad thing here is the absence of multiplayer, which is understandable, since it was one of the stretch goals when it was funding in kickstarter, goal which wasn't unfortunately achieved. The devs have plans to implement it in the future, though.In other words: must buy. Nice game for a fair price. I have waited since this was just a kickstarter project, and the wait was not in vain.Great game that will be probably improve over time.			"

												One of the best Terraria-like games out there although still very different.Most people seem to hate the inventory system. It is true that it has it's flaws but I want to compare all aspects of this game.Here is a quick pro/con list:Pro:+ Small tutorial, helps you to getting started.+ Nice little story, that gives this kind of game a new look.+ Lovely visuals.+♥♥♥♥♥♥load of items+ great music and soundeffects+ Airfights are great+ Looting is always rewarding+ Grapplinghook mechanic/physics are just a dream.+ Lot's of bosses+ Pricetag,  9,99€ is very cheap for this game. (6th jan. 2017)- 3D look can be irritating if you build ships, you have to get used to it- Menu/interface has a bad handling- Big world but not much point's of interest / secrets to find- Random physic problems can kill you from time to time- No multiplayer option- Later on temples can be frustating. You have to find a specific room and it can take sometimes hours to find it.Conclusion:I had a great time with Windforge and I wish there would be an sequel or at least a mod community wich would give this game more potential. Unfortunately it didn't sold very well afaik, so there's no hope for a sequel  I guess.Getting momentum to swing you around is one of the best things in this game. But it has much more to offer.I would always recommend Windforge to players who enjoy Terraria, at least to those of you who enjoys singleplayer games. "

												I had a lot of fun with this game, but I feel like at this point reccomending it comes with a few warnings: The developers have stopped updating the game, so none of the issues with it are going to get fixed. There are a bunch of physics bugs still in the game, and a lot of other issues that make the game feel extremely unfair at times. The ship building system in this game is unfortunately very flawed. Building a huge expensive ship with workshops and so on may be cool, but it serves no useful function in the game. Almost everything in the game is easier with a fast, small ship than with a big one, and most of the essential story points happen on foot. There are also at this point other games that simply provide a better outlet for engineering minded players.That said, the game does have a very cool world with an interesting story, which is kind of a saving grace. The fact that the game has a story you can play through and actually beat the game means that this isn't just another creative game you'll never play because there is simply no reason to get into it over the dozens of other games that have no clear goal. You can play through it in a few hours and have fun with it and then come to a satisfying conclusion.			"

Also the grappling hook. You will have so much fun with the grappling hook.I've enjoyed every second that I've spent playing and I'm certain you will too.			"

BUILDING THE SHIPS!Oh, the design possiblilities!I sat for hours redesining ships with new materials. Making redundancy measures, making new ship alternatives... I love it!It's like Terraria with a storyline and airships.

												Warning: most of this is me rambling than a point to point of what is good and bad.This, in its own right, is a great game. However, what you do need to before purchasing is that there are bugs. The optimization is terrible, the psychics are sometimes weird, sometimes the A.I.s just stop what they're doing, even if you're shooting at them, standing around confused, the controls are lofty (which is sort of good for these sorts of games where you're flying all around with grappling hooks, though this makes it feel like a task to walk from point A to point B), and at times you'll find yourself flung at high speeds while using the grappling hook for no apparent reason. The worst of these problems, I believe, was the optimization (keep in mind this error only happens for a few). When exploring temples, it would get so bad the combat turned into more of a how to predict where the bad guy will be throughout the lagging. But, getting past that, this delivered an experience like none other. This is one of those few games that has created memories for me. I still remember the time I jumped off my airship onto the back of a whale and killed it with a knife, thinking of a way to stop my fall as we fell through the air towards certain death. I had so much whale meat after I carved it out on the side of a done that I was encumberd for so long and didn't know what to do. Or the time I was boarding a huge whaler ship and then a whale came across the fray, so it was madness of bullets flying through the air as it rammed into the side of the ship we were fighting in, sending us flying away, then crashing further below. I was uncertain whether I should use this to my advantage or fight for dear life alongside them to kill the brute. Or even the time I got into a ship and saw the odds were so against me I ran to their engine room to destroy their engines, sending us crashing and scavenged what I could from the wreckage. That's the thing I love about this game: that feeling of falling through the sky, that fight-or-flight response, wondering how the heck to save yourself. I could divide my time into exciting scenarios through and through. Stories are great, but what is the game, you may be asking. Well, you fly around the world with this neat map system with three zones: the below world, which has toxic gas you need to fix your ship and your character up for to counter it, monstrous creatures instead of air ships that I will let you discover for yourself (it might have ships, too, I can't remember), the middle is the normal forestry place, and the sky world above is mostly free some stuff other than a few dunes here and there littered around. Well, maps are great, but what do you really do? The goal is to loot special temples (along with a few other odds and end jobs, though mostly you're left to yourself, which I love). You can get blueprints to be able to craft items and can use your money to buy stuff and train your person in a few traits, such as agility, wisdom, strength, etc. (I’ll let you discover the wondrous perks may do. I am not an expert on that area, anyway). Looting temples really leaves something to be desired, sadly. (The lag I have makes everyone a nightmare, though, yet again, only some have this glitch). They go on forever, it seems, and though you can keep a mindset of, 'get in, get out', I'm a perfectionist so it doesn't feel right to not explore every room. The items and money scattered around are just enough to make it feel like you're missing out. I think that bad guys keep spawning, too, which is annoying. Mostly, I found myself standing around, boredly shooting at turrets until they exploded and then moving on, drilling holes into the ground because I didn't feel like taking any more trash from the spikes. So, why do you have to loot these temples? Well, some are just small plain ones for fun and loot, though there are the special ones that require you to find and kill the boss there and collect the tablet which triggers the trap--the best part of the temples, in my opinion (the walls and floor will start changing, sometimes spikes will start to appear everywhere and bits of the roof will fall down and hurt you or close some paths off (which you can drill through if you want), so you're on a clock to get out of there and hop into your jolly parked ship and bring it to a person who will give you tons of money (unless your ship gets destroyed by an enemy and you have to improvise. That, again, is what I love about this game. That feeling of just sitting somewhere wondering how you're going to overcome this next obstacle: should I wait for someone to come along and take a ride on their ship (or steal) or make a small ship on the fly? Of course you may be wondering what is ship building and what if you don't want to design ships in the first place? Ships require a few key things, such as generators to keep components powered (if there isn't enough power, components work worse and worse depending how much energy there is to go around, and, if there is none, they will simply stop working), propellers to move the thing around, steering thing, and, optionally, you can also add balloons to make them float better, along with guns to defend yourself. There are also a few other odds and ends, I believe, not to mention the bits purely for decor. The great part is, you really don't have to make your own ships from scratch. You start with one, so you can either keep adding stuff to it or steal someone else's and so on. It's a great mechanic because you can do as much or little as you want with your ship.The air battles are fantastic. You can crash into ships, shoot them, or my personal favorite of boarding and killing everyone, claiming the boat for your own or scavenging their parts for your own creations (at the dock, you can save ships there so you never have to worry about it being lost, broken or boarding another ship on the fly when you register it at the dock. Also, the repair system is super nice. An outline of the ship always remains even when it's shot off, so you can simply highlight it with said tool and it gets repaired to the original design instead of you having to guess what went where).I think this game is really more about the heart than mechanics. If you're going to judge it simply because it's a game--well, it has problems. But if you're like me and look upon it like a door to a crazy adventure, step right in.If you have decided purchase this game, my parting bit of advice to you is to look beyond the shell and instead to the heart of it--and save. I always get this tingly feeling like something crazy is about to happen so I save it--like that whale part--so I can keep reliving that one absurd scenario over and over.			"

												Absence makes the heart grow fonder, or so they say...I have a newfound respect for Windforge after writing my previous review a year ago. While I played it, it was a game that kept my occupied for several hours on end. The kind of game where I kiss my wife goodnight on a Friday and don't see her again until Monday morning!It does have its faults, but those can be pretty much overshadowed by one very high point - it has atmosphere. You will not forget playing this game; it will be etched into your brain long after you put it down, a few months and dozens of games later.The developer has abandoned it - well, gone on to work a real job and try to earn a living. I think that term ""abandoned"" gets tossed around way too much these days though. This isn't an online game so there's not really and maintenance to be done or constant server upkeep needed.If you go back to the 1990's, you could technically argue that every game released for a console back then was ""abandoned"" since none of them ever received an update after release.Windforge has that same feel. The game is complete and perfectly playable. Even if every feature planned may not have been fully implemented (just a guess since I don't actually know the backstory behind the release of the game) everything that is in the game is playable and works fine.It has a strong enough story to keep you moving along and a large and expansive open world to keep you wanting to explore further, build bigger and be stronger.It has RPG elements like character stats, NPC quests, and even has a certain SNES type of style to it.It has survival elements like crafting and cooking.And it has originality - on the player's part.Here's a true story that happened earlier today:I crashed my starter ship into another ship in the higher atmosphere. They weren't trying to outright kill me, so I let it ride out for a while - our mangled wrecks hovering in mid-air. Then I looked it over and liked their ship a lot more than my own...I grapple-hook my way above their balloons and pull out my drill. I pierce a hole through their roof, down to one balloon, then proceed to set it on fire with my drill. It goes up in flames, burning holes through their floor and dropping one crew member down to the darkness below.Still no signs of aggression... I suppose the only crew member who realized my intentions was about 2 miles below, screaming his last breath!Now, it gets interesting....On attempt one, I drill out the other balloon and the other two crew members spot me and fire their shotgun and machine gun at me. They not only destroy the balloon the rest of the way, but hit one of the large furnaces (?) behind me, it goes up in a fireball and we all die horrible fiery deaths.Attempt #2. I hold off on shooting out the other balloon and instead, swing down below to see if I can get a better angle to invade their ship. As I swing, their ship changes direction and the steel propeller sucks me in and I get processed into ground beef. Attempt #3, I sit and wait. I see one of the crew start shooting at something and a second later a HUGE WHALE rams the side of the ship, kills two crew members, tears through a wall, destroys one balloon and blows up the same furnace as before.Attempt #4. No signs of the whale. I drop down one deck and drill the crew member left off the deck to the bottomless abyss below. I open the hatch and see the crew on the other side start firing again... great, another whale! While their backs are turned, I commandeer the controls and drop the ship off screen.We're now falling at terminal velocity with all the controls (and crew) at my mercy. The crew's being tossed around like rag doll, totally helpless.CRASH!We smash bottom first into a few trees and then bedrock. Splinters of wood spray everywhere and the 3 crew members left flatten like pancakes due to the impact.I survive with 2 health and a badly damaged ship... but it's now MY SHIP! Mwuahahahah!!! Anyway, it's events like those that make this game stand out from the sea of mediocrity on Steam. Pack a PBJ for lunch one day, skip Pizza Hut and do yourself a favor and buy this game instead! You'll get a lot more enjoyment out of it than a Pizza can provide! "

												There is nothing about this game that I do not like.   I can't say that about many games, but, this is one of them.   I hope the game keeps going with more content.   The game is Contra meets Terraria and adds dynamic game play with sandbox elements of open world building.   It's great and delivers very well on all levels of stability and entertanment value.   Besides, what is there not to love about giant flying whales?			"

												There seemed to be a lot of potential here, like this game would be an adventure version of Terreria, where you could hunt flying whales on a steampunk air ship. Unfortunately, like others have said, the controls are pretty clunky, the hitboxes on everything are really off, and the inventory management is very difficult. Also the game's framerate drops really low randomly.With some mods or patches, this would be a great game, but in its current state, it just isn't that much fun.			"

												This game is amazing! Having such a great time playing it. I am not sure why some people are having crashing problems.. I've only had one crash in my 10hrs+ of play time, and none of my save files were compromised. I am currently running this game on an Alienware x51.I love the artwork, gameplay, story, and freedom to explore a huge world. It's challenging and addicting. Hanging off a whale with a grapple hook, killing enemies with a sausage, and completely messing up the other airships in this game are a few of the hilarious things you can do. Please give this game a try, and don't let the negative reviews influence your opinion of this game! It really is great, and you need to give it a try for yourself! :)  Have fun!			"

												So you spent all that time collecting resources only to lose them when going to the next area just because you put everything into a chest instead of carrying it around with you. In other words your ship is very specific how it travels to the next area. If you add a chest, it won't be there after it finishes loading the new area (mission I guess), because it's not in the script. I really hated this feature of the game, you lose hours of foraging if you forget to grab everything out of your chests, but then if you have to grab everything out of your chest then you can hardly move. So what's the point of having the option to make storage chests?Plus the enviroment is pre-definied and makes replayability utterly boring (everything is always in the exact same spot).			"

												Nice concept but horrible execution. The controls are extremely clumsy and awkward; mining/drilling especially. Even when the drill visibly hits the block, many times the block remains unchanged. Managing the cursor to get in the right spot (which doesn't visually match where you'd expect it to be) to mine a block is a chore. Bullets visibly pass right through enemy models doing no damage about half the time. Apparently it was horribly broken on release, and perhaps many of the bugs have been fixed, but it remains unpolished.			"

												Best game I've seen in a while, I have to say. A game where you have the freedom to not only build a little house, have a little mine, but you also get the freedom to build your own airship and explore the vast open air or if you're feeling confident; your own sky base! The game has only a few bugs that I've encountered, but the auto save this game has makes up for it. You get a game where you're thrown into a story line, but you get to do whatever you want. It's a perfect mix between free roam, free build, and storyline all wrapped up with a nice steampunk bow. This game is a must have for your Steam library. 10/10. Well done Snowed In Studios.			"

												The idea is good and all but the graphics just dont cut it for me. Combining 2D and 3D is a very fine process and doesn't work very often, especially in this case. It feels to force to work and the extra depth provided by the ""3D"" enviroment makes the game seem less and less like a decent metroidvainian and more like a half baked pie. A bad pie at that. The crust looks good but everything on the inside is poorly choosen and doesn't go well together. Maybe if they had left the entire game in 2D instead of the half and half. To add to the fact of terrible graphic choices, the extra ""fog"" layer that covers ground you haven't mined yet is really sloppy and seems to take ques from Worms Open Warfare, and other Worms titles, revealing small circles each time damage is dealt to the terrain. Maybe if they simply blacked out the ""unknown"" sections and had a similar function as  Terraria and Starbound, it might work out better, but they didn't. All in all the game looked promising but as I took a ""bite"" into it, it turned out to be poorly put together with terrible choices in the design. Maybe some people will like it, but I don't, at least not in it current state. So if you want a good game to run around in and explore, especially with a ton of weapons and tools, go play Starbound, Terraria, Minecraft, or maybe just go play a different genre.			"

												Controls feel.. loose. Does that make sense? Pretty similar to controlling your character in Starbound on a low-gravity planet. Walking past some colourful plants at the beginning was kind of hard on my eyes, but I later would find out that they were supposed to stand out because you’re able to destroy them to harvest their contents. I jumped the second animal I saw and it got bugged in the wall behind me in its haste. The enemies move pretty unconvincingly in any case. Like in Starbound! But somewhat worse.At the end of the first level was a whole “omigod you got the relic now the place is falling apart” thing, and all of the walls began turning into dirt for some reason; blocking the path I’d taken to get there. But it was happening slowly, so I tried to walk back out, and then I died due to unreasonable amounts of falling dirt. The menu presented to me was then “Go to town”, or “Load”, and the former was greyed out. So I loaded the autosave it had made for me, apparently right after I got the relic, but somehow without triggering the whole collapsing sequence. Still played the dramatic music, though.I then realised that I could use the jackhammer to carve my way out of the side of the old, unstable ruins, and spent some time picking up rocks and stuff from a mountain I was briefly considering digging to the top of to see if anything was hidden there. When I got back to the ship, my partner in crime was all “Whoa what was happening back there?” and you don’t reply, and then you fly away and there’s a huge collapsing explosion of destruction just off-screen to the right where the big ruins were supposed to be collapsing but weren’t.As the ship sailed away, the camera didn’t centre on my character, but it did pause and jump to centre on her when I pressed tab to open up the inventory, and I had a lot more fun than I ought to have then, showing that game what for. Take control of my camera angle, would you? They'll think twice before they mess with me again.I would then find out in the captioned images between levels that our ship had sustained heavy damage from the hypothetical explosion, and that’s why we were flying away so fast, downwards. Immediately upon landing the terminal velocity crash, both of the crew members were totally okay, apart from the NPC one developing a sudden case of laziness and electing to be the foreman and tell you what to do while you go around making all the repairs to the ship yourself. Upon using the repair tool for a second on the balloon, it instantly repairs itself fully in terms of aesthetics, but when you talk to Ms Lazikens again she insists you need to like hold the button down on the balloon for a while to repair it fully. God. (Actually, all she says is to repair the balloon, I figured out the holding down of the button part by myself.)She then says that “it will take some time to repair the ship fully”, you know by harvesting supplies in the form of block from the land we just crashed on, and then she talks about forges and recipes and oh god I’m going to stop playing for now because I realise that this is actually going to be probably exactly like a Starbound that isn’t as good as Starbound, because it doesn’t have as good mechanics and doesn’t have aliens and claims to be a Steampunk game but the entire plotline is centred around the fact that your society runs on Whale oil. And I didn't have the patience for Starbound.I also had intended to go for the ‘Vegetarian’ achievement for eating no meat throughout the entire campaign but unfortunately walked over the dead bodies of the animals I’d slaughtered and my character immediately devoured them like a voracious ♥♥♥♥♥, thus RUINING EVERYTHING.I got it for 0.20$ in the Humble Bundle. I may come back to it at some point, but I’m not largely motivated to. It was worth that price I think, but I can’t help but wonder if a lollipop would have been an even better deal.I could have dipped it very briefly in water and then sucked that. Have you ever tried that? It’s lovely. I used to do that all the time when I was younger. In my youngling logic, I decided that because it was so nice after putting it in for just a moment, it must be even nicer if I leave it in for longer! So, I left my lollipop in a bowl full of water and went away. When I came back a few hours later, I was devastated to find that the water had consumed it whole! The turmoil in my heart was real, and I don’t think I’ve ever truly recovered.This looks like it has some decent elements in it but excels at nothing (this is what I've discerned from my like forty minutes of playing). But you know, that's undoubtedly just me being an unbelievable jerk and not giving it the chance. Nay, I gave it not the chance it needed, but the one it deserved. Did you like Starbound? You might like this. Good for you, go for it. I won't think any less of you. I'd be happy if you enjoyed it more than I did. Just, you know, whatever man.TLDR: Meh.			"

												This is a great game to play, though I'll admit, it would of been much better if it had at least a co-op only because of the hilarity that could occur from such.I loved the combat system, the grappling hook, and the music, though it would of been nice to have a slightly more upbeat song playing during combat, especially in the temples... I'll touch base on each of these of course.The combat system: I loved the fact that you could fly your ship around and man the guns directly or from your control panel, which allowed you to either directly shoot at them from the turret, or fly around shooting sparatically at your opponent(the ai) not to mention that you could leave your ship, use your grappling hook to grab onto an enemy airship and climb aboard for a good old fashioned pirate raid. :D  I'll admit I wasn't a fan of using melee weapons(I discovered that you could use them to dig faster than your starter mining tool...) but I did play around with them abit and found that if I had chosen a good starter or built up my strength and vitality, it would of been a very interesting way to play.The grappling hook: While I did discover there's also a grappling gun, I never actually made it, the hook was perfect for me since I prefer the idea of just throwing your hook into the wind and hoping you snag something as you fall to your doom. xD I will say that it was a handy little thing to keep on my right click incase I fell, or incase mid fight I needed to propell(can't find proper spelling, but I know it's a word...) myself around to avoid instant death/grab an enemy and pull him into a hole where he will fall to his death or land in a trap.(my personal favorite)The music: I loved the feeling of the music most of the time, I wont say 100% of the time, because when I was in the temples, it was just too soft for what I was doing(usually dodging those annoying small lizards and the mass of turrets at every entry point v.v) however, when I wasn't fighting evil tiny lizards, or dodging a mass volley of turrets, the music was the right level to give me the feel of drifting along the currents in my very own airship, seeking a new target for my weapon system I've just built, or to ram into with all of my grinders on the side of my ship(hilarious moment right there...)Over all, I'd say this game is a must have for anyone who wants to build your own airship, or just plain run around swinging on a grappling hook from one side of the world to the other.(watch that first step doc, you might end up in the core!)

												Fun game if you enjoy customising your own airships, bases, etc. Kinda like sky starbound. The fact the blocks are so small (you're eight blocks tall) makes building slightly annoying, but the fact the blocks are so small lets you edit pretty small details which is great fun. At the moment i'm getting really annoying crashes but i'm sure this is not an over-arching pattern. In short go for it, as it's already a solid little game.			"

												This game, while difficult is excellent.I'll admit a few grievances though.   -Every so often the dirigible will stop firing when you click before firing almost automatically for several minutes.   -When exploring new islands, it will sometimes randomly react as if you dropped a great distance, but this is rare.   -The insect enemies are overpowered, given they've done more damage than the lizards.   -It needs controller support.Ultimately, the pros outweigh those cons by a landslide.I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Terraria or Starbound.

												just wow.this game got me hooked so suprisingly well..concept-a world ravaged of gravity, mid-air floating islands, art that resemebles some of ""yes"" albums? compressed in a ""liero"" like platformer, with the throwing rope hook, and tons of rpg elements.but that's not the en of the gameplay:you can also destroy everything in the game, and get resources to build stuff for your baloon ships, new weapons, armour etc.concept: A+performance of the concept-set in an old school like, graphics and mechanics. the zooming is great, and the controls are fair.there is a learning curve when trying to climb steep mountains with your hook, or getting back to your ship. but its all part of the gameplay, from my account. you can save on every point, and reload. so you can experiment as you wish.i would say it has some clankiness in it, but its terribly rare. never had a crash, and never did my character got stuck.performance of concept: A-.sound-the music is fine, i would lower it to get the just the right amount of atmosphere, i think its a bit repetitive, but very fitting.the only nag is the sound effect expolsion in the intro, and the fact that there is no accompying music to the cut scene.sound: BGameplay-right now i can't get enough of it. so many things to do, besides the quest. is getting more moeny for more recipes to get cooler items and also increase your stats to get cool perks. which right now is terribly expansive. but the gameplay is so enjoyable. it inclludes- real dodging from bullets, monsters fire, monsters jumping at you. the grappling hook is fab. the fact that you  can destroy anything in your path to make a shortcut through with your jack hammer.your costumable ship. literally paint your own ship that has its functions. the air battles are fun. although wind can be a drag??overall:A-this is a great development of oldschool nostalgic, i can't believe i've waited so long to play this. its like the developers only came up with the evolution of what newer games would be from the 2000. this is one of the best games i've played in years. thanks!

												This game is a fun game with some very good concepts and a nice imaginative story. It takes the player on a creative journey in a air world filled with adventure and steampunk styled air ships. Unlike some games the storyline in Windforge is mostly not open-ended, you can continue playing after you have completed the main quests but there really isn't that much to do.This game is another example of a game that functions and is fun to play but, sadly, lacks the polish and finishing that would make it truly great. There is so much untapped potential in the world of Windforge that this game just can't capture. There are towns but they are filled with NPCs that mostly have only a single phrase if you try to talk to them. They have no awareness of the world around them and will not make a peep if you empty the safe they are standing next to.The finish and polish of the graphics are simplistic but do convey the steampunk styling. The character animation is simple and the movement a bit unrefined, making it challenging to control the character with precision sometimes.The destructible world is done quite well with ore generating in the floating islands. I really enjoy games that let me get creative and this is the biggest thing that made the game fun and exciting was to build and refine my airship. I appreciated the recepie system where you can discover new things you can build. It makes more sense than some other games where you mysteriously know how to make everything for which you have materials. I wish there was a way to get specific recepies, none of the towns had a recepie for large motors so I spent half the game looking for that one recepie. A dedicated recepie vendor in one of the towns that is guarantied to have all the basic recepies would be a good idea.I enjoyed playing this game but the lack of refinement was abrasive. This game will not likely be one I return to like other creative games. It kind of makes me sad when I see games that have so much potential but were not able to realize it. I am a furniture maker by trade and this game reminds me of a beautiful chair that still needs some sanding and a lovely laquer finish to be a real good seller, but currently is little more than a functional place to set your bottom. Careful! you might get splinters. :)			"

												This game is fun, and the only bugs I ran into was my screen occasionally having a white bar across the screen.(maybe once every several hours) I'll also note that in the temples after a lot of enemies spawned it slowed down my pc, merely saving and reload fixed this issue, which happend once every temple visit. However, I imagine pc specs play into when the slowdown happens. My specs -> AMD FX-9590 Eight core, 32 GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 970 Graphics card.			"

												I'll recommend Windforge but it's a small recommendation.The game does a few things right, but many others wrong. In the end, the ability to fly with your home everywhere you want, and fight other such vehicles and giant flying whales and krakens makes it up for it, for me, but I think not for everyone.The really bad things:- Framerate issues on large maps with a lot of entities- The fake isometric view that can make jumping through holes and hatches infuriating- The generally ""floaty"" controlsThe bad or tedious things:- Building and mining: mostly due to the strange camera view- Going into town for quests. Seriously, why so wide?- Mining. Mining is OK, but even in late game there is no way to pinpoint ore pockets of interest- Crafting. I love that there is such a big variety of items to craft, and especially that starting materials stay relevant in the end game. However, the interface for it has not been well thought. No search option.- Travelling. Travelling is usually fun, but when you need to go from one point in the map to the other, well, you'll need to hang on. A fast travel option would have been welcomed, at least between towns, and even for a cost.- Killing whales/krakens/ships: if you kill them in one map cell and they fall in another map cell, that's it, you've wasted your ammo for nothing, because their remnants will disappear.The good things:- Super varied crafting- All armors have different looks in-game- The world and the lore, despite lacking a bit of life, is quite cool- The graphical atmosphere is pretty nice, even though the toxic smokes can clutter the screen a bit- Player progression is smoothThe very nice things:- Flying your own ship (even though building it might be a chore)- Exploring temples, when the framerate is OK, its really pretty nice- The fights against whales and krakens are really cool, and the reward of ""mining"" their body never gets old (seriously, try the cluster bomb, super satisfying to use)In the end, it feels like the game might have been too ambitious for the means at its disposal, but for me it was a nice experience, at least it felt fresh. If there is a huge sale, then definitely get it to try it and make your own opinion.			"

												Great game. I love how you can drop 3 map spaces without your ship and survive then tame a whale to take you back to your ship. it's a lot of fun finding ways to do the dungeons differently. for exampe theres a part where you get captured and youy have to fight with your fists to get some weapons. but this can be avoided if you craft rope and parkour up to your ship.

												Game seriously needs a patch. AI is a bit messed up. Fast melee monsters will chase you but they are going so fast that if there is a wall they will get stuck inside or on the other side of the wall, if you jump over them they will try to change direction upwards so they will instead run through the ceiling.  Also, when you are flying your ship you will constantly be attacked by either pirates or flying creatures, which gets extremely annoying when you're just trying to find your quests location (some quests you are shown exactly where they are, some you are only shown what map it is on). After completing the first quest you will get turrets and 1000 bullets for them, but I used them up the moment I had reached the closest mission target, leaving no bullets for the return trip. The closest target was about 2 ""zones"" from the city and the furthest about 10.   I was being attacked by a pirate while I was near the ground I stopped controlling my ship, still standing inside, it was like now the pirates couldn't see me anymore and just flew away. Aiming is also a bit wonky, shoot and you miss, aim a bit more down, shoot and hit the same spot. What I mean by that is, that it seems like you can only aim at specific degree angles. So you aim to the right, but can only shoot 5 degrees upwards to the right, not directly at 0 degrees.			"

												I had quite a bit of fun playing this game. The mechanics can be a little bit wonky and there are some glitches here and there but it was worth the 25 or so hours I put into it. Building the airships and hunting for new parts and materials was what I generally had the most fun doing. I think it's worth the purchase.			"

												Imagine if terraria, Bioshock infinite, and a lil bit of dishonored were all mixed together to make a game...This is the type of game it would be. Its got all the moving around and platforming like terraria, and works more or less the same. But once you take to the skies is when the fun really begins, as you go from weak lil ship, to a gun toting armoured war ship, Destroying anything that dares attack you. Or maybe you want to make a ship thats good for ramming into other ships so that you can board them and take that ship for yourself, or just smash them into the nearest island and leave the remaining crew marooned. And once you get some nice artillery you can become a glorified planet cracker(uhhh island cracker?) Sending shell after shell into the floating islands so you can take the precious ores they have with ease. Then theres also the whales, yes they seem a bit silly at first but once you start playing the game the whales and all the other creatures that are in this world will start to fit in and it'll all make sense.The mechanics of the game work well and the combat takes quite a bit of skill at first, as you can die fairly easily, but once you find that one special gun itll all start coming together. The crafting, once i figured it out is alot deeper then it would appear. There are alot of recipes, and instead of having different recipes for every different material they just have a bar that lets you choose any variant of the item that you want to create.Building a ship is also a nice thing as you are essentially building your base they you use to take to the skies.Now to the gripes i have about the game-Yes unfortunately there is no multiplayer, at this time.- The tilted 3dish looks of the blocks makes it kind of hard to navigate when building a ship and for other things.- The fully destructible enviroments are cool, but it would be nice if instead of having to take are base with us in the skies we could settle down a home base on an island without having to worry about it being destroyed. Imagine if we could build are very own town which we could dock all are ships at...ahhh thatd be nice.But yeah the gripes are small troubles when compared to how much fun ive had with this game.			"

												This game got a bum rap when it first came out. There were bugs, and game review sites were not kind. But the devs kept at it, and did a good amount of patching in the months following the game's release. By the time I got it, everything seemed to be in order and I had a blast with it. The guts of the game are that you're an airship captain trying to figure out why the sky whales (yes!) are disappearing. It falls solidly into the Terraria 2D crafting genre, but rather than building a base, digging like crazy, and exploring the depths, you're going to spend a lot of time flying around, desigining ships, and getting into lots of air combat, which is both fun and hilarious.That's not to say the game is perfect. The animations are a little weird, and clicking on things is sometimes inaccurate because of the faux three-dimensional appearance of the game. And combat can get frustrating sometimes. But the world is interesting and has a neat backstory. And the setting is so cool, with different layers of the cloud world having different styles and effects, and the flying whales are just awesome. The whale fat adds bouyancy, and can be added to your airships, allowing for truly bizarre ship designs if you're so inclined.For the price, there's plenty of fun to be had here, and it's markedly better than a number of other entries that came in the wake of Terraria's success. And it has a real story that can be completed, giving some structure to what's normally a formless sandbox genre. So if you're looking for a Terraria-like game with a unique twist, try this one out.			"

												This game just completely lacks any sense of direction. I start off and boom temple + miniboss, okay, why am I here? Where do I go? What do I do? How do I craft? I eventually found my way to another temple and suddenly actual boss fight but I had no gear because I had no clue how to make it or where to find it. I mean yeah I also found a town earlier, but.There's no thrill of exploring here because everything's floating islands and thus there's not a whole lot to find. Didn't get to any ship combat at all either. This game was just really hard for me to even play, did not hold my interest in the slightest. I feel reviewing it like this is kind of unfair, but I doubt I'll ever play it again, so...			"

The character moves like a puppet.You will die ALOT. And then there's some small bugs. After that said, I felt happy to spend four 40 hour work weeks livinginside Windforge. Beautiful ArtShips are awesome to fly and buildMany weaponsMany Ship partsA bunch of missionsHuge worldGreat battlesEpic whale encountersNothing like seeing a floating Island with alot of orein the early game and think "" I need that ore but it'll be hard to get it all""but later you return in your giant mining ship and devour the entireIsland.I love you and your many flaws Windforge.Would pay $100 for an even better sequel.

												Defineitely the most underrated game i have ever played. This game is truly amazing, it's a lot of fun. All though it lacks a bit of story quests. However, the story is ok-good-ish, it has a nice plottwist at the end which is surprising and pretty cool. To say it like this, the end of the story quest is not the end of the game. I didn't even start the story quest until i was about 20 hours into the game. I was flying around in my super badass ship, destroying small and big ships, hunting whales for oil. I had a blast just scavenging ships and selling the parts to vendors, so that i could get better weapons and armour. I found it extremely fun to jump of my ship and grappling hook another ship, and just completely ninja them. All  though some ships are friendly or, rather neutral. Especially tose carrying valuables, such as cans of oil and other stuff. ""trying not to spoil some of the ships in game"". At least give this game a try, i will be playing this game a lot more. JUST BECAUSE IT'S VERY FUN!! Give me another game where you can jump of your custom designed steampunk ship, grappling hook the tail of a whale, jump on top of him and start ******* **** *** **. Oh you are wondering about what i was gonna write? buy the game and try it yourself, i am seriously irritated by the lack of awareness this game has got, it is very cool.

												I will have to say that this game is rather rough, but even the rough edges don't detract me from enjoying the game as a whole. The mining is an interesting way of handling resource gathering in a very similar fashion as other 2d survival games. The problem happens that the hit boxes of everything from the mobs, ores, and even your own hit box seems to be very small compared to the models used for the objects. I am sure when I find my way further in the game there are going to be other bugs, but to me the basic elements that I wanted to play with are there. The grappling is just enjoyable and the airships are a fun change compared to other titles that are similar. I guess for the real thought on if you should buy the game or not. To me it was worth the 15 dollars as I can see myself putting some more time into the game when I'm not so busy. I went ahead against the bad reviews and bought it just to give the game a chance since I watched it for so long, and I'm not regretting it so far unlike other titles that have been in a much worst mess and for much more money.UPDATE:I've been spending so much time just traveling around and building onto my airship I never got around to advancing the main story line until now. I've taken on my first temple without actually beating the main boss at the end as of yet, so I guess my judgment is still lacking a little. My experience has been a mix of enjoyment along with a little frustration. I enjoy the randomness and small challenge of the temple, but at the same time I start to get frustrated due to the game throwing an unreasonable number of enemies at me. I am glade that it gives me plenty of potions or food to keep me from dying, but a few times it feels overwhelming. I still enjoy the game and still don't mind the minor bugs that I have come across.

												This game has captured my attention and just won't let go.  The typical game keeps my interested for about 30 minutes, maybe an hour. (Most of the ""Played"" games on my profile have been just getting cards overnight.)  I've sunk over 20 hours into this game already, and most of that has just been exploring and trying different things out and not even focusing on the questline.I really enjoy the ship-to-ship combat, and the grappling hook play is really fun.  I'd never really gotten the hang of the grappling hooks in other games because they just felt weird.  This game's grappling hook works intuitively and I have a lot of fun flying around and doing things with my grappling hook.  The only downside to the grappling hook is that you can't use a gun while swinging around.Another big plus for me is the destructible world and environment. You see it, you can probably destroy it.  I like using brute force with part of my ship to smash other ships into stuff, then while they're held pinned, gun down their people and steal their ship.  As their ship starts to fall apart, I'll usually rush in and repair it if things get too bad while I'm gunning down the crew.  Then I'll steal all the good stuff from their ship and let the rest fall into oblivion.  Another plus of the destructible terrain is that you can plan entry into hard to get to places and make a back-door.  (A quest that sends you into your first major boss fight had me accidentally take a back entrance that was one room away from the boss fight.  I opened the door and was like ""What? Already?""  Then I spent the next 3 hours exploring that area completely because there are chests and such in hidden spots.  But the back door made the boss fight really easy to do.)At the time of this review, there are a couple of crippling bugs that make it so that you'll want to use the quicksave frequently.  First, there's one that if you move stuff from your inventory to your stash or to a vendor really quickly it will cause the game to crash.  If you go slower, it prevents that crash.  Another is that there is something that overloads the physics that can cause the game to freeze.  When there's a lot of stuff going on, my game becomes a lag-fest.  For instance, there's a Temple you have to break into and retrieve something.  There is so much going on in there that the whole game starts chugging.  I have a pretty beefy rig, and even have a dedicated Phys-X card (which I'm pretty sure this game doesn't support, but I only mention it to emphasize how much I've invested into my rig).  Terraria used to have the same problems and they were able to resolve them, so I hope this game follows the same trend (maybe adopts the same solution?)Minor concerns are:* I wish that breaking stuff open in the temples would give better loot than healing potions and money.  I went through the first major temple and didn't really find anything interesting.  My armor is still pretty weaksauce, although I found a dual shotgun early on that was a major game changer.  One-shot kill most stuff.  (That gun is way OP for the stage of the game I'm in.)* The AI is pretty weak when it comes to ship-to-ship combat.  Most guys on the ship just stand around. On the ground, the AI just follows a ""run directly at you"" mode, and doesn't seem to have good pathfinding.The good of this game vastly outweighs the bad, and so far the developer has been very active in the forums.  I've only had the game a few days, so I don't know how often the game is updated, but rumor is that it's pretty frequent.			"

												Fun game, neat concept... and I do love me some builder games.  Can make fun little airships and fly them around in a sidescrolling map that's comparable to Terraria/Starbound mechanics.Would be a lot more fun however with multiplayer, but that's likely not going to happen any time soon.

												Saves are broken, so you must start a new game if you exit out of the game. Also, the game randomly crashes every 5 - 30 minutes. I jokingly named my save crash1 before I learned of the broken saves, and when I try to load any save, the game crashes... It is apparently in early alpha, but the steam store didn't mark it as such. Either wait a while until at least the saves are fixed, or just take your money elsewhere. It is NOT worth the money they want for it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. But a myraid of bugs quickly halted my progress. The premise is fun most certainly. But the framework for that fun needs quite a bit of work. I do not think the game should have been available on steam as a released game. This really qualifies as an ""early access"" offering. At this point you would have more enjoyment playing games in this genre that offer multiplayer, this would offset your loss progress with a communal experience. Verdict: Not recommended. It simply does not feel ""finished""			"

Posted: August 13, 2014
												Dunno why the metacritic score for this game is so low. I've played Minecraft, Terraria, Starforge, and Edge of Space (and tons of other procedural games), so you could say I'm into these types of games, and Ive actually had my eyes on this one since the days when it first entered greenlight (i actually voted for it). Finally got my hands on it, and I gotta say, of all the games ive mentioned above, Windforge was the right-off-the-bat funnest game, and it also shows the most promise. Right now, its an early access experience like you might expect, but the ship mechanics are awesome, the dungeons are tons of fun, and the balance between grinding materials/buying from merchants/unlocking schematics is leagues ahead of the other procedural gen games familiar to this. If you like the genre, you're bored, and can spare $15, this game is worth it, if not now then at least for what it will be with sufficient backing and dev support. The current bad parts just really have to do with content and variety. All that is probably bound to change, but to name a few in case the devs are watching, more enemy ship types at all stages of the game, more towns (maybe scattered small villages? just for the merchants? or even friendly merchant ships?) and definitly more enemies. the biggest bug that's bothered me is randomly some items, after being crafted or purchased, wont move into my inventory, it will simply dissapear. That means the materials/dollars are gone. lost as much as 30k in one shot once. thats a lot for where i am in the game. Otherwise its a wonderful experience and i will definitly keep playing and having fun while the devs do their work.EDITMy hours have continued to rack up in this game. Got a lot of things on my mind but wanna keep it short. The biggest thing is content (theres too few of it). I mean, obviously its early access and the game isnt finished, but for those wondering whether it will be a ""complete experience"" if they purchase the game right now, well it really depends on their expectations. The fundamentals are there though. The ship-to-ship combat remains incredibly satisfying, theres tons of freedoms for modifying your ship (construction choices will seriously influence the way you explore/fight/survive), and after a little while the 2.5D graphics grow on you. At least they did for me. World seems to have a lot more detail and a bit of much needed depth. Yea, I guess construction can be a bit clunky, but personally I have adapted wonderfully. Its not perfect by no means, essentially if you want to have some precision, you wont be building anything fast. But destroying stuff with your jackhammer feels pretty good (especially with high strength), the grapling gun is just about the most amazing mechanic in any builder so far other than probably the ship mechanics. You can swing around, rappel, pull things, fly about basically like spiderman (after practice), with just one mouse button and WASD. But again, need more content. More dungeons, more towns, more enemy ships and more everything. The game world is huge, and there should be more content propelling you out there into the dangerous unknown. Do you know how cool it is engineering a combat/exploration-worthy vessel air-tight-ready for the Gas? Then only have to employ it a couple of times? Oh wait, that second bit aint cool at all. But its the reality right now.P.EDITI forgot to mention this, because my PC's pretty meaty, but even it dips significantly in framerate every once in a while in this game, but sometimes for persistant amounts of time. I've seen others complain they cant run this game on a laptop (which seems rediculous to me in this age of computing), so be forewarned.			"

												Don't ever try it. Just don't.There are sky in it, there are flying ships in it, there are real huge awesome skywhales in it, there are steam/dieselpunk in it, there are skypirates, merchants and sailors in it, there a liquid magma core and floating islands, there are wild layer with gliding wolfes, poisoned deadly layer with gigant krakens, civilized places with town and government, and there are ancient temples.Fully destructible world. Over 200 crafting recipes.Flying Ships. Whales. Temples. Secrets.  Just no! If you ever want be a pirate don't even look at it. Cause probably you will fall in love.And only after that you will find that there are no AI, just pair of bad scripts; no plotline, just holes; awful animations for everything besides sky, propellers and animals. Characters are not characters, but poorly made mannequins.Real lack of graphic everywhere (like dozen types of armor, eh? they use one sprite, no difference, leather jacket and machinized diesel armor; two faces for 95% of population), okay, probably I'm too casual player for it.But no, even if graphics is nothing for you, it's really disappointing to see how bad some good ideas could be implemented. It will break your heart and you will be crying in corner of your bed.Again: no AI, no good story, no 'live' characters. Everything is bad.(Beside sky, whales and packed resources from 'big.file'. But last one doesn't implemented good)Or try, because it still damn beautiful, just don't fall in love too much, I have hard feelings about this game, that's tragedy that it stays so unfinished =(			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough, it's literal only flaw is the lack of multiplayer, it combines guns of icarus with terraria or starbound, there is no floor to the world so you have to be careful of freefalling to the core, if you get close to the core there is poisonus gas that will slowly invade your ship and kill you if you get any holes in your vessel, you can wrangle yourself a sky whale and ride it into battle or into the nearest island so you can kill it and use it for fuel and then turn the corpse into your own rotting sky shipthere is so much to this game and it is so perfect that it makes me cry that there is no multiplayer, you really get this amazing feeling of being an awesome andventurer who doesn't fear jumping out of his ship onto an enemy ship and removing the engines, only to barely manage to attatch his grapel hook back to his own ship before the enemy plummets to the firey core belowjust buy it			"

I get the impression, one day the people behind it will start anew, get it right and be hailed as the new minecraft of the next decade.In short, wonderful ideas which are let down by the lack of a little polish.

												Windforge is a single player Terraria-like with a focus on creating and flying airships and turning into into mobile weapons.And it's absolutely awful.Art - It's passable. But you can really see the rough, unfinished spots. The monsters look hilariously clunky too.Controls - Your character is a sliding, greasy mess. Trying to slip through the many trapdoors in the game is an exercise in annoyance. Mining things somehow manages to be a gigantic, clunky pain... in a Terraria-like.Story - It's not exactly inspired, but it works.UI - Clunky. Hey it's that word again! The whole UI is clunky, unresponsive and in general a mess. Trying to find specific items to craft is bad right from the beginning and as soon as you start getting more recipes and materials it turns into a nightmare.So to summarize, I get the feeling the developer's creed when making this game was ""Is this barely passable? Maybe? Then great, let's move on to the next feature"". Buy at your own peril, because this game is crash happy and won't hesitate to mess with your save files.			"

												(I may change this review if the bugs are patched)A fantastic idea, that, if placed in the hands of a better funded or more experienced game developer may have skyrocketed, but so far the game sits like my airship with a broken balloon.Let me regale you with the tales of Buggy McBugstien.Once upon a time McBugstien set out on an adventure into a temple to recover some magical macguffin. This artifact must have had a lot of magic in it, because upon jumping into the air in excitement, Mr. McBugstien practically exploded and died instantly. Must have been too much for his heart. Next, after recovering the magical thingy and the temple collapsing around him, Buggy managed to escape into his airship just as the island exploded. Sadly, there must have still been some magic in the air as Buggy phased through the ship floor and fell to his death.Upon awakening at the crash site, McBugstien decided to make some repairs to his ship. He decided to make a venture into the mine to the west and after killing a Bat-Dog that, upon death, flew back with such force that it litterally evaporated 5-6 layers of solid rock, Buggy decided to decend deeper into the cavern, firing his grappling hook into the floor to make his slow decent. Sadly, Buggy must have shot himself in the foot, as he instantly died once again. Deciding that firing high powered grappling hooks near ones body is probably not the best thing, Buggy fired it into the cieling and decended down into the depths. After killing a Marauder (or at least thats what Buggy hoped it was) he jumped onto a ledge containing a copper vein. Little did Mr.Bugstien know, that the copper had been irradiated by whale blubber and procceeded to keel over and die once again. Thus ended the life of Mr.Bugstien at least until the world in which he lives becomes a little more stable			"

I get the impression, one day the people behind it will start anew, get it right and be hailed as the new minecraft of the next decade.In short, wonderful ideas which are let down by the lack of a little polish. I would buy the game as you may get more out of it but only if you are hardcore into these sort of things.			"

												This game seemed like a lower quality game when I first played.  I gave it a chance, and played it for several hours to find out if the mechanics and gameplay made up for the graphics.  At first I enjoyed it.  I liked the platforming, and the grappling hook made for some enjoyable mechanics.  But when I got into the exploration of the temples in the game, I came to realise its major downfall.  The temples are massive, repetitive, full of beginners' traps.  They're made difficult not by clever level development or intelligent enemy AI, but instead are just full of areas where you can't avoid taking damage.   The whole game boils down to a test of how much frustration you can endure before rage quitting.  I should have known better when I read the description on the store page and it said this game is similar to contra and terraria.  Trying to simply emulate other games without putting enough effort into flushing out your own designs is doomed from the beginning.  Overall, I don't think it's a particularly terrible game, I just feel disappointed to see such a missed opprotunity.			"

												I know this game is currently being updated but as the game sits it feels incomplete and like it should be an early access title. When playing this game I was sure it was a beta or something but I was suprised to find out it wasn't being sold as an early access title. The art style is weird and assests don't really fit together, the sound effects were probably taken from a royalty free site and they sound very cheesy, and the viewpoint of the game seeing individual blocks as more like logs is unnecessary and confusing. The ideas presented in this game are really cool and the whole build your own airship thing works but there are too many other things that just don't in my opinion. Maybe after a significant amount of updates this game will be a lot better but since it's not an early release title, this cannot be guaranteed.			"

												You Will Love This Game.Movement felt odd at first and I wasn't sure I liked it, but the more I played the more I began to love this game.My favorite thing so far: getting attacked by a pirate airship, blasting a hole in their hull, seizing control, then looting it midair, and grappling to my ship as their ship plummets due to my stripping all its vital parts. The movement feels wierd, until you do something like hop over incoming shot and unload a double barreled shotgun into an enemy through a doorway.The collecting & levelling system feels much nicer than any of the other crafting/sidescrollers I've played. It's mostly about money: You can loot enemy ships for parts, go whaling, buy items that are actually good (vs only available by findling Xbajillion ultra rare), buy recipes for items, mine, pound a ship into the ground to mine faster..., you also buy/upgrade characteristics of your character for bonuses like double jumping and carry wieght.  So you can hunt for more rare stuff, but you can also choose to do whatever feels the most fun at the moment. I Countless times I headed out for a mission and ended up in an air battle that turned to 2 as I scrapped them for parts (money!).			"

												This isn't a bad game from the little I was able to play it, but there were a lot of problems with the controls, not to mention having a hard time getting it to start up to begin with.  I had trouble with it crashing even after I upgraded my video card drivers.  I played a total of about two hours before the technical issues got to me and I asked for my money back.As to the game itself, what little I saw was very creative.  I personally like the visuals, and the flora and fauna are very creative.  However, controling the main character was too difficult.  I expected there to be some manuvering and a learning curve for directing the air ships, but the PC herself was flailing all about, over-shooting her mark and making it hard to avoid dying by landing wrong.I don't like the weird layout of the blocks.  In Terraria, the screen is completely 2-D, so wherever you point your mouse cursor is where your character digs.  Here, it's like they were trying to give a slight three-dimensionalness to it, but that made it hard to know just where I was aiming when I was trying to shoot or to dig.I really wanted to like this game - REALLY wanted to.  It's a fabulous idea, and as I said, the graphics are great.  I just can't get past the difficulties.If you're used to Terraria-style game play, I can't in good faith recommend this game.			"

												Lets me first say that this game is fun. but it still feels like an unfinished game with the constant crashing, terrible ui, (no mouse wheel like every other game that has number selection for item, also crafting is hard to find what you need and what items are good for what since the wiki is still new. Beside all that stuff that makes it less enjoyable, I still like this because it's another terreria clone,  that has a couple of new cool ideas. The best is the ship building and man is it cool. Not just build it with liike wood, iron, or diamond, it's gots lots of minerals that each have different properties that can make your ship immune to fire, chemical, lighter. You try to build the most efficient ship at killing mining, basically a moblie station. Try doing that in this game, it's hard. The music is good for this game. The grappling hook is fun to use. So don't get it yet if you don't want an early access type of game. Wait to see if they can fix the things that might annoy you, just like they do to me. Also, i got this game for $1 on some inde bundle, so that's the best price you can get. Good luck finding it for better. Quick Review:Thinkk Terreria meets Space Engineers with fun physics and cool ship battles.... but still in early access, despite it not saying so.			"

												First off, this is not ""Terraria"" or ""Minecraft"" & all the fanboys who scored this low because Terraria was their 1st sandbox need to go explore the playground some more.  Judge ""Windforge"" for what it is, not what you want ""Terraria 2"" to be.  There is NO WAY this game is under a 70/100 meta in quality.  There are far worse sandboxes out there with far higher scores.""Windforge"" answers the question:  What would it be like if ""Terraria"" was steampunk and written by Herman Melville?   Make Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥your personal Airship.  The physics feel damn good, especially the grappling hook, which is exhillerating like ""Worms"" when the ninja rope *finally* feels right.  The low-G is fun, taking a bit of adjustment from the run-of-the-mill pltaform physics.  It takes a practice, but is ultimately rewarding once you realize just how far you can push getting close to death and surviving.  Often I catch myself on a cliff edge -midair- with my hook right before I hit the ground.  Tons of hunting & gathering, with craft to match.  Classic interface for the genre with the addition of several tools, notably the Repair tool, which with a wave of your mouse fixes your ship -to your origional design- making the destruction element of the game much more forgiving and enjoyable.  The story is different, intriguing, open ended to and extent, and quite charming.  For those fooled by the graphical style while mining, the key is -unlike Terraria- aiming *past* the block you want..  then it moves along at a good pace.  With a little practice, ""Windforge"" is a fun adventure where the art style makes the sandbox a joy to just putt around in, or the dangerous world is a great survival escapade.  ...and, seriously...

Don't waste your money, or your time - I wouldn't even play this if it were free.First of all, ignore the apparent play time I have, I only registered this game with Steam to write this review - I have a DRM free version.This game is bloody awful.  I Kickstarted this game, and bought 3 copies, having high hopes for it and trusting that the developers would do a good job.  I've Kickstarted loads of games, and this is the only one I regret (despite some of them being less than awesome) - I wasted my money.  Don't do the same.The controls are sluggish, odd and feel disconnected; the story is boring and pointless; the crafting/construction is clumsy and poorly planned.  This isn't a survival game, it isn't an adventure game, and it isn't a builder game (like Terraria or Minecraft) - at best, it is a clunky platformer with some gimicky construction tacked on.It is difficult to pin down any particular problem with Windforge, as the concept is a good one, and the game really deserves to be decent - but something in the implementation leaves a lot to be desired; it just doesn't work.  The whole point of any *game* is to be entertaining, and this isn't - it's boring.  It feels like work.  I want to enjoy it; it is full of stuff I should like (steampunk, airships, sky whales, resource collection, construction, adventure - hell yes!), but it is just put together with so little finesse, and such poor implimentation that it falls flat.  It is lifeless, and tedious.I guess the developer's thinly veiled attempts at money grubbing during the Kickstarter campaign should have warned me off - but, I hate to say, I trusted that they believed in the game enough to do what was required to make it good, even if people didn't throw vast sums of money at them.  I was wrong.  Honestly, I'm pretty surprised that they finished it at all - although they seem to have done only the bare minimum to achieve that.			"

												The popular expression ""A glass half full"" best describes Windforge as a game. The metascore windforge received was well earned. Read from the various critics and you'll soon realize how unpolished windforge really is. Caverns do not reveal themselves entirely. Gameplay mechanics feel rather clumsy when compared to other sandbox games. The mining target/hitbox is very inaccurate. Nothing feels finished. Spending more time working out the kinks in the system would have made windforge a real gem. What a waste.			"

I didn’t know game like this existed. I was able to build and customize my own airship “spent more time doing this in the start then the storyline”. Had an awesome RPG aspect to it.The Story line was a little short for my liking but loved it none the less. The travel in the game became a bit tedious” sending me to one place only to send me back a forth a few time between several zone did get annoying” but was worth it none the less. My one pet peeve was the “dungeons” I was able to run in and out with next to no adventure. I know my choice to adventure around them or not but a goal would have been nice to have. You know other than running in owning the bad guy and running out.I wish this game had some sort of multi-player aspect I would play it all day long!			"

												Somewhat half-baked but probably the most ambitious Terraria clone out there.Windforge has a semi-unique steampunk aesthetic and instead of houses you have air ships. Everything is a bit clunky on building and not everything instantely makes sense, especially with quests. But it does have a sense of adventure to it that's quite nice and some of the art is quite good while basic blocks and such don't look great. Backgrounds and those whales look fantastic though.It's an interesting curiosity. Not worth a lot of money but good on sale. It needs to be polished and perhaps some more content would be great but as is it's worth it on sale for the airships alone. If you're willing to put some time in to understand building and all that, you might like it. I did.			"

Hoping for the magical update that would fix my issue asap:Every time I give the game another chance it gets ruined by the horrible movement within a few minutes. I cannot imagine that the devs decided that this was fine.The game itself looks very interesting and got plenty of good stuff, but I'm focusing more on not falling from edges while moving than exploring the content this game has to offer.It's a real shame, why didn't they try to change it, or why didn't they change it in the first place pre-release?

												Excellent game even though it was never finished, sadly. Yes it can be buggy and there are things missing, however it is still very pleasurable to play. It has elements of Terraria with Airships. I still hold out hope someone decides to pick up the reins and either finishes this game or starts over and recreate a game with similar aspects plus more. This game to me is worth the cost and I have almost 200 hours into it. If you are a person who only will play perfect polished games don't buy.

												Is this a Terraria clone? Yes. Does it do anything different? Also yes.I've played 36 hours of this game, most of which was progressing through the quests. I was overleveled and overgeared by the time I finished them, sure, but I never bothered much with making a neat skyship or building my own fortress. This game HAS a story, a distinct story that you are a character in. This makes it VERY different from other games in this genre, such as Starbound or Terraria. Starbound HAS a story, but it's a background story that has very little real affect on the game. Windforge has a story that drives the game forward.The grapling hook feels good, the combat is heavily based around dodging bullets, and you can tame and ride any of the beast enemies in the game.It's far from perfect, though. The AI isn't terribly bright. Most enemies can be beaten by closing a door before their bullets hit you, opening it to shoot, and closing it again. The final boss was a bit of a disappointment, but that may have been do to me being practically unkillable at that point. The leveling system is oddly implimented, requiring large sums of money in a Elder Scrolls training style of upgrading skills, or using dungeon drops to make potions. The game never really explains this, so you just have to figure it out. I wasted a bunch of my dungeon drops on health upgrades because I just didn't know. The airship combat is like the normal bullet-dodge combat, but if your ship loses it's balloon that can be it for you. Luckily, you very rarely have to actually use your ship to combat, and can normally board enemy vessels.Overall? It's still pretty good, despite it's flaws and bugs. 7/10 for not enough water.			"

In-depth 2 minute ReviewBelow the short informative review video, you'll also find a written review, should you prefer reading to listening.


YouTube™ Video: Swash! ❧ Windforge Critique 

			Views: 288		

			WindForge is a 2D building-block RPG, similar to Terraria. Developed and published by Snowed In Studios out of Canada, WindForge is available on the developers homepage and on Steam!		

REVIEWWhen I first read about Windforge, I was quite intrigued to say the least. A procedural world filled with quests, combined with the building and crafting possibilities of Terraria and a Contra-style combat. Soon afterwards however, I started up the game and was unpleasantly surprised by its graphics. The weird isometric view, with the mashup of two dimensional characters just looks odd and out of place. The ugly repeating textures all of the place were giving me the rest in terms of aesthetics. But then again, judging a book by its cover often leads to missed out opportunities. So I delved in a bit deeper. After a small tutorial section, that ended up with me flying around with a self-build flying machine, I was swayed into joy again, which was not meant to last though, as the combat soon after was more than just sluggish. The main reason being the floaty controls. Followed by that however, came the final dagger, twisted into the already heavily wounded SwashbucklingSir: when entering a larger town area, the game ditched all frames into the abyss, leaving me with measly 10 frames per second or even lower at times. Barely able to move about the place, I decided that Windforge might not be as ready to be released yet, as the developer would want it to be. An ambitious project, no doubt about it, but sadly the weird mash-up in terms of aesthetics, the unresponsive controls and the horrible performance do not earn much praise for Windforge. "

												Windforge is a game about sailing through the sky in a home-made airship that you craft, modify, design, build and repair as you battle sky-pirates and seek out ancient artefacts. Set in a Steampunk world where everyone lives amongst the clouds, Windforge combines the destructibility, 2D perspective and mining mechanics of games like Starbound and Terraria with its unique premise. That should be a recipe for success - the concept is brilliant and early signs are good that a world of depth and exploration is about to open up before you. In short, if I were reviewing a game design document rather than an actual game, I'd be giving it a much higher score than the one Windforge is about to receive. Unfortunately Windforge is a game beset by problems that slowly chip away at the enthusiasm earned by its obvious promise, it's a dreadful shame because there is real ambition on display here. Windforge is set in a world where Whale Oil is the primary resource used to operate industry and keep the ubiquitous airships from falling out of the sky. Your character is working for an underground organisation, tasked with uncovering the advanced technology of a race known as the 'Aetherkin', defying the laws of society in the process. Although Windforge gives you the freedom to explore and fight on your own terms, there is a central storyline driving things forward, with quests sending you off to the far corners of the sky in search of the means to utilise a renewable energy source to replace the rather less renewable Whale Oil. The game begins by having you select the class, hair colour and gender of your on-screen avatar before throwing you knee deep into a story-led tutorial that sees you rescuing a translation tablet from a crumbling temple. It's a decent enough introduction that sees you coming to terms with the platforming and fighting elements of the game as well as operation of the jack-hammer that replaces the starting pickaxe of similar titles. Before long the tutorial takes you to your airship and requests that you mine the materials required to repair it. This is where the first warning signs begin to flash. While both Terraria and Starbound revel in the simplicity of 2D pixel art, the most basic elements such as mining and building are remarkably precise and refined enterprises. Here, not so. Mining in Windforge is the first task that demonstrates that all's not well, it's never entirely obvious where you are mining, and a task as simple of grabbing a few chunks of ore quickly becomes arduous. The inherent fiddliness on display here sadly extends to building and navigation of the world as well as flying your ship. While moving your ship is as simple as using the WASD keys, a lone vine hanging down from a sky island can completely halt your progress. Navigation troubles can occasionally lead to hilarious moments as you smash your ship into a town, wrecking both in the process. Sadly the AI does not really react to this (most NPCs are quite happy to ignore a bullet in the face too). My post-tutorial adventures in Windforge were at first thrilling; coming across a tiny aggressive ship manned by sky pirates, I leapt from my own ship to theirs, using my grappling hook to catch on to the balloon keeping it afloat, before climbing aboard and dispatching the two pirates that manned it with my hunting rifle. Now I had choices - do I capture the tiny vessel and take it to town to add to my fleet, or strip it for parts with my removal tool, adding further engines and turbines to my own ship? Windforge has moments where the concepts threaten to cohere into a satisfying whole, yet its severely hamstrung with fiddly menus, and worse controls. An act as simple as moving through a town becomes a chore, overladen with pedantic platforming and odd design that seems to have been thrown together by an army of sadistic architects. The first quest tasks you with finding someone within a town to turn in an item - typical RPG-fare that quickly becomes frustrating with the lack of direction or finesse in moving your character from point A to point B. Later quests that see you exploring temples for further artefacts too are rendered into frustrating exercises, you're constantly fighting against a game that doesn't seem to want you to play it, from movement to ship navigation, down to the act of destroying terrain – nothing is as smooth as it should be. Combat is relatively simple, using ranged and melee weapons to take down well imagined sky creatures and bandits, yet again the paucity of the AI prevents this from being as fun as it should be. Windforge is almost an oddity in an age of PC gaming where 'early access' seems to be the way to release an unfinished game into the wild, allowing creators the time and resources they need to offer a polished complete experience. What we have here is a game that would clearly benefit from extra time – and the advice and input of beta testers could have allowed it to become something more than worthy of its peers. Instead, we’re left with a game that promises so much, but falters repeatedly in its delivery. The 2D platformer with Minecraft elements and bits of the RPG genre (someone really needs to come up with a snappy name for this) is expanding in exciting directions and Windforge deserves to be a part of that. Yet the novelty of airships and battles with giant sky-whales are simply not enough to save it from its flaws, painful as they are. Perhaps post-release support will allow Windforge to transform into the game I hoped it would be, but for now it sits as a flawed gem. It veers between a showcase for ambitious design and an exercise in endurance as you grapple with the controls and wince at the obvious problems, willing the game to live up to its fantastic premise. But it never quite does.Slightly Recommended "

Product received for free
												Windforge is a Block Building RPG set in a Steampunk universe that offers the ability to create and pilot airships. It also includes a story and RPG elements.Gameplay: Gameplay is where this game shines offering tons of crafting and other ways to satisfy multiple types of gamers. Airships can be built from scratch or you can modify your starter ship. There are weapons armor and loads of other objects and building components to craft with an ingredient based crafting system. Gameplay is somewhat like other 2D block building games however areas separated by loading screens which was unnecessary. This doesn’t kill the fun you can have by exploring. Airships are necessary to move from zone to zone since falling thousands of feet is not healthy for your character. While flying you will encounter enemies including but not limited to bandits and Flying Whales that will attack unprovoked if you get too close. With living creatures and other NPCs attacking what else is there to worry about? Meteors coming from below. These meteor showers are really annoying early on and will tear up your airship like a M134 firing over 3000 rounds into a minivan. Combat wasn’t anything new or exciting but it was fun and worthwhile. You can choose a melee approach or a ranged approach either way it was pretty fun taking down bandits and hostile wildlife. Story:For a story well it was okay. It has those cool moments but there aren’t enough and it did feel somewhat bland however it touches on a similar real world topic the topic being our most used fuel source depleting. Whale oil is the fuel source and a replacement is trying to be found of course the only possible viable replacement is highly illegal to research. It is pretty much the typical quest to save the world/human race plot. This sort of plot is getting old thanks to TV, movies ,and other video games.Difficulty:The learning curve isn’t too large the tutorial was straight forward. The only truly difficult part of Windforge was navigating meteor showers along with the occasional whale attack early on in the game.Major Issues: A part of any game that degrades quality if optimization. While Visiting the first town my frame rate dropped from a steady sixty to ten and wouldn’t go above twenty. This made me cringe and is an issue that should be fixed. Pros:Crafting SystemBlock BuildingRPG ElementsBuildable AirshipsOkay StoryDecent Learning CurveGood Combat Cons:Optimization IssuesUnnecessary Loading ScreensThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												This game is fantastic! This is easily one of the best sidescrollers I have EVER played! This game is very fun and addictive! It's also very challenging! This is a great game and rather cheap! I won't go into detail, but the customer service is also VERY good at Snowed In Studios!The only thing I would ask of the devs to improve Windforge, is more quests just to extend the story, but most of all, more options! There are very few options for the game, settings-wise. I would love it for more to appear so that mine wouldnt lag that 1 tiny bit it does when I go into a town or temple, which is where bosses appear so you can imagine the fun I was having XD Overall, fantastic game! I would recommend this to EVERYONE! Get it now whilst its on sale! (Until the 22nd of June, 2015)			"

												Ok; so this is a *part-review* meaning i havew only got to the first town so will not be a *full-review* and will try to keep updated as i experience more of this AMAZING game:First, a little note to ammount of *how many games in-one* this game actually is - Terraria? CHECK! Contra? CHECK! Gods? CHECK! (that old platformer from the 80s/90s?) no idea why i think its like gods though lol.Ok, so this game takes place in a Steampunk world/universe, where everyone HAS to use air-ships (due to the fact you have FLOATING ISLANDS!!! and no... *terra-firma* as such. You also have... SKY-WHALES ! which i think the story centers around (the Sky-Whale population is dwindling, due to the fact that this world lives off sky-whale by-products (meat to eat and oil for their industry) so it is your job to find a new (or OLD) peice of tech, so the world can survive.Now the review.Pros:+ All-of-the-above-games-listed-in-one-game!!!!!!!!!+ Creative/survival/platformer heaven!!!+ 100% destructable (and creatable) evironment!!!+ Old-school graphics (LOVE IT!!!!)+ Rpg (leveling - kind of) and quests+ Main story (you actually have a POINT)+ Proceedurally generated (kind of)... the islands are the same, but their locations in the world + that of their loot/minerals will change on every playthrough+ The price for what you actually get!!!Cons (ARE there any???)Ok, the only cons i think there are is that this game does NOT hold your hand (appart from the *lip-service* tutorial)Other people might think all of my above *pros* would be *cons* if they don't like that kind of thing; if this is the case? Don't even bother with this game!!!10/10 would destroy the temple again! ;)			"

												Played this with a bunch of friends for ~5 hours during an Indie-Game Saturday event.While I ultimately cannot recommend Windforge, it is probably worth the $15 pricetag.Pros:1. Wonderful artwork2. Great game mechanic (Terraria but with fully functional aircrafts)3. Lots of crafting recipes (I heard like 1500)4. Cool map with drastically different 'biome'-esk areas and different windstream patterns, etc.5. Pretty cool physics and engineering depth when building the aircraftsCons:1. Dungeons could almost be considered broken in the state that they are in (finished game) - they are either randomly generated or just poorly made. They are way too big, too hard to get in to, and completely boring.2. The AI is as dumb as can be as far as the enemies go3. Probably the biggest con is that everytime you go to a new scene (next section of the map), everything resets. This is hard to describe but those that have played the game will absolutely agree. Basically if you are mid-fight and jump to the next scene usually by accident, the game loses all memory of said fight and all that you have is much less ammo to show for it. This is made worse by each section of the map being ridiculously small.Meh:1. Music is ok. Not great. They should also have breaks in it - playing for 5 hours straight I started to really notice this.Overall, great great potential but I could not recommend the game. I certainly could see getting $1 an hour for this (for those that base value on that aspect).			"

												meh.... a little disappointed, for a game that is completely released it is waaay too buggy. I definitely think Starboundor Edge of space will be much better. I am utterly dissapointed in this game and would like my money back.Edit: I will say however that the Dev's are very nice and aware of the bugs, so the game will be recieving patches, so we'll see what happens :)			"

												Cons:The 2.5D view was a very poor design decision and makes digging intolerable. Movement controls are very subpar. Tried this game after coming from Terraria and kept wanting to go back.Pros:Visuals are fantastic. The concept of a craftable mobile base is amazing (and the one thing that I felt missing in Terraria). Couldn't progress further into the game to find out other things.The game has good potential but will probably remain crappy because the 2.5D appears to be part of the core game engine that cannot be ""patched out"".

The story and skills to name two. I could go on and on about things I would like and things that need to be fixed. I have a list (Really). Dont get me wrong!

												Since Terraria is a clone of Minecraft (although it actually has merits) and this is a clone of Terraria, I get to bust out the sadly-overused:OH, LOOK. ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MINECRAFT CLONE. STOP. MAKING. THESE.Seriously, I could rant for hours on how many boring games are♥♥♥♥♥♥out to try to cash in on Minecraft's success, but I'll leave that for another time (i.e. never since I'm too lazy). Windforge is probably floating around near the bottom of that group of garbage, since it's more or less actually painful to play.It's glitchy, broken, boring, abandoned by its devs, and crashes more often than a plane with one wing. The airship is kind of neat as a basis for crafting, but it's unwieldy and annoying to build/fix, the map is unnecessarily broken up into segments (I think they were going for some kind of 'map sector' feel which is effectively just 'unnecessary transitions'), crafting is kind of irksome, combat is inconsistent, and finding materials is a chore. Items glitch through the ground all the time, blocks are unnecessarily small compared to your character so trying to do any kind of ""mining"" takes forever, cities and maps are messy and annoying to traverse. Instead of making me mad at how terrible it is, however, it just makes me sad, since this is obviously just the developers going ""Hey, Minecraft is good, let's make Minecraft except 2D and steampunk!"" rather than having some kind of originality.It's not rage-inducingly bad, but I think Windforge is a good example of how the gaming industry is getting overfilled with crap pushed out by people who don't care and paid for in advance by idiots with no sense of financial responsibility. I got this from some Humble Bundle or other, and I wish I could return it, my library is already filled with ""It's Minecraft except _______"" games that piggyback onto Humble Bundles and other deals to try to spark some life back into them. Just let them die, please. Stop rewarding people who don't deserve it.			"

												You know pixel piracy? I don't but I got this thing here and I very much like it despite the many bugs so many peoples complained about (impatient Kickstarter backers - LOL)It is not pixelized voxelized or anything else LOW bit junk. It looks more like a ♥♥♥♥in 2D Flash sidescroller with cutout bodyparts but much more smoother than in your average flash game.I don't know what people are talking about: I can fly my fortress around, transitions between areas are a bit long but that depends on your CPU mainly. Enemies differ between moronic creatures or annoying as hell flying serpents with fire breath.The NPCs are sometimes ok, sometimes so OP they wipe you out with a single hit unless you got armor. Only real problem is the slowing down when you are inside the cities (must be my♥♥♥♥♥♥CPU) and the horrid visuals that ask a lot of getting used to from new players. It tears alot and strains your eyes a bit too much with its non blocky color schemes (maybe its just my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen that tears the frames apart maybe something wrong with Vsync... Anyway:Put the health items above the movement keys, forge a mighty rifle (sell that ♥♥♥♥ing starting pistol its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just blow away evrything that comes in between you and your objective. The hit detection on creatures is sometimes a bit off especially when using the starting gear... but the Doublebarrel shotie fixes any worries about accuracy and damage in no time. Gathering ressources can be a chore and digging tunnels trough the islands is also a waste of time unless you got the right perks and gear. Air battles and hunting flying whales is a matter of pattern and your design preferences (maybe your ship has a lot of expendable armor on one side, maybe it can be locked into place to hold the other ship or even catch a whale carcass. Unfortunately sometimes maneuvering around smaller islands becomes a chore because even thin plants cause your ship to colide with the ground and completely slowing down your movement to zero.Best thing I like are the grappling mechanics. Hell is it fun to do the spiderman from one flying island to a nearby airship or if you fall from the sky maybe reach a nearby cliff before smashing into something. Lost your ship? Just steal one from any passersby and after reaching your fortress again demolish it to sell the parts. Its like Terraria meets GTA in STEAMPUNK UPDATE: SO apparently not a whole lot has changed and I progressed even further into the game. A few sky gods dead and my ship upgraded for every situation I ventured on and found a whole bunch of nice weapons for myself. There is literally a gun that is a rocket engine xD powered with hydrogen. This thing can be forged into an even better badass recoil flamethrower that can send you flying around the map. So there is a whole world foryou to explore once you get into the crafting and improving. Also. If you like Ship building this one is for you. 2D Sandbox done right. IMHO			"

												Windforge is very unique in a lot of ways. The 2D contra-like combat is very fun, as is the mining and building. Some aspects of gameplay aren't obvious, and there is a bit of a learning curve (E.G. how to effectively kill a whale). The airships look a bit hoaky, as they are essentially flying houses. However they are still fun to build and design, as you have to worry about things such as power, bounyancy, and weight.  Small things like grappling hooks make this game fun.   My main complaint is the lack of side-quests. Although you aren't forced to work on the main storyline, there isn't much else to do. Most of the game consists of raiding temples, and occasionally gunning down bad guys. I would like to be able to build a town, raid an enemy base, or maybe even do some trading.  "

												As a person who is a huge fan of games like Terraria, Minecraft, DayZ, and Dark Souls, this game pushes all of my buttons in the right sort of way. I purchased this game in a bundle ($3.00 for a Humble Bundle of 4 games) and honestly can't believe that I never played this game sooner, or even really heard of it for that matter. As many of the reviews of this game state that there is crashing problems, and janky controls and such, as of today I have not encountered any of these issues. Not sure If I'd pay the $14.99 they are currently asking on steam (cause I'm cheap), but if you can manage to pick this up in a sale or bundle, do yourself favor. GET IT!Things I like:-Just the right amount of hardness (everything from enemies, to quests, to mining. It all has just the right amount of danger to make it challenging and fun.)-The freedom to build your own air ship ANY way you would like is just awesome. Most games don't come anywhere close to this much sandbox fun. Not to mention the thousands of approaches you can take to completing missions or fighting bosses. Drill through walls, build barriers, hijack ships, or take them head on.-Tons of items to craft, and weapons and items to collect.-The balance of weapons/leveling/health and such is spot on (So far)-Graphics are not the best, but they are decent, as is the audio.-Physics A+-The world and storyline are original and creative.Things I dislike:-Not much-Hatches can be quite annoying, and difficult to get through in panicky situations.-There is so much content that a more in depth tutorial is needed.-I wish they had a hardcore mode that enabled permadeath. Would make this game so effing hard! (but fun)-U.I. could be a bit more streamlined.			"

												It's a fun game, but in it's current state, it lacks polish. At time of writing I've played for just under an hour, and it's crashed three or four times. No explanation, no 'not responding', the game just closes. This is a serious deal-breaker for me, which is a shame because the game has potential. The idea of being able to build your own airship and fly away sounds good, and the game itself is fun, even if the movement is a little glide-y, which makes some of the platforming a little difficult.tl;dr: don't buy it right now, wait for a sale and/or until they fix the crashing			"

												Really fun idea, but terribly executed. The game slows down every thirty seconds or so to load blocks around the user, leading to an abysmal frame rate and extremely choppy, laggy gameplay.It's also very, very buggy. The last straw for me was when I jumped for a ledge, hit it with my grappling hook, but then I kept falling, my grappling hook sprite glitched up (there were two ropes visible), and the fall damage from the missed jump killed me and I lost about an hour's worth of loot.Probably won't be playing this again anytime soon.

												It has quite a lot of problems; The UI is less than stellar, the on-ground combat can be sort of dodgy, the character customisation  extends only as far as gender and hair colour, and the ship building, which plays a HUGE part in the gameplay experience is very awkward and basically not explained at all.The crafting system is cool and accessible, and for the most part makes a lot of sense, suffers a lot because even if you know what to do, your character CANNOT make something without knowing the recipe. This bugged me a lot because although it makes sense for complicated things like engines and guns and machine parts, I find it very difficult to imagine my guy doesn't know how to make ""cooked meat"".But honestly, it is still a really fun game! Even with the problems I mentioned, I've still already sunk hours into it and plan to sink many more. The world feels HUGE, even though it is very specifically mapped out and not open ended like minecraft, it is still epic and massive.When you know how the ship building works exploration feels big and adventurous, and occasionally if you find a large ruin or a cave system or something, exploration and materials gathering always feels cool and rewarding. The game features a heavily used grappling hook mechanic (which I thought was lazy at first, but it REALLY grew on me when I used it) and when you get used to using it, it is such a cool way to get around and safely explore.So yeah, the game has a few problems, but when you get into it and find your rhythm, they will take a backseat to your steampunk airship adventuring.

												Amazing game.  So very fun.  I got so much fun out of this game. I cannot wait for the next title from these devs..  I felt  so good about this title that I had to send an email to the developers thanking them for making it.   Not only did it help me though a tough time, but it was a good story as well.   Fun engaging gameplay (think terraria + original bionic commando), creative and immersive storyline, and fun open world.			"

												This game is not so bad when coming from a game like Terraria.  If you enjoy that kind of game, you should like this game with a twist.  The twist that involves buildling airships and encounter flying whales.  Pretty interesting.   While I would give a thumb up on designing and building airships, the rest of the game kind of feels flat.  Movement does not really feel smooth to me as it can be little problematic to control sometimes.  You would notice this when you are trying to make a precise movement such as getting out of a hole or the likes.While I do not recommend this game, but if you happen to own this game from a bundle like me, I do recommend giving the game a try.  I think it takes about an hour or 2 to feel the vibe of this game.  I did and it was not really positive but I kept going and wanted to give airship designing and construction a complete effort which I actually enjoyed.Airship construction aspect, I would give 7-8 rating but the rest of the game feels 5 roughly.  Just not really good enough to deliver to my liking.			"

												Great game.  Steampunk flying-island Terraria with airship combat.  Too bad it has no multi-player co-op, it'd be so perfect.  If you liked Terraria (personally, I loved it slavishly), then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND Windforge.As with other games in the Terraria-clone genre, it has crafting and fighting and harvesting and so on, and all of that works well, although not necessarily better than any other game.  Crafting requires you to collect recipes in the world, which you could view as good or bad.The questline/plot is entirely adequate, and the pacing of the plot is very good.  In particular, I always knew what to do next if I was bored with crafting/mining/whatever, but I was always free to go at my own pace.  But also, I was also never forced to stop following the plot to harvest resources.  This was really well-done game design (and rare!).  On the other hand, the plot itself, while above-average for the genre, wasn't amazing.  Really, it acted as an adequate skeleton to hang awesome gameplay on.Airship combat was really satisfying.  I admit, I descended into outright piracy for a while, as I gave in to the thrill of chasing, damaging, boarding, looting, and scuttling.  I'm not proud of what I became.  Well, except for rich.  I'm proud of the ""rich"" part of what I became.Actually, speaking of becoming rich by doing things I'm not proud of, I'm also not entirely proud of the map segments where I strip-mined entire islands.  Like, removing entire islands, reducing them to their consituent parts, and selling them.  Lucrative as hell, though.I love games with grappling hooks, and this was a particularly good grappling hook.  Fond memories of the Worms ninja-rope were evoked, and amazing ninja-moves were executed (mostly by accident, but I'll still remember myself as a badass).I found the boss-fights pretty easy.  Although I did tend to over-prepare, which is what a game like this lets you do if you want to.  They were also not very different; the same strategy or two seemed to dominate every major fight.  It didn't feel bad, but boss fights were not as thrilling as ship-to-ship piracy.I sure wish it had multi-player co-op.  Ideally with harder challenges to match, especially harder enemy ships.  That'd be so freakin' awesome, holy hell.			"

												Edited 02/17/2015:After an extensive amount of time logged in this game, and conversations with peers, I can say that the game does work.The art, at first looks really nice, but you quickly realize how much deatail is lost with how far out the PoV is. This angle helps with being able to see the action as it happens, but their is very little veriation in the zoom.I can also say that the frame rate is poor to average, droping sharply in many plot-critical locations.Speaking of the plot, for much of the game it takes a back seat (if not stuffing itself into the trunk). While the charecter sets out with the noble goal of saving the world and socity as the world knows it, there is so little support by the in-game cast that one can forget the names of most characters, or that they even exist untill one has a quest to go talk to them. There are also so few quests that one can exsaust the side quests in an hour, and I will say that out of a 70+ hour play through, less than 6 hours were actual questing, of any kind at all. as such, one quickly devolves from an archeologist reaserching forbiden parts of the past and re-discovering world alering technolagy into an air pirate, plundering other ships to get the money for training, ammo, and other supplies, as well as ship components.Another complaint, their is no good dry-dock avalable. In-town, there's just not a lot of space to work with, and out of town, one has to deal with wildlife and other ships while trying to build.That said, I do enjoy game play. Being able to design, construct, and fly my own armed airship. I enjoy flying around, hunting down pieces of the past, trying to save the world. I love the effort that was put into this game. I love that onw has the freedom to go wherever and do whatever in this game. I even started a second play through to try and get the good toys earlier.I just still feel... I want to say disapointed, when I play this game. It feels like it could have become so much more, and for one reason or another, fell flat. It hurts even more when you can see how hard Snowed In tried on this. Its clear how much they wanted to do, and were unable to.But what is here is a joy to play. It is an example of how a game can explore a world with a compleatly different makeup than our own, and even a wonder of its genre. I would strongly recomend it, even with all its flaws.My Final Verdict: 5/10			"

												First the upfront answer, should you buy this game: Yes you should. At release it was a mess but since then the developer has remained committed to their product and hammered out most of the real larger issue show stopping bugs and greatly improved performance. The Positives.I really liked the core game-play of this game, I thought its concept is awesome, It's a lot of fun when the bugs and technical shortcomings do not get in the way. -Building and flying airships is fun, the concept of the game itself is fun. -The story is interesting.-Grappling hook action. Like grappling a dragon thing and riding around on it.-Lots of different armor, items, block and resource types, recipes to craft things, and weapons.-Mining resources, especially from the sky whales flying around in the environment.-Air combat is fun and satisfying, especially using artillery turrets on your foes.-Boss battles.-Hazards are fun. Meteorites in the upper layers, Acid rain in the lower areas. I would say the poison gas of the lower areas but that has a huge performance hit associated with it.-Ground combat is also pretty fun.The Negatives (starting with the most prominent to minor irritations).-Garbage performance of 5-10 fps in the cloudy (trade route) region, and all of the lower poisonous gas regions where the fog effect is used. Making combat in these areas very difficult and as such a poor gaming experience. -Crash to Desktop, general freezing (happens every 2-3 hours roughly) Crashes have been greatly reduced with patches.-Poor save game system. On release there was no date and time listed on saved games, there still isn't at the moment, however they are now listed in order of date modified.-Enemy spawn rate is can be annoying. To the point where its hard to get anything done, like mining. They often spawn just off screen. -Forget building a base or an outpost. There is no way to designate safe areas outside of towns. Technically you could build a base, but enemies will continue to spawn inside it and wreak havoc. -No anchor/harpoon system. Airship constantly sinks regardless of how light or buoyant it is (Only on screen now, offscreen it stays put).  Often you come back and your airship has sunk either out of reach, or fallen out the bottom of the current map into the next. Since the last update: Your airship is anchor (frozen) off screen, and when at port in a town. -Repairs can be tedious, most of your time managing structural integrity. During the beginning of the game this isn’t an issue because the lower tier materials take no time to repair but once you make it to latter in game with better materials with more hp, repair becomes a very tedious task and to make things worse there is only one repair tool rather than multiple tiers like all the other tools have. In combination with the enemy spawn rates, even with the best materials repairing is a huge chore.-Zoom in-game can be annoying, there is no actual ability to zoom in or out at will through something like the mouse scroll wheel, it all depends on how far away from your character the cursor is. The farther out you zoom, the greater the impact to performance, especially in any of the fog areas.-Some of the physics are glitchy and annoying. Like being killed by your own airships hull when standing it it after a creature pushing on the outside has caused it to jump wildly up or downwards a huge amount.  this has been mostly if not completely fixed with patches. My current verdict on the game is 7.5/10 (considering its an indie game with a lower budget and fair price)-Game-play core: good-very good-Graphics: average-Sound Quality: good-Art Style: good-Performance: Good. Still has issues but the bugs now are fairly minor. Could have benefited greatly by early access and larger base of Quality and Assurance Testers.What would my score be without the performance issues and bugs? Around a 7.5-8/10I think without the performance issues and bugs you would really enjoy this game.My System (Understanding performance in terms of hardware):CPU: I7 4960x 3.6 ghz hex coreRam: 16 GB Adata DDR 3 PC-19200HD (game also installed on besides OS) Adata SX900 256GB SSDGPU: EVGA 580GTX (performance in review with new 337.50 beta, and non-beta 335.23 drivers)OS: Windows 8.1 64bit			"

												Possibly the best 2D sandbox crafting game on steam. I give it a 9/10. It has a few bugs (but the active dev team fixes most of them) and the dungeons can get a little repetative, and there's no multiplayer (fingers crossed it will come soon). The pros though: build yoru own airship any way you want. Have multiple airships. Insanely awesome air battles where you can board enemy ships. Fantastic grappling hook mechanics make traversing the world and combat super fun. Very well designed weapons and enemies. Giant flying squids. Really unique environments. Falling meteors can burn your ship if it's not fire proof, and the lower layer has poison gass so your ship has to be air tight. Excellent system for repairing your ship mid combat too. And giant air whales. And PLOT! Decently good plot too. Beautiful environments. Merchents are well designed as well. Tons of cool materials to build with, all with differnet properties like bouyancy, health, and special damage type resistances. Ship building is super fun haing to manage all the different aspects. And there's no 1 solution to anything. You want to make something float? There's 2 ballon types, propellors, whale blubber (it's boyant), and other methods I won't mention because spoilers. If you like sandbox in any way I suggest playing this game.			"

												I almost didn't purchase this after reading some honest criticism. I'm glad it went on sale and I got a hold of this title. Although there are some bugs that will likely never be fixed I have to admit that I have been having a lot of fun.Single-handedly in a small flying raft I decided to capture a flying galleon. I zipped across to the ship as it blew my raft apart. While trying to kill the large crew another ship decides to attack the ship I just landed on! I'm getting fired on from all directions. The bullets fly fairly slow so Im dodging them, but its a lot of action and it's fun! So this crew is really putting the screws down on me when they accidentally ignite their own flamable oil drums. The ship is burning, the crew is burning ,and I'm making off like a sky bandit. The ship is falling from screen to screen. I manage to kill the crew, repair the ship in mid air and survive an epic battle with so many unforeseeable hazards.The steampunk world really fits and you are like this secret-agent-privateer who works with scientists and engineers to make even better equipment in their secret lab. The world is super imaginative and I'm surprised some people haven't enjoyed it as much as I have.Felt sad when I killed my first whale, read there is a way to make them into a pet, but not sure if that feature recieved the polish it deserved.

At release there were a few problems though with the patches streaming out, I think most of them are fixed. I have a gameplay video showcasing some of the early bits of Windforge.

												In theory a good game but the execution is flawed. I stopped playing after 100 minutes into the game. Why?- Wonky controls. You feel like you're constantly walking on ice. And when you're jumping through the air all bets are off.- Badly optimized graphics engine. My frames dropped into unplayable single digits in town, on a machine that can play Skyrim on highest graphic settings.- Weird 2.5D blocks. In theory a neat idea, in execution quite terrible. In a game that's all about building and mining I shouldn't have to question myself which block I'm currently aiming at. Mining minerals out of the ground is a chore which it really shouldn't be in this type of game.Sure, this game has a lot of good components like the neat stat system and the awesome idea of building flying battle stations. Too bad it falls short on the basic mechanics.I really wanted to like this game, but in the end it's just not worth my time. There are too many other games out of there to sink my limited time into.4/10			"

												Recommended if you like Terraria-style games. The game has a nice story and setting, and it's awesome to be able to build an actual moving vehicle!And while I noticed some of the regular complaints, namely: - movement acceleration - unintuitive stash and crafting menu- 2.5D making it difficult to properly place and destroy specific blocksI did not find them that problematic. You get used to the movement acceleration, you soon figure out the stash and crafting, and destroying a few extra blocks and having to replace misplaced ones are not that big of a hassle.The game is a bit short, however, and you advance through to different tiers of materials quite quickly, but if you find it at a sale it could be worth buying. Hopefully they will have some success with this game and make a sequel with a longer story, more kinds of materials, weapons and enemies.			"

												don't let the slightly awkward visuals fool you, this game is a well balanced terraria meets ""metroidvania"" game with deep ship customization and a fascinating world, surprisingly intense ship to ship combat and an overall rewarding experienceadmittedly inventory management is a bit of a chore, dungeons aren't quite as diverse as they could be, and there are certain mechanics that usually get taken for granted in games absent(namely being able to use the scroll wheel to cycle hotkey slots, but that is intended to be fixed in an upcoming patch) the game physics are well implemented and balanced, damage tends to be realistic(getting shot with a rifle messes you up good unless you're well armored), ships respond to collisions as they would in real life, by rapidly being turned into twisted wreckage(this applies to enemy ships as well, lots of fun with an inventive ship design) offset by being able to quickly and easily repair all damage even while under fire. leading to moments of frantically patching up the ship while under a constant barrage, desperately alternating between keeping your smoking heap airborne and firing shots at your opponent, it's amazingly fun, muted though by the rather small variety of enemy ships to encountersome people complain about floaty jumping physics, it's pretty typical for a ""metroidvania"" sort of game, and anyone already used to that won't notice much of a difference, the grappling hook you start the game with makes most jumps trivial, and you can simply place a safety line before a risky jump, and rappel down the side of a mountain to where you want to go, in addition to unlocking wall jumps and double jumps among other things down the linethe fact this game is being continually updated and new content added over time adds replay value as well, just keep in mind this is a metroidvania sort of game first and a terraria game second, as such don't expect much by way of multiplayer, and for the story to have a distinct beginning and end, the small developer team also means updates will likely be a bit slow, but they are very active in the forums and respond to most meaningful issues and suggestions			"

Lucrative as hell, though.I love games with grappling hooks, and this was a particularly good grappling hook.  Fond memories of the Worms ninja-rope were evoked, and amazing ninja-moves were executed (mostly by accident, but I'll still remember myself as a badass).I found the boss-fights pretty easy.  Although I did tend to over-prepare, which is what a game like this lets you do if you want to.  They were also not very different; the same strategy or two seemed to dominate every major fight.  It didn't feel bad, but boss fights were not as thrilling as ship-to-ship piracy.I sure wish it had multi-player co-op.  Ideally with harder challenges to match, especially harder enemy ships.  That'd be so freakin' awesome, holy hell.			"

												don't let the slightly awkward visuals fool you, this game is a well balanced terraria meets ""metroidvania"" game with deep ship customization and a fascinating world, surprisingly intense ship to ship combat and an overall rewarding experienceadmittedly inventory management is a bit of a chore, dungeons aren't quite as diverse as they could be, and there are certain mechanics that usually get taken for granted in games absent(namely being able to use the scroll wheel to cycle hotkey slots, but that is intended to be fixed in an upcoming patch) the game physics are well implemented and balanced, damage tends to be realistic(getting shot with a rifle messes you up good unless you're well armored), ships respond to collisions as they would in real life, by rapidly being turned into twisted wreckage(this applies to enemy ships as well, lots of fun with an inventive ship design) offset by being able to quickly and easily repair all damage even while under fire. leading to moments of frantically patching up the ship while under a constant barrage, desperately alternating between keeping your smoking heap airborne and firing shots at your opponent, it's amazingly fun, muted though by the rather small variety of enemy ships to encountersome people complain about floaty jumping physics, it's pretty typical for a ""metroidvania"" sort of game, and anyone already used to that won't notice much of a difference, the grappling hook you start the game with makes most jumps trivial, and you can simply place a safety line before a risky jump, and rappel down the side of a mountain to where you want to go, in addition to unlocking wall jumps and double jumps among other things down the linethe fact this game is being continually updated and new content added over time adds replay value as well, just keep in mind this is a metroidvania sort of game first and a terraria game second, as such don't expect much by way of multiplayer, and for the story to have a distinct beginning and end, the small developer team also means updates will likely be a bit slow, but they are very active in the forums and respond to most meaningful issues and suggestions			"

												this is one of the games that doesnt look amazing, but once you start playing it... hours and hours will go by. The game its self has some issues with play and menus. The general tool sets, and building is a bit rusty and could be polished some more. The thing that screams at me the most while playing this is, I wish it was two players. However, the sense of adventure and exploring, while building an awesome air ship is  a very good feeling to play. I would say this is what starbound should of been more like.			"

												The physics in the game are lots of fun. The game is reminescent of Terraria, with superior controls, but it lacks the depth and variety. The game has a great asthetic, but a few problems and glitches really rob the game of its potential. Key items (i.e. vulcan forge), manage to disappear from your inventory such that they can't be replaced. Occasionally, critical story elements are skipped and the story can't advance as a result. The penalty (or lack thereof) of dying seems to undermine the challenge of the game. Finally, the game could use a bit more variety: you'll run through nearly all of the random encounters possible on your first trip to a different city--well before you complete the game. Also, the weapons are quite redundant. Summary: the game has great potential, but its nearly too glitchy to finish, and lacks the substance needed to reach its potential. I recommend the game, but it could be so much better with a few minor adjustments.			"

												Recommended if you like Terraria-style games. The game has a nice story and setting, and it's awesome to be able to build an actual moving vehicle!And while I noticed some of the regular complaints, namely: - movement acceleration - unintuitive stash and crafting menu- 2.5D making it difficult to properly place and destroy specific blocksI did not find them that problematic. You get used to the movement acceleration, you soon figure out the stash and crafting, and destroying a few extra blocks and having to replace misplaced ones are not that big of a hassle.The game is a bit short, however, and you advance through to different tiers of materials quite quickly, but if you find it at a sale it could be worth buying. Hopefully they will have some success with this game and make a sequel with a longer story, more kinds of materials, weapons and enemies.			"

												Really fun idea, but terribly executed. The game slows down every thirty seconds or so to load blocks around the user, leading to an abysmal frame rate and extremely choppy, laggy gameplay.It's also very, very buggy. The last straw for me was when I jumped for a ledge, hit it with my grappling hook, but then I kept falling, my grappling hook sprite glitched up (there were two ropes visible), and the fall damage from the missed jump killed me and I lost about an hour's worth of loot.Probably won't be playing this again anytime soon.

												It has quite a lot of problems; The UI is less than stellar, the on-ground combat can be sort of dodgy, the character customisation  extends only as far as gender and hair colour, and the ship building, which plays a HUGE part in the gameplay experience is very awkward and basically not explained at all.The crafting system is cool and accessible, and for the most part makes a lot of sense, suffers a lot because even if you know what to do, your character CANNOT make something without knowing the recipe. This bugged me a lot because although it makes sense for complicated things like engines and guns and machine parts, I find it very difficult to imagine my guy doesn't know how to make ""cooked meat"".But honestly, it is still a really fun game! Even with the problems I mentioned, I've still already sunk hours into it and plan to sink many more. The world feels HUGE, even though it is very specifically mapped out and not open ended like minecraft, it is still epic and massive.When you know how the ship building works exploration feels big and adventurous, and occasionally if you find a large ruin or a cave system or something, exploration and materials gathering always feels cool and rewarding. The game features a heavily used grappling hook mechanic (which I thought was lazy at first, but it REALLY grew on me when I used it) and when you get used to using it, it is such a cool way to get around and safely explore.So yeah, the game has a few problems, but when you get into it and find your rhythm, they will take a backseat to your steampunk airship adventuring.

												Windforge is very unique in a lot of ways. The 2D contra-like combat is very fun, as is the mining and building. Some aspects of gameplay aren't obvious, and there is a bit of a learning curve (E.G. how to effectively kill a whale). The airships look a bit hoaky, as they are essentially flying houses. However they are still fun to build and design, as you have to worry about things such as power, bounyancy, and weight.  Small things like grappling hooks make this game fun.   My main complaint is the lack of side-quests. Although you aren't forced to work on the main storyline, there isn't much else to do. Most of the game consists of raiding temples, and occasionally gunning down bad guys. I would like to be able to build a town, raid an enemy base, or maybe even do some trading.  "

												Great game.  Steampunk flying-island Terraria with airship combat.  Too bad it has no multi-player co-op, it'd be so perfect.  If you liked Terraria (personally, I loved it slavishly), then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND Windforge.As with other games in the Terraria-clone genre, it has crafting and fighting and harvesting and so on, and all of that works well, although not necessarily better than any other game.  Crafting requires you to collect recipes in the world, which you could view as good or bad.The questline/plot is entirely adequate, and the pacing of the plot is very good.  In particular, I always knew what to do next if I was bored with crafting/mining/whatever, but I was always free to go at my own pace.  But also, I was also never forced to stop following the plot to harvest resources.  This was really well-done game design (and rare!).  On the other hand, the plot itself, while above-average for the genre, wasn't amazing.  Really, it acted as an adequate skeleton to hang awesome gameplay on.Airship combat was really satisfying.  I admit, I descended into outright piracy for a while, as I gave in to the thrill of chasing, damaging, boarding, looting, and scuttling.  I'm not proud of what I became.  Well, except for rich.  I'm proud of the ""rich"" part of what I became.Actually, speaking of becoming rich by doing things I'm not proud of, I'm also not entirely proud of the map segments where I strip-mined entire islands.  Like, removing entire islands, reducing them to their consituent parts, and selling them.  Lucrative as hell, though.I love games with grappling hooks, and this was a particularly good grappling hook.  Fond memories of the Worms ninja-rope were evoked, and amazing ninja-moves were executed (mostly by accident, but I'll still remember myself as a badass).I found the boss-fights pretty easy.

												In theory a good game but the execution is flawed. I stopped playing after 100 minutes into the game. Why?- Wonky controls. You feel like you're constantly walking on ice. And when you're jumping through the air all bets are off.- Badly optimized graphics engine. My frames dropped into unplayable single digits in town, on a machine that can play Skyrim on highest graphic settings.- Weird 2.5D blocks. In theory a neat idea, in execution quite terrible. In a game that's all about building and mining I shouldn't have to question myself which block I'm currently aiming at. Mining minerals out of the ground is a chore which it really shouldn't be in this type of game.Sure, this game has a lot of good components like the neat stat system and the awesome idea of building flying battle stations. Too bad it falls short on the basic mechanics.I really wanted to like this game, but in the end it's just not worth my time. There are too many other games out of there to sink my limited time into.4/10			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. Even if it takes some time to get used to its peculiarities, like the odd ¾ side view, wonky physics bugs that make corpses or even entire ships dart off at missile-like speeds, and sometimes-questionable AI, it's still fun once you adapt, if you're one who enjoys 2D dig-em-up type games.So, why can't I give it the old thumbs up? Well, it's not finished.Don't get me wrong, it is feature complete, for the most part – the main questline is functional and the game itself is “winnable”, but there are still bugs and crashes for the player base, and no consensus on their frequency. To top it off, the game seems more or less dead in the water, if not abandoned. While it was actively being worked on, the developers were involved with the forums here, but it seems either they've been tied up with other projects or moved on to greener pastures – neither of which give a good impression.Windforge is certainly an interesting take on 2D builder platforming, but in its current state, I can't justify a purchase in good faith.

												Tried to land at the port for the first time, crashed into the dock, blew out my engines, plummeted down to next area onto another ship which, though crippled, promptly blew me out of the sky, crash landed on a flying mountain, got lost in a cave, leapt off of the mountain onto a bandit ship, commandeered it, flew back to port, crashed into the dock, died on impact.All of the requests for  more stuff, more ships, more enemies, more quests, multiplay are totally valid. but only because this game is that much worth expanding. i could play this forever if there was a steady steam of content like terreria. i havent had that raw, incredible feeling of an epic unscripted event from a 2d game in longer than i can remember. escaping exploding spike filled temple only to find theres a dragon inside your getaway vehicle, and crashing a homemade airship into a whales face and then turning said whale into a new airship, are among the many ridiculous kinds of trouble you can get yourself into.so far the only cons ive found are that everythings too far away, the controls take a minute to adapt to, no minimap, and theres not enough developer updates anymore (though they did just add mod support so hopefully that will take off).11/10 would learn to park but its less fun that way.

												Possibly the best 2D sandbox crafting game on steam. I give it a 9/10. It has a few bugs (but the active dev team fixes most of them) and the dungeons can get a little repetative, and there's no multiplayer (fingers crossed it will come soon). The pros though: build yoru own airship any way you want. Have multiple airships. Insanely awesome air battles where you can board enemy ships. Fantastic grappling hook mechanics make traversing the world and combat super fun. Very well designed weapons and enemies. Giant flying squids. Really unique environments. Falling meteors can burn your ship if it's not fire proof, and the lower layer has poison gass so your ship has to be air tight. Excellent system for repairing your ship mid combat too. And giant air whales. And PLOT! Decently good plot too. Beautiful environments. Merchents are well designed as well. Tons of cool materials to build with, all with differnet properties like bouyancy, health, and special damage type resistances. Ship building is super fun haing to manage all the different aspects. And there's no 1 solution to anything. You want to make something float? There's 2 ballon types, propellors, whale blubber (it's boyant), and other methods I won't mention because spoilers. If you like sandbox in any way I suggest playing this game.			"

												Despite the mixed reviews (c'mon people, Terraria and Starbound aren't the only great 2D exploration games out there), I found this game to be both fun and aesthetically pleasing.  The excellent music and original setting were two of the best features that sold this to me.  The slightly clunky movement is easily overshadowed by the hilariously fun airship travel and combat system.  The procedural world of floating isles and the navigation system is also amazing.  If you are a fan of the steampunk genre, you will love this unique game.  Too bad it's only single-player (for now).			"

												Personally for me I do not have the problems that other people have. The controls are great for me, so many hotkeys but your really not going to be using that much during battle. Ship building system is weird, the gratings (the backround that connects your ship to pieces further out e,g, I placed a floor in one room then removed half and there was a grating connecting the wall to the platform that was connected to the wall which connected to the wall that was connecting to the platform) ugh I think you get the point. 2.5 D can be confusing but it makes this game more than just plain 2D image.I don't really think anyone cares about this but I'm kind of annoyed my wooden ship doesn't burn up when I'm near the core. If you like seeing airships fall out of the sky to a shot from an artillery cannon or fighting flying whales and squids. Or just physics games, this is the kind of game you might like.I rate this game 6/10.EDIT: I take that back, I didn't know what clunky meant. I personally enjoy the concept, but I don't spend a whole lot of hours on it. Don't buy it right now			"

												Game could have been good, but unfortunately it suffers from a lack of any real development.   Not sure if devs died or something; but this game has been unfinished for a long time now and nothing is being fixed.Edit: Looking back over my review of this game, I think I really shouldn't un-recommend this game just due to that.   Infact I do recommend this game,  it's got some rediculously fun shinanigans that can happen in it.   The only major downsides are that the physics are a bit wonky, the bosses suffer from horrible AI at times and are all pretty much the same, and the majority of the universe feels-  boring.   If you want to simply pull off silly stunts all the time or make a rediculous atrocity of physics, then go ahead and play the game, if you expect an entertaining story-line and polished gameplay,  I suggest trying it, seeing how it makes you feel, and then probably playing something else.

First off, ever since i watched Avatar, the movie with the large blue creature tribe, I've always been fascinated with floating islands, always loved the concept, this game fulfills that fascination better than i imagined, the controls are great except for having to get used to the character sliding a little when changing direction at full speed, which is a bit more realistic than a certain other game that allows you to stop instantly when moving at over 50 mph on foot, and i do very much enjoy the graphics. Overall, the progression system is excellent as no material is ever scoffed at throughout the game, ie copper is used in wiring, iron for steel, etc.. Just a fantastic game in my opinion.			"

												You know pixel piracy? I don't but I got this thing here and I very much like it despite the many bugs so many peoples complained about (impatient Kickstarter backers - LOL)It is not pixelized voxelized or anything else LOW bit junk. It looks more like a ♥♥♥♥in 2D Flash sidescroller with cutout bodyparts but much more smoother than in your average flash game.I don't know what people are talking about: I can fly my fortress around, transitions between areas are a bit long but that depends on your CPU mainly. Enemies differ between moronic creatures or annoying as hell flying serpents with fire breath.The NPCs are sometimes ok, sometimes so OP they wipe you out with a single hit unless you got armor. Only real problem is the slowing down when you are inside the cities (must be my♥♥♥♥♥♥CPU) and the horrid visuals that ask a lot of getting used to from new players. It tears alot and strains your eyes a bit too much with its non blocky color schemes (maybe its just my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen that tears the frames apart maybe something wrong with Vsync... Anyway:Put the health items above the movement keys, forge a mighty rifle (sell that ♥♥♥♥ing starting pistol its♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just blow away evrything that comes in between you and your objective. The hit detection on creatures is sometimes a bit off especially when using the starting gear... but the Doublebarrel shotie fixes any worries about accuracy and damage in no time. Gathering ressources can be a chore and digging tunnels trough the islands is also a waste of time unless you got the right perks and gear. Air battles and hunting flying whales is a matter of pattern and your design preferences (maybe your ship has a lot of expendable armor on one side, maybe it can be locked into place to hold the other ship or even catch a whale carcass. Unfortunately sometimes maneuvering around smaller islands becomes a chore because even thin plants cause your ship to colide with the ground and completely slowing down your movement to zero.Best thing I like are the grappling mechanics. Hell is it fun to do the spiderman from one flying island to a nearby airship or if you fall from the sky maybe reach a nearby cliff before smashing into something. Lost your ship? Just steal one from any passersby and after reaching your fortress again demolish it to sell the parts. Its like Terraria meets GTA in STEAMPUNK UPDATE: SO apparently not a whole lot has changed and I progressed even further into the game. A few sky gods dead and my ship upgraded for every situation I ventured on and found a whole bunch of nice weapons for myself. There is literally a gun that is a rocket engine xD powered with hydrogen. This thing can be forged into an even better badass recoil flamethrower that can send you flying around the map. So there is a whole world foryou to explore once you get into the crafting and improving. Also. If you like Ship building this one is for you. 2D Sandbox done right. IMHO			"

												Steampunk skywhales... this game sells itself. Combat is odd... one of the main influences for that aspect seems to be contra, really slow projectiles to encourage dodge based gameplay, which is kind of defeated by corridory dungeons. Crafting is good, building your own airship is amazing, I'd recommend this game.			"

												Out of all the games of this sidescrolling genre started popping up everywhere. From Starbound, signs of life, to Craft the World, and Terraria. This is the most unique and under estimated. This game when actually given a chance, really is fun. Being able to build a giant flying fortress is fun. Like Starbound this game follows a story and has missions. Tho it's not as apparent in Starbound, this one is. Honestly I love having the direction. The content and mechanics of this game make it a lot of fun. Having a grappling hook adds to the game in a very good way. There isn't really a solid ground persay, everything is floating islands with vicious pirates and creatures. I love it and I wouldn't want them to change the main mechanics of the game at all. It's inexpensive with a lot of longevity and creativity. Worthy of anyone's time who enjoys the genre.. I'm a very picky gamer, but this one is possibly the best of the genre.			"

												Game is fun but as many said, it feel unfinished.  It is still a fun game with a interesting gameplay, so if you can get over the occasionnal glitch (nothing gamebreaking at least), I would reccomend getting it while it's on sale.As for the play value, you get a good amount of time our of it, and it is enjoyable for the most part.  I really liked boarding ennemy ships ;)  It is not a very hard if you learn to use the game mecanics to your advantage, but can still offer some mesure of challenge.I would really like to see a update that would finetune the game into a finished project.  Adding more gameplay would be a bonus.			"

												I almost didn't purchase this after reading some honest criticism. I'm glad it went on sale and I got a hold of this title. Although there are some bugs that will likely never be fixed I have to admit that I have been having a lot of fun.Single-handedly in a small flying raft I decided to capture a flying galleon. I zipped across to the ship as it blew my raft apart. While trying to kill the large crew another ship decides to attack the ship I just landed on! I'm getting fired on from all directions. The bullets fly fairly slow so Im dodging them, but its a lot of action and it's fun! So this crew is really putting the screws down on me when they accidentally ignite their own flamable oil drums. The ship is burning, the crew is burning ,and I'm making off like a sky bandit. The ship is falling from screen to screen. I manage to kill the crew, repair the ship in mid air and survive an epic battle with so many unforeseeable hazards.The steampunk world really fits and you are like this secret-agent-privateer who works with scientists and engineers to make even better equipment in their secret lab. The world is super imaginative and I'm surprised some people haven't enjoyed it as much as I have.Felt sad when I killed my first whale, read there is a way to make them into a pet, but not sure if that feature recieved the polish it deserved.

												Had too many bugs when I got it over a year ago, but before it broke it was very enjoyable, art work is a little distracting at times but its well worth playing.			"
