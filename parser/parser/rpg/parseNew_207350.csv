												Ys Origin does a great job explaining the past, it also features interesting characters that you can finish the game with (each one having their own unique game-play, equipment, short storyline and so).For those who don't know, Ys is an old school action RPG (from the late 80's) that luckily didn't got extinct in today's modern video game industry (That strives to approach to the masses), the surviving series features a very solid and hardcore experience for those who delve in to it (No hands are held here, not suitable for some casual players).Without delving that much in to the storyline, I'll start by saying that the whole game is set in a massively big tower with tons of floors where you'll actively explore till you reach the top, all because due to the fact you're part of a team that is looking for two mysterious female angel like characters who have disappeared and also they are fighting a mysterious evil that suddenly appeared on their land.Just like the first of the series, it is based on your character progression (Status), based on your skill and how well prepared and equipped you're, you'll fight tons of different minions and bosses through out the game.The game is fast paced, if you're used to a slower and less action based game, then do not delve in to this one, you'll have to be quick and prepare yourself to evade any possible attacks and at the same time plan how you'll attack your foes quickly before their defense is up again.You're forced to play the game to unlock new areas as you progress but do take in mind that you're not only forced to a narrow path, you'll have some freedom of exploration to farm and grab new items. As for the game soundtrack you'll be delighted, it is so memorable!In terms of art style and UI they are all professionally done and will set in motion your connection to the game, giving you a taste of immersion (You'll have a good read, the game has a big script), character wise; some are forgettable but overall your experience with them is quite positive. If you like Anime and you like oldschool games that are fast paced and hard, then this is the game for you!			"

												When I bought this game, I didn't expect too much. Like may be it can kill couple of hours of boredom. Most reviews are of some grand praise but how actually this could be any good, YouTube videos quite meh, nothing amusing.     So without much anticipation I picked some girl with axe and started in nightmare difficulty. Control was good and responsive; there are some instruments in your arsenal on how to wreak havoc on your enemies. However, your enemies aren’t going to watch you kill them, some immune to this, some immune to that, some shoot barrages of projectiles, some charge without rest, some come in swarms, some bestow loads of status effects. All of them share one thing: they want you DEAD RIGHT NOW.   Terrain is quite simple, however made well in its simplicity: every zone have unique feeling about it, not like “I can watch landscape forever” of course, but certainly adds to game.    Music was to my liking, which does not necessarily mean that you would like it, but this game strong point is that tracks come in huge variety. Orchestra, piano, violin, harmonica, metal, electronic stuff – game has that all. If you played through whole game and did not like a single track that would be a huuuge “WOW!” from me.   Plot is not complex and has nothing unexpected in it but still makes you feel for characters. If you’re new to YS, it would make a nice introduction, so you won’t have “what’s happening?” feelings, if you’re veteran, some why’s and what’s would be answered.   So like I said, I picked girl with axe and started playing. Shortly I came across that guy – Velagunder, he is boss of first subsection. And he killed me… repeatedly… for six hours straight… WHAT THE F…?! I sure am not “high skilled” player or something, but I was able to finish battletoads, TNMT, contra, rollergames and such titles on NES in my childhood. What is this guy? He surely is enjoying watching me struggle, shouting angry words and writhing in agony. Six hours after he decided to surrender and I was like: “YEAH! DIE! YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! HA! HA! HA!” running around the house like an idiot. Great feeling of completion over some pixels dead body, really not what you would have often nowadays.   And what I would like to say all of this guy's friends share his hobby. This not much anticipated game gave me hell of a journey. May be not the best game I ever played, but one of most memorable for sure. I liked it so much, so I bought other YS games available on Steam, and expecting more to come. YS is great franchise forged for over 20 years already and doing great on delivering suffering and spanking to people.   In conclusion, if you’re YS veteran, I wonder why you haven't bought it already, YS Origin lives up to YS series standards in any way possible and if you’re new to YS whatever you like this game or not is up to you but it is sure worth a try.

												Ys Origin is quite possibly my favorite game on Steam.It might be because I was already a big fan of the Ys series before I played it, but still! It's a great game.Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. To avoid spoilers, I'll only detail the initial two.Hugo Fact is a ranged caster. He is very powerful, firing off spell bullets from his wand and his twin artifacts known as the ""Eyes of Fact"" that hover at his side at all times. His is very agile, but he cannot fire while moving. Yunica Tovah is a melee attacker. Armed with her handaxe (and later greatsword), she excels at close combat. She is very quick, dealing fast, hard damage to her opponents. When you start the game, you get to choose from many different difficulty settings (Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, Very Hard, Nightmare), as well as choose which character you want to play as. Each character has their own storyline, though all three of them are intertwined. Playing each character is highly recommended, as each storyline offers more and more insight into the overall picture.Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat.Ys Origin includes a neat Arena Bonus Mode and a Boss Rush/Time Attack Mode. In Arena Mode, you choose a character and fight wave after wave of monster in a specific location. As you defeat enemies, you accrue SP. You can then use this SP to unlock a variety of things for this mode, such as extra costumes and even a surprise guest character! In Boss Rush Mode, you can choose to either battle one Boss at a time, or every boss in the game consecutively.The music and sound effects are top-notch. The Ys series is known for their amazing soundtracks, and Origin is no exception.  After awhile I found myself whistling along as the music played! You may be inclined to find and purchase the soundtrack online...just a warning! :POverall this is just an awesome game. I got it on sale for about $7, but in my opinion the original, full price is WELL worth it. You get a lot of game for the price.Highly Recommended "

												When you think of action-RPGs you probably think of Diablo, Torchlight, and all those other games where a player’s worth is measured in the loot that they acquire. Monsters are essentially piñatas that when killed will explode into an array of multi-colored pieces of equipment. After spending so much time on games such as these, my mind dulls to the point where I stop caring about saving the world, or performing some heroic and death-defying feat. All I really want to do is look at numbers rise. I need an intervention. I need to refocus. I need Ys Origin.All you really need to know about the Ys Series is that everyone fights with an un-matched level of veracity. Imagine a thousand buzz-saws being shot out of a thousand cannons, and everything they shred also gets set on fire. When the series was still very young, the early games required the player to kill monsters by running at them and striking either of their sides. In a way the later games such as Ys Origin are an extension of this basic design. In the interest of balance, the improved controls and maneuverability means players have to contend with more intense battles. A plethora of difficulty settings assist the player in finding a level of challenge that suits them. The hardest settings deliver an experience akin to a 2D shooter, where the entire screen is flooded with death. As you’d expect from the title, Ys Origin establishes the roots of the series. Fans will quickly note all of the references to the first entry, which include characters, events, and even boss-battles. In fact, the entirety of the game takes place in Darm Tower, which is essentially where most of Ys 1 also took place. Still, aside from the boss-battles none of this is particularly exciting. This game was originally released in late 2006, and even with the update to Steam, an option to skip cut-scenes was never developed. The dialogue is fairly good, but the story is very traditional and there are certain events that have to be sat through. The time spent outside of combat, tends to be really dull.There are three playable characters in this game and each of them has a different fighting style, a few unique bosses to contend with, and their own path in the story. Yunica Tovah is the token cute-girl-with-a-big-axe. Her companions and adversaries are quick to point out her lack of magic ability, but I can’t tell the difference, when she’s summoning firebirds that lay everything to waste. Hugo Fact on the other hand is all about the spells, though his style of play can best be described by the classic arcade shooter Mercs. Expect to run & gun your way through the tower if you play as this wizard. Big brother Toal Fact is unlocked after beating the game with either of the other two characters. His fighting style resembles Wolverine. Basically you go pork or bacon on enemies and claw your way to success. Each adventure should take around six or seven hours to complete, although this can be slightly effected by the difficulty setting.Darm Tower is a lot like Dracula’s Castle in that the forces of evil can shape it to fit their whims. I’m absolutely certain that when I scoured this tower in the first game I did not have to deal with swimming through flooded corridors, jumping over spike-traps, and dealing with that always-necessary lava level. Each level has a theme and by the second or third you’ll figure out everything you need in order to progress. This adventure is almost entirely linear; however you’re free to backtrack in case you missed anything. Unfortunately even though you get some cool powers like the ability to double-jump there really aren’t any instances where you can go back to prior areas to find items you couldn’t get to earlier. This is the same case for all three playable characters, so once you learn the layout, all you have to focus on is the methods for dealing with the demons. The combat is by far the greatest aspect of the Ys series, and the same can be said for this entry. All fights move quickly and multiple types of foes all attacking at once is a regular occurrence. To keep things fair the demons have a “tell” when they’re about to attack (they blink white for half a second). Also, while all demons are capable of hitting very hard, as long as you’re exploiting weaknesses they go down just quickly. If you’re not doing enough damage, usually a level-up will balance things out, and a second or third might even make you slightly overpowered. Still, don’t expect to grind through bosses as experience points drop to about one per kill, which will force you to move on. The boss-battles in this game are especially great, probably among the best in the series. At first I was worried that every boss was going to be a weak-point mashing affair, but each encounter is varied and just awesome. Some demons like The Creeper are not only relentless but can also induce serious headaches by healing themselves in mid-battle. Unlike a few of the other Ys entries there also aren’t any herbs, potions, or elixirs that can be purchased to bail you out. But hey, all this difficulty adds to that feeling of accomplishment. Replay value in Ys Origin is certainly high. After completing the game with all three characters you’re given access to the time-attack, arena mode, and bonus shop. The time-attack is a boss-rush where you can face off against any or all of the major demons for the possibility of a spot on the leaderboards.  Arena mode has you dealing with waves upon waves of monsters, if you survive you can use the points you earn to buy prizes from the bonus shop. You can always head back to the tower and attempt the harder difficulties as well. There are plenty of achievements and getting them all practically requires that you master the game. Really there’s not a whole lot that can be said about Ys Origin. There’s no hidden meaning to be found and this is not some life-reaffirming experience that I could write thirty pages on. This is simply an excellent action-RPG that despite being more than a few years old it still contends with among the best the genre has to offer. On the other hand if your experience with the genre has never gotten beyond breaking open monsters and collecting all the armors, swords, and belts they were stowing in their nether regions, then steer clear. This game keeps it focused and judges the player entirely on their ability to evade and strike, luck isn’t a factor in the slightest.			"

												A thorough evaluation of how bad you are at video games.The music starts pretty grape and actually gets better the higher you go up.Yunica has pretty cute oven mitts.If you die it's probably your fault because controls and movement are solid.The platforming actually doesn't suck (wow!).Featuring the Wolverine from the Marvel universe.Has a boss rush mode.Bosses will bully you.Higher difficulty actually adds stuff to bosses instead of just health and damage.11/10 would play again (because the game needs multiple playthroughs to unlock everything).I actually have no complaints about this game for real.

												Well here we are a few days into June 2012, and the gaming year couldn't be going better.. E3 is in full swing, with publishers announcing their latest and greatest titles. However quite frankly I'm finding myself distracted from all the excitement. Why, do you ask? It's because I have found my personal Game of The Year, and I don't think anything else that could come out right now could possibly top it. You can take your Diablos, your Modern Warfares, your Max Paynes, and you can file them all away for some other time and place. I'm too busy saving the ancient land of Ys from demonic hordes hellbent on the destruction of humanity!It has been a mere three months since XSEED made their Steam debut with the smash hit Ys: The Oath in Felghana. In that short time their crack squad of programming gurus and translation wizards have been working overtime to bring us more Ys goodness, and this time they've takes us back to the beginning with Ys Origin. This entry in the series is actually a prequel, taking place 700 years before the events of the first Ys games. This of course means that Adol Christin has to sit this round out, however do not despair! This time around we have THREE playable characters to fill out the roster, and each of them brings their own story and unique gameplay style to the table.If you have played a Ys game before (and I'm sure you have) then you should feel right at home with Yunica Tovah, our first playable character. She's a tough but compassionate young girl who has dedicated her life to protecting the goddesses. Do not underestimate her abilities because although she cannot use magic, she can swing around a massive battle axe as if it were a feather duster. Players new to the series should start with Yunica, as she is very easy to handle in combat. Once players feel comfortable they can tackle Hugo Fact, a magic user who plays out like a bullet hell shooter. The third (and secret) character will unlock once you finish the game as either Yunica or Hugo, and suffice it to say he's only for experienced players.Of course it would not be an Ys game if it didn't have big badass boss fights, and Ys Origin delivers in spades! As usual each boss has it's weak point and a pattern that you can exploit, and half the fun is figuring out how! Unlike other games that have impossibly punishing bosses, in Ys Origin if you're dying frequently you can simply level up and try again. Also be sure to check out the upgrade menu at save points, though they may seem minor, the right enhancement can save your life. Also be on the lookout for rare cleria ore, as it can be used to temper your weapons.The music and graphics are of course as stunning as you would expect from a series of such a high caliber as Ys. From the stirring violin strains of the opening theme which give way to choral chants and guitar riffs, you can guess from just that track alone that the soundtrack is something special. And it truly is, with a wildly diverse soundscape of orchestral music inlaid with the finest hair metal that Falcom Sound Team J.D.K. has to offer. Just ad rich are the gorgeously rendered 3d backgrounds and lush sprites that make up the visuals.After you finish the main quest in Ys Origin there's still plenty to do. A host of unlockables including Time Attack, Boss Rush, and Arena modes round out the package, offering hours of gameplay beyond the main story. If you yearn for an epic story with brutal bosses, complex character development, and a truly hardcore soundtrack, look no further than Ys Origin. Newcomers will find an engaging start to a new series, and Ys veterans will find plenty of references to their beloved series, and even answers to some burning questions that they may have. At a solid asking price of $20, Ys Origin is an unbeatable value. Pick it up today!			"

												YS Origins, a lost gem among rpg's?Ys Origins is a prequel to a series named Ys which I had never even heard of, which I was suprised considering my love of rpg's. Ys Origins feels a lot more like a very fast legend of Zelda title mixed with a dungeon crawler, as in you navaigate dungeons while solving puzzles and killing a lot of enemy demons rather than a Final Fantasy type game with it's turn based battle mechanics. The game consists of three characters Yunica, Hugo and Toal, the game must be completed once to unlock Toal.The three characters have very different distinct play styles and abilities which really makes the game feel fresh even though you are revisiting the same areas each time, also each time you will see a different side to an interesting story. The entireity of the game is spent climbing a tower, with your surroundings, traps and enemies varying from floor to floor.  You will solve puzzles while fighting hundreds of demons which will give you experience to level up to get stronger and sp to enhance other abilities. Along with the three characters the game also contains a time trial mode that times your climb of the tower and an arena mode which you fight waves of monsters increasing the replay value, which you can unlock other versions of the three characters and the main character from the other Ys games.Enemies are very varied, but every few floors you will face a gigantic boss, the boss's are very challenging needing different tactics each time and extremely rewarding when you finally finish it off. I really enjoyed playing it as all three characters and will be purchasing the other ys games on steam and reviewing those too. Pros- Nice graphics feeling retro and new at the same time- Interesting storyline and characters- Lots of replay value- Fun gameplay- Very action packed- Amazing boss fightsCons- No world map, entirely in the tower- The inside of the tower barely changes for each character- Some of the steam achievements didnt seem to unlock although im sure I met the criteriaOverall Score9/10			"

												This is one of the best action RPGs available, with one of the best combat systems ever made. The game is also very challenging, but you can put it on an easier difficulty. Normal difficulty will cost you many deaths, especially during the difficult boss battles. The game will last you around 12 hours to play through the storyline portion, but it has high replay value. You can choose from 3 characters (1 is unlockable) and they each have their own storyline. I would say Hugo and the unlockable character have strong storylines, while Yunica has a weak one.			"

Posted: January 2, 2014
												So, an RPG franchise from the 80s-2000s that completely flew under the radar for me until now. Ys Origin, being my very first Ys title makes a VERY great impression on me as not only an RPG obsessed gamer, but a huge fan of the ARPG as a whole. Having only experienced Yunica's story thus far, the game itself is beautiful in nearly every way. The art style is what you would expect from the older Final Fantasy games and is greatly complemented by the stellar soundtrack. In fact, during cutscenes during major plot points, the music actually adds a powerful layer of emotion, which really made the game complete for me. The story keeps you wanting more, and you're always itching to progress some more, to see what happens next. As for the gameplay, it is nothing but awesome. Even though Origin takes place in one location only, each new floor you ascend to varies from the previous floors, so you never end up feeling bored, or feeling like you're on a slow grind to the summit. Enemies are varied, environments are varied, and nothing really seems to be reused. It's hack n' slash style gameplay is also fast, and furious, and there's little to no downtime between enemy encounters, which keeps the flow of the game fresh and constant, which is a must in an ARPG. Boss fights are unlike anything you'll see in today's generation. Boss fights have multiple mechanics to each, and force you to learn the mechanics until you're doing that fight like clockwork. Some boss fights become intense endurance matches, and when you see the boss fall to your feet, the feeling of victory is nothing short of amazing. Overall, if you love RPGs, or you're just looking for an intense hack n' slash game that will keep you busy for quite a while (Between playing through all three storylines, time attack, boss rush, and Arena), give Ys Origin a try. You seriously won't regret one moment of it.			"

												This is certainly an interesting game, it starts a little slow and just throws you in but thats pretty standard for a JRPG or a Hack n slash game. Now the combat has three styles depending on the charecter that you are using, the first uses an axe and physical skills, three skills and each of those skills have charge ups depending on how much power you which to throw at the bad guys. The second charecter is a little slower but they can use magic, its pretty much the same but different ranges/speed/damage etc. The third charecter is a secret you will have to find that yourself because its a spoiler if I tell you. Expect the gameplay to be vastly different for each of these charecters, you can also get various varients of the charecters which changes the way it all plays out.The artstyle is pretty old fashioned, its immersive though so it doesnt really matter. In the various dungeons that you are in you will find various artstyles depending on what theme that area is going for. Its pretty cool and the soundtrack that goes with it helps a lot.Onto music which we touched on before, at the start you would think that its a little cookie cutter but after a while you understand that the music goes with the various themes and the emotions of the game. For this reason they seem to compliment eachother very well and it sort of amplifies the emotions that you feel throughout the game. Storyline of this game isnt the most complex one ever id say, that being said ive only done a singe playthrough and its designed for you to play the three charecters because they each have different viewpoints in the story, they each lead to the same point but you will have to face various challenges to get to your end goal. At some points you will question what your protagonist is thinking or what their motivations are. Its well thoughtout id say but the introduction into the game was a little poor. As i understand this is the first in the series so i imagine it is meant to lay down a good foundation to the rest of the series so think of it as a prologue, a very long prologue. Its about 10-12 hours to finish the story for a single person, i imagine its the same or faster with the others.Difficulty, this is the meat of the game because holy hell is it hard. Just go into the discussions and you will witness the poor souls that have come close to throwing all sorts of hardware out the window, at the wall or at a sibling due to how hard this can get especially the bosses. The normal difficulty of this game is hard, the easy difficulty of this game is challenging, hell even in very easy you will struggle at times. Its not for the faint of heart but that is a good thing because its pretty rare to get a fleshed out game with those sorts of scenarios anymore. It also leads to the 400+ types of monsters that you will occur, some are strong, some are weak, some resist fire, some arent. You will encounter all sorts of rabble but they all want to kill you. In the end this is a game that i can recommend to anyone, if you dont want to break anything then play on very easy and then work your way up, it certainly is addictive and you get one hell of a euphoria after you beat what seemed like an unbeatable boss at first(looking at you mantid)			"

While I did complete the game without finding all the the items, there is something if your at a certain level you need to obtain to drastically reduce the amount of damage you get in the final boss scene before taking them on.

												Another JRPG game. Yes, another great game. As a fan of rpg games. I can say that Ys origin have alot of rich stories from different perspective of the characters. This is an rpg with action that requires more than repeatedly hitting the same buttons. If you have played a YS game before then you probably know what I'm talking about.The buttons are simple, it's easy as 1 2 3. There are 5 modes that you can play. Which are the Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard & Nightmare. A single playthrough on Nightmare takes about 30 hours the first time through, it's pretty hard. So those repeatedly buttons will require more than skills to finish it. There are 3 different characters that you can play, different skills, different stories, and different outfits. lol. From the artworks and cutscenes, it takes creativity in order to create something like this. I can't say I like it, I love it. There's alot of things you can do here, you won't get bored I assure you.After completing the game, you get to experience new menu's from the game which includes the arena mode, boss rush and such. If you're really planning to 100% complete this game, goodluck. What I didn't liked about the game is that, the dialogues are pretty much the same for the characters but your experience will be pretty much the same each time aside from different attack methods and skills of the characters. You'll understand this if you play the game.So all in all, if you don't have this game. You're missing out 1 great rpg game. 8/10.			"

												I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:http://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/07/ys-origin.htmlWhat sets this game apart?The Ys series has been a popular action RPG franchise since 1987, but has only had limited release in the US.  Ys Origin serves as a prequel to the rest of the series chronologically, but is one of the most recent releases in the series.    While the combat sometimes seems more like a hack-and-slash action game than an RPG, there is a sense of strategy and patience required in some areas, especially boss fights, which maintains a more cerebral element in the game.  In addition, there are some good platforming sequences and simple puzzle elements that add enough variety to keep the game from feeling monotonous by breaking up the combat sequences.What is the difficulty factor?This game is extremely simple to pick up and play.  It features the choice of mouse and keyboard controls featuring point and click movement, or you can control your character with just the keyboard when more precision is needed.  Personally, I only use the mouse when I have a slice of pizza in my left hand.  When new powers are unlocked, brief tutorial screens pop-up to explain their use, and most of them feel fairly intuitive anyway.  The game also does a fairly good job of offering direction, feeling fairly linear except for a few brief moments, often due to dialogue from the NPCs.With that being said, this game is not without its challenging points.  The bosses tend to be extremely powerful, at least until you master the patterns of their attacks.  Even then, they require some precision movement and possibly some level grinding to survive.  For those familiar with the bullet-hell genre, you may find yourselves following a familiar strategy of focusing on not getting hit, only taking attacks when you have the rare opportunity.  The rest of the game is fairly tame, although if you let yourself get impatient or careless you will likely end up dying.  Save often.Does it use media effectively?I feel a bit torn regarding the visuals of this game.  The cut scenes use a great mix of 3-D and anime style graphics and are usually gorgeous to look at.  The hand drawn character art used during dialogue is on par with many other games, although the character designs feel a bit stale, like you’ve seen them all used before.  The sprites for the characters have an odd, compressed feel to them, looking more like dwarves than the anime style drawings used outside of gameplay.  The game also uses an odd semi-locked camera at three-quarter view, but the level designs do a good job accounting for this.The music in this game is phenomenal, playing on both the classical and rock aspects of traditional game music to keep every fight intense.  One thing that struck me was the lack of voice acting in the game, which I feel could have done a lot to enhance the overall experience of the game, especially during some of the longer cut scenes that can break the momentum of the game.Best moment in the game?Without a doubt, the star of Ys Origin is the boss fight experience.  Every boss fight seems bigger and more epic than the last, and each one requires better timing and more complex movement to follow its pattern.  Off hand, I really enjoyed the giant centipede boss, Nygtilger, playing as Yunica.  It wasn’t necessarily the hardest boss, but the amount of movement and explosions, coupled with the amount of time you spend climbing on it made it a really fun experience.Who needs to play this game?While it doesn’t have as many exploration or story elements as many other games of this genre, Ys Origin’s saving grace are its gameplay and music.  Each character has a very different feeling to its playthrough, including some alteration of the level design and especially the bosses, greatly increasing the playtime on this game.  With scalable difficulty and already difficult bosses, it can also prove a suitable challenge for players seeking it, or to encourage subsequent playthroughs.  Personally, while I enjoyed the game, I am glad I picked it up while it was on sale.  If it sounds like your cup of tea, I would wait for the next Steam sale to roll around to pick it up.			"

												Fast paced, mash em up anime type game.Nice little story, with a pretty good soundtrack, considering you're going to be hearing the same tracks a lot.Some games have frustrating OST's like Banjo Tooie. Where the only reason to finish the level is to change the music. (Lookin at you Glitter Gulch Mine)But yeah the ost is great.When I bought this, I wanted sort of a steam version of Tales Of Symphonia, which is sort of what it turned out to be. Really just because of the anime stuff plus the mash buttons strat ya gotta employ.It's got a lot of replayability with it and it's tantalizing to see the end of the story.So basically,1. Keeps you interested (Storywise)2. Decent soundtrack3. Doesn't p!ss you off			"

												Ys Origins is one of these great games you've never heard about and that has been lying on steam unknown, its worth unrecognized. Hier of a presitigious part gaming series that exists since the 80ies, Ys origins is a solid title If you don't mind anime art style and story tropes you'll have a solid isometric action RPG, with excellent bossfights and a demanding, nervous very satisfaying gameplay typical of japanesse games that has been embodied recently by darksouls./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Ys Origins est ce genre de jeu qui traine sur steam, un peu perdu et oublié. Héritier d'une grande saga ayant commencé au cours des années 80, Ys origin est un titre généreux a condition de ne pas avoir d'alergie style manga que ce soit d'un point de vue esthétique ou narratif, par-ce que les clichés, vous allez en bouffer, chose qui n'empêche pas le jeu de conserver un certain charme et d'être une petite tuerie au niveau de son gameplay : boss-fights intressants et exigeants, très bon rythme de progression. Voilà du jeu japonais bien fichu et nerveux qui n'est pas sans rapeller Darksouls, même si la comparaison entre les deux s'arrête là.			"

												Ok, to put in perspective how good this game is, I was recommended this game by a friend and within the weekend I ended up beating it with all three characters.  Within a month I had played every Ys game on Steam.  After a while I ended up playing every localized Ys game and eventually I even played the fan translated Ys V.  This series is that good.  This game is like a gateway drug, only instead of being a gateway drug to something worse, it's like upgrading from sex to wild orgies with beautiful women.  This game controls like a dream, looks gorgeous on high settings, and is just challenging enough to feel like a real accomplishment when you progress.  If you love action RPGs, you owe it to yourself to play it.  Just remember, you're getting yourself into a beautiful addiction that you won't be able to stop.			"

												Superior soundtrack, dazzling animated cutscenes, excellent art and level design, solid writing, and a really fun combat system that feels good and intuitive. Definite recommendations, this sold me on the Ys franchise and it should sell you too. If you can hook up a USB controller, the old school RPG experience is flawless.			"

												A truly epic action RPG experience.  Controls are intuitive and easy to learn, and the game uses these to present a brilliant and thoroughly challenging experience, with some of the best boss designs I've seen, sometimes highly difficult yet still fair.  Three different playable characters provide three different storylines with their own bosses and events.  The soundtrack ranks among the best game soundtracks of all time, creating an atmospheric richness that compliments the excellent visual presentation.  Together, they create a dramatic narrative punctuated with highly memorable encounters that leave you very satisfied when you emerge victorious.(Disclosure: I received this game as a gift from a friend, who bought it while it was discounted.)

												Even with its focus on Dungeon Action/Platforming, YsO is by far my favorite adventure game and story amongst Falcom's lineup currently on steam.  The dialogue and localization is fantastically written, realistic, and invests you into characters without spoon-feeding you or succumbing to many of the usual JRPG tropes.  The game is challenging at appropriate difficulties, and like all of Falcom's games, changes the way bosses fight instead of just increasing their damage like a lot of other games boringly do.  The music is also a given if you know anything about Falcom and the in-house JDK band.Potential drawbacks do include having to go through multiple playthroughs in order to get the complete story out of the game, but each character's strengths/weaknesses are different enough to provide a much different gameplay experience in addition to the altered story perspective.  The game is also fairly short to where you could probably finish the game within 10 hours on the lower difficulties without issue if you rush, but the quality makes up for it.By far the most satisfying game I 100%'d on steam.

In all seriousesness though this is one of the funnest games I've played. It's easy to learn, hard to master, and offers a decent challenge. Plus with 3 different characters, each with their own unique play style, this game has a very high replayability level. My only warning is that if you don't take the time to explore you'll miss key items like weapon upgrades that will make the game nearly impossible later on.			"

												+ The music is really good, particularly the boss music. You will be hearing a lot of that.+ It's like a mostly-2D cutesy Dark Souls.+ Controls are mostly very tight, the only weird thing I noticed was sometimes accidentally firing a second skill after using a charged skill. If you get hit, it's probably your fault.+ Bosses are all sufficiently unique that it feels good to die to them over and over again until you learn their patterns and beat them into the ground.- Level scaling and equipment levels' effects are ridiculous. It seems like either the designers or programmers didn't know how much damage a boss should do or take. After spending ten minutes grinding a few levels or finding weapon or armour upgrades, a boss can go from doing 20 damage a hit and taking 50 a hit to doing 8 damage and taking 100. It doesn't take that long to grind, but it's make-work and is frustrating when you just want to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the boss on a balanced playing field. It also feels pretty lame when you enter a new area and are suddenly doing 1 damage a hit to enemies that look almost identical to the ones you have been pulping before.- No auto/turbofire function for Hugo, the projectile-spamming character. I gave up on him after an hour when I decided damaging my hands was not worth it. - Puzzles are mostly formulaic and consist of find x item and bring it to y location. Potentially cool stuff like the Mask of Eyes which lets you see and interact with hidden objects while blinding you to living creatures is used only a few times in the entire game.- Plot is completely ignorable. Villains like power, heroes like the power of friendship. News at ten.			"

												Just like all games in the Ys series, what you're getting with this title is a fast-paced action RPG. The regular enemies are mostly an easy grind, but the boss battles are a different story. If there is another thing the Ys series has a reputation for, it's grueling boss battles that often require multiple attempts and still manage to decimate your HP even if you emerge the victor.The one major downside to Ys Origin is that----unlike previous Ys games that involved exploring an overworld, traveling to different towns, and exploring different dungeons---Ys Origin is just one non-stop slash-fest through a single extremely long dungeon. While the dungeon wallpaper does change somewhat as you make progress, the entire dungeon pretty much feels exactly the same, which can leave you feeling bored of the scenery hours before reaching the final boss.The game also has multiple characters with which to complete the campaign as well as an unlockable arena mode. If you are the kind of person who likes that kind of extra content and you like the action of the game enough that you feel like making one more go through the dungeon all over again with a second character, then you will be pleased to have the option. As for me, I personally got too bored of being trapped inside the one neverending dungeon for 14 hours, so the idea of doing it all over again just to play with a different skill set for fourteen MORE hours does not sufficiently entice me. Since the game is somewhat of a grindfest (especially near the end), I just don't find the replay value to be nearly that high. Still, it is a great bonus for those who want an extra challenge or just haven't eaten their fill of the hacking and slashing yet.I feel like I only have one major gripe with the game, which is that the designer chose to arbitrarily disable your ability to pause the game or access the main menu during boss fights or cut scenes (which--to make matters worse--are unskippable). When I raised this concern to other players, some came to its defense explaining that it is an intentional design decision to keep you from swapping equipment in battles. However, I don't think that is a very good excuse. One very well could have disabled access to the inventory/equipment screen only. But making it impossible to pause the game or open the main menu means that, for example, if you decide that you want to QUIT the game during a boss battle, then your only option is to Alt+F4 or kill it via task manager. Both of those are easy enough to do, sure, and yet I can't help but feel like this is an obtuse and unwieldy measure taken for a small design nitpick. The fact that you can't skip cut scenes or even open the main menu during cut scenes seems even less excusable, since there can be no game design argument for it.Small gripes aside, if you are at all a JRPG fan/enthusiast and want to slash up some monsters in an action RPG, I'd recommend giving it a whirl.As for the other question: is it worth twenty whole dollars? I personally feel like $20 is slightly steep for this one. $15 feels like a good maximum price to me. $10 or below is a bargain. Therefore, using the rating scale below, I rate the game at around a 4.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A pretty good game, but I would recommend buying it discounted.3) Worth checking out, but I would recommend buying it heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs.

												Ys Origin is an original JRPG/Hack & Slash game with really good fighting mechanics, a decend story and Metroidvania style levels.If that's not enough praise, let me say it's one of the best games I've ever played.You first (first because you can unlock more characters) play as Yunica Tovah, a young woman who has sworn to protect the godesses of her world; a girl who is looked down upon by all the other guards because she possesses no magical powers whatsoever. A girl, that proves to be more than valuable and capable without magical powers in rescuing the godesses and the whole world in the course of the story.The gameplay feels really slick, it's not simply a matter of button mashing but you have to react to what enemies do and figure out strategies to effectively kill each one of them. They have certain movesets that are predictable and thus can be learned - something I really appreciate. There is no buIlsh!t going on with the enemies. If you fail, it's your fault - it's quite Dark Souls'esque in this regard. Especially noteworthy are the bosses that are all very unique in their mechanics and that are thoroughly fun to fight. Each and every one of them has move-sets that are to be learned and understood if you want to defeat them. It's not too difficult to figure out what to do because each of their movements can be predicted by the animations they have - to me it seems that's one of the biggest strengths that Japanese/Asian games have over western games (the rules to beat the game are very clear - it's still tough).The level design is great. There may be some backtracking involved but it's really only if you didn't check everything properly in your first run-through. Everything is connected in a consistent and logical manner and there are various styles of areas.The sound design is great as well. The feedback you get for your actions is quickly ingrained into your brain, and helps you understand what's happening even if you can't take in all the visual information at the time - perfect. The soundtrack is pumping and very well done, suits the overall game.The graphics are not top notch but they suit the kind of game Ys Origins is. They are probably even perfect for what the game tries to achieve. They are simplistic but nice to look at, everything fits together and there is nothing that sticks out as ugly or unfitting. Especially noteworthy are the character models that look very nice.My one problem with the game is that if you are underleveled, you will have a really tough time against some of the bosses. An unnecessarily tough time that may force you to go back and grind 2-3 levels. Which doesn't take too much time but is tedious nonetheless and could've been circumvented by making levels count less and making items count more for the overall strength of your character.All in all - who woulda thunk it after reading what I just wrote - Ys is one of my favorite games of all times.I won't give you a stupid random number for this game though - judgements of games are always subjective.If anything, I'd give the same rating Conan O'Brien gave for Tomb Raider:Edit: Sorry, but it doesn't start you at the right time, even though I linked with time. Jump to 7 min, 30s for the rating :)

												Most people, if you ask them to name a 25-year-old game series in which you explore dungeons and fight monsters, will likely say “The Legend of Zelda”. Even though the Ys series is as old as Zelda and has enjoyed immense popularity in Japan since the first game, Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished (1987), the series has never been that popular outside the Orient.A few entries did make it west on PS2 and PSP, either through Konami in 2005 with Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim (the first English release of the series in thirteen years) or XSEED’s masterful handling of translations starting with Ys: The Oath in Felghana. XSEED released Ys: The Oath in Felghana, a remake of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys (1989), on Steam in March. This is the first time most PC gamers get to experience what is (in terms of number of game releases) the largest Eastern RPG series second only to Final Fantasy. Released on Steam in May, Ys Origin is the seventh game in the Ys series and a prequel. It takes place first in terms of chronology, 700 years before the events of “Ancient Ys Vanished” (Ys I & II). As you explore a huge vertical dungeon known as “Darm Tower”, the game elaborates on much of the series’ backstory, including characters, mystical artifacts and locations. There are three playable characters (one is initially locked until you beat the game once with either of the other two), each has their own story and combat style. Yunica, a young knight, uses an axe and sword for close-range melee. Hugo Fact, genius magician and all-round ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, shoots bullets and is the easier of the two to play. We’re not going to spoil the third character for you.Combat is fast and action-packed, with enemies having clear and recognizable patterns to their attacks. As you hack-and-slash your way up the tower, there are some mild puzzles to solve and mild platforming elements to jump through. There’s a kind of momentum system to keep you pushing forward: as you kill enemies without stopping, you gain a bonus to the rate at which you get experience points and “SP”. The “SP” points are spent to permanently buff your character, such as increasing resistance to negative effects like poison or confuse , or to upgrade your armour.The boss fights are where the game (and series) really strut its stuff. While mowing through general enemies is pretty easy, boss fights require focus. You’ll need to learn their attack patterns, figure out which skills to use against them, and if you’re really into that kind of thing there are Time Attack and Boss Rush challenge modes.			"

												If you are a fan of aRPG's, this is a must have. To be honest, to me it doesn't look like much with the RPGMaker style graphics, but don't be fooled. As a fan of hack and slash, and already owning many great jRPG's I would have completely overlooked this one if not for the great price on a STEAM sale and such positive feedback. The story and characters are quite adorable. The tower is well laid out, simple small maps for each level/story, yes it feels like a dungeon crawler,but technically its a tower. In which you start your adventure at the base of the tower searching for 2 princesses. Music is really well done, animations etc, just exceptional, a really cute fun game. Technically as an aRPG fan this game is well worth full price, but if you are like me and have a large back log of great games, it comes on sale for a few dollars now and then. For a few dollars this one is a no brainer, as a casual and value gamer this one is a steal of a deal. Do not miss this one! Probably the cutest aRPG I own. Yes i say aRPG, it really doesn't feel like a jRPG to me honestly. Mostly because when the game starts, the story telling is in French(I am pretty sure) and English dubbed. Some may not like the unskippable cutscenes, especially if you have already had one playthrough, I personally am not really a fan of visual novels either but once the gameplay actually starts up, its not that bad or as long of cut scenes, but I do agree there should be some sort of skip/next button.

Pros:-+Best Ys game.+Best Protagonist +Best Story Line+The game that starts it all+Best Soundtracks and the theme.+Balanced gameplay. +No Ridiculous grinding required (Unless you are playing on hard or nightmare).+No annoying difficulty scaling like in the other Ys games.Cons:--You can't skip dialogues which gets tedious at some point because if you like me want to get every achievement. It IS required for you to beat the game on multiple times and one even requires to beat the game on nightmare with every character. For me beating the game wasn't that hard, but the need to go through all those dialogues and cut-scenes again and again. It just takes so much of your time to even complete one playthrough!			"

												I was given the idea to play Ys Origin by a streamer I watched and a friend I often speak to who had nothing but praises for this franchise. When I first picked up this game I had my doubts and I wasn't entirely sure if I was going to enjoy playing it or not. I was dead wrong. Ys Origin is quite the amazing game, I have finished the game on two different difficulties with two of the characters and doing a nightmare playthrough on the 3rd. Even on Nightmare this game is still fresh and challenging, i've spent my time streaming this game a lot longer than I usually stream, upwards to 8 hours from my usual 5 hours and I don't want to put it down. The story itself can be a bit difficult to follow if you haven't played any of the other games but it's a enjoyable experience itself. The combat in the game is superb and the bosses equally so, there are some minor annoyances but the game outshines them completely. I would recommend getting this game if you're a fan of great combat and RPGs. 10/10.			"

 For god sakes those who say this game is not recommeded I don't know if you are a freaking person. Glad this is overwhelmingly positive reviews the game deserves it.Hope all Y's Games will be on steam and sale or not definitely worth the penny.The excuses for negative reviewsNo pauses in boss battles (just like online games) so don't bother on your keyboard to press it all because it is disabled in this gameSuper overwhelming challenging bosses (another reason for negative reviews just because it is not an easy RPG that you always love doesn't mean its already negative? ergh !? The infamous unskippable cutscenes ! (the most stupid reason for negative reviews) One guy there give this a negative just because its unskippable and did not play the game. Wtf!? Insane humanity is nowaday. BAW GAWD ! help us.Now to move on why this game is highly recommeded Great music nostalga soundtrack - Yup the feels sometimes I stop grinding and going to my inventory to listen some piece of great music.Grinding/Lvl up/Mobs- The least best on this game for me but still an awesome dungeon crawler game.3 Playable characters- Not like other ys games this is the most polish and well made ys gamer ever (for me) ! Godlike badass bosses-The boss from start to finish is insanely hard even in very easy difficulty. You must study the bosses power and trick to beat them takes time and patient to beat all bosses. Special mention the boss fight music is insanely badass. Downloaded ys origin OST ! download it too if you want . :)Story/Art/Graphics- Well written amazing art nostalga graphics. Not just that the story slighty change when you play a different a character. Overall Gameplay Experience- Amazing one of the best JRPGs that I've ever played the best Ys game ever. I love dungeon crawling I love the dungeon challenges and mostly I love the search party crew. If you don't like challenges,trial and error and nostalgic feeling then stay out of this game.11/10 One of the best games I've played.Price is just about right but recommeded buying it on sale or not :) Still hoping all ys game will be on steam. :3Sorry for my english and grammar I'm an asian please spare me :D			"

												Ys Origin is an isometric rpg game that plays like a game you would see in the arcades very action oriented and fluid. in Ys you play as one of three selectable characters and go through their journey in order to help the goddesses fight off evil that dwells within the tower. Each character has their own dialogue and conflicts most notably the secret third character has a lot more bosses than the other two. 	Progression+Statues offer instant traveling back and forth+Enemies are highlighted red to progress+Grinding is minimum (10-15 minutes if you're underleveled)Traveling from floor to floor can take some time, luckily you have goddess statues that teleport you instantly to other statues you have unlocked along your travels in the giant tower. This allows the player to be able to teleport to any floor he thinks requires more exploring weather its to grab a item he missed or simply to teleport back to floor 1 for upgrades. Not only that but you are fully healed when in range of the goddess statue, you can also save.There is practically no grinding in this game if you do not skip mobs, even if you were somehow still underleveled its relatively quick to level to the proper tier for the boss. Grinding is not required in order to defeat bosses, it can be beneficial in order to survive more hits but dealing more damage only works on anything under the highest difficulty. Being on nightmare there is set amount of damage you are going to be able to do against any bosses. This is to keep the game challenging for the purpose of the difficulty mode so that players won’t find a easy way to accomplish the feat.Red highlighted enemies are triggers to progress through the levels. For example killing a red highlighted knight can trigger a jumping platform so you can reach a certain area otherwise unavailable. Level Design+Nice variety of environmentsDespite the entire game taking place in a giant tower there is a surprising variety of environments and design with their own elements that seperate how you proceed through them. There is platforming but it never really gets too complicated to the point where you're constantly backtracking because you cannot perform the required jumps, its especially gets easier once you get helpful power ups like double jump.Mechanics+Multiple obstacles throughout the game solved with unique items-Cinematics can interrupt your movement (Very Rare)Going through the game you will find yourself often unable to past an obstacle that requires you to have a special item in order to proceed to the next floor. For example the item that helps with magic resistance will be useful for resisting the pull of statues trying to drag you down into a trap that sets you back to another floor and further away from your goal. Cinematics interrupt your movement if you happen to be above a trap for example in water when you trigger a cinematic you will fall into the spike trap and take damage when you're able to move againGame Modes+Nice leaderboards (keeps track of alot of variables/characters)Upon beating the game you will unlock more content for example the first time I beat it with Mittens, I unlocked time attack which features a circuit of going through all the bosses you fought throughout the game with set equipment and having to race the leaderboards in order to pass your friends. ConclusionYS origin feels like one of those old very challenging arcade games with rpg elements and some platforming. The features a nice variety of boss types, even more bosses can be discovered by playing the other characters which gives the game more replayability. The game lasts around 12 hours per playthrough and with 3 characters thats a good chunk of time not to mention you have extras to go through.			"

												I'd say this is the best Ys 6 engine game we have on Steam, as far as gameplay mechanic goes. It has (I think) the most bosses, it also has the best bosses, its dungeon is really well-designed for the most part, and the action got even further refinement from Oath in Felghana. There are two problems however. Having three character is nice, but having to play three times is not nice, especially when considering the dungeon design stay more or less the same. And when that third and hidden character's story is the ""truth,"" it means you have to play it at least twice to get the actual story.So it actually comes down to how much into Ys you are. I do not recommend this to people who are going into Ys for the first time; it's not a good reflection of how Ys series actually work, because it's a game entirely based on dungeon-crawling. Not only that, the storytelling is more similar to Trails series than Ys series (same scenario writer), so you have to be fine with crap-ton of dialogues.If you like Ys 6 and Felghana, you can just play it once as Yunica to feel satisfied with its mechanics, because it's one hell of a tight ARPG, but really, the game wants you to have played Ys 1 and Ys 2 before playing this. The level design, story, characters, background music, they are all designed around the fact this is a prequel to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and the game doesn't shy away from making that connection.But to be honest, if you've played Ys 1 and Ys 2 and have fond memories of it, Ys Origin has such a good story that gets to you in so many ways. There are so many subtle connections to Ys 1 and Ys 2, and a lot of them add a lot of emotions to those games retrospectively. You get to understand its lore better, a few of its characters better, and you get to understand why and how things came to be when Adol first got washed ashore on Esterian beach in Ys 1. It's dependant on whether you have played those games or not, so it's not recommended to everyone, but if you have, this is a must.			"

												I followed this game from the psp releases.If you want an action/rpg game cause you miss the old days, this is one of the highly recommended.Possitives:Nice game play and terrain, as they used to be on Ys series.The character skill progress develops pretty cool as you find gems that match the skill's origin gem.Different flavored characters, which are making the game experience totally different from one to another.Negatives:Graphics could be a little better, but it's not really a thing.If you are looking for a game which is HARD to finish, along with much grinding to find 100% of secrets, this is the one for you. Especially for the hardness part, on highest difficulty you will really get annoyed from pressing the f'ing ""Retry"".Have fun all.			"

												Ys is a great series in general and you won't be disappointed with this game. It's the 8th game from the series. It's only available on Pc and it's a prequel of Ys I & II. (So it's better to play Ys I & II to understand a bit more.)So first of all, I just want to add that I have around 120 hours on this game and I didn't finish entirely. (I'm finishing the third character at Nightmare Mode and I'm focusing to get every achievements. Not an easy thing to do.) Pros:-The story is great. (You will get the point of view on each character.)-4 difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard and Nightmare)-Music is so great.-Fast paced game. -Button mashing game.-Anime game-Time attack/Survival modeCons:-Nightmare mode can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ You really need to focus on farming a lot of level and to know every pattern of each bosses. You will restart a lot of them and yes, you will want to throw you controller at your screen a lot of times.-Only two characters (a third one can be unlocked. But if you only play only one time with Yunica or Hugo, you won't be able to unlocked it.)-The ""real"" story is with the third character. So people who don't love to play the same game over and over won't be able to taste it. (You need to complete the game with Yunica and Hugo, that's it.)-Maybe overpriced if you only play one time and at easy mode. (Approximately 4-5 hours if you know what to do.)Note 9/10 because this game has made me a fan of Ys.Edit : If you want more information about the order that you need to play the game, check this link :

												Ys Origin is a great example of an Ys title: lots of fun hack-and-slash combat with awesome environments, great boss fights and a killer soundtrack to boot. It's also unique compared to other games in the series due to the fact that you never play as Adol, but rather as two (actually three) other characters, each with their own style of combat. There's Yunica, whose style is the most similar to Adol's, with mid-range combat skills. Then there's Hugo, who's more of a long-distance fighter. And finally, the third character, whose storyline is considered the ""canon"" one but is also the hardest due to his short-range fighting style. Although there are differences between the three, you're still exploring the same dungeon, so it may get repetitive playing as each one. However, doing so helps flesh out the world of Ys further and brings some fun tie-ins to Ys I and II.The difficulty of the game is well balanced. Normal feels just tough enough but not too much so, making it an enjoyable and rewarding experience. There's also plenty to do for completionists, from beating the game on the highest difficulty (Nightmare) to doing Boss Rushes to Arenas. It'll keep you coming back until you've unlocked all the things and gotten all the Steam achievements. Again, it's hard but not so hard that it seems impossible. Overall, I'd recommend this game to people looking for a fun adventure title and are maybe looking to get into the Ys series as a whole. I'd also suggest looking into Ys: The Oath in Felghana, which is equally fun but with more exploration and a shorter game time (which some may prefer).			"

												Just about everything important is well made in this game. The gameplay is satisfying with its RPG elements, action based combat and simple platforming, the soundtrack is absolutely great and fitting for the gameplay, the main characters are surprisingly interesting and the bosses offer plenty of challenge, really requiring you to learn their patterns and time your attacks correctly especially on higher difficulties. Even the story has its moments despite never being invasive, and the graphics are pleasant enough in all their simplicity. My only slight gripe with the game comes from its few heavily compressed animated cutscenes which could've looked smoother.The game will initially take you about 8-12 hours to finish, but it has three different characters with different storylines and slightly different events, and I strongly suggest that you take the time to finish the game with every character if you want to get the most out of it and its story. As such, the replay value is strong especially if you're going for achievements which the game is almost designed for with its multiple difficulties, unlockables and the boss rush mode where you fight all the bosses of the game in a marathon setting. If going for full completion though, the replay value eventually depletes and the process turns into more of a grind towards the end of it.The combat consists of slashing and blasting through numbers of enemies with a combination of regular and special attacks while jumping around platforms and structures, avoiding enemy hits and collecting the currency and temporary power ups that they drop, all while the speedy and melodic soundtrack is playing at the background. Most of the depth and challenge comes from the tried and true mechanic of dodging and timing, which is very apparent in the several boss fights the game will throw at you. On harder difficulties you'll have to retry several times to get the patterns down properly, and while you can overlevel yourself by one or two levels with some extra grind to make many bosses noticeably more doable, in boss rush you have no such luxury. On the other hand if you just want to sit back and chill, the game has easier difficulties as well.Overall, YS Origin is a simple but solid ARPG that I can recommend to anyone.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago and let it sit in my Library for ages (like I'm sure we all do once Winter and Summer sales roll around. I like to think of doing so as letting the game ""age like a fine wine"" or something like that). Well, I finally blew the dust off the cover (metaphorically) and grabbed my gamepad to begin playing. I was met with a well-done anime-esque intro matched with beautiful music (including a sick electric guitar and violin, two of my favorites). If you are on the fence about buying this, make the jump. It feels so classic and nostalgic to so many of the older action-rpg titles yet handles well and looks beautiful (the graphics, in my opinion, aged rather well).  Buy it, you are sure to enjoy it if you are a fan of arpg's! "

												Ys Origin is an outstanding game. As an action/adventure, it lets you crawl run through dungeons with awesome music and big, bad bosses. The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, so much that you may want to grind even if you don't have to. Bosses range from challenging to hard, though you can choose them to be pushovers or soulcrushingly difficult depending on the difficulty level.The clear main focuses of the game are combat and boss battles, both of which are amazingly well done. In higher difficulties, bosses don't just get more health and damage; their abilities work differently and have shorter recovery times.Compared to Oath in Felghana, Origin has three playable characters in story mode, bonus modes such as arena, and is overall more polished, though it's a little more linear and less RPG-y.Hacking and slashing monsters has never been so much fun before.

												This is the first game of the Ys franchise that I've played and, frankly, I didn't expect very much from it. The idea of some janky JRPG with 3rd person action combat has always sounded weird and, from what little I've experienced, didn't work out too well. I come from the Final Fantasy line of games and use that as the barometer for whether or not a JRPG will be good, and look for those elements, and was less than optimistic going into Ys Origin, and on through the opening credits, but once the gameplay started, I was hooked. The controls are tight, everything is useful throughout the game, and it takes skill more than anything to make progress. A certain amount of grinding is necessary for your average gamer (read: everybody that isn't doing a speed playthrough and min/maxing like crazy), and knowledge of enemy attack patterns is crucial, but knowing character limitations and being able to execute around enemy patterns trumps everything. On top of that, the game is damn hard; I played through on normal and got lambasted. I can't remember a boss that I beat on the first try, and there were two difficulties above that, meaning that whenever I give nightmare a shot is going to live up to its name.As for the story, it's not on par with what I associate with an RPG, but it also doesn't feel like it's trying to tell a large, dynamic story, but instead just introduce a handful of characters and set the background for the other Ys games (it is Origin so I'll have to confirm any of this by playing the other games). From Yunica's perspective, it's a classic coming of age ""I can't do anything and basically become a God by the end"" kind of story.The in game art style reminds me of Final Fantasy Tactics with more stuff going on, while the character portraits and cut scenes are appealing without being obtrusive. The music is also on point, keeping with Japanese gaming tradition.Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this game. It was a small investment during a steam sale, and now I want to go back and try out the rest of the Ys franchise. I recommend Ys Origin with a 8.5/10; it doesn't try to do too much in terms of story or gameplay, and opened up a whole new franchise to me.			"

												First things first - I had no idea what this game was about when I bought it. It was cheap in a Steam Sale, and I thought 'Hey why not - lol backlog'. However, times are a changing, and it's no longer about buffing that backlog game count, but actually PLAYING GAMES. Yes, playing games. On steam.So, having finally gotten around to playing this game (thanks to Steam Roulette), I have to say I'm genuinly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's a simple RPG/Adventure game, with some very basic yet effective hack'n'slash mechanics. While it would be wrong to say it's similar to Devil May Cry in the way that the combat is simple, but at the same time a little frantic, it does help paint a similar picture. The most rewarding part of the entire experience are the Boss Battles. They're old school - patterns & phase based, rather than just being normal mobs with a crazy amount of HP, dealing insane damage. Nope, no spank'n'tank here - these bosses have patterns of attacks, and phase of attacks based on their HP. Classic. They're frustrating to the point of fanfare when you finally take them down, which is great. Games tend to skip over the challenge and frustration these days, which means gamers miss out on learning, resilience and fist pumping when they finally topple the♥♥♥♥♥♥that's blocked their way for the last hour. This game doesn't deny you that pleasure. I feel like I'm not really doing the game justice - if you're still unsure there are 10/11 youtube videos linked to my Steam Account of my playthrough, so you could always check those out too. Ultimately, give it a go and you might surprise yourself.			"

												(Yes, all those hours are legit. I have played this game that much.)This is a darn good Action RPG. It's a fast paced, simple game that just hits the sweet spot between ""too long"" and ""too short"". The game is simple enough that you basically know what to do from beginning to end, but has enough variety to make it not feel mindless. It's damn fun smacking the crap out of enemies.Despite taking place in one location, a single 25 floor tower, the game has enough variety in its areas to keep it constantly fresh and entertaining, with new mechanics to work with and environments to traverse. It has a nice difficulty curve, with bosses that continually test your wit. If you're looking for a nice challenge, pick this game up and play it on hard. And its soundtrack is damn good. Seriously, go to Youtube right now and type ""Ys Origin - Genesis Beyond The Beginning"", and tell me it doesn't make you want to play this game. I got this for 10$ and would gladly have paid full price. It's got more than enough content and has three different protagonists with their own stories and mechanics, and it's consistently fun and challenging, while offering something for just about every type of gamer.

												This little gem of an ARPG [ARPG in the vein of Bastion, Alundra, or Zelda rather than Diablo] doesn't do a whole lot but what it does, it does extremely well.The story & setting are similar to the likes of Dredd and/or The Raid: Redemption in that this game takes place in a single tower. You start on the first floor as one of three characters (only two initially unlocked) and fight your way up, to deal with the baddie at the top. Along the way you can appreciate some awesome...[1] Boss fights. The Ys series is known for its boss fights and these are no exception. They're tough, without ever feeling cheap.[2] Pacing. The game typically involves 2 or 3 floors of regular enemies (who can be quite challenging!) between each boss fight. You'll usually need to explore these thoroughly in order to find the key to the boss and any equipment upgrades. Yet these intermediate sections don't overstay their welcome. And it's entirely possible to run through them if needed.[3] Polish. The camera works. The controls work. The game provides proper feedback. Everything feels smooth and responsive, which makes the game a joy to play purely at the tactile level.[4] The music. Ys music is awesome.On these strengths, I give the game a thumbs up. If you like old-school ARPGs, this one is sharp and sleek. It'll provide about 10-15 hours of gameplay for the first playthrough. If you really like it, it's then got two other characters as well as boss attack / timed modes (though, big surprise!, the leaderboard is dominated by cheaters).Do keep in mind, however, that this game doesn't offer as varied an experience as other RPGs. Gear progression is strictly linear. Though each boss and its levels have different environmental themes (sand, lava, etc), there's ultimately not much variety in setting. You certainly aren't doing any globe-trotting. The story is serviceable, rather than inspired. So know what you're getting into.DIFFICULTY RECOMMENDATION: Ys games can be tough, but provide a variety of difficulties to compensate. This one has very easy, easy, medium, hard, and nightmare. I, personally, wouldn't recommend ANYONE play below medium. If you don't want a challenge, then play a different game. As a veteran gamer, I chose to start on hard. A good choice. Challenging, but never insurmountable. I had to look up only one boss fight - mostly because I misunderstood a mechanic. When I did the boss attack mode on medium after, I beat most fights on my first try. I wouldn't recommend Nightmare for your first playthrough. It'll be tough to learn the fights while simultaneously worrying about timing, aim, and movement.			"

												Y's Origin is , in my opinion, the best Y's game. Its telling the story of what happened before the main character Adol Christing took over. The story has MANY moments that will make you laugh, feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥or make you cry.There are a total of 3 characters and all of them have their version of the story. Though the cannon one is the final story you unlock for beating the game as Hugo. The Characters:-Yunica: She is here for people who like Adol's abilities. She can do pretty much everything he can. The difference is she actually talks. Out of all the characters she has the weakest story in my opinion but it does have its moments. Also she is pretty fun to play as so thats all you need.-Hugo Fact: Oh boy here is the character that will make you wish you have played megaman games. Because you will be pressing that attack button a lot. In all seriousness though Hugo is pretty fun to play as. His weapons a bit more defensive and require you to play strategicly. His story is pretty good and has some amazing moments. Better than Yunica in terms of story in my opinion.-Toal Fact: And here is my man. The secret character who is also the main character. You unlock him for beating the game as Hugo. First off in terms of story Toal is easily the best one. Because while the other characters have good stories with great moments, Toal is ONE BIG moment himself. I also love the fact how they made you unlock him , this is good because they first in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥e everything to you with other characters and then give you the final story. In terms of gameplay he pretty technical compared to the other characters. In fact if you know what you are doing you wont have to grind as him once and you will still make mince meat out of the bosses. The music: Comon its falcom we are talking about here of course the music is godly. Just listen to the trailer song and you will know what I am talking about. Its not my fav sountrack (that honor goes to the trails in the sky games also made by falcom) but its definitly my fav Y's sountrack. The graphics: In terms of models well this is an old game but you know what I think it looks nice on the eye. It has aged nicely in my opinion. Going through the tower: Well the trailer already spoiled it so yeah the entire game takes place in a tower. Don't worry it has areas inside it. Like lava, water, desert, demonic etc... You also have these statues that serve as save spots, shops , and teleportation spots. You can pretty much teleport to any statue in the game once you activate them. So backtracking is NEVER a problem.Overall its a fantastic game.			"

												This is the first YS game that i've ever played, and, i gotta say that this game is, incredibly impressive. Ys Origin is a 3D Action RPG game, a fast paced one at that, developed by Nihon Falcom.In Ys Origin, you could play as either Yunica, a girl that wield a heavy battleaxe, or Hugo, the prodigy of magic. (There's a 3rd playable character, which is unlockable after you complete the game with either Hugo or Yunica)So, now to the review as always !Pros (+)- Story, it's pretty decent i would say ! Each characters have their own stories (and playstyle), which is awesome. There's a lot of reason to do another run in this game. I personally love Hugo's storyline.- Playtime, There's 3 playable characters, it takes about 10 hours more or less to complete the game, also, there's some extra after finishing the game, so, no need to worry.- Soundtrack, it depends on each own preferences, but i gotta say, you'll most likely, loves the soundtrack. It really fits the game and adds a lot to the immersiveness.- Controls, the controls feels really responsive.- Challenging, the difficulty feels right. The boss fight is totally fair, there's no unfair attack that leads to sudden death all out of nowhere. It's required to learn the behaviour or pattern of the enemies here. There's also difficulty option.- Progression ! Level, Move based artifacts, blessings, you will find a new playstyle along the stories.- Artstyle, again, it depends on preferences, but personally, i find it to be unique and ended up loving it a lot.Cons (-)- This game could be, a bit... grindy. If you're not good at this kind of games. At least, that happens to me, ahaha.- The enviroment feels a bit monotonous, well, we're inside a tower so.... yeah.Conclusion :So to sum it up, this game has, a good story, awesome soundtrack, great amount of playtime, good enemies & boss design, and the progression also feels nice. Pretty much, it has, everything you need to make a good RPG games !So if you love a fast-paced, 3D action games, i totally recommend it for you.			"

												The Ys series is old, having started back in 1987. One of the first action-oriented JRPGs, and one of the few series that still sticks around today. There's a reason for that, it's a series that has evolved over time without losing it's roots. It's still all about running around, killing monsters, growing stronger, finding key items and fighting challenging bosses.In that, it's pretty much a cousin to the Legend of Zelda. It does have it's own style of combat, and it's own setting (generic by today's standards, but when the series was new it was one that helped build the stereotypes) and each entry tends to have it's own twists and tricks. This is one of the later entries to the series, and uses 3d environments with good-looking 2d spritework for the characters. It mostly sticks to overhead view, but there's sections that twist the viewpoint along the way.story-wise it's the prequel to the story. As such, the mainstay hero swordsman Adol is nowhere in sight yet, and instead you have 2 playable characters with their unique playstyle (with a 3rd one to unlock).Each character has a different playstyle, and gets different special skills to use.Pros:- Game provides a good challenge on Normal difficulty, ramping up quickly but smoothly. Easier & harder difficulties are also available.- Bosses are memorable, with fairly tricky attack patterns at times (and mostly references to the bosses from earlier games in the series)- The playable characters do handle completely different, adding replayability- Crisp high-res artwork, holding up well today even though the original Japanese version of the game dates back to 2006- Pretty cool soundtrack- One of the playable characters is a non-sexualized, non-stereotypical female protagonist. That seems to be a big deal in this day and age so I'll list it as a pro.- Plenty of customization options. (if using a gamepad, you will want to remap the pause/menu button though - for some sillt reason it's not mapped to start button by default)- Solid controls- Update: Unlockable bonus modes, with leaderboards and all, which start unlocking once you complete the gameCons:- While good-looking, there isn't that much variety in the different environments you'll run through- There's a couple of weird things, like a key equipable item not being in the equipment screen, but tucked away in between the usable items instead.- No auto-saving. This being an old-school game it uses a savepoint mechanism, which works well. What's weird is that savepoints do work as checkpoints when you die, but don't auto-save to an actual save game.- Non-skippable cutscenes. Which is annoying if you want to start a new game but can't skip the minutes-long opening movie to get into the action. Update: At least the long animated scenes become skippable after you complete the game once. So it's mostly annoying if (like me) you want to try both initial characters without beating the game first.			"

												My first Ys game, since I came to know the series late... I figured I would play the games in chronological order.I'd heard lots about the Ys music and even heard some from watching twitch streams/youtube videos of the other games. But I never expected to feel the way I did watching the opening cinema, fighting the bosses and overall beating the game. Much of the excitment and enjoyability of the Ys games is their music, and this title certainly delivered and surpased my expectations. Another staple of the frnachise is its incredibly difficulty, especially on the boss fights. I decided that for my first playthrough I would choose the ""normal"" difficulty, and my overall consesnsus was that it felt like what any other game would try to pass as a hard mode. However, grinding and searching for all secret items will help TREMENDOUSLY. Overall this was an amazing experience... I love the lore of the Ys franchise so far and can't wait to dive into the first game. I would highly reccomend this to anyone regardless of if you've played another Ys game or not.			"

												Easily one of my favorite games on Steam.  I noticed some other reviewers saying that you shouldn't play this game if you haven't played other Ys games.  I don't agree: previous to this I think maybe I had played Wanderers from Ys (SNES) briefly and I had probably played 5-10 hours into Ys VI (PS2).  I think I got this on a Daily Deal, but it's worth paying full price.  The dungeons are beautiful, the music is spectacular, the action is superb.  I prefer this to Oath in Felghana or Ark of Napishtim - both great games, but I thought this had more charm.  Granted there aren't any towns, which is a departure, but I think pure dungeon crawling works well for this series.			"

												The game is simply amazing, if you are a fan of old school Zelda this is for you!Game can be a grind at times to beat certain bosses, but not required as the boss mechanics can be very fun to learn and easy to dodge. I played through the story on the first time as Yunica and felt very connected to the character and was happy to see the progression she had made throughout the story from an apprentice knight to a full pledged knight.Don't let the long intro at the start of the game bring you down because it is unskippable because once that is all over the hack n' slash begins!

												Some games I buy for the story.Some games I buy for the gameplay,Other games I guy for the music.In the case Ys Origin I bought it for the gameplay and musicHowever, that is not to say that the story of this game is it weakness.It have several  stories to tell, although very similar are different enough to deserve a play through of every one of them.The music, as I said before, is an great reason to buy it since it is so well tuned to the gameand gives you an certain nostalgia.The weakness of the game however is what all rpg can suffer from, the difficulty can be a matter of levels, not skill. This can result to you having to do some exp grindingHowever, thankfully Ys Origin gives you something for that trouble in the way of unlocking lore as you kill monsters.That said, the actual fights can be fun and gives you the ability to chose how you want to play the characterAnd finally you may as yourselves “Which game should I play first? Ys 1 or Ys Origin?”Since both the first game an Origin has spoiler for each others it can be a hard choice.However, I recommend playing Origin first since I enjoyed interacting with a certain character in Ys 1 more than I would otherwise had if I hadn't played Origin first.And  if you are only able to pick one of Ys games for now, make it Origin as it will probably give you a better lasting experience than the other games.

												Do you like ARPG, awesome story and don't mind anime style? Well, then this is what you have been searching for your whole life.General Overview:As you start the game, you can select between playing Hugo and Yunica. Hugo is like an SMG, you can spam your basic attacks like crazy, but is slower than a slowpoke. And Yunica has oven mittens... oh, and an axe, and is quite mobile. After that you can choose your difficulty, whereas nightmare really is a nightmare, and easy for Hugo players (yes, I hate him and I can't play him).In this game, nightmare actually adds stuffs like attacks to the enemies, not just way more health and damage. Don't worry if you get stuck on a boss for 3+ hours in this mode.Upgrading your character is also possible. You get small crystals which are your ingame-coins. In Nightmare every crystal is 1 point worth. In every other difficulty, I think, the bigger crystals give way more points.The story:The goddesses are nowwhere to be found on Ys. It's your job to go to the surface and find them. Of course, they are in the giant Darm Tower, the lair of the evil guys. Depending on which character you play, the story changes a bit. You get a few different bosses and other cutscenes. Due to this, you want to play it again, just to see how everything plays out for each character.Overall, to leave it mostly spoilerfree: Each story had it's emotional part and was well thought-out.Gameplay:Hugo: Will make your hands hurt (You should map a key to autopress the shoot button 30x a second)Yunica: Solid Movement, good attack speed, fun to play and mittens.There are a lot of enemies. Some are just powered up versions of older enemies, others are completely new. Especially on Nightmare difficulty you have to be very carefully to choose how to deal with the enemy. Some are almost completely immun to your skills. Learing the patterns of your foes helps a great deal.Setting:You play in a huge tower. However, this doesn't mean the interior is all the same. Every time after one of the bigger bosses, the tower changes completely. One time you play with lava, the other time you play with sand and also mirrors!Unlockables:Yes, this game has unlockables. Once you complete the game with any character, you unlock something awesome and the boss rush mode. After you finish the game with every character, you get the arena mode and a shop. In the first you defeat enemies for points, which then can be exchanged for stuff in the latter one. The shop allows you to buy many things, like powered up spells, Hugo still sucks though.Soundtrack:Just listen to the trailer music. It's so awesome! The rest is also pretty good.Long story short:Buy it, so we get even more Ys on steam!			"

												There's a lot to like about this game. The real-time, fast-action combat stands out from a lot of other Japanese titles that you might be tempted to compare it to. The enemy variety and challenging bosses can get frustrating, but are nonetheless thrilling to overcome. A couple bonus modes add variety to those of you looking for time-based challenges. Two starting characters and one unlockable one give some plot variety, including an alternative ending if you complete it as the secret character.Also? The soundtrack... it rules.			"

I do recommend playing the stories in this order: Yunica, Hugo, and the third character you unlock after beating the game on one the the above mentioned. The story is very well put together. Having not played an Ys game before I thought I might be lost but I was not. And the music, omg the music, I went and bought the soundtrack because I can't live without the music! The game also has many different modes that are unlocked once you beat the game, and continue beating it. It never ends... Thank goodness! :D			"

												Whether you played the other series or not, this game is not to be missed for any JRPG fans.Yes, this game does not have an insane number of customisable skills, stats and equipments, or any potions you can keep for that matter, like Final Fantasy or the like. But you'll be too busy mashing the attack button to realise.This game is also fun and compelling enough to play through all the characters for their individual stories and skillsets, even if you're not an achievement hunter. Note: Be prepared if you're an achievement hunter though, this game is totally unfair on the hardest difficulty setting.Final words of advice if you get this game. Take breaks when playing this game, as in go do something else for the rest of the day. You just might not get carpal tunnel like I did. I had that much fun =D.			"

												The boss fights are generally better and it has the most fun to play as playable character in the series. But it is not as good as Oath. I think its because it feels more padded out. In order to unlock the true final boss you need to run through the same sets of levels in the same order twice as different characters, to unlock the bonus arena mode you have to run through the same game three times as different characters.The game is also a lot more wordy than Oath, with all three of the playable characters being unbearably whiny and having daddy issues. Music also took a step down from Oath, most of the non-boss music feels really limp and underwhelming.Though the boss fights are probably some of the best in the series, and a game that is worse than Oath is still a game worth buying. Just if you're going to buy only one of these, get Oath instead.			"

												Fast paced, hack'n'slash, simple but fun RPG, that's how i describe this game!Around 10 hours of gameplay, but if you're like me, and enjoy exploring every inch of every level, then that'll be a little bit longer!! HehehYou get to control 1 of 3 characters (one of those you unlock when you finish the game), every one of 'em has a different story, but the main storyline is the same. Gameplay'wise, they have a basic attack and 3 different skills for their weapons and the game is really fast paced!! Boss fights are really cool! :)The game is a lil' bit hard at the beginning, but once you get used to it, things get a lot easier!Even tho' i say it's easy, it's not hard to find yourself some tougher enemies and get killed... So here's my tip: ALWAYS save your progression... Seriously!!It gets kinda annoying when you have been playing like 30+ minutes without saving the game and then, all of a sudden, a big pack of tougher and faster enemies apears and you die, losing those 30+ minutes of UNsaved gameplay! And the worst is, you'll have to do it all over again!!! So yeah... SAVE!This game is pretty cool, nice soundtrack, simple but good story, fast paced action and so on... The only problem with the game is that, most of your alies are kinda dull and easily forgettable! Only enemies and a few alies are pretty cool... But the other ones, you just finish the game and don't even remember their names!!Other than that, iz all gud! I recommend it! ;)			"

There are a few pros/cons that I want to discuss, though.Pros:-Good graphics and a beautiful, original soundtrack.-Different characters and unlocks for the game.-Multiple endings depending on the character you play.-Amazing storyline!Cons:-NOT Gamepad compatable instructions ingame, all instructions are based for computers.-The same ending regardless. Come on, you have to have one ending that ends well for everyone, right?-Heavy grind game, if you play on the harder difficulties with Yunica or Hugo, expect more grinding than with The Claw.Very good buy, especially if you're a fan for awesome stories and fun (Yet punishing) games.

												Great game.  3 story characters to play as. (You need to unlock one). While they all tranverse the same levels they have a few differences in bosses but mostly story wise. They also each play differently. One weilds an axe, one is a mage, and the unlockable is a berserker.Spoiler: Toal, the unlockable chraracter, is the character with the canon storyline and true final boss. 	That said I felt the game had a great story and very worth its price, and with each character getting their own storyline it gives you a reason to play them all. Difficultly ranges from Very Easy to Nightmare. Upgradable skills/traits. You have to find your gear upgrades there is no shop to buy them from. Fear not since the gear upgrades are either in chest or given to you. No RNG luck based element to make you spend your days grinding instead of playing.Bosses have gimmicks but they also for the most part seem to follow a pattern. Though the gimmicks each boss have can be enough to prevent you from winning on your first encounter with them, and 2nd, maybe 3rd. This isn't a bad thing. It requires you to actually learn how the boss works if you want to beat them instead of just brute forcing it.That said I would just like to point out a couple of cons.1. Keyboard controls for the most part are fluent but on a certain boss they are a bit chunky.2. The same above applies to trying to fight flying enemies. I would suggest a gamepad if you have one.That said I am a keyboard player and still find it around 95% fluent. Perfectly acceptable.			"

												I picked this game up on sale after wanting a really good JRPG, or rather an action platformer. With a good combat system and a strong, responsive, gameplay methodology the game is a winner. You can complete the game inside of 10-20 hours depending on difficulty setting and past that there is a tonne of replay-ability through either doing it on harder modes or in playing the game again from another character's point of view (there are 2 characters to choose from at the start, a third being added at the end). It's well worth whatever price you pick it up for, though if you're not sure you'll like it (it grows on you), I would recommend at least snagging it on a sale. Basically, it's Zelda on the PC in 1080p, or rather a Zelda-esque game.Story: 8/10I played through the game on hard as 'Yunica Tovah', aka, Axe Girl. Being more of a agility-speed player it was my natural choice as I've never been that into mage characters, which is the other character model available as you start the game fresh. As a character Yunica is more or less your bumbling anime girl that has inner strength that expresses itself as impatience and immaturity, which naturally changes over time. I found her interesting - a little predictable at times, but as the plot progresses she does develop more facets and towards the end her angry side really is a welcome extension of her persona. As for the overall story and setting, I found them engaging and enjoyable. It's definitely a fantasy game firmly within in the anime genre, and if you like that then you'll love the game. Me, personally, I can take it or leave it, so for me the it would be the gameplay that would swing me on this.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is fantastic. Fluid, sharp, and precise. Everything I like and enjoy. As a new player to this type of game it only took a quick control re-mapping to something more western - WASD as apposed to ZXCV - and then I picked it up pretty quickly. The gameplay is great because you have a really well thought out of mix of trash mobs, mid-level, high-level, then boss-level type enemies. And towards the end-game they start mixing in conditions and aoe gravity pulls to really start tripping you up if you haven't mastered how to pick off certain enemies. And that's what the gameplay really is at heart: you get thrust into a new situation and you have to adapt to these new conditions pretty quickly through piecing together enemy attacks, patterns, strengths, and weaknesses. This is especially true of the boss fights, which were always thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, and at times, a little frustrating. All of which are designations of a good game.Difficulty is king here. If you have it on easy, you'll somewhat breeze through the game. Greater difficulties are just that in this game - it's not the western version of difficulty where 'Veteran' is what 'Easy' used to be in the late 90s, Nightmare literally means Hell.  I didn't give the gameplay 10/10 because of one reason: if you miss a chance to power up your weapon and you progress to the next stage, you'll suddenly hit a spike in difficulty. The same can be said if you don't more or less flatten the majority of enemies on contact (at first). So this can be a little infuriating as you suddenly can hit grind mode, unless you go back and find that missing upgrade. But, the good news is there's a transport system so it's not difficult at all. And, worse comes to worse, you can always use GameFAQs to trace your steps to that upgrade. Game design: 8/10This game is obviously Japanese in regards to design which naturally means that some inherent Western expectations aren't fulfilled. This takes the form of, or rather, a lack of:A nice looking menuThe ability to map controls inside the game (instead of inside the launcher only)The ability to skip cutscenes - even if you've already seen themThese are gripes that you get used to and they're only mildly annoying. If you're a JRPG fan, well, you're used to this kind of thing anyway. Level design throughout is interesting and never repetitive; effectively think of the game as like a Mario or Zelda game: you're always in one 'general area' but as you go progress through the levels/stages the scenary changes etc, such as Ice to Fire to Sand and so on. It's classical and is nice to go through again if I'm honest. These different stages bring with them different unique challenges that do require a bit of trial and error occasionally, which I feel is a good thing. Not enough games punish you for messing up, this one does punish you; but never in an unfair way. I like that method of design.Conclusion: 8.5/10Highly recommended if you want an old school experience in 1080p that is reminiscent of Zelda and old school Mario. It's a great game with solid gameplay elements and the story is engaging and interesting. If you're an anime fan then I'm certain you'll find worth in this game. If you're not an anime fan then your opinion will likely differ, maybe drastically so. But regardless, the gameplay is super strong and rewarding, so if you want a challenge then this is it. If you're in the unsure camp like I was, wait for a price reduction via sale then snap it up.			"

												I simply have no words to describe how incredible Ys Origin is. There are 3 playable characters with slightly different stories along with few different boss fights and each one of our heroes have a unique combat system, so you will have at least 60 hours to complete the entire storyline. This game is a true masterpiece in every aspect, like music (as always), art style for the characters design (anime-like), beautiful graphics. Get it, you won't regret.			"

												I tend to be weary of japanese game ports. The PC gaming market is small over there, and it's common for developers to misunderstand PC expectations. Moreover, these types of games attract a passionate fanbase, who will often overlook technical flaws in their reviews.Good news: none of this applies to Ys Origin. The game runs at 60 frames per second without a hitch. Widescreen resolutions are properly supported. There is minimal letterboxing on menus, but devs have added additional graphics on the sides (rather than black bars), a nice touch. 7 hours in, I haven't been able to spot a single bug or glitch. Keyboard controls are implemented and the various tutorial screens actually reference these keys rather than gamepad prompts.As for the gameplay itself, other reviews give a good overview so there's hardly any need to expand on this. Personal recommandation, don't let your ego get in the way of a fun experience. As someone who finds the Dark Souls series' reputation for punishing difficulty to be largely overblown (and I love all Dark Souls games), Ys Origin's demo boss still handed my♥♥♥♥♥to me several times on Normal difficulty. Picking Easy for my real playthrough after buying the game, so far it has been appropriately challenging. Also worth noting leveling seems to be important in this game. Sometimes, getting two extra levels can be the difference between hitting a boss for 1 damage per hit or 10 damage per hit (those numbers might seem paltry either way, but when you think about it, the latter hits ten times harder). On Easy there hasn't been any need to grind experience so far.Overall, an excellent game. -75% discounts come and go on a regular basis, and at that price it's a steal if you're even remotely interested in the genre. Heck, I don't even like anime, but one can only stay grumpy for so long in the face of sheer fun.			"

												Just bought this game because it was on sale and figure I'd give a chance. Never played the franchise before but I have been pleaseantly surprised so far. If you love action rpgs like castlevania:sympothy of night or Top down action games like Zelda: Link to the past then try this game out. They blend those genres really well. Despite its 2d aesthic the game is actually 3d so you can also jump around, adding potential for greater puzzle/platformig depth and exploration. In the end it's great mix of action, and light puzzl/platforming, and rpg. Has that charming old school vibe to it but with extremly fluid controls. And the music is great and the sound effects help bring you back to that old school action jrpg genre nostalgia. Great game and I'm only 2 bosses and 1hr plus in. I can all ready tell I'm gonna love this title.			"

Seriously bring more of these games on here!+Graphics are hugely improved over Oath  (Backgrounds, attack animations, cut scenes.)+Great Sound Track (As usual.)+Fast and fluid combat (On par with Oath.)+Intersting Story (Who playes this for the story anyways?)+I can still play with 2 different characters with different play styles (Played as Yunica = Similar to Adol.)+Challenging boss fights (Everything besides bosses are easier than Oath.)+Nice additions to combat such as SP and that Doble Boost thing.-Your in a tower and it's pretty linear.  No towns or villages.-Can't skip scenes (Gets more irritating near the end of game.)			"

												Outside of an awful RTS spinoff on the DS Origin was my first real taste of the Ys series, and it was a taste so good I've continued to buy up all subsequent releases on PC. An action RPG comprising of three separate character journeys through a rather large and complex tower, featuring many natural obstacles and puzzles to overcome. The game is certainly challenging with a combat system that is easy to get used to and offers layers of options to your fighting. You're likely to die to each boss as you figure out the tactics, making it so satisfying when you do break through. There are few other games that have demanded so much attention and kept me hooked throughout the way that Origin has done.You can read a full review of this game here.[www.neoseeker.com] "

												Forget how Anime or cutesy it looks - this is one of the best action adventure platformers i've ever played. The combat is fast and fulfilling and the boss fights are incredibly fun and very challenging - you MUST like boss fights or else the gameplay won't have much appeal to you. The game kind of reminds me of Zelda in that you fight your way through differently themed stages/levels (dungeons/temples) with the sole objective of reaching the level's boss. Although don't go thinking that the game offers anything more than pure, fast-paced action and a lightish story.This is the first Ys game I've played and now I'm hooked. I can see why the Ys series has a dedicated following. On to play The Oath in Felghana next!			"

Ys Origin is built on what is possibly the best ARPG engine out there, featuring fast and tense combat with responsive controls that requires a little strategic thinking.  On top of that, the graphics manage to be impressively beautiful while retaining excellent system performance.  The plot's pretty good, too - about as straightforward as you'd expect in a game like this, but I think the character development carries it, and the fact that there are three slightly different versions of it (one of which is unlocked by clearing the game once, has you initially fighting against the other protagonists, and includes additional plot revelations) improves replayability.I do feel, though, like Falcom made a mistake with the difficulty levels and achievements - many mistakes, actually.  For starters, SP (points for buying ability upgrades) gain rates are tied to difficulty level, and some upgrades are so exorbitantly expensive that getting the related achievements is only feasible by playing through and farming on the lowest difficulty level, which is so easy as to be boring.  That's not the really crazy part, though.  The crazy part is the extra outfit for one of the characters - let me say that again: it's just an alternate sprite, and an achievement to go with it - that requires beating the game at least 6 times, including 3 on nightmare difficulty, plus spending a lot of time in Arena Mode.  Even if you just want to fight the unlockable optional boss, which I kinda do, you'll still have to do the 3 Nightmare runs and the grinding in Arena Mode.  Now, I do have to give Falcom credit for making the higher difficulty levels challenging in ways that are a little more creative than damage dealt/taken adjustments.  I already mentioned the SP gain rates (I think EXP is also affected to a lesser degree), and your special abilities have longer cooldowns, but the most noticeable difference is in the enemy AI: on higher difficulty levels, enemies will attack more frequently and aggressively, with bosses in particular saturating their lairs with hazards to your health, making the game not just more difficult, but also more exciting.  Unfortunately, though, your chances of surviving still come down to experience level.  A single level gain makes the difference between a boss fight you have absolutely no hope of winning and a boss fight you can probably clear with your character just barely still breathing if you practice a few times.  Upgrades, of course, help too.  And, remember, farming is slower on higher difficulties.  What this means is that a Nightmare playthrough is basically a long, tedious grindfest punctuated by occasional intense boss battles.  It doesn't help that all the dialogue, which ordinarily I'd appreciate, is all unskippable, and there's sometimes a lot of it immediately before a boss.  I had been planning on getting as close to 100% completion as I reasonably could (Caress of Steel?  Ha, ha, NO.), but having beating the game once with each of the three characters, including one Nightmare run, and cleared all but the last arena stage multiple times, it's gotten too repetitive, and I'm kinda sick of it now.  Uninstalling for my own sanity.			"

												This game is anime as hell, with horrible pacing, painfully awkward(ly translated?) writing, cringeworthy story, setting and characters that it shoves in your face in lengthy, unskippable conversations and cutscenes.You should still totally play it, because once all that stuff takes a break this game is an addictively fun simple brawler with a limited but very satisfying moveset, basic but enjoyable rpg systems and very challenging (depending on your level and difficulty), varied and interesting boss fights - all supported with a catchy soundtrack.Don't expect Dark Souls though: if any encounter is too rough - likely because you're underleveled - it usually can be trivialized by grinding a room full of enemies for 15-30 minutes to get a handful of levels over the boss. There's also easier difficulties to pick if you don't feel like ""powerleveling"".The regular playthrough is a very decent length already, and the game is designed for multiple playthroughs with different characters with different abilities and boss encounters, so if you enjoy the gameplay the game certainly delivers tons of it.

The boss battles are pretty hard -- there are no healing spells or resurrecting potions to keep you going. You have to be careful and dodge every attack and in Nightmare mode, the bosses are very durable. It takes patience, quick reflexes and level grinding isn't really that bad. This game also inspired me to revisit the good RPGs of the SNES and PS1 era. Chrono Trigger, here I come!			"

												J-Just.... THE EMERSION! A game that, to me, gave a really good bonding experience with the playable characters. Good difficulty and balance, yet still the possibility to easily gain some more fighting strength for tough fights. Not many games do, but this game gave me that empty feeling of sadness when it was over. I was forced to consider what just occured, and the meaning of it. And let me tell you, my conclusion wasn't a happy one. Knowing that your character was done and that you would never again experience the same thing is not very pleasant in this case. This is something I rarely see in the modern gaming genres. I want to mention a couple of things to those who have doubts about this game.It's a japanese game, so it does have some anime-esk cut-scenes and images. Yet, these occur very rarely, so do not be concerned if you think this would bother you (Though, seriously, why would it?). It's an old game, don't look for good graphics and such. Though, that's not what you primarily should be looking for in a game. The gameplay feels smooth and fast-paced, something that I thoroughly enjoyed. Characters that are extremely unique and different from one another. Discovering the plot feels utterly fantastic. Any time something plot-related occured in between my beat up sequences, I couldn't help but let my excitement lead me through the dialogues. Remember when I mentioned I felt really empty and sad about my character that I played? How I wasn't going to be able to see her anymore? Well, that happened with not only that one, but some NPCs as well. Definitely an achievement.Something more about difficulty. The game has 5 difficulty settings, two above and below normal. This makes it very suitable for people of all skill levels or interests. Keep in mind that you cannot change your difficulty throughout the game, yet this is also not necessary as you will always be able to beat the boss without exception because of the possibility to grind a level or two. Not once have I felt like a boss was truly overpowered. Rather, that I, myself, was underpowered. And that is something that's easy to fix. Now, something I really appreciate about this game is that you have 3 playable characters. One of which is unlocked by finishing the game with one of the other two. This is because the final one is the hardest one to play and to minimize sploilers for the other two. The reason for that is something you will have to find out for yourself. The last one also has the one true story, meaning, the heaviest plot. This gives the game amazing replayability. That is about the best I can give you. If this has not cleared things up for you regarding gameplay and such, I'd say you oughta simply look up a video and see for yourself. Try to minimize spoilers, however! So, to conclude my review, this game is heavily recommended by myself among others.			"

												Score: 8.5 / 10I haven't 100%'d the game yet, but I feel like I'm ready to review it after 120 hours of gameplay and 3 playthroughs on nightmare on all characters.I have played three games from the Ys series so far (Ys I & II, Origin and Felghana) and each one of them clearly shows the extreme effort Falcom and XSEED put into every aspect of the game: super smooth gameplay with solid mechanics and very few bugs or inconsistencies, pretty challenging difficulty, excellent performance, very flexible settings that support even 120hz and up monitors and modern resolutions, the portings are very compatible with modern OSes even though these games are from 2006 and earlier, the anime graphics and the artwork are sweet and pleasant (but not necessarily ultra detailed) and the soundtracks are masterpieces.In poor words, Falcom consistently does a great job in every aspect of the game and puts a great effort into making every detail perfect and solid. Both the engines of Ys I & II and Origin & Felghana have the perfect balance between graphics, performance and gameplay quality.I won't talk too much about the plot because I usually don't care about that stuff.Ys Origin is a prequel set 700 years before the events of Ys I & II and tells about the past of Ys, the twin goddesses, the black pearl and Solomon Shrine. Most of humanity fled to Solomon Shrine (which is on a floating island up in the sky), as the surface got taken over by demons. For the very first time we're not playing as Adol. We will be playing as one member of a group of adventurers (you can choose between 3 characters) sent to investigate on the disappearance of the twin goddesses, who seem to be inside the Darm tower.Pro / Cons:+ = pro- = con- no more ""bump mechanics"" from Ys I & II. In my opinion, this combat system was unique and kinda set Ys apart from other action RPG's, also it made boss fights a bit more challenging. Ys Origin & other newer Ys games ditched that system for more generic hack n slash mechanics + magic which is okay but nothing special.- the game takes place entirely inside of the Darm Tower, so there is not that much variety environment-wise.- while Ys I had very short but extremely fast & challenging boss fights (except for a few bosses with bugged AI's), the boss fights on Ys Origin are slow and long, and since the bosses heavily rely on RNG, defeating a boss on Nightmare difficulty is 50% skill 50% luck unless you overlevel to fight that luck factor. Either way, there is too much luck involved in boss fights, and sometimes it can become frustrating even if you can actually beat the boss 100% of the times. This also makes boss rush / time attack extremely tedious and frustrating especially on Nightmare where you will be barely equipped to beat the boss. In Ys I & II, on the other hand, the boss fights were 100% skill based and used nearly no RNG-based attacks, but they were so challenging that you had to practice for a bit to master them even if you memorized them, so the results of the boss fights scaled directly with the player's skill.- there is a lot more grinding required, too much for my tastes. Leveling up for bosses takes much longer and filling the monster book is now random instead of having to kill each mob 31 times.- the dialogue can be sped up but not skipped. this can be frustrating when playing through the game multiple times.- the save system does not allow you anymore to save anywhere - you can teleport to save points, but you will have to save there so that adds some useless backtracking when saving before dangerous situations. On the other hand, the teleport system is handy to quickly teleport to every area of the game, but a system like the wings in Ys II would've been enough.- Alt + F4'ing the game has a chance to corrupt your monster book+ a playthrough takes about 10 hours if you kill all of the bosses first try and 20-30+ hours if you take a few tries to beat each boss, which is pretty optimal for multiple playthroughs or speedruns.+ amazing soundtrack with lots of remasters of the original darm tower musics in Ys I+ lots of references to Ys I & II: remastered bosses, lots of monsters in common, lots of remastered music, some key items in common and the plot is nicely linked and properly explains all of the backstory behind Ys I.+ very high replay value: each character sees the story from an entirely different perspective, will encounter slightly different bosses and each character's boss fight is balanced differently. There's also an arena mode where you will be able to fight monsters from different areas of the game to gain SP you can use to unlock alternative versions of the characters and other bonus content, including a secret boss. Completing all of the achievements will take up to 6 playthroughs or more. There's also the usual monster book you have to fill by grinding all of the monsters in the game (some are missable), an upgrade system for your characters where you can spend SP earned from mobs, and various Roo's hidden around the game that will give you missable upgrades if you feed them Roda Fruits (also hidden & missable).+ the achievements where you have to beat two ""unbeatable"" boss that you normally have to lose to are pretty interesting challenges even though they're heavily rng based+ retrying bosses doesn't make you go through the dialogue all over again+ perfect support for the 360 joypad and ps3 joypad + ds3 tool+ the engine has a minimum guaranteed performance: for example, if there's too many effects on screen some of them will not display, that way there is always a guaranteed minimum framerate even in the worst scenario.+ the bosses partially retain the ""bullet hell on foot"" feel that Ys I & II had.It's not a masterpiece like Ys I & II, but it's an excellent game like most Falcom games and it's certainly worth the price. Highly recommended.			"

												Ys Origin from Nihon Falcom is a Japanese take on the ARPG genre, so it's a JARPG I guess. I didn't really know what to expect when I started playing it but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The combat is solid and the graphics are charming.  Although you aren't given free reign to upgrade your character like a Western ARPG you level up as you kill monsters which strengthens your stats and you also gain SP by killing monsters which you can use to purchase upgrades for your character to increase passive stats such as Mana Cost for spells. Grinding is also well done in this game, if you kill the monsters as you advance through the game your character will be strong enough to defeat the bosses; however, if you're having trouble with a particular enemy you can grind up to increase your stats if you wish. Speaking of bosses, it was the best part about the game. The boss fights are well designed, challenging, but also fair. It's kind of a ""find the pattern"" type of deal, but there's a lot of skill involved in defeating the many bosses in the game. It had a Demon's Souls type of feel for the boss battles but the rest of the game had a Zelda-esque feel to it. The bosses were so fun I thought to myself while playing, ""it would be awesome if this game had a boss rush mode."" Little did I know, it does! It unlocks after you beat the game.While I enjoyed the game a lot, it did have a few problems. The game is linear, with you having to find a key or item to get to the next area and there isn't an open world as you're just going up a tower. That's not to say the environments aren't varied, as they are, it just means there isn't much exploring to do. There's also a bit too much backtracking for my taste, but it wasn't too excessive. The music is pretty low quality and repetative and the control settings aren't adjustable in-game (you have to use a separately loaded launcher) so if you don't have your controller settings set properly you have to exit the entire game to get it right; other than that the controller support in the game is quite good. There are three playable characters (one of which is unlockable), each of which gives you a different point of view on the narrative. The unlockable character is actually a demon as well, so you get the antagonist's point of view on the story which I found quite cool. The story itself is rather tropey, but still was a little more adult than other JRPGs I have played (it has swear words and death) which I enjoyed. The game loads and exits in a snap, which is also a plus.Pros:GameplayStoryline (multiple perspectives)3 Characters that play quite differently""Grinding"" done well for a JRPGBoss FightsUnlockables and Bonus Modes (with leaderboard support!)Excellent ReplayabilityCons:Music/AudioBacktrackingLinearityI really enjoyed this Japanese take on the ARPG genre. If you enjoy killer boss fights I'd recommend it for you. There's also a boss rush mode which is amazing for this game and many other unlockables to keep your interest in the game after you've beaten it. The three available characters all play differently and show you a different perspective on the events of the story and I'm really looking forward to coming back and playing this game again once I've finished the other games in my collection. There are a few negative aspects of Ys Origin (I really disliked the audio engineering) but they don't overbearingly detract from the fun I had with this game. A-NOTE: I did play Ys Oath in Felghana and I have to say I wasn't as impressed with that game as I was with this one.  The boss battles weren't as epic, grinding felt more necessary, the music was better (but still repetetive), and basically everything that was good about that game is in Origin, but there's a lot missing.  The protagonist is also silent (which hasn't been cool since Freeman did it), and there's only one playable character.  I would NOT recommend Oath, but Origin is great.  If you want more of the same gameplay, play the other characters on Origin - skip Oath unless you REALLY love the series.			"

												Maybe my biggest surprise / gut purchase ever. Ys is one of those darling series where everyone seems to want to tell you how good it is yet few people have played. While I won't say it's become one of my favorite series, it's become one I've begun to follow, and it along with Trails in the Sky has put Falcom on my mental map when it comes to video games.Ys, pronounced something like ""ease"" with only the first letter capitalized and no apostrophe, is basically an action jrpg without random battles or a heavy story emphasis. There's a moderate amount of text dialogue but it's interesting enough and no voice acting to drag it down. Ys Origin is essentially a far prequel to the events of Ys I and II, also available on Steam but significantly more dated. You are given two choices of characters. Yunica provides gameplay more similar to that of series protagonist Adol, specilizing in close combat fighting. Hugo seems to be a more experimental playstyle for the series, focusing on long range magic attacks.I strongly suggest Yunica to be your first playthrough character for the game. Her playstyle is simply exceedingly more engaging than Hugo, who simply becomes a button spam unless playing at one of the more difficult settings. Luckily to unlock the third character you only need to beat the game as one of these two, which is nice if you want to experience the full canon story of the third character without slogging through a Hugo playthrough. Though you may find you don't mind and will want to play his story anyways.Ys Origin is a brief experience, which is good considering that if you want to see everything you have to play the game a few times. It also allows for replays and taking on higher difficulties if you find you truly want to master the battle system. While the common enemies may not offer much lateral thought in how you tackle them, the frequent and varied boss encounters are quite a relative spectacle and there's no re-skinning or re-hashing to be seen here. All of them are tackled in a different way.There is a plethora of music selections for each section of the tower. The whole soundtrack is great an I often found myself humming some of the more memorable tracks. There's also good variety, so finding a few floors with a theme you don't really care for is offset by knowing that a new track is just around the corner.Definietly consider it if you are looking for a unique jrpg without the bloat that SE or someone like NamcoBandai puts out these days.8.5/10			"

												Do you like old school hack and slash RPGs? If the answer is yes, then I recommend that you play Ys Origin. It has some great boss fights and tight controls. Nothing else to say, check out the trailer and if you think it looks fun, then you'll have a blast. It's definitely one of my all time favorite action RPGs, along with the other 3D Ys games.			"

												If you made contact with any Ys Game you probably have a good idea what this is about.Basicaly it's straight-forward HacknSlash-Action. The levels themselves are not that much of a challenge. The essence of the gameplay comes to shine when you're battling one of the bosses where none of them is too easy but not too hard as well.The Graphics are held in a anime style. The levels are mostly well designed though not always easy to overlook. The Story is nice. The dialoges are well written and give the gameplay its moments of calm. Often the dialoges get a little long but nothing too terible.The biggest plus to all Ys Games I know is its music. It drives you forward when you are slashing through monster hordes. Musics in the calm-story moments are simple and nice too.			"

												[English]Ys is one of those series, where your first Impression isn`t that good! It doesn`t look like very unique, rather normal. But a Friend of mine, recommended this Game, so i tried it. And how shall i put it? It's Awesome and i am a very big Fan now. The Characters are well-elaborated, the Story is exciting and the Gameplay is so much fun! But the best Thing for me in Ys are the Soundtrack and the Bossfights. Rarely a Game-Series brought me that, what i liked the Most in my Favorite Series like The legend of Zelda, which i love! The one Thing, that can grab you and don´t let you go! And that is what Ys have![Deutsch/German]Ys ist eine der Reihen, die zu Anfang keinen wirklich großen Eindruck hinterlassen! Sie wirkt nicht sehr besonders, eher gewöhnlich. Doch auf die Empfehlung eines Freundes hin, habe ich mir dieses Spiel dann doch besorgt und bin nun ein begeisterter Fan der Reihe! Die Charaktere in Origins sind Spitzenmässig ausgearbeitet, die Story spannend und das Gameplay macht, so simpel es auch gestrikt ist, einfach eine Menge spass. Doch das beste ist der Soundtrack sowie die epischen Bosskämpfe. Selten hat mir eine Spielereihe das gebracht, was ich an meinen Lieblingsreihen wie z.b. The Legend of Zelda geliebt habe. Das Gewisse etwas, ein sog - der nicht mehr loslässt. Und die Ys-Reihe besitzt es!			"

												Ys Origin is a fantastic and surprising game. At the start it appears to be a fairly standard JRPG-esq story with the memorable and challenging hack and slash gameplay Ys is known for, but as you play through the game multiple times with each of the characters, what was first a simple, borderline cliche, if well executed tale becomes far more memorable, complex, and touching. No other game I've seen tells a story like it, and its a damn good story to boot. With memorable characters and story, fantastic gameplay, and a mindblowing soundtrack, there is little reason not to get Ys Origin as soon as you can.			"

												My score: 9.5/10I have yet to find anything really wrong with this game.  It plays very much like an old-school RPG but with action elements instead of turn-based combat.  You're slashing, smashing, and magicking your way through a 20-something story tower full of demons.  I don't want to go much into the story because that's half of what makes this game so brilliant.  I haven't played a game with such a great story in a very long time.  Finish this game through to the end as well, because there's a bunch of unlockables (time-attack and an arena battle mode, to name a couple... naming more would be spoilers).  The replay value is pretty good but if you're going for a 100% completion it could take a long while.Gameplay-wise, it has a few quirks to get used to, and it'll take some time, but once you've got it down it's pretty easy.  The boss battles are INSANE, and there are a LOT.  If you're a fan of great boss fights, you'll love this game.  Each difficulty brings a new attack pattern, etc. to the bosses in addition to basically oneshotting you if you're not properly leveled/geared.The only qualm I can see that some people might have is that, like I mentioned earlier, if you aren't properly leveled you're going to have a rough time in certain areas of the game (bosses in particular).  The good news is that you'll catch on pretty quick.  The bad news is that you might have to sit there grinding enemies for a while - which isn't too bad, but you have to make sure you save often just in case.TLDR: Fantastic story, quirky controls, fantastic boss fights, lots of unlockables and decent replay value.  Pick this game up and if you want more of the story, pick up Ys I & II as well as Oath in Felghana.  All four games are worth it, trust me.			"

												This game is what revived ARPGs for me. Fast paced combat, enough story to keep you mildly invested, and multiple characters to help fit more than one type of playstle. Ys Origin has many [noticible] flaws and successes, most of which make it the game it is today.Pros: 3 Playable characters- We have your battle axe wielding berserker-style teenager, your snooty mage, and your ""Git gud and unlock me"" Character. Each one plays differently because of movement, magic skills, or how well they can manage themselves in, what I like to call, ""crisis"" situations (instances where you end up in a terrible spot and thinking/reacting fast is your only means of survival"".Jumping- FINALLY, A GAME WHERE I CAN PLAY AN RPG, FIGHT IN REAL TIME, AND JUMP!!!! Moving in 3 dimensions makes platforming puzzles and combat reach another level of challenging.Puzzles- Puzzles are NEVER stupidly difficult and one particular puzzle can actually be solved without getting a ""mandatory"" upgrade nearby as 2 of the 3 characters. Puzzles are more meant to keep you from ""completely"" blitzing through the game.Story- Story is spaced out enough that it will never wholely interrupt your climb through the tower, but will still be there to keep you interestedBoss Fights- Probably the crowning achievement of Ys games, the boss fights will almost ALWAYS let you have a ton of fun on any difficulty (Yes, even people like me who are frustrated on higher difficulties still enjoy Nightmare mode/Inferno mode for Oath in Felghana). The fact that most of them keep the same pace, or even speed up a bit near the end of the fight, keeps the adrenaline pumping and makes victories that much sweeter.Difficulty select- You can't change once you start...but at the beginning there are multiple difficulties for the casual/hardcore masochist in all of us. Very Easy mode for the people who just want to beat the game, all the way up to Nightmare for the people who want to be challenged/punished for slightly better unlockable rewards.Music- FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING SACRED AND DEMONIC IN ALL WORLDS, THIS MUSIC IS AMAZING :L I am a SLAVE to the soundtracks in Ys games! Fanboying aside....we DO have many memorable tracks and a few that may put you to sleep (I'm looking at you 2nd sector >.<) but the tracks are all VERY good standalone....just not always for extended periods of time. The BGM will be the same for the ENTIRE time you are in a sector/until you enter a boss area, so get used to them.Cons- Combat playstyles- Each character can only really play one way...turning trash mob combat into tedium when you are a few levels shy of doing any real damage to enemies. Trash mobs WILL eventually turn into beat-em up sections if you need to go level grinding for any reason.Level to Damage scaling- You will get new armor and be able to upgrade your weapon as you play through the game but at the same time your level is just as dependant on your damage. If you are even 2 levels shy of where you ""should be"" you will do little to no damage. You will literally get a small damage/defense spike around certain levels just so you keep up, a pattern present in Ys: Oath in Felghana as well. The same applies to having a weapon too low level. I was at the 3rd boss of the game as the 1st playable character and I noticed I could barely do 2 damage to the guy. Turns out, I missed an upgrade partway through the tower section I was in; because the MOMENT I got it the boss was taking normalized damage again. Upgrade (as a result) are NOT optional, which may kill the game for you if you are playing on Hard/Nightmare and you are going in blind. Glitches- The game is relatively glitch-free from my 160-170 hours on record, but occasionally you will witness things like falling through a floor during an attack or clipping into things that stay relatively solid. Nothing too bad, but it did hurt a little getting to the true final boss and falling through the floor RIGHT as I pulled out my nuke move.Upgrades- Remember how I said upgrades ""should"" be optional in places? This is where the game has the potential to be a real deal breaker for some. Most RPGs have proven that treasure chests are relatively optional unless something you NEED is in them. Ys: Origin loves planting things that make not getting OHKO'd/combat even remotely possible late game IN treasure chests and then giving you free reign to ignore them. This is not a complaint, but this HAS halted/slowed the progress of a few people Ive helped out on the forums. You should ALWAYS go for chests you see...even if it looks like a pain in the butt to get if you want to have a decent time above Easy mode.Overall, I give this an 8/10, its EASILY one of my favorite games (especially out of my Steam Library) but even I can see where this game would♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off.

												This is a pretty amazing game. It may not look like much at first but believe me, once you start playing you'll enjoy every bit of it. The gameplay is solid and the boss fights keep you on your toes - every boss has some kind of weakness which you need to discover and then exploit in order to beat them (something you don't see very often). As for the story - it's AWESOME! Some may find it a little cliche but for me it offered a very enjoyable experience. In addition, you get to experience it through the eyes of three different characters - Yunika, Hugo and a mystery character (You unlock him after beating the game as either Yunika or Hugo)I personally had never played a game of this genre before (Japanese RPG) so I'm not really sure to which type of player to recomment it to... All I can say is that I've had a blast with it and definitely recommend it. :)			"

												Ys Origin is a fast paced platformer/hack 'n' slash that resembles many of the old PSX games from that genre. I found it to be quite enjoyable although some of the dialogue is a bit hacky and some grinding is required. The does take care to ensure that all of the power-ups and items you receive throughout the game maintain their relevance and don't just become another thing in your item bag. The music good, the combat is great, and the game successfully rides the line between fun and challengng. This is a great buy and you will more than likely kill your life, or at least the next several hours.			"

												Ys origin is a great game,its an action-jrpg that has all the elements that makes Ys series great, the huge difficult bosses, the fast paced action, the amazing music. This one follows the style of the modern 3D Ys games like oath in felghana and ark of napishtim but the story is a prequel of the whole Ys series, before Ys I & II chronicles. It does a great job explaining how the story started with interesting characters and a plot that suits the game. Dont expect an amazing plot but its decent.As for the content, the game offers three playable characters (one fo them is unlocked after you complete the game with one of the first two) with different story for each one, also there is boss rush,time attack and an arena mode, so there is lots of things to do. Just for completion with one character you will need about 12 hours in normal difficulty.The game can be really hard so think carefully before starting it in hard mode for a first playthrough.I highly recommend this game for hack and slash action-jrpg fans.

												This is a pretty amazing game. It may not look like much at first but believe me, once you start playing you'll enjoy every bit of it. The gameplay is solid and the boss fights keep you on your toes - every boss has some kind of weakness which you need to discover and then exploit in order to beat them (something you don't see very often). As for the story - it's AWESOME! Some may find it a little cliche but for me it offered a very enjoyable experience. In addition, you get to experience it through the eyes of three different characters - Yunika, Hugo and a mystery character (You unlock him after beating the game as either Yunika or Hugo)I personally had never played a game of this genre before (Japanese RPG) so I'm not really sure to which type of player to recomment it to... All I can say is that I've had a blast with it and definitely recommend it. :)			"

Nothing else to say, check out the trailer and if you think it looks fun, then you'll have a blast. It's definitely one of my all time favorite action RPGs, along with the other 3D Ys games.			"

												If you're in to (japanese) Action-RPG's and like a great challenge when it comes to boss fights, I highly recommend Ys: Origin. There are 3 different playable characters with their own playstyles and multiple difficulties to choose from. The basic ""grinding"" and leveling system is fun and addictive. You'll just want to keep slaying enemies after another, before your accumulating +exp, +str and +mana regen meters run off. The levels have puzzles and ofc treasures aswell, so it's not all brainless grinding (though you still can't turn your brain off while leveling, it's easy to die to normal mobs unless you pay attention). The level designs are nice aswell, there's enough to explore and it's not linear at all.But the best part of Ys: Origin are the hard boss battles. (If you're experienced in this kind of genre, I recommend either Hard or Nightmare difficulty to make the best out of the fights) The boss tactics are quite varied, though many resembled me of Touhou games, just in 3D. In other words there's quite a lot of projectiles to avoid, and you can't take too many hits. The fights usually take some time to learn to execute good enough, but beating the boss in the end is a great feeling.The story isn't anything fancy unfortunately, so better not get your hopes up on that. Music on the otherhand is great, not the best of the best among the J-RPG composers, but still great. I love those upbeat tunes that play during the boss battles, they make the fights feel even more epic!The graphics are really outdated, since the orginal game was released in 2006. The characters are drawn as sprites, but the enviroment is in 3D and looked from an isometric perspective. Though, the game kind of has an old-school feel with it because of this, and it might not be a bad thing. But if you're bothered by the old look, this game is not propably for you.			"

There is a nice diversity in the characters though they different characters do not impact the story as much as I had hoped. Still the story isn't too important as you'll mainly be playing this game for the gameplay and outstanding soundtrack! If you're unsure then give the demo a whirl which will give you a fairly good indication whether or not this is your thing.			"

												Ys Origin is that one game I have been waiting for to make me feel like a child again. I orginally got this game because I have played some other Nihon Falcom games.      This game completely blew me away. This series is now on my top 10 list just from playing this one game. The fighting is fun and quirky and makes me wish more games took this kind of play style. On top of that the story was perfect. The writers took great detail in making sure that you fell in love with the character. Granted I have only played one character and there are two more I can play, but I completely fell for Yunica our heroine. This to me is one of the best games I have played and will always have a place in my heart.Storyline: 9/10Gameplay: 9/10Characters: 9/10 Personal Score: 10/10Overall: 9.5/10(Note:I have not played all Characters.

In it's simplicity this game puts many AAA titles in shame by it's design, writing and gameplay. Perhaps in 100+ people development teams the heart of fun is often lost.

												I strongly recommend playing this game. It is an action RPG where you can play through as three characters, the final character unlocking the true story behind the game. The controls of this series have finally gotten far, far less clunky, and Ys Origin will keep you on the move. There is very little stopping, even with level grinding. Hit things, fire magic at them, kill all the demons and make it to the top of the tower, learning more and more along the way. This game also has supreme replayability, as you can (and should) play as all three characters, each with a unique storyline and playstyle. PLAY IT, BUY IT, UNDERRATED SERIES "

												I've not got incredibly far in this game but what I've played so far has been a blast. The controls (at least with an XBOX Controller) are tight and responsive, and the combat is very fun.However, the real treat in this game is the boss fights, which are hella cool and provide a pretty good challenge. I'd recommend a controller because the response time and precision of control you need is so exact. Some of the bosses go into bullet hell territory but many of them require precision jumps and dodges to beat. The common enemies don't really give you too much trouble, but there are areas where combinations of certain types of baddy provide a pretty satisfying clear up.The graphics are what you'd expect from a small budget Japanese game. They're functional, mostly sprite characters on poly backgrounds and the art style is nice enough if not a little generic. The particle effects are very nice and the fully 3D bosses look fantastic and really show the games artistic strength in full. But you're not really playing this game for the graphics.All in all I'd recommend it to anyone, especially at a sale price!			"

												Ys Origins is a mix between Diablo and Zelda, and it is very fun to play. Unfortunately the great gameplay, soundtrack and visuals are dragged down by downright cringeworthy dialogue and a by the numbers story with a very flat ending. The graphics are also a bit dated even for 2006 when this originally came out. However the game still has a charm of its own. The character sprites are well made and environments have clear and different themes and feels. The fast pace of the monster slaying is maybe a bit too often grinded into a halt when you have to sit through lengthy and uninteresting line exchanges between the monotone and cliche characters.One interesting thing of note is the other main character of the game, Hugo. He should probably get an award for the most edgy video game protagonist ever. Most of the cringe material of the game comes from his teenage rebel attitude. The story might have been much less cringy had I picked Yunica for playable character, but I also think the edginess is kinda charming and memorable.In conclusion the rock solid gameplay and soundtrack totally redeem this game from any negatives I might have towards it. It was a blast to play and a definite recommendation.			"

												Amazing game, one of the best cRPG and for sure one with the best lore out there. Even on normal difficulty killing some bosses requires a lot of wipes. I ended game with 2 characters - Yunica and one that you unlock after you end game with Yunica or Hugo. Playing and beating game by Yunica is fun, there is more puzzles and exploring tower by her for first time is a real challange. Finding all hidden chests takes a lot of time. Unlocked hero doesnt have so much puzzles and you already know the tower so its easy to get through all levels, but imo bosses are far more challanging on this one and lore is incredibly good.

												Now, let me just say that Falcom and Xseed games did a respectable job with this installment of the Ys series but it is not a game without its flaws. Lets start with the things I really liked. The gameplay was wonderful, honestly I would change a thing about it. Yunica moves where you want, attacks where you want, slaughters thousands of enemies in an effort to grind levels, the way you want... and umm hmm I'll talk about that pretty soon. The visual style was really good to look at with a SNES era feel to it. Although, same of the 3D environments looked a little choppy and jagged it was enough to take away from the game. I liked the good use of colour throughout the games many different environments. What I found really neat that despite the fact you spend the entire game inside a tower the developers still put floors dedicated to elements such as desert, water and lava. My favourite part of the game was hands down the combat which was a pleasure to utilize. The boss fights were always overwhelming and in general were very unique. They provided a great deal of challenge to the player and some would not be defeated easily. Just my basic two cents on what I feel was done right.On the other hand there are some areas for improvement that I feel should be touched on. I'm not providing any plot spoilers but I do think the story was all anything to special. If you look at the whole picture then maybe the story is more meaningful, but the events leading up to the end just felt a little bit empty to me. I'm not saying it's bad but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Another thing that I found rather bland was the characters. They weren't very likeable and for that matter many of them just felt forced into the game. A lot of them were unlikeable and literaly added nothing to the game or the story. The villians of the game didn't really have a reason as to why they wanted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up. A character later in the game dies and the plot sets it up to be very emotional but I think that character had maybe like a dozen lines of dialogue before hand. Anyway, enough about the story elements lets get to the elephant in the room. That's right a JRPG's best friend, grinding. Oh, Jesus Christ, the grinding. Let me just say that I played though this game on normal and I probably spent a very sizable amount of my time proforming mass genoside on these creatures. Why is it that even though I kill all of the enimies in the area, when I get to the boss he rips my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half? Seriously, like I slaughtered every enemy on the way to the fight and the boss don't give a ♥♥♥♥. So, what do you do? You go back and grind until you level up again. Alright, round 2 you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥boss mother ♥♥♥♥er. Nope. You lost again. Game over. Welp, I guess I grind some more levels. This time the boss is ♥♥♥♥ed, right? Nope. ♥♥♥♥ you. And when you finally beat the ♥♥♥♥er you cele-♥♥♥♥ing-brate because you know that all that grinding is past you. You are like overleveled now so, time to go to the next area. The first new enemy you find in the next area does more god damn damage then the ♥♥♥♥ing boss you just beat. At this point you are just like whyyyyy? Why Falcom why? And they are all like ♥♥♥♥ you thats why! So then after crying for half an hour you go back to the last area and grind so you can fight the enemies in the next are and not die. see a pattern here.

												I've not got incredibly far in this game but what I've played so far has been a blast. The controls (at least with an XBOX Controller) are tight and responsive, and the combat is very fun.However, the real treat in this game is the boss fights, which are hella cool and provide a pretty good challenge. I'd recommend a controller because the response time and precision of control you need is so exact. Some of the bosses go into bullet hell territory but many of them require precision jumps and dodges to beat. The common enemies don't really give you too much trouble, but there are areas where combinations of certain types of baddy provide a pretty satisfying clear up.The graphics are what you'd expect from a small budget Japanese game. They're functional, mostly sprite characters on poly backgrounds and the art style is nice enough if not a little generic. The particle effects are very nice and the fully 3D bosses look fantastic and really show the games artistic strength in full. But you're not really playing this game for the graphics.All in all I'd recommend it to anyone, especially at a sale price!			"

												Amazing game, one of the best cRPG and for sure one with the best lore out there. Even on normal difficulty killing some bosses requires a lot of wipes. I ended game with 2 characters - Yunica and one that you unlock after you end game with Yunica or Hugo. Playing and beating game by Yunica is fun, there is more puzzles and exploring tower by her for first time is a real challange. Finding all hidden chests takes a lot of time. Unlocked hero doesnt have so much puzzles and you already know the tower so its easy to get through all levels, but imo bosses are far more challanging on this one and lore is incredibly good. I think its my favorite game on steam.Story 10/10Gameplay 10/10Music 10/10Graphic 7/10			"

												Now, let me just say that Falcom and Xseed games did a respectable job with this installment of the Ys series but it is not a game without its flaws. Lets start with the things I really liked. The gameplay was wonderful, honestly I would change a thing about it. Yunica moves where you want, attacks where you want, slaughters thousands of enemies in an effort to grind levels, the way you want... and umm hmm I'll talk about that pretty soon. The visual style was really good to look at with a SNES era feel to it. Although, same of the 3D environments looked a little choppy and jagged it was enough to take away from the game. I liked the good use of colour throughout the games many different environments. What I found really neat that despite the fact you spend the entire game inside a tower the developers still put floors dedicated to elements such as desert, water and lava. My favourite part of the game was hands down the combat which was a pleasure to utilize. The boss fights were always overwhelming and in general were very unique. They provided a great deal of challenge to the player and some would not be defeated easily. Just my basic two cents on what I feel was done right.On the other hand there are some areas for improvement that I feel should be touched on. I'm not providing any plot spoilers but I do think the story was all anything to special. If you look at the whole picture then maybe the story is more meaningful, but the events leading up to the end just felt a little bit empty to me. I'm not saying it's bad but it just wasn't what I was expecting. Another thing that I found rather bland was the characters. They weren't very likeable and for that matter many of them just felt forced into the game. A lot of them were unlikeable and literaly added nothing to the game or the story. The villians of the game didn't really have a reason as to why they wanted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up. A character later in the game dies and the plot sets it up to be very emotional but I think that character had maybe like a dozen lines of dialogue before hand. Anyway, enough about the story elements lets get to the elephant in the room. That's right a JRPG's best friend, grinding. Oh, Jesus Christ, the grinding. Let me just say that I played though this game on normal and I probably spent a very sizable amount of my time proforming mass genoside on these creatures. Why is it that even though I kill all of the enimies in the area, when I get to the boss he rips my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in half? Seriously, like I slaughtered every enemy on the way to the fight and the boss don't give a ♥♥♥♥. So, what do you do? You go back and grind until you level up again. Alright, round 2 you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥boss mother ♥♥♥♥er. Nope. You lost again. Game over. Welp, I guess I grind some more levels. This time the boss is ♥♥♥♥ed, right? Nope. ♥♥♥♥ you. And when you finally beat the ♥♥♥♥er you cele-♥♥♥♥ing-brate because you know that all that grinding is past you. You are like overleveled now so, time to go to the next area. The first new enemy you find in the next area does more god damn damage then the ♥♥♥♥ing boss you just beat. At this point you are just like whyyyyy? Why Falcom why? And they are all like ♥♥♥♥ you thats why! So then after crying for half an hour you go back to the last area and grind so you can fight the enemies in the next are and not die. see a pattern here. I've seen more grinding in this game than a the club for ♥♥♥♥ sakes. The worst instance was charging the Evil Ring. After trying to figure out how that criptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t worked, I finally figured out I had to kill those sand goat things an area back. So I start attacking the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and only do 1 ♥♥♥♥ing damage to the little♥♥♥♥♥♥ I start attacking the other monsters in the room and do like 55 to them. So what the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing wrong?

												A solid action RPG that properly balances the action and RPG elements, making for a fluid and fast-paced experience free of unnecessary frustration.The game essentially consists of multiple 'dungeons' strung together and with generous save points at various intervals, each of which you can travel between instantly using an inventory item.The dungeons are all consistent in layout in that they're conducive to the action RPG format; it's difficult to get lost and a path will usually branch two different ways at most, one leading to progress and one leading to a chest for example. This keeps the emphasis on the action as it allows you to storm through areas with very little fear of missing a key, new item or consumable.Combat is smooth and enjoyable, and the boss designs are excellent. Replay value is high given the various playable characters--each with their own play style--as well as multiple difficulty settings, bonus modes, unlockables and achievements.I didn't find the storyline very interesting, nor inspiring enough to make me want to explore the series further, though the dialogue is often funny. Which brings me to my main gripe being that the dialogue scenes can be long at times and are unskippable, bringing all the action to a halt intermittently. In addition, it can feel grindy at times in a somewhat imbalanced sense, in that you'll suddenly hit a wall in combat and have to trek back and grind for an hour or so before you can more easily proceed. Otherwise, entirely recommended.			"

												Well, this be my first review... Dunno how to format it but i'll try my bestStory: The game has 2 normal endings but 1 true ending, giving 3 in total. While they of course vary, there are many things which stay the same in the story such as how each character progresses. At points this makes you believe you already know all the story and what's going on after one play through, but later on the story can completely take a twist for each character. Each story does start off pretty slow, especially if you go in without any prior knowledge to the Ys series, but once the plot thickens, it thickens good. It is pretty engaging and most the characters are quite understandable and likeable.Gameplay: I suggest you play the demo itself. On higher difficulties it can be fast paced, manic, epic and overall very enjoyable. There are a few moments in the game mind you where it can be frustrating trying to defeat a boss or enemy, because some of them are just soo cruel on the insane difficulty!.. Each character have 3 abilites they unlock through the game, each of them have their special uses for puzzle solving but also for combat, the main problem I find is that you unlock these all of these three abilites around half way, leaving not much else to unlock except for one super move or a sort per character (Which is awesome but missable) and passive abilities.One thing which did annoy me a lot though is how vague the game could be with it's in-game instructions. For example - if you play as Yunica the game will tell you about how you can use a descending jump attack, what it DOESN'T tell you until later, after soo many chances where it could have been useful, is that the attack is capable of stunning enemies, but since the attack does little damage alone you will probably spend a lot of time playing the game without knowing this gameplay element. Neither does the game explain thrusting or how the boost meter charges quicker when you have less health (Which is really essential to know for a certain task otherwise you could be waiting about for a good 30 minutes). Now, honest maybe it did explain some of these things in the game, but if it did, it obviously didn't make it's point since i'd completed the game twice without knowing some features...Visuals and Audio: Uh... Well this is a sorta old-ish game now, so the visuals aren't all that great for the 3D? models. Weirdly though I find the special effect in game to still look top notch, flashy and cool. The audio is fine really, I haven't much comments on it except that the OST is pretty epic and great, especially nearer to the end of the game.Overall: Since you can, I suggest you just play the demo first, it's a great game in pretty much everyway, there are a few moments which will make you pull out your hair but otherwise the experience as a whole is brilliant for the price.8/10 "

												What happens when you combine a Danmaku with a JRPG? you get Ys! This is by far one of my most favorite Action RPGs series' in existence, mainly because it's fast paced, long enough to keep my interest but short enough to give incentive for replayability, has some serious kick♥♥♥♥♥music and because it's just flat out great old school fun. Being a 90s Kid I grew up with games like this so even normal is pretty relaxing for me, but like any good game of old, the bosses are where the real challenge is at. If you've never played a Ys game then this is by far the best one to start with. Not just because it's the prequel to all Ys games,but it has great controls, fantastic looks, hectic but fair difficulty. Give it a try, you've got nothing to lose and plenty to Ys... oh and one more thing, Bring a controller with you!			"

												Challenging, whimsical, emotional. Ys is an interesting series that I've stumbled upon a few years after its release. I was told that it was very ""chatty"" to which the common complaint was coupled with ""should have had voice acting."" I honestly went into this game only knowing that and nothing of the type of gameplay, combat, or the story elements I'd be facing. When I did, however, it was amazing. Ys Origin takes it's stand as a prequel to the following games before it: being Ys I, II, etc. I've never enjoyed such a vibrant set of characters before; each with their own unraveling stories AND abilities. Mastering the mechanics is some sort of joyous experience that only proves itself further when you go into boss fights. You'll be frustrated and tired of dying, but with those tight controls, well thought out music compositions, and charming graphics, you'll always come back for more.			"

												Darn this game is amazingly addictive and makes you compel to finish the storyline.I recently got this game and decided to try it out since I have heard alot of nice things about it, and me being a fan of JRPGs certainly does help. 11 hours later, I completed the game. Well, granted I did it on the 2nd difficulty level, which is easy, it is still a fun game to play. This is one of the only few games which I powered through to the end, the others were the Assassin Creed's series up to Revealations and some others. P.S: The art style reminds me distinctively of the Golden Sun series on Gameboy, which is another highly rated game I would suggest people to play.			"

What's also great about it is that you don't have to play the games in any particular order, which is what made this franchise popular back on the SNES. One particular complaint I have is the slowpaced intro sequences but honestly this franchise is a barebones Japanese ARPG. I'm gonna go ahead and say you owe it to yourself as a JRPG fan to play this franchise from a simpler era and how it showed you didn't need vast depth to get a great experience.			"

												Fun and positively addictive combat system. Grinding in this game is one of the best grinding experiences in ARPG. Boss battles are tricky and sometimes incredibly brutal, with an upward trend of difficulty in attack patterns and damage received from the first boss to the very last, which is always a crucial key in boss battles design.Storyline is straightforward and fluid with epic twists (the most literal sense of 'epic'). Covers most of the important key points that explain what happens in the main series, while also leaves very much room for personal interpretation and possibly retelling. Character designs are surprisingly intricate and interesting, considering the fact that Falcom had always been set with simplicity in all Ys titles until Ys Origin came out in 2006.Not much needs to be said about the music. Falcom JDK Band did a fantastic job as usual. I believe the music in Ys Origin is about as well-praised as that of Oath in Felghana. Beyond the Beginning is personally my favorite track.The only potential problem with the game is everything stays the very same throughout all three arcs, except for character combat mechanics, storyline, and minor spoiler: a true final boss. This can be boring to some people, but not to me personally.Overall, this is definitely a very solid and highly polished dungeon-crawler ARPG from Falcom, and a worthy title to mark the big jump of the series to Ys Seven. Absolutely a huge Yes from me.			"

												Ys Origin is an excellent game. I was expecting an average action rpg but it ended up being one of my favorite action rpgs to date. The game can be quite difficult at certain points, especially boss battles, even on the easier difficulties. Also the entire soundtrack is superb. So far I've finished the game with Yunica and I've started playing the game as the other two characters (the second of those two must be unlocked by beating the game with either Yunica or Hugo). Each character plays differently from the others and the story for each character is also different (although your going to be running through the same areas and fight most of the same bosses as well). After beating the game with a character it unlocks an arena mode for that character, other unlockables are also unlocked after beating the game with all three of the characters. I'd recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of action games or action rpgs, I'd say its a must buy.  "

												After playing Ys I and II, how I think of this game is much different. It drags along Ys I and II's coattails too much at times, so this hampers the story mode (recycled puzzles from those games, to name a few). Also there are a ton of unskippable cutscenes so it makes the multiple playthroughs required to get everything tiring.The gameplay is good aside from horrendous imbalance between characters (bosses were not balanced around multiple characters very well, so the worst character in the game will have loads of trouble against a boss that can easily be defeated with the ""better"" characters). Soundtrack is pretty great. 8/10Go play Oath in Felghana or Ark of Napishtim for a better Ys experience.			"

												This is an amazing RPG! Rather than following standard turn based actions, you play it in real-time. Amazing story, with plenty of variation and plot twists. The only downer was waiting through a 5 min. unskippable intro. Besides that, amazing game! 4/5 stars			"

												I think the Ys series is really underrated, or maybe it just hasn't had the advertising it did overseas.  These games go way back and there have been several remakes of the originals, including Ys 1 and 2 that are available on Steam.  I recommend anyone that is a fan of action or RPGs to take a look at these.  If you want a more modern game then go for Oath in Felghana or Origin; Ys 1 and 2 have a much different gameplay but I still thoroughly enjoyed them.For the most rewarding experience, play them on Nightmare difficulty.

												-Wonderful Japanese Action Role-Playing Game. -The game is beautiful and the controls work wonderfully. Perhaps a controller would be easier to navigate but so far the keyboard hasn't been too frustrating. -The enemies all seem to be unique and pose different challenges.-The boss battles are so far very well crafted and takes some skill... again easier with a controller.-You unlock skills as you progress similar to how you would in say metroid... which I will mention because whenever you open a chest you get the wonderful metroid new upgrade sound effect.(That's what it sounds like to me!)-Music sounds great and well done.-Storyline so far is interesting and enjoyed the usage of the Sosarian Runes, which i know from the old Ultima games.. and is similar to Dwarven Runes from Lord of the Rings. All being based off of the Germanic languages. (So far not needed to know during the game, but provided some extra interest.)-Great save point locations so you don't waste too much time from deaths.			"

												Ys Origin is an action RPG, with a hack and slash styled battle system. There are 3 playable characters, the 3rd being unlocked when you clear the game the first time with either of the first two characters. Each character has a very specific playstyle. Gameplay consists of your typical RPG fare: battling monsters while exploring your surroundings. In Ys Origin, you are tasked with exploring a giant tower that extends to the heavens. The tower is broken up into segments, with each segment offering a different environment to do battle in and explore. They are varied enough to where sometimes you forget you are in a tower and are instead traversing a dungeon located elsewhere. At the end of each segment (and sometimes in the middle) you are presented with a boss. The end of each segment is always a screen-filling boss, and these are the most fun parts of the game, each requiring some strategy to defeat. "

The bosses are unforgiving, expecially if you pick the melee character to start with. And I like Dark Souls, I just hate the awful port that is on Steam. Go play it on a Playstation.			"

												""Let me tell you a story of the beginning.....Of Ys""Set 700 years before the events of Ys 1 and 2 we venture to the destroyed world of Ys by an unknown force of demons.Days pass as the remaining survivers atop a floting island that they sent to escape the scorge of demons on the earth known as ""Solomun Shrine"" the 2 Goddesses that watch over the people of Ys Reah and Feena have disappeard along with the source of magic in the world of Ys ""The Black Pearl""A group is dispatched to search for the godesses on the earth but are soon separated by an unknown force that attacked them on the way down from a tower that showed up out of nowhere.Shortly after regrouping the search party begins to climb the mysterious tower in search of their godesses only to find much more afoot the tower that awaits them.Unlike most Ys games where you plays as the title character ""Adol the red"" Ys origin gives us 3 different characters all together to play as.Yunica Tova: A young girl and Dauther of the Captain in Gaurd command that protect the godesses, She wields a small battle axe and is a ""less mobile"" Adol if you are familier with the other games.Hugo Fact: A mage in search of his missing brother and seeks to achieve great power, He wields ""The Eyes of Fact"" making Hugo the first Mage character to be playable in an Ys game as unlike Adol or anyone else he uses projectiles to fight from long range.Toal Fact: Hugo's older brother and was once a commander of the Gaurd for protecting the goddesses, Now a half-demon Toal's Action's seem questionable at first as he as sided with the enemy to achieve great power as well...or does he? (Unlockable only after beating the game once as Yunica or Hugo, Note: His story is the actual cannon to the series)Ys origin uses the same Ys engine that began with Ys VI and later improved in ""Oath in Felghana"" and as its own game and prequel story it holds quite well. Areas are broken to floors as you are climbing up the tower but variety exists as each floor as its own theme (Water, Sand, Fire ect) and its not just going up stairs upwards as they spice of the areas giving you places to explore for goodies and what not. However despite the variety in areas unlike other games in the series Origin is very linear in where you can and can't go to with only a very small bits of Exploring later down the line. There's also not that many Intresting characters to meet as most of them are either from the search party or the Villains of the game limiting the feel of a living world like previous games.Despite those small down parts Ys origin is still fun and challenging game like all other Ys games in the series.One small problem that kind of annoyed me is the Checkpoint systume. unlike the two eariler Ys games using this engine (Ys 6 and Oath in Felghana) if you die in an area/room you will restart from the start of that room and you can go back to a previous area if you are low on HP however Ys origin doesn't do that and instend your only means of checkpoints our the Goddess Statues that let you save the game/buy upgrades.Which means if you died a along ways through an area without getting to the next Statue its all the way back to the previous one, And while you can Teleport back to one at any point to save any progress you made (I.E points or Key story items) you still have to go all the way back to the last point you got to which on later Difficulties can get on your nerves sometimes.But if you've played any Ys game before and tried to beat it on Nightmare mode you should be pretty used to the pain and suffering by now. :P			"

												Okay, let's just get the obvious out of the way right now: The intro to this game is LONG. LOOOOONG. Like, possibly the longest intro to an RPG I've ever played.HOWEVER, once you get past the intro, you're introduced to the meat of the gameplay, and holy hell is it satisfying! The combat in Ys: Origin is fast placed hack n slash that seems mindless at first, but if you just mindlessly spam attacks with no thought, you will die. A lot.In fact, even if you're careful, you will most likely die a lot, because this game is HARD. The normal enemies are usually no trouble, though there are indeed cases where they can chump you if you're not careful, but the real meat of the difficulty lies in the boss battles.If you're at all familiar with the Ys series, than you probably know that one of the series' most lauded aspects is the incredibly designed, incredibly difficult boss fights, and Origin is no exception. You will most likely die to a boss at least once before you learn how to deal with them. And each boss as their own styles, attacks, and strategies, so each boss feels fresh and exciting.Also, did I mention the music? Because HOLY HELL the music is amazing. Quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.All in all, if you're looking for an RPG with fast paced action, an interesting story, amazing bosses, amazing soundtrack, and a difficulty level that constantly keeps you on your toes, then Ys Origin is for you. In fact, give the whole Ys series a try. Its a great series, and Falcom and XSeed are great companies that deserve your support.			"

												Falcom decided to revisit the Darm Tower from the first Ys game (and you even visit it again in Ys IV: Dawn of Ys), so while it's a barebones concept on paper, they actually reinvented the mazelike floors of the Tower wonderfully. For the first time in the series, you can play with different characters (Adol is still in the game, don't worry) and the music proves once again how this series can brag with having one of the finest scores in video game history.Sadly, in order to understand the full story, you have to go through the game with all three characters, which doesn't sound bad at all, but you still go through the same places three times and that can get boring.

												Action-packed, a fine story, lots of great boss battles (AMAZING boss battles!)… this is a hacky-slashy JRPG that has it all. The game might look kind of old, but it’s still pretty and plenty of fun. If you’ve played OiF, then the gameplay will feel quite familiar. There are three (one of them must be unlocked) main characters, each with their own style of fighting. The story takes place before the events of Ys I and II, which fans suggest you play before starting this one. Don’t let that stop you from picking this one up whenever you can though! Show your support! Falcom and XSEED are a match made in heaven. I really hope they continue to bring over games to this side of the pond for a long time to come. Overall, Ys Origin has to be one of the best games I’ve bought on Steam, and I’m really happy to have it in my library.			"

												The Ys series is a long runnning action RPG series from way back in the 1980s. In 2006 a prequel to the first two games in the series was made called ""Ys Origin"" it  allowed you to play as three different characters with three different playstyles and abilities. You got to move around a strategize how you were going to attack your foes with melee or magic spells in nicely done varied areas such as a water and fire sections. The game has some platforming and slight puzzle sections at times too which is a nice change of pace. Falcom here again did a nice OST to listen too while your killing those bosses or even when jumping from area to area or running down hallways killing everything in sight. The story as already mentioned is a prequel telling more of the story established in earlier Ys games and connecting them. It's nice and each character you play as has their own little portion in the plot I really like games that do that. If you are craving some action based JRPGs check out this game for sure you won't regret it! :)			"

												An expansion pack sequel to Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin has much of the same feel of it's predecessor. New enemies and world to explore, but you handle exactly like Adol Christin, wind-powered spinny attack and all. Origin has three campaigns to justify that extra five dollars on the price tag, but they're all the same, with the exception of bosses. With the same puzzles and monsters, I finished Yunica's campaign but only scratched the surface of the other two, dropping them once I felt like I was going through the motions.What bothers me about the Ys series is that I don't think Falcom understand why their game is good. Every single one of their games starts with at least five minutes of cutscenes, with Oath in Felghana clocking in at 15 before you start to slay monsters. Game, I don't need you to tell me to beat up monsters. Legend of Zelda had an old man in a cave saying ""take this sword and♥♥♥♥♥♥off"" and I still saved the world without knowing why or caring. Damningly, around halfway through Yunica's campaign, you get thrown into a supposed-to-lose boss battle, and then your character mopes around for another five minutes of cutscene until your male love interest (no homo) cheers you up and encourages you to keep going. All the while I'm thinking about how much fun I'd be having if I was playing the game. This game needs less talky talky, more stabby stabby.Four out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )			"

												This game serves as my introduction to the world of Y's (pronounced EES). I've been wanting to play a game in this series for a while and I'm so happy I picked this one up. A Diablo-style action RPG, this game is hella fun. I'm several hours into my first playthrough and have really enjoyed it so far. Challenging boss fights, decent level design that rewards you for exploring while providing a decent story. It's all a very solid and polished experience that's worth your time. A lot of games like this have mecahnics that suffer or that are a bit loose. To me, this is a crucial part of enjoying a game's platforming sections. It's very frustrating when you feel like you told your character to jump from the platform they're on to the one on the right only to find that you were pressing every so slightly in an upwards/downwards direction which caused you to miss the platform and fall into the pit. Not so here. I felt like I had good control over the character and rarely if ever made such a mistake that felt all too common even in AAA titles that are top ranked in their class. Overall I really can't find much to fault in this game. To nitpick I'd say the costumes are a bit plain when you're talking to others but this is also refreshing at the same time. It's simple, and practical. I would also say there maybe could have been more variety with the monsters but this doesn't really bother me at all either. It's just a fun game that's knows what it is and has fun being just that. If you like games like this I highly recommend giving it a try.			"

												An incredible action RPG with 3 campains and a hard-rock soundtrack.  Each character has their own story that unfolds at a very pleasing rate, but these characters also go to the same places and almost do the same things.  As far as Ys games go this one is definitely one of the best.  One warning though, it is not the best Ys game to start on if you care about the story.  Gamplay wise this game is less like Ys Seven and more like Ys: The Oath in Felghana (Also on steam).  You have three crystals that you will obtain over time and you can upgrade them to do more stuff and get stronger.  This game also has an upgrade system for your armor, weapons, and resistances.  Music wise the Ys games are second to none, a blaring hard rock soundtrack (Plus remixes from Ys 1 & 2).  On a final note, if you like action RPGs or fantasy games this game here is a must buy.			"

												Ys Origins is a old school JRPG time of game. part of the Ys franchise it is actually a prequel to the other games. Its action packed, the boss fights are hard and has a reasonable good soundtrack being very good at times. I'll add that the story, while being a bit thin, does start to grow on you speacially after you unlock the third playable character and start to play with him.There is also plenty to do and a good replayability value given all the unlocks the game have like arena modes and as I said 3 playable character in the campaign. I recomend it for fans of this type of games as well as someone who enjoys a chalenge.			"

												One of the best action/rpg i have ever played. This is what dark soul inspired itself from, to make their bosses. Ys does not relent, the action is fast and rarely stopping. The music is great and gets you going for hour. the difficulty is present and will challenge you, this particular game is a little more easy than Oath, nothing that putting it on Nightmare cannot fix. The game plays like a rpg in the way of magic, equipment and character development, but everything else play like an action rpg, perharps a bit like zelda too, if he could turn super sayan! This particular one challenge you with multiple playable characters each with their touch and varying stories.-Lost			"

												The Ys series is one of the longest running franchises around. As far as RPGs go, there isn't really another series to compare with this. Ys Book I & II was one of (if not the 1st) action RPGs. And even today, there aren't many other games that do it better. Even though Ys Origin was released many years after I & II, Origin stays true to what make an Ys game, an Ys game. You can always expect brutal boss battles, a compelling story, an absolutely amazing soundtack, enjoyable characters, beautiful visuals, & unforgiving gameplay.I fell in love with this series back in the late 80's on my TGCD. I just about crapped my pants when I heard Ark of Napishtim was being released on PS2 & made it an immediate purchase. Now years later finding a treasure trove of Ys games on Steam... how am I supposed to resist?The Ys series may not get the recognition of the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest franchises(at least not in the US), but it ought to. Being the 1st game in the Ys series(timeline wise), Origin is a great way to be introduced to one of the best RPGs around. I highly recommend it.			"

												It's a satisfying hack and slash game, but keep in mind, this is not a title for the intellectual gamer. I'll start by explaining what I don't like before what I do like. (IMPORTANT - This game is not worth $19.99. Get it when it goes on sale.)The writing is horrible and the game treats you like a baby that can't figure anything out on your own. For example, I entered a zone on the 12th floor that would quickly drain my HP simply by being there, forcing me to leave the area. When the character said that it felt like an evil sound boring into her head, I checked my inventory and saw the silver harmonica given to me by one of the goddesses. I figured ""No brainer right? I just got this thing, so obviously this is the solution."" I go back into the zone and try using the harmonica, but it doesn't work. And not in the context that the character tried using it, but failed. I mean I went to use the item and got the equivalent of Prof. Oak saying ""Now is not the time to use that."" No, you have to call somebody outside of the room, listen to a conversation, and have the character say bluntly that ""Hey, look at this here harmonica. I'll betcha that will solve the problem."" So now, I don't feel like somebody who used reasoning to deduce the solution to a problem. I feel like my hand is being held. (And yes, I know that the harmonica still doesn't technically work even after the conversation, but it still serves the purpose of progressing the game.)And again, the writing is fanfiction levels of god awful. Maybe if the writing were better and didn't look like it was tailored to pre-teens, the story could possibly be decent. But with writing like this, there's no way any adult could enjoy it. ---As for the good things about the game, despite not being the deepest combat system, it's very fast paced and feels extremely satisfying. I've played the game for about 6 hours now and I'm still not tired of the button mashy combat. Enemies spit out tons of resources after being defeated, giving that packrat portion of our minds a constant tickle. My favorite part of the game would have to be the boss fights. Unlike other aspects that treat you like a child, these boss fights are pretty brutal. I'm playing the game on hard mode, and I've had to go through these fights at least 10 or so times before coming away victorious. I love that there's actually room to strategize in these fights. Like a giant centipede that drops poison time bombs from its destroyed body parts. Do you try your best to methodically clear out the bombs, or do you continue assaulting the boss and hope to outlast them? And while you do have the opportunity to go back and grind out some levels to make it easier, these bosses will still command all of your attention.  Overall, I don't believe the game is worth the asking price of $19.99. If the writing were better and if the zones actually had secrets and left more room for exploration, then it would be a no brainer. As it stands, Ys Origin is a fairly straightforward hack and slash that is very good when you're actually playing the game, but suffers when anybody opens their mouth. Again, get it on sale for sure. Around $4.99 is more than acceptable.   "

												Ys Origin plays like a top-down hack-and-slash but can at times be so frantic it feels like a bullet hell. Think Zelda on steroids. An interesting story, awesome gameplay, and very challenging. Well worth the money and made me purchase the other Ys games - which I am also enjoying.You are given the choice of playing as a girl with a big axe or a guy with magic. After you beat the game you can go ahead and replay it with the other character or with a new, 3rd character. Playing it with the girl or guy you're first given feels generally the same, although you obviously have an entirely different set of skills. All three characters pretty much trek through the exact same dungeon layout but the 3rd character you unlock fights a set of new bosses and has an entirely different story. Playing on higher difficulties actually changes things besides HP and damage - although the story stays the same.One downside is that I feel that the leveling was pretty tedius. You will find yourself in positions where you need to grind out 5 levels because it is literally impossible to beat a boss if you don't have the damage output. This only takes maybe 10-15 minutes before each boss but later in the game I remember having to spend an entire hour just beating up 1,000 grunts.Defintely one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while.

												Ys Origin is one of the best games I've ever played.It has the perfect balance between story, music and gameplay.  The combat is simple to learn but hard to master if you want to tackle higher difficulties or venture into Arena or Time Attack mode.  You'll probably want to use a controller.  The story in this game is simply one of the most perfectly paced and emotionally driven games I've had the pleasure of playing.  This game completely blows every other Ys game out of the water (Take that, Adol!).  If you're a Ys fan, or any sort of JRPG fan, or even an anime fan, this game was made for you.With every track of music that is perfectly tuned for each area to match the locale, to the incredibly deep characters that have their own personal motivations and feelings, this game will blow your socks off and keep you guessing about some of the characters until the very end.  This is what game design should be about.  Graphics don't matter, they don't have to cost millions of dollars, they just need a little bit of love.Praise the Goddesses.			"

												i gotta say... who the frick hands you a reraise item as they themselve is on deaths door?!.. ok the game has a story an its kinda dumb, some ppl wanna like bring down a floating island or something an things are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the planet cuz monsters an junk theirs this orb pearl thing thats important or w/e... main point is i didnt listen really to the story all that much mainly cuz it didnt really care. that being said... this game is by far one of the best times i've had with an action rpg ever hands down its a 9/10 in my eyes due 100% to its battle system an attention to detail. the passive items you get are really neat too since they come into play without the game spelling it out for you, the game makes you think ""hey maybe if i used this item that thing would *blank*"" its really nice to have a feeling that i figuered it out an i wasnt told i needed to use an item. all in all if you like grinding that feels rewarding, a battle system that is fair an action packed, really cheesy bad yet loveable wrighting then this game is for you. i had tons of fun with this game an now totally a fan an will be getting some of the other Y's titles... but i gotta say it...

												I had always heard people call this series an RPG series, so I never paid it much mind until recently. I was browsing random things on Steam and discovered to my surprise that this is actually sort of an action/brawler game with only light RPG elements and a bit of Metroidvania-ness to the map layout. It's really quite fun. There are three different playable characters, and not only do they have different stories but they actually play quite differently from one another too. The music is catchy as well.			"

												It's a very linear game and the plot is pretty unoriginal, but executed well enough to make me feel emotionally invested in the later boss battles.  Each level is a 3D puzzle platformer full of hacking and slashing.  Many of the later boss battles become like shoot-em-up/bullet hell games, except that you A: fight melee (if you choose the melee character, which I did), and B: can jump over the bullets.  Each boss requires a nuanced combination of strategies.The RPG elements are pretty minimal, and the XP system is such that you can't grind ahead of the area's level, but you always catch up the area's level before you reach the boss, even if you try to avoid enemies.  IMO that's a pretty good thing, since it means that there is nothing to distract you from the meat of the gameplay.  (It is vital that you find all of the hidden items, though, at least on hard mode).Also, while the environments are kinda simple, some of the shader effects look pretty good, the character portrait and sprite art are beautiful, and special effects for character and boss attacks are completely ridiculous (but totally interactive and quite sophisticated; pretty much no scripted execution nonsense).Oh, and I forgot to mention that the music is fantastic.  I still regularly listen to the soundtrack.			"

												This one is for those thirsty for quality JRPG action! A very well designed game both in graphics and sound. Not the most thrilling of plots but very well written, nevertheless. Enough to keep you engaged for some playthroughs. Superb gameplay, with hack 'n slash elements and innovative spellcasting. A good variety of enemies in general and bosses only increase this game's worth, and they'll surely make you stay on your toes more than you think you would!I think it could be way better if the stories of the three playable characters were intertwined. At some points, there are events in which it would be more satisfying if another character was focused instead of the one you're playing with.Because of all that, I'd give Ys Origin a 9/10. :D			"

												Really fun JRPG platformer. Enemies are pretty easy and bring in the fun of reigning destruction, and just as you get bored of it, they bring in a very difficult bossfight that you won't beat on the first try on normal or higher. Controls can be awkward, so it might be better on a controller. Also the music rocks too.			"

												I did not expect the game to be as good as it is, sure, the intro sequence is a bit long in the absolute beginning of the game, but after that you have very little that is dragged out at all in the game, story is decent with good characters(At least the one I've played) and combat is pretty fun.Also, something that is a selling point for me personally, it isn't as heavy on the stats-department as other RPGs, IE you do not need to level up individual stats or numbercrunch with a calculator, you just get better stuff, that's it. Also lastly, experience gain scales with how high level you are, so catching up to an area in levels isn't too hard, usually requires just going in and out of a room and mopping up the enemies while having the double EXP bonus going.

												Ys Origin is a good game. It's worth every bit of money I spent on it. But it's not perfect. There are some flaws with the game that prevents the game from being great.1) The story-If you've already played Ys back in the golden age of the Super Famicom, you'll probably appreciate the story in this prequel. But if you never played them, chances are you'll be disappointed with the story. It's very cliche and predictable. Even worse is the story for each characters. Long story short, each of them aren't parallel with each other.2) The difficulty-Hard games are good and welcomed but the difficulty in Ys Origin is borderline cheap and unfair. Basically, the higher difficulty means enemies have more health, takes less damage and deals more damage to you. It pretty much boils down to grinding enough levels by killing the same enemies over and over again, just to inflict damage more than 1 to the enemy. That, and finding power-up item to strengthen your weapon because if not, the later stages becomes nearly impossible. Unless you're a masochist or have a lot of free time, just play it on normal or easy.3) The gameplay-It's fun enough for a few hours, especially after getting all abilities but it get pretty old as you play. Equipment, stats, abilities, items, etc are all streamlined and simplified. You'll be begging for more complexity the more you play. Almost no exploration or secret locations to discover, a few unneeded platforming and a non-existent puzzles to solve.  I'm giving this a thumbs up simply because it succeeded in giving me a brief moment of enjoyment.RECOMMENDED        : For Ys fans. If not, buy this during a sale.NOT RECOMMENDED: Player who seeks more complexity than slash-fest J Action RPG			"

If you grew up on the Ys games, the nostalgia factor alone makes this worth playing.

												If you''re looking for a fun and addicting action rpg look no further. Ys Origin and a light hearthed but still serious story, an amazing soundtrack and offers great replayability with 3 playable characters (one you have to unlock). Each character has their own story and offers different conversation while playing through the game which keeps things interesting. It''s not a long game but with the three characters you''ll easily get 30+ hours out of the game not counting time attack and bosh rush modes. If you''re looking for a jrpg which is actually good and not boring don''t look any further you''ve found it.			"

Tip though, if you're like me and use mouse and keyboard, remember to configure it before you start playing.The game also has a very good difficulty settings, and due to the 3 characters you can play, a good replay value.

												Decent game, not a very worthy addition to the Ys Series as a whole though... The back story on Ys was something I never cared about and this game didn't really do a good attempt at making me care now... so yeeeeeah. I'd reccommend it to both casual and masochistic gamers just for the solid gameplay alone.The difficulty is quite insane and requires hours of training if you intend to complete it on Nightmare mode. Unfortunately completing the game on the hardest setting is the only way to get the full experience and unlock all the extra goodies like alternate costumes / characters and most of the achievements.It's quite tedious if you intend to experience the entire story as there are three playable characters and the final and true story arc doesn't unlock until you complete the game with the first two characters... not to mention if you're one of those loliconners you unlock a school girl outfit for the main by completing the game an additional THREE times after the initial three playthroughs... it's kind of unreal... I mean just go download some porn, it's faster and healthier.I'd stick to easy mode and experience the paltry story just to say you've ""Been there and done that"" if you're a casual Ys fan... Easy = Fun, Nightmare = NONE. Keep that credo in mind if you decide to purchase it.			"

												Many have dismissed Ys Origin as a cheap cash in game, a place holder between other, more successful games. Yet I'm not one of those; sure, it's basically Ys I&II: The Before Years, but that's EXACTLY why I enjoy the game. Ys as a series has been sorely lacking in back story; many key events in the past have been teased by Falcom, yet we've never seen them. Ys Origin, thankfully, does the job of offering us SOME insight to the history of the flying island, several bosses/main villains of Ys I&II and, finally, the reason why the Goddesses of Ys lost their wings.Even though Oath of Felghana and even Ark of Napishtim are better in certain aspects, Origin IS NOT in any way truly inferior to them. It has the same great engine and game play of the others, and despite, or perhaps maybe in spite of the fact that it's all contained within Darm Tower, Ys Origin earns its place in my heart for giving me precious back story that's been so scarce.Oh, and Adol is unlockable.

Although playable with a mouse and keyboard, a controller is highly recommended for the best play experience. Fast paced combat and tough bosses make for a very satisfying game. Make sure to beat the game with one of the initial characters in order to unlock the best charcter with the ending that is considered canon to the story!			"

												This is a game I really want to like, but it's just too flawed. The bosses I played were very creative and possibly some of the best I've seen in a game of this genre. So why don't I recommend it? First off, unskippable, long, unnecessary intro. Supposedly you can skip it if you've beaten the game - still not acceptable. The next major beef is the bizarre leveling system. One character level can mean the difference between unbeatable boss and wow, that boss was easy peasy. Finally, the boss and area that made me pretty much quit early was the Construct. Cool boss design, but I'd like to damage him successfully. The fight is pretty much you play for like 2-3 minutes to be able to take off a tenth of his health bar. It's an easy fight, but the patterns are so predictable that it just feels like a massive waste of time. The next area, I don't know what happened. Maybe I shouldn't have been able to beat that boss, but the standard enemies just became massive damage sponges. Went from dealing like 40-60 damage per hit to 2-7. Just completely unfun. It could have been a great game, but balance issues run amok it seems.			"

												Ys isn't as bad as the first few hours make it seem.  There's enough about it that's bad enough to give it a thumbs down, but it's definitely done some things pretty well.  This review lists major points concisely with more detailed explanations at the bottom.Here are the flaws I've seen so far:-Character and item upgrade systems are pathetically bad.-Uninspired levels.-The 'puzzles' involve finding an item and backtracking to use it.  -Framerate issues with some graphical effects.-Controls need autofire and autocharge.  Other control problems may be specific to me.-Too many rpg text dialogs that can't be skipped.  -The difficulty curve isn't right.  -The rate of levelling needs adjusting, and the effect of gaining levels is not done well.  It increases damage done and decreases damage taken, altering boss fight difficulty too much.Game's strong points:+The bosses are very challenging with fully-avoidable attacks+The action is fast-paced.  +The graphics are colorful, and I like the graphical style of the characters.Regarding difficulty,On Hard difficulty with the magic user, the monsters are a joke, unable to threaten the player.  The bosses are very challenging.  On nightmare difficulty with the melee character, the (skippable) trash monsters are about right, but the bosses are extremely challenging.  There is at least 1 boss fight that cannot be won without grinding due to its being a dps race.  It is not obvious that grinding is the intended (and only) way to win the encounter.  Grinding 5 levels for that fight also reduced the boss's attacks from 40 dmg/hit to 9 dmg/hit.  I do not know how hard those bosses are supposed to hit, and I suspect the developers don't either.  Without grinding, nightmare bosses can take 1-10 hours to beat, including the time to learn their moves.Unskippable dialogsare ubiquitous and boring.  Even if I were interested in reading the story of a hero who rescues princesses and saves the world, my replays through the game would not be.The intro cinematic is well done, but it can't be skipped either.  It takes at least 15 minutes to start a new game due to the unskippable cut scenes and dialog.The controlsdesperately need an autofire button and a way to hold down the magic charge button.  Using outside configuration utilities creates some problems in the game such as menus opening and closing due to autofire.  Holding down the magic charge button while imtermittently holding down the attack button and periodically jumping has led to some hand soreness.  Without autofire, the repetitive button presses will cause a lot of repetitive stress.Even after some configuration, there are still occaisional phantom axis motions, and recharging magic immediately after casting makes it cast twice.

												I will be reviewing this game in stages as I play it.My expectations are, from reading reviews, a game with a good story.So I chose my character, and pressed start. Actually getting to gameplay took almost 11 minutes of unskippable-cutscenes and dialouge (with me jamming through skippable dialouge). One of my biggest criteria for a game is how long it takes me to be able to PLAY the game. This can be mitigated by interesting presentation. Ys Origin does not have interesting presentation.7 minutes til you can start pressing a button. 7 minutes to get past ""So there was a paradise named Ys. Then demons showed up. Twin goddesses lifted their city into the sky. Demons made a tower to get at them. Then the goddesses left. You're a member of the team to track them down in the tower."" Then you spend 4 more minutes scrolling through ""Where am I? I better go to the tower"". Finally, after ANOTHER cutscene showcasing the Barad-Dur rip-off, you get to the tower and start fighting the monsters. But this is broken up by lots of clumsy tutorializing. Skip ahead a few more minutes and you get actual control. So if you want to start a new game, expect close to 20 minutes before you get to play the game. Great. Excellent pacing. I'm sure there's other games out there that aren't there to pad their length out artificially.So far other reviewers have let me down. This isn't an interesting story, this is a PREMISE. The characters are anime archetypes. One is an apprentice fighter girl (despite the long♥♥♥♥♥intro saying they're sending their ELITES) and an brusque, impatient mage. The gameplay feels like a solid PS1 era dungeon crawler. Feels a bit primitive but functional. The pacing is utterly awful. If you have lots of time on your hands, you might like this.More to come as I play a little more.			"

												The mouse cursor is way too fast and it doesn't let you adjust it in-game. I don't want to have to adjust cursor speed everytime I play the game or use a third party program. I'm using dual monitors and if the mouse accidentally reaches into the other monitor and I click down on it it'll switch windows so I'll lose health to enemies while I'm trying to tab back into the game. There's no way to make the game full screen so that doesn't happen and I don't want to have to disable my second monitor just to play this game. I only played it for about 6-7 minutes and was too frustrated with lack of options to control these problems. Also, there's like a 15 minute intro that you can't skip. No thanks. If I could use a controller instead then the game would probably run a lot smoother.			"

												This game had potential. I have played the others in this series. However Steam is selling a broken version. As to how they managed to crash a duel GTX titan I7 rig is beyond me. After looking through the files a bit (not an expert) I found nothing unusual. How ever when I launch the game the FPS jumps to 1000 or so (not possible?) then into negatives and then the screen turns all funky colors and freezes. My usual Insticnt is to remove cartridge and blow into it, but as you know thats not possible here. Im very dissapointed with steam support for not allowing a refund even though i have than 32 seconds gameplay and I purchased it 3 hours ago. I am warning you all now. DO NOT waste your money.			"

												I don't know, I played the first 2 hours, and I can't find something good about this game, well the character models look really cool and the graphics are something different. And here are some negative things:- story is unfolding really slow- the game is repetitive, the battle system looks really simple in the first 2 hours I played, you use your shield and button mash (played this magic guy)- the main character acts like a total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he thinks he is smart, then there is this mysterious thing about him and you know already you have to play 5 hours to get at least 1 useful information out of him (main character: ""you want to know this secret? well, forget about it..."" other people: ""excuse me I even asked, my fault, well let's continue our journey :3"")- backtracking if you chose a wrong path, so... if you are not lucky to find the wrong way first (to get secrets!) you have to backtrack alotI can't recommend this game, the negatives are just 2 heavy for me :(			"

												On the pluss side:+ This game had a smooth and nice gameplay and from time to time I really did enjoy it.On the other hand the negative list is far to long for me to give it a thumbs up. The negative is:- The controlls when using a controller was incorrect since it displayed the keys for the keyboard- I thought no game could beat Half-life intro in boringness and length, I was wrong.- Because of the boring intro, I lost intrest in the story and all the story elements was just lost on me.- The grafics was kind of bad, both in the cutscenes and in the game. The fact that I am stuck with the resolution 800*600 makes matters even worse.So if you play with a keyboard, like stories that takes ages to even let you play and like this retro style with mixed 2d and 3d modells, this might be the game for you. This is not the case for me so I am going to uninstall in about 2 seconds.			"

												I am really amused how much good reviews this game got on steam. Most likely game is overrated because of nostalgia.pros:- Great platformer- Story- Soundtrack (for those who like such music)cons: - not an RPG at all (by modern standarts)- unskippable video: long and predictable hence boring- uninspired level design, too repetitive- Spam attack button to win on hard difficulty.- Spam attack button to win on nightmare difficulty.*** for those who are going to argue about difficulty, yes, bosses may be tough, everything else - just spam attack button.gameply:1. Watch unskippable anime (or just minimize the game and do something fun)2. Spam action button to skip tons of text (or read it if you haven't played any RPG video games in your life)3. move your character for a few seconds4. spam action button to skip text (or read it)5. spam action button to defeat your enemies6. spam action button to skip text7. move your character and spam attack (which is the same as ""action"") button8. repeatconclusion:It is very easy to like this game: Solution #1you need a few things:- love anime in general- remember original game - have nostalgiaSolution #2You haven't played any RPG games before, or played only jRPG games.Solution #3You just like easy-going pace of this ... well ... combination of non-interactive story and attack button simulator.

It's filled with unskippable cutscenes, some of which aren't really necessary, and an unbelievably slow to start story. I can just see that this game will end up being 90% cutscenes and dialoge instead of combat.. So it doesn't really reflect what the trailers and screenshots show. I got this in a humlbe bundle and..

												If you're looking for a game that you just can go to play... forget this. Now. First hour is watching quite boring animations and story and it's really slow paced. Nothing like the trailers. On the other hand if you're looking an adventure game with over 9000 thousands of animation and around 16 minutes of gameplay, yay.After more hours. I keep it in there. Gameplay is good. Bosses are interesting and some fairly hard. But there's too much stopping ""story cutscenes"" that you can't even skip.  Those are a no go in modern gaming (or in any gaming in my opinion).Playing this to unlock all the achievements is painful.			"

												Ys Origin (and the Ys series for that matter) is an odd combination of RPG/Platform/Puzzler but that doesn't stop it from being a surprisingly enjoyable game.The RPG elements are light, with upgradable equipment, attack choices and bonuses to pick up from defeated monsters in a arcade style way of handling temporary buffs. Story-line wise, there's nothing ground breaking here with some 'world is ending, must save it' fayre but the dialogue between characters is strong and there's just enough intrigue implied throughout to make you want know what's going to happen next.On the downside, some may find the combat element repetitive but it is fast paced and the dearth of creatures with their different attack patterns should keep things interesting. Boss battles on the other hand are a different kettle of fish, bold and brash with more than a nod to old school 90's boss fights they are tricky and engaging, providing you with a real sense of achievement when you finally succeed in downing the overseer blocking your path.Graphically it's not going to win any awards, lets be honest, it's functional but plenty of set pieces (normally coupled in with the boss fights mentioned above) provide the highlights in what is an average looking game. However the art style has it's own unique character which has been maintained since the original release of Ys, which is charming and beautiful all the way through.This is a solid game, plenty to keep you occupied and with a meaty enough story for each of the playable characters to deserve a playthrough, which is all well and good as if you're out hunting achievements, multiple playthroughs await you. Give it a look, especially if it's on sale, you'll be glad you did.			"

												So I know I haven't gotten very far into this, but I will say this: If you are a fan of old school hack and slash games like Illusion of Gaia, or Terraigma or even the other games in the Y's series I'd say pick this up. It's simple, fluid controls make combat a breeze, the light RPG elements and combos are fun and the story it self actually holds up pretty well and surprised me at the production values and what I saw! I mean this is not multi-million dollar production, but it does have cut scenes, like-able characters and even some psuedo anime/cg thrown in for good measures. It reminds me of those games of yesterday and I have to say I enjoy it's simplicity and fun combat. A good pick up and play for an hour or two at a time.			"

												Ys Origin is a fast-paced hack and slash rpg, there is no staying behind and preparing your mana... Thats probably the same as giving away openings to your enemies in this game.I love these kinds of games, and cannot wait for them to release it for the PS Vita! Ys Oath in Felghana runs on the same engine it appears, but if you want another Ys game but a little bit different, pick up Ys Seven, it's awesome.Played this game for 40 minutes, and im already lovin' it! Haven't faced a boss yet, but im guessing it's very much like Oath in Felghana; learn the moves and dogde them, look for openings, and try not to take any damage (make sure you are at the appropriate level for the boss fight!).Don't worry about being bored grinding up levels, it's not all that boring, it's quite addictive if you enjoy this kind of gameplay. the more hits, the bigger the combo, the more XP you earn, and this is very fast-paced!There's loot to pick up, items and armor to find, checkpoints to activate, and magical objects to obtain that gives you special skills! I've played through Ys Seven on my PS Vita, and it took more than 20 hours to complete!Ys Origin is an addictive and fun game that you should check out on youtube. If it strikes your fancy, i recommend you pick it up!			"

												I never played Ys Origin before until I take it on Steam. I'm a big fan of the Ys serie. Whatever is the console I never miss the chance to buy one of these games. Ys Origin is one of best of the serie. Ys games are one of best in the genre hack&slash platformer.  You don't play these games for graphics or story but for the gameplay.  All of rest (graphic, soundtrack, story) is bonus.I first played with Yunica because she is the one who seem more as Adol Christin. But I'll surely replay with the 2 others characters because it's too fun and good.			"

												""Ys Origin is a Japanese action role-playing game developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows in 2006."" (Wikipedia, November 2013)I've played this RPG for 45 hours on the hardest of the 5 difficulties (nightmare, hard, normal, easy, very easy) with ""Hugo"" (1 of 3 characters) and completed it by level 52. I found the story to be a run-of-the-mill ""good guy wants power, turns evil temporarily, and repents through the power of friendship/love"". I'm generally not the type of guy to delve into, and enjoy, the story of a game very much anyways, so I didn't mind it. In fact, considering that I look for ""great gameplay"" in games, and what type of gameplay I'll tend to go for, I would practically expect a story to be ""the usual"" in a game (not to say I haven't enjoyed original stories). I don't know how the story goes with the other 2 characters, since I haven't played them yet.This game, played with a top-down camera angle, plays kinda like a shooter when Hugo is the chosen character, as his attacks revolve around shooting magic missiles straight ahead of him. After a quick test run, the other 2 characters appear to revolve around close-range melee combat. On the hardest difficulty level, the bosses offer such a challenge that you'll find yourself grinding a lot, just to gain that extra level or two and be able to defeat the boss at all (and even then, your battle strategy better be near perfect). This game has some simple puzzle-solving, if you can even call it that. You'll find yourself having to press buttons, defeat certain enemies, obtain and use items/skills, and so on. I did enjoy the challenging gameplay, but it would get frustrating at times with bosses, and also 1 time with a certain enemy that can practically insta-kill you (but that you'll still have to deal with). The only thing to do there is keep looking around for equipment and the like, and grind in special spots to gain levels.If you want to know how nice the graphics look, just ""You-Google-Tube"" some gameplay footage on the game. And while you're at it, check out the soundtrack for it as well. It's pretty awesome. As of this post, the game is normally $19.99 USD on Steam and I'd say it's worth the price if you love to spend many hours on a challenging ""battle-grind"" RPG. If it turns-out that you love the game, then you may also love ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", which follows a similar gaming style. You may want to avoid Ys I & II though, which has your main attack revolve around ramming into enemies (like in Hydlide), which ruins any sense of ""gameplay"" (at least in my opinion).			"

Its not just 3 characters doing the exact same things, they all have very different gameplay styles, different boss battles, and different storylines, significantly changed.Boss battles are hard as nails (esp on nightmare), and have innovative mechanics are much more exciting than just ""mash your attack button at the boss"". Magic must be used strategically, and every magic ability has a use.			"

												OI, completely forgot to recommend this game.It's a bit easier than Ys Oath in Felghana, and it has more characters to choose from instead of just Adol, which means more replayability, but a single playthrough of Felghana is longer than a single playthrough of Origins. At least, was so in my case, even if I had to actually grind a bit in Oath.It's just awesome and you should play it. Such a satisfying game, with awesome bosses to beat up. The only flaw is that some characters lack ways to efficiently deal with some monsters, but it's kinda obvious..Is da orkiest stuffz dere is in dis 'ere game - ya hav' da Weirdboy wif gut dakka, gerl wif gitty hat an'♥♥♥♥♥♥ an' da orky Kommando only choppin' and choppin'.

												Even though Ys Origin is now a relatively old game (it was first released by the end of 2006), it still has plenty to offer to RPG fans:   - Beautiful graphics, both in-game and cutscenes   - Simple and intuitive graphic user interface   - Very fun, rewarding, fast-paced action that hardly gets old   - Challenging bosses that will make you rethink your playing strategy   - Not one, nor two... but three different game stories that seemly complement each otherDefinitely a great introduction to the Ys series and great improvement from the previously released title, The Oath in Felghana, except maybe in the soundtrack which in my humble opinion lacked that trilling component that made me want to carry on shredding monsters just to keep hearing the track. However, this is more than compensated by the deeply intriguing game stories; more than once I found myself playing an extra hour just to find out what was going to happen next.Overall, even if you're one of those players that rush through games (which I highly discourage with this one), Ys Origin is guaranteed to give you a good 30+ hours of gameplay any noteworthy action RPG should.

Do not attempt to play this without a controller. This game is seriously like Secret of Mana free attack on Crack. RPG + Free attack + special moves/spells/ etc. You WILL like this game. Oh and the bosses? Have you ever played Blaster Master? Yeah.. That size. But this time you cant hit pause and infinite grenade attack them. You will be challenged. You will die even on normal.			"

												The Ys series is, from what I recall, one of the big names in the Action RPG circuit, and Ys Origin changes the original formula of the first game (Ys 1 and 2, technically the second being an extension of the first rather than a separate game) by making it more actiony than RPG-y if that makes even the slightest bit of sense (it doesn't).That being said, this is still a rather fun game to play. The story's nothing to cry home about, but it's engaging enough to make you want to learn more about characters. Basically an okay plot, points for that.Gameplay is fantastic; three unique characters that each get their own special abilities and varied fighting styles, as well as boss battles that are tailored to their story rather than set bosses (though set bosses still appear). Again, more actiony than RPG-y, but it makes it fun.The music helps carry the game, since it almost obviously coined the term ""rpg combat music"". It is literally as generic fantasy-rock as you can get. I swear this is how a music company got its start. The music still helps the game move along.Overall a rather fun game to play, and one of the few I've played multiple times just to see everything. The other Ys games are about as good, so if you have money to burn, this is worth it, but definitely get it on sale if you can.			"

												It's a really fun hack-and-slash with a rockin' soundtrack and epic boss fights. Fair warning: You must play through the game at least two times (finish with one of two characters which unlocks the third character) to get the true ending that wraps up the story of the game and makes it the prequel to the rest of the Ys series that it is.

The option to play as one of three characters, each of whom have a different story and a completely different playstyle, is pretty neat.  Fun and highly recommended to people who like this sort of thing, but I've got one complaint:  no matter which character you choose, you have to go through the same huge tower and fight the same monsters (for the most part).  I wish Origin would have had a different scenario for each character or a shorter shared campaign.			"

												Fantasic game. It's an excellent prequel to Ys 1&2. It does a great job leading into the other games in the series if you've never played them, and ties up all the loose ends if you have played them. All difficulty levels pose some level of challenge, even on the easiest setting, which keeps with the Ys tradition of hair-pulling moments. This game really appeals to me as an avid Ys enthusiast because of all the refernces to Ys 1&2 that aren't story related. Obviously, as a prequel, many story elements have a lot to do with the events of other games, but it's the more subtle references that I enjoy. I especially liked the fact that most of the bosses are from the original games, but the fights are different. I get to see the familiar names and remember my experiences from the original games but have unique and refreshing fights with them. Also, the rendition of ""Termination"" in this game is completely kickass.			"

												Grindy, storyless, extremely simple combat, single dungeon RPG. If you're looking for an RPG with a focus on boss battles that doesn't take 50 hours to run though, this a good choice. There's a bit of exploration but the goal is always clear: up. You can breeze through the game up until the bosses, at which point you have to spend some time grinding up to the proper level. No real loot, combat tactics, overworld, shops, or side quests to worry about. It's a real shut off your brain game, which is why I come to Ys.			"

Graphisms and artwork are great, the ost is good (some music like the boss theme for exemple are epic !), the storyline... well he's average for Yunica and Hugo but a bit more interesting for the secret character we can play once we finish the game for the first time (That tempts to play, doesn't it ?). As usual, there are 5 difficulty modes (Very easy until nightmare) and I find this opus a little easier than ""The Oath in Felghana"". The game (only 1 storyline) in ""normal"" difficulty ends in 12-13 hours but if you want to do the game at 100%, Ys Origin will occupy you approximately 50-60 hours. He's not expensive, then buy it now ! :)			"

												Grindy, storyless, extremely simple combat, single dungeon RPG. If you're looking for an RPG with a focus on boss battles that doesn't take 50 hours to run though, this a good choice. There's a bit of exploration but the goal is always clear: up. You can breeze through the game up until the bosses, at which point you have to spend some time grinding up to the proper level. No real loot, combat tactics, overworld, shops, or side quests to worry about. It's a real shut off your brain game, which is why I come to Ys.			"

												It's a pretty decent hack'n'slash ARPG, if that's all you're looking for, but it doesn't particularly stand out unless you're there for the Ys part of it. The combat is solid but doesn't have a ton of depth. The characters are likable but don't have a ton of depth. The story is your standard ""bad guys did something bad; now the good guys better do something about it"" fare, so it won't carry anything on its own (not to mention it only shows up for a few minutes of exposition every hour or so). It would be a fairly satisfying little timekiller that doesn't really stand out in any way except for one thing: a lot of the unlocks feel like they're on a free-to-play schedule in a non-free-to-play game.The higher tier upgrades in the story mode take an absurd amount of grinding to pay for. Can't beat a boss? Grind some levels, because a single level's worth of stats will make an enormous difference in the damage you deal/take. Two levels will change a fight from brutally hard to a pushover (although that's more ""return of the 90s"" than ""when free-to-play games attack""). There are a bunch of bonus game modes you can unlock and extra characters and alternate character versions with different attacks and all sorts of stuff like that, but they require beating the entire story mode so many times (and weirdly, most of the achievement requirements are also ""beat the game multiple times"") that I'm guessing at least 90% of people will never even see things like arena mode. I know I certainly won't, even though I'd try it out if it were available immediately after having beaten the game the first time. It makes Korean MMOs look like they're concerned that you don't get outside enough.Aside from that, it's fun enough, but I'd mostly only recommend it to people who want more backstory to the Ys games.

												Ys Origin is a classic Japanese RPG, with old school graphics, but which have their charm; and musics are very cool. Kinematics are made with illustrations in a manga style, allowing to tell the general story of why we are there and why it is like that. As usual in every good Japanese RPG, we have a cool bad guy, with long and brilliant hair, which wants to control the world of Ys for a random reason, and which has some underlings in order to stand in your way.The game takes place completely in a tower, we climb gradually its levels, by exploring every floor, collecting what we find as equipment and killing everything we can, jumping from time to time on platforms to move forward. At the end of every level, we have a boss to explode. There are 6 levels, each one has around 3 floors, and every level has its universe (fire, water, sand…). Yes because there are completely aquatic floors. In a tower. And above, there is a lava world. And also a forest. Yes. In a tower. A TOWER. :DAs a consequence, we adapt our fighting techniques to every level. For example thunder is very effective on the aquatic monsters, whereas fire will be effective against plants. Hello, Pokemon players!There are several difficulties, it goes from Very Easy to Nightmare. YS Origin will take about ten hours to finish with a first character.About characters, we have the choice between a knight girl and a magician boy. The first is a specialist of hand to hand fights, with special techniques in short and medium-range, the other one is a specialist of remote fight. Besides the difference of gameplay, every character has its own nature and background. This will influence a bit the global scenario, but the final goal won’t change: prevent the bad guy with nice hair from destroying the world. In other words. So big potential of replaying, in spite of the repetitive aspect of the game, especially because a third character is unlocked in the end of the game, as well as the bonus games like Time Attack mode or Arena, to kill a lot of monsters in a limited time.Conclusion: a good RPG as Japaneses know how to make it, with a manga universe both in graphics and musics. The gameplay brings nothing innovative but is very pleasant. Can be rather repetitive in the long run.			"

												While the story isn't really that long and unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, I think you can finish the game in around 8 - 12 hours. There are 3 characters, each with a different story. All three characters have different skills and this allows you to use different tactics for the same boss. Grinding isn't really needed as by the time you get to the final boss you should have the minimum requirement to beat the boss. Overall it is a fun and fast paced ARPG. Just don't play through all 3 characters' story in one shot like I did, it is quite tiring~ XD			"

												This game was sent to me by a wonderful friend of mine and let me tell you that this is a game that is worth buying.  Now yes I recommended that you try Oath of Felgana just to test the waters but this game is for those who want to know the backstory behind it all.  Despite it being set in the Tower of Solomon, it has plenty of replayability and each character has their own speed and attack power so choose carefully and go for it.  There will be times where you'll need to consult an FAQ to track your progress because backtracking is involved and you'll be doing a lot of that to move forward.  Is it worth trying out for yourself? Well, you be the judge and find out.			"

The boss battles are downright cruel and the environment is challenging enough to annoy you, but the smooth, responsive and easy to setup controls, compensated for the difficulties. The backstories are interesting. When you finish the game for the first time, it will unlock the third character, do another playthrough with this character to reveal the whole storyline, it's worth it.			"

												The more I immerse myself in the Ys series, the more enamored I become.  This is one solid little franchise.  There are so many things that Falcom does right in caring for this classic property, and I have high hopes for future Ys games I will be playing.  This is yet another perfect little charming gem of an action RPG.  It mixes 2D sprite animation and seamless 3D architecture to create a style both retro and timeless.  The care and attention payed to the characters, story, music, and ys heritage is truly admirable.Design wise, this game is a typical dungeon crawl, but the challenge is quite thrilling during boss fights.  The exploration aspect can get a bit tedious if you play through the game multiple times in quick succession, but I imagine this can be offset by tweaking difficulty levels to your liking. On that note, the story of Ys Origin plays out with a Roshamon style redundancy; with three individual character's story-lines.  Much of the joy of this game comes from experiencing the events of the narrative from these different perspectives.  Granted, there are slight differences in each Character's narrative, with only one (Claw's) considered 'cannon', but walking through the game in each of their shoes lets you become much more familiar with the characters and the world in which they live.  I can't imagine having only played through this game with a single character, and I found each separate run interesting and challenging due to the different play mechanics.  It's a faithful loveletter to the Lore Falcom has developed for Ys over the last several decades.  The characters, the settings, and even the music is heavily inspired by past games in the franchise.  Now at the time of this writing, I had managed to play the steam releases of Ys 1&2, as well as Oath in Felghana (remake of ys 3).  These games stand perfectly fine on their own story wise, and it is absolutely unnecessary for anyone to have any prior knowledge of the franchise to get your money's worth.  That being said, each entry also helps to paint a beautifully detailed picture of a larger whole.  Falcom seem quite devoted to the world they've created, and the relationship between games is actually quite nuanced.  I'm so very glad I played through this, and I encourage everyone to take it for a spin.  If you're only interested in a charming hack 'n slash romp, by all means coast through it.  If you're at all interested in the story of Ys, I very much encourage you to experience each story line.  On the lower difficulties, each play through should take about 8 hours.  I, myself, played the first round on normal, then coasted through the next two on easier settings for a total playtime of 26 hours.			"

												This game turned out to be a real diamond in the rough for me. Bought it years ago cheap in some sale. And thought i would play it just because it's in my library. Turned out this game is awesome!It's an action RPG, hack 'n' slash style. Combat is very fluid and responsive and more importantly fun. The story in the game is also very good, although it develops along slowly, so it wont rope you in that fast. But once it gets it's hooks in you it's too late. This is the first Ys game i bought and after completing it i had to buy Ys I & II Chronicles+, i want to know how the story continues, and i will get the other games aswell.The game is unique in that you have to play the game through 3 times to get the full story. There are 3 characters to play. Yunica, Hugo and Toal. Toal can only be played after you have completed the game with Yunica and Hugo, and rightfuly so as Toals playthrough contains the most story with couple plot twists even.This game also has a very high replayability. It wont get boring to play through it several times. And after you beat the game there is also time attack mode, boss rush and arena where you can compete for leaderboards. In arena you also get points you can use in a bonus shop to buy alternative characters to play through the story with.Big time bang for your buck!On story page it says this game has partial controller support. I played through it with controller, also tried keyboard both works fine, i just liked controler better. Even if all tutorial popups show keyboard keybinds.			"

												I'm doing an Ys marathon, except for Celceta which I have yet to get and 7 which I'm still playing, this is my favorite gameplay wise. The story's ok and explains Ys' history well before the events of 1 and 2. While Yunica's story is ok and Hugo's was intruiging, The Claw's ending is the only one that's canon. Gameplay wise you get 3 different playstyles. *Yunica uses an axe and later a sword as her main weapons, she can be a bit challenging since she's not the fastest character around but she's also a bit of a tank so you can muscle your way out of enemies with little damage. *Hugo's my favorite and the game just turns into a semi-bullet hell shooter. He shoots pretty fast and you will get upgrades along the way that will increase your projectiles for a duration. He's a mage so the typical low health, crazy magic damage applies to him . His shooting range is enough to be able to shoot enemies from afar.*The Claw plays as a hack and slasher. He's a good balance of health and strength and he has a nifty transformation that's fun. do a boost attack then talk to the RoosAfter you're done with the story, you also get Boss Rush mode and a bonus shop to use for a new game. There's nothing new in the story after but if you're a completionist and/or would like to clear all difficulty, you'll find much replayability in this game. I'm currently easing myself starting from very easy until I can tackle Nightmare without ragequitting.			"

												I didn't know what to expect when I bought this game, but I've enjoyed it immensely.  The gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of the older Zelda games, and it's very, very fast-paced.  The graphics are definitely showing their age (the game was originally published in Japan in 2006 or so), but don't really detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.This has been one of my favorite recent purchases.  I hope XSEED is able to publish English translations of more stuff like this and Oath in Felghana (which is also fun, but not quite as good).Pros:-Fast paced, fun gameplay-Interesting bosses-Can reduce the difficulty of boss encounters by grinding a bit to raise character level (good if you're as bad at the boss fights as I am)-Although grinding is necessary, there's an XP multiplier based on the number of hits you've made in the last few seconds, so it's possible to grind more quickly by fighting only in crowded rooms-Responsive controls-Good soundtrack-Pretty good replay value--although the levels are all the same, each of the three playable characters has their own story arc with slight variations in the boss sequence and various other details-Very good localization work by XSEED; doesn't feel rushed at all-Runs very smoothly on modern hardwareCons:-Graphics a bit stale-Long cutscenes and dialog that cannot be skipped (note: there IS an option in the settings applet which suppresses ALL video playback; good for skipping the intro on a second play-through)-Character level scaling is very drastic:  Gaining two levels is usually sufficient to turn an unwinnable encounter into a cakewalk, so this tends to inspire a decent amount of grinding-You NEED to find all items, particularly weapon power-ups; there are some enemies that are virtually impervious to damage if your weapon is at too low a level.

												Previously cleared this prequel of YS  when the original Japanese version was released for PC, but purchased and cleared again for nostalgia when it was re-released on Steam. Gameplay (as stated in another review of YS) is action-RPG'ish (resembling both Zelda and Diablo), as the player controls the main character from an overhead third person view. Characters can be unlocked within the game, offering up to 4 (one is unofficially unlocked) different selections each with their own types of skill sets. Characters can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game. Storyline is paced well, but can be tedious to understand, as the lore of YS is quite deep in this version of the game. Must play as all three storyline characters to completely understand each of their motives. Music is also amazing, setting the tone of each and every stage the character enters. Graphics are outdated by modern standards, but the gameplay and music completely allow the user to forget about it. Played through the entire game with all three characters (Yunica/Hugo/Toal).Highly recommend. 5 out of 5 stars.			"

												In my opinion, this is the best Ys title currently available on Steam/PC.If you've played other Ys games, you know what to expect. Compared to the other titles, Origin is reasonably short (roughly 6 hours) but has 3 playable characters. Playing the game with all three characters does add a significant amount of replay value, as they play completely differently, and also have some unique story elements. Once you're done with the three main campaigns, there's also an arena mode for an extra challenge.As usual, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the controls are spot on.			"

												Picked up some colorful a** f*** vocabulary because of this f***ing game.This was my first introduction to the Ys series and I must say this was the first game in a long while that has challenged me in skill and not luck. By that I mean, this game actually takes skill to play as opposed to some ""difficult"" games which don't rely on player skill as opposed to how lucky you get on attack patterns, monster spawns, etc.I played as Yunica on Nightmare mode on my first (and so far only) play through. --------------------------------------------------------------------Likes: -fluid feel of the game movement and attacks-especially enjoyed the invulerability frame of the lightning spell and the fact that it took skill to use correctly (and i felt was almost absolutely required while playing nightmare mode)-Most of all I enjoyed the difficulty and uniqueness of each and every boss you fought. Each boss had its own way to be defeated which wasn't simply ""Smack till dieded""Dislikes:-Don't unlock a special character until you've beaten the game once...-Need to play the game with said special character just to unlock secret ending & secret boss fight-Too much running around on occassion-Game requires a bit of grinding to be able to progress if you're playing higher difficulties--------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, 10/10. Highly recommend the game. I also highly recommend nightmare mode first try if you enjoy a challenge like me, even though everyone recommends against nightmare mode first try :p			"

												Whether you're new or familiar to the Ys series, this is a fantastic game.Best introduction to the Ys series for new players, and a very rewarding prequel to people who have played Ys I/II already. Rivals Ys II as one of my favourite games of all time.			"

												If you like Action RPG's and care more about a good challenge which focuses solely on skilled gameplay, I'd definitely recommend this game. The only downside is that, at some points, it does require you to kill a few extra monsters for some additional levels, in order to make boss fights more 'fair', but it's not bad enough to be called a grindfest. This game (on Nightmare mode, with the last character) is probably the hardest game I've ever finished.			"

												Great game with a decent story.  The third playthrough story arch completly threw me off guard and was well worth the effort.  Playing this game in nightmare mode on one character was enough but all 3 is just insane and not worth the achievements.  Playing Hugo on Very Easy mode was actually kinda fun because you just went around blowing **** up, what's not to like?			"

												Good combat and a fair story are the strong points of this game.Extremely linear progression and the fact that you are confined to a tower for pretty much all of the play are it's cons.You play as three characters (a playthrough for each, one being unlockable after finishing with one of the other two) through the story mode to unravel their story as they ascend the demon tower, battling monsters and large bosses along the way. The story itself is fair, with some expected plot twists (and some not so expected) but doesn't have that much in the funny side. Everyone seems more into serious business mode. So if you want something with laughs this isn't really the game.Combat is real time, meaning that for the most part your skill at dodging attacks will determine your success, mostly in the harder difficulties. You don't get healing items nor healing magic either but some enemies drop use-on-pickup items. Some heal, some boost a stat for a time, and there's also currency drops you use to buy upgrades. A gripe I have is that the items and currency are dropped pretty much everywhere when killing monsters and because they disappear over time, you sometimes have to choose between clearing the room or pausing to run around to grab the spread items. Each character has basic attacks, including jump and jump attacks, and obtain magic items through the game that allow them to use special abilities used mainly for battle but are sometimes needed to get past certain parts of the game. There's no puzzles here either so most of the time you are either in combat or reading the story.Speaking of sounds, there's no voice acting here and the music is pretty much midi based. In fact all sounds remind me of the final 16 bit (SuperNES) to early 32 bit (PS1) era games so don't expect a John Williams score here.Visuals are the same. Characters and common enemies are all sprite based(they do have beautiful portraits), while the stage and bosses use very low polygon models, akin to PSP games. Sprites are drawn in the chibi style while portraits use the usual serious anime way. The one complain I have about the visuals is that the whole game takes place in a tower where all rooms are similar in terms of textures and such, only changing their color every few stages. Sure, no room is the same and there's plenty of enemies to get you busy, but I myself like variety of backdrops and open spaces. Then again hard to do when the premise of the game is to explore a big round demon tower.Overall it's a good game I can recommend to throw yourself back with a simple yet effective gameplay, simple visuals that while similar, don't completely bore in my opinion, and a good story to boot.

												This game turned out to be a real diamond in the rough for me. Bought it years ago cheap in some sale. And thought i would play it just because it's in my library. Turned out this game is awesome!It's an action RPG, hack 'n' slash style. Combat is very fluid and responsive and more importantly fun. The story in the game is also very good, although it develops along slowly, so it wont rope you in that fast. But once it gets it's hooks in you it's too late. This is the first Ys game i bought and after completing it i had to buy Ys I & II Chronicles+, i want to know how the story continues, and i will get the other games aswell.The game is unique in that you have to play the game through 3 times to get the full story. There are 3 characters to play. Yunica, Hugo and Toal. Toal can only be played after you have completed the game with Yunica and Hugo, and rightfuly so as Toals playthrough contains the most story with couple plot twists even.This game also has a very high replayability. It wont get boring to play through it several times. And after you beat the game there is also time attack mode, boss rush and arena where you can compete for leaderboards. In arena you also get points you can use in a bonus shop to buy alternative characters to play through the story with.Big time bang for your buck!On story page it says this game has partial controller support. I played through it with controller, also tried keyboard both works fine, i just liked controler better. Even if all tutorial popups show keyboard keybinds.			"

												    No items to use, no breaths to catch in intense fights, using only your wits, reactions, and skills, this is game can be pretty tough but it's a blessing to those to loves a challenge. It's a short yet classic JRPG game with some nice anime touch to it. The gameplay is nice, exploration is simple to a certain degree. The real deal is dealing with some bosses. Though not mandatory, it is reccommended to take your time exploring EVERYWHERE to make your life slightly easier.    This, I should say, was worth the money spent. Reccommendation Approved			"

												Live the legend that is Ys in Ys: Origin. Search through a sprawling and multi tiered tower that you may remember from other Ys games for the first time on a quest to find the twin goddesses and thwart demons and outsiders alike. While easier and much more linear than others in the series, this game provides multiple characters with different playstyles and controls the same as modern Ys installments for fast and decisive action. A gloriously atmospheric and rocking soundtrack supports the different zones of the tower while monsterous and menacing bosses bar your path to your ultimate goal of rescuing the goddesses. The various ways to complete this game depending on what character you pick through their combat style makes this game very replayable if you are a fan of Ys or real-time action RPGs. Through the use of magic artifacts and different weapons you are able to find unique weaknesses in enemies and exploit them viciously. While your equipment is very limited for a Ys game, the items you can pick up are mostly the ones you know and love from other installments as they are recovered from the broken land of Ys here initially. I never had a Ys game before Oath, but with this, I and II (remade with the old ""bump"" combat style), and Oath as well in my library I always keep coming back to Ys for another adventure.			"

The combination of lightning fast combat and perfectly balanced difficulty means that every level gained, item upgraded, or new item found will dramatically improve your chances in the glorious boss battles.It may not be a deep game in terms of upgrade paths or character customization, but  its focus means that every moment, every boss battle is wonderfully tuned.Multiple characters (with different stories for each), time attack mode, and some challenging achievements offer extra content beyond a single dungeon run, but even without them this game is more than worth the asking price.

												If you enjoy playing action role-playing games (particularly those from Japan), Ys Origin is a solid investment.  At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the ""right"" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the ""normal"" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.  If not at the normal price, then consider adding Ys Origin to your Steam library the next time the game is on sale.			"

												If you've played ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", this is very similar, except this game is a bit more polished in a lot of ways. Origin has a lot more content, the graphic design is mostly the same but it still looks better, the music seems slightly higher quality (though a bit less metal than TOiF has). This game is more linear than TOiF, but it doesn't really feel like it because the story is far superior to TOiF and the level design is very good. There is a lot of content, with multiple characters and stories to play through and you can unlock boss rush, time attack, and battle arenas, and you can even purchase bonus stuff from earning SP in the arenas. Origin is much bigger than TOiF in many ways. Both are good games, but this one is the better of the two.I did notice a couple graphical errors when at a 1080p res, being that a few skyboxes/backgrounds left black space on the right side of the screen. It really wasn't a big deal though, and I think it only happened in two parts of the game.Rating: 7.8/10Worth: $5 to $12.50			"

												Well damn, having almost never played a single RPG game, and JRPG nonetheless, this game caught my attention when it was on anime sale on steam. Why did I buy this and the other Ys games on steam on a whim like that even if they were on sale? Why did my curiosity get the better of me? And why this urge to play this game non-stop?Soo many questions, and only one answer: ""This game is an epic RPG with a decent (though perhaps anime-cliche) story with a really fun and very much replayable game-play that takes you on a journy inside a demon tower. Very simplistic in its setup, but my god the best part is the boss battles. Well designed requiring more than just skills but also a certain strategy, makes it less easier than killing simple masses of enemies in comparison. This is probably one of the best non-turn based and non-party JRPG games out there. And that goes for the whole series, as I assume the original games are even better story-wise. Either way, if you're into RPG games or just like anime or japanese related stuff like me, then surely this is a good game to try out. would give 9/10 gg wp			"

												This game is loads of fun. Combat is smooth and rewarding, not too complicated but it's not just buttonmashing either. The platforming is done very well, challenging but not frustrating. Bosses are awesome (as far as I've gotten). Only niggle (ugh, really steam? I'm saying n.i.g.g.l.e) is if you're really having trouble with a boss, it may be you're just underleveled. The game doesn't really emphasize your level so it's easy to miss, but I found that after going back and gaining 4 levels, the boss that was seriously kicking my behind, was suddenly pretty easy (although you'll still need to learn each boss' attackpatterns). Luckily though, grinding those 4 levels was very quick, probably no more than half an hour or so, and didn't feel like traditional grinding (aka boring) at all.One comment though, everyone's saying how tough the game is... Well, it's not easy, but you might think it's a frustrating experience. As far as I'm concerned it's not. It offers a challenge, but it never feels unfair and to me personally on normal mode I find it's just right (and I'm not normally a glutton for punishment, still havent dared to start up dark soulds ;-))I haven't gotten anywhere near completing this game yet, but just wanted to share this quick review because the game is still on sale for another 21 hours or so. So what are you waiting for? Go buy it!			"

												Ys Origin showed an extremely unique graphic and art style which was extremely foreign to me when I first started the game. Upon the first few swings of my axe, I knew I was in for an amazing experience. This game's controls and combat system flow so fluently that every kill drew me further and further into the game. Even on Normal Difficulty this game showed the absolute perfect challenge... Hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only on one occassion did I ever beat a boss on the first attempt. Unlike most games where a death to a difficult boss would be frustrating; I never wanted to quit, as every death got me more pumped up than the last.The smooth flow of the game wasn't everything. This games soundtrack took me by storm, as I am a sucker for a game's soundtrack. One amazing song after another... This game never grew dull even for a second. The fact that i have written over 20 words about this game should explain just how much I enjoyed it because I hate reading... and writing... and typing.....Basically what I'm trying to say is this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and now has a place in my list of favourite games. :D			"

												As the first game of the Ys series i played, it was a great experience! It got even better when i found out whilst playing through my first run that actual members of quintet came from famicom! fyi, quintet was a legendary team of game developers who made the gaia series, a trilogy of imo the greatest action rpgs ever made.Anyhows back to Ys: It's full of action, every room you find yourself slashing your way through monsters (or firing your lazers as hugo)! The boss fights are always compelling, i liked the way you could simply jump onto most of the bosses at whack em on the head!The story is compelling, and i won't spoiler, but to understand most of what is going on you should play through at least once with all the characters~I recommend this to anyone who loves action rpgs or hack n' slashes, its a great game and it has brought me to love the world of Ys!

												The ones that would appreciate this game the most are fan of Ys because it’s a prequel for the first Ys games. But that doesn’t mean this can’t be enjoyed by newcomers. It has that classic SNES adventure feel but will enhanced graphics like all other Ys games. There are multiple characters you can play in story mode but replaying story mode for minor changes in dialogue and events for the first two characters was tedious. The main replay-ability is in arena and boss mode. Overall the sprite animation is an improvement over Ys: The Oath in Felghana and most replay focus is on extras. It’s worth picking up for what it is and if you are already a fan of the Ys franchise you’ll enjoy the lore.			"

												One of the best JRPG game to have on STEAM. Don't be fooled by the old-school graphics. This game provides fast paced action, HUGE bosses, and a solid storyline that would make you want to play it after you beat it once! 2 available and unlockable characters, solid short but unique inventory system, diverse stages, beautiful soundtracks and anime style artworks...What else could you ask for?

												I made a Let's Play from it. I think this is worth it.There are a lot of games in the Ys series, several of which are on Steam. This is actually a prequel, set hundreds of years before the main series games.Yet... this is my favorite.The Ys series are action RPGs. What makes them unique is that a level-up should not be underestimated - it makes the difference between getting served by a boss and dominating it. So grinding feels genuinely rewarding, and something you shouldn't have to do much of if you're not playing on higher levels. Plus, the soundtrack absolutely rocks.There is a bit of a Metroid feel as you'll be backtracking and searching around for powerups to help you get further into the tower. There are three characters, and for me the game was never really boring enough not to replay with the other characters. Getting all achievements, however, requires beating the game a total of six times, and on the highest difficulty for three of them. Don't think I'm going for that.The Ys series was never huge on story - you won't find anything revolutionary here. But it's not a problem, since the gameplay more than makes up for it.In summary: Genuinely fun action, great music, and a great intro into the Ys series. GET THIS GAME.			"

												Any fan of action games should give this a try. While it has a very basic story and dated graphics, the gameplay more than makes up for it with tight controls and it has a great soundtrack.

												I picked this game up on impulse a couple years ago becuase  I had heard good things about the Ys Games and this was super cheap. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting with Ys Origin, but from the beginning I was hooked, and I kept looking forward to the next boss as you make your way up the tower. It's not a long gmae, but it felt a really nice length to play, but thats becuase they make you want to replay it with a different charachter. One charachter is ranged and the other melee, different conversations with each. I wasn't expecting this game to engross me as much as it did, I couldn't put it down from start to finish. If you see this in a sale and you too want too see what all the fuss is about with the Ys Games this is a good start.			"

												This is a fine game. You'd do good to purchase it. It's got really fast and challenging combat, bosses that feel REALLY rewarding to finally defeat, and tons of replay value due to including three characters and five difficulties for the game, as well as secrets. The soundtrack to this game is also rather well done. The only thing that could be improved would be the graphics, but they serve their purpose well without cluttering the screen, and who cares about graphics if the gameplay is awesome! If you like any other ARPGs, you owe it to yourself to get this at some point.			"

												This action RPG drips ""old-school"" from its pores. While the series never caught on big in the US during its original releases, these remakes and rereleases are worth a look.There isn't any variation or customization in your character progression, other than the order in which you buy some passive upgrades, so the game will succeed or fail by the gameplay itself. It mostly succeeds here, if you liked Secret of Mana and similar games. There's a great soundtrack to keep you going as well.So what's old-school about it? Two things stand out: the punishing bosses and the level grind. You'll NEED to pick out the boss patterns to beat them. If you're not stopping to spill some extra blood as you play through the game, you'll be underleveled and you will die quickly. This can even happen on normal monsters - if you find yourself dealing weaksauce damage to new monsters, when you used to be cleaving through armies, go back and grind a few levels. Comparative level matters a lot.			"

												The Ys (prounounced Ees) series has long ben one of the finer series in Japanese action RPGs. It has been known for being one of the first game series to emphasize story, its brutal bosses,   fantastic rock soundtrack.....and barely ever being imported into the U.S. My own only experience with the series was Ys III, released in 1991, on the Sega GenesisYs Origins is a surprisingly polished game, considering its original release in 2006. With a focus on combat and dungeon exploration, the game feels familiar, but is polished enough to stay entertained enough through its campaign.And what a campaign. Though a single character's story line is no longer than 8 to 9 hours, Ys Origins provides 3 different characters, each with a completely different fighting style, viewpoint in the story, and even differences in area accessability and boss battles. Combined with bonus time attack and boss rush modes, where devoted players can earn special costumes, battles, and even a bonus character, Ys Origin can easily be enjoyed for over 30 hours. Ys Origin is not without flaws. The story is serviceable, but fairly predictable. Some later boss battles can be an exercise in frustration, and you'll wish that they mixed up the dungeons a bit more between characters. However, for anyone looking for a classic, rewarding, challenging action RPG with all of the Japanese trappings, you can do a lot worse than this artifact of the previous decade.			"

												The platforming issues become really apparent once you hit the second boss. Its really hard to tell where the character is in relation to the rest of the world some times. Otherwise, boss design is good. The lack of item usage during fights means that you'll be cherishing every last drop of the hp that you do not have a lot of. Play this game if you enjoy rage followed by the release of stress not unlike 2 years worth of glopping.			"

Fun and highly recommended to people who like this sort of thing, but I've got one complaint:  no matter which character you choose, you have to go through the same huge tower and fight the same monsters (for the most part).

												A solid piece of hack-and-slash platformery (is that even a word?)  with rpg elements thrown in. The graphics leave a little to be desired- I recommend watching the trailer to see if they're your cup of tea- and the story is a tad cliche, but that doesn't stop Ys Origin from being a fun-filled romp. The adjustable difficulty levels make the game accessible to casual gamers and hardcore fans alike, and the multiple character choices make this game more replayable than the previous Ys title released on Steam, Oath in Felghana. In fact, if you want to see what the Ys series is all about, this is a good game to start with. A word of caution for the uninitiated- the boss fights are old-school, learn-how-this-thing-can-kill-me-by-dying -to-it-repeatedly encounters, especially on any difficulty above easy; then again, the boss encounters are part of the game- and the series'- charm. Is it an amazingly designed game, worthy of critical accolades? No. Is it enjoyable? Definitely.			"

It is not unfair, just tough.  2.  There is a level mechanic, but the game relies more on skill and perseverance.3.  The music, which is stereotypical Japanese power metal, still manages to be perfect for the setting and helps to add energy.4.  There is a story, but it is more about playing the game then watching cut-scenes, instead of the other way around.5.   Has some of the most insanely-fun boss battles in recent memory.  (Which the game knows as there is a boss rush mode).I don't know what else to say.  Great game that takes around 15 hours to complete on normal.   "

												If you are already a Falcom fan, then I don't need to encourage you more to go play it. Ys Origin brings you the tale of 700 years before the first game. The epic conflict you had in the first game is finally revealed, and what a Hell of a start it is. In terms of story it stands strong, and playing between each character may cause the game to feel repeatable, but it's actually done well. The gameplay may feel a bit stiff or slippery from time to time, but that's because Ys wasn't made to be this combo-ish action game; Adol isn't in it though, so I think that's where the problem lies. It's easy to get to the 100% clearing, but for 100% upgrades you really need to have a love for grinding. And as always in true Ys fashion, if you think this game isn't hard enough there is the Hellish ""Nightmare"" mode. It offers enough variety for you to play on and a loveable story. Though it may look weird from a linair look, this being Ys 0, the gap of 700 years should indicate that this one will stand on its own like it should be.			"

YES.It takes a lot of patience to understand the entire detail of the first story between the first two characters (Yunica and Hugo) in their own perspectives, but understanding it is as rewarding as beating it at higher difficulties -- well worth the effort. But once you complete the game with both of those, you get a new character -- Toal -- and the real story begins. It's difficult to understand like before, but once you figure it out, it's excellent.Yunica is a melee character; Hugo is a ranged character. Toal is a melee character, but his Boost mode turns him into a demon -- crucial for certain areas of the game. Some monsters take more damage to specific elements -- remember this.And don't forget to buckle up.			"

												Fans of the Ys Series, rejoice in learning the origin of the legends which the first two games are based off of. The game primarily revolves around either Yunica Tovah or Hugo Fact, and yes, those family names should be familiar to those who've played the first two games. Each of them plays differently, with some mechanics making some fights a lot easier than others, some more difficult.This game serves as the seventh canonical entry in the Ys series (Ys V is non-canon), and as a prequel to the entire series. It does a lot to explain a lot of the lore in the first two games, as well as why even in the main series, there is always a seemingly world ending threat around the corner.The game has three characters, two of which are available from the start: Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The third is unlockable after beating the game with either one and finishes the story with its true ending. Even if you don't beat it with him, there is still a lot that is canon from Yunica and Hugo's endings, just not the true mastermind, a very familiar enemy who was responsible for the events in Ys I & II.Killing normal enemies is rather easy, and if you are having trouble, go back to a previous zone and grind a couple of levels, then come back. You will easily know when you've grinded enough in a zone when the experience rewards vs. the amount needed to level becomes more grindy than the time needed is worth. Basically, if you need to level, you can gain   a level in about 10 - 15 minutes, sooner if you're on the low side for the zone.Still, the main focus is the bosses. Each has unique mechanics and weaknesses that you need to take into account. Don't be surprised if you die a few times figuring out the boss, and if your attention slips, or you make a wrong move, then you are in for a world of hurt. That's where the fun is.			"

												This action RPG drips ""old-school"" from its pores. While the series never caught on big in the US during its original releases, these remakes and rereleases are worth a look.There isn't any variation or customization in your character progression, other than the order in which you buy some passive upgrades, so the game will succeed or fail by the gameplay itself. It mostly succeeds here, if you liked Secret of Mana and similar games. There's a great soundtrack to keep you going as well.So what's old-school about it? Two things stand out: the punishing bosses and the level grind. You'll NEED to pick out the boss patterns to beat them. If you're not stopping to spill some extra blood as you play through the game, you'll be underleveled and you will die quickly. This can even happen on normal monsters - if you find yourself dealing weaksauce damage to new monsters, when you used to be cleaving through armies, go back and grind a few levels. Comparative level matters a lot.			"

												Ys Origin showed an extremely unique graphic and art style which was extremely foreign to me when I first started the game. Upon the first few swings of my axe, I knew I was in for an amazing experience. This game's controls and combat system flow so fluently that every kill drew me further and further into the game. Even on Normal Difficulty this game showed the absolute perfect challenge... Hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only on one occassion did I ever beat a boss on the first attempt. Unlike most games where a death to a difficult boss would be frustrating; I never wanted to quit, as every death got me more pumped up than the last.The smooth flow of the game wasn't everything. This games soundtrack took me by storm, as I am a sucker for a game's soundtrack. One amazing song after another... This game never grew dull even for a second. The fact that i have written over 20 words about this game should explain just how much I enjoyed it because I hate reading... and writing... and typing.....Basically what I'm trying to say is this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and now has a place in my list of favourite games. :D			"

												Solid action RPG fun, 3 different characters to play with each with their own unique fighting styles and storys, each path takes around 8 hours.Game difficulty is medium, with boss fights being a particular difficulty spike.  However they each have their weaknesses and are quite fun to fight.This game plays similarly to Ys: The Oath in Felghana, however both of these games play very differently to the two Ys: Chronicles games.

												A solid hacky-slashy JRPG, Origin is the release followup to Oath & storyline prequel to Ys I & II (which are on steam,btw). The three main characters in the game play quite differently from each other, Yunica feeling pretty close to Adol's style in Oath, while Hugo is more shmup-ey. The gameplay is pretty much as fast as Oath was, although a bit easier if compared to it,which is a good thing if you thought Oath was hard...Graphically. it's once again the same deal as Oath. The game is old so it runs on toasters, but it looks great if you can bump up stuff like AA and AF to the max and maintain 60FPS, making the whole package feel fluid.To sum: If you like hack-slash JRPG's, it's a pretty great game to play.

So then, I picked up the serie again when I saw the Ys serie on Steam... And it's still the same Ys feeling I remember.Picture playing an old Zelda game... with faster gameplay, jumping, good music, hack and slash with animé. That is Ys.

												Good action rpg game, it has a nice story and a good level of challenge (well, at least if you don't play on Very Easy). It offers a good number of unlockables (extra characters, extra modes and multiple difficulties) and it has a good replay value too. You'll keep replaying the game to unlock everything, and every time you'll have something different or new. The sprites (anime style) are good too. Grindind may become frustrating at higher diffs though... bosses in particular can be very challenging. Recommended.			"

												I didn't know what to expect when I bought this game, but I've enjoyed it immensely.  The gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of the older Zelda games, and it's very, very fast-paced.  The graphics are definitely showing their age (the game was originally published in Japan in 2006 or so), but don't really detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.This has been one of my favorite recent purchases.  I hope XSEED is able to publish English translations of more stuff like this and Oath in Felghana (which is also fun, but not quite as good).Pros:-Fast paced, fun gameplay-Interesting bosses-Can reduce the difficulty of boss encounters by grinding a bit to raise character level (good if you're as bad at the boss fights as I am)-Although grinding is necessary, there's an XP multiplier based on the number of hits you've made in the last few seconds, so it's possible to grind more quickly by fighting only in crowded rooms-Responsive controls-Good soundtrack-Pretty good replay value--although the levels are all the same, each of the three playable characters has their own story arc with slight variations in the boss sequence and various other details-Very good localization work by XSEED; doesn't feel rushed at all-Runs very smoothly on modern hardwareCons:-Graphics a bit stale-Long cutscenes and dialog that cannot be skipped (note: there IS an option in the settings applet which suppresses ALL video playback; good for skipping the intro on a second play-through)-Character level scaling is very drastic:  Gaining two levels is usually sufficient to turn an unwinnable encounter into a cakewalk, so this tends to inspire a decent amount of grinding-You NEED to find all items, particularly weapon power-ups; there are some enemies that are virtually impervious to damage if your weapon is at too low a level.

												OI, completely forgot to recommend this game.It's a bit easier than Ys Oath in Felghana, and it has more characters to choose from instead of just Adol, which means more replayability, but a single playthrough of Felghana is longer than a single playthrough of Origins. At least, was so in my case, even if I had to actually grind a bit in Oath.It's just awesome and you should play it. Such a satisfying game, with awesome bosses to beat up. The only flaw is that some characters lack ways to efficiently deal with some monsters, but it's kinda obvious..Is da orkiest stuffz dere is in dis 'ere game - ya hav' da Weirdboy wif gut dakka, gerl wif gitty hat an'♥♥♥♥♥♥ an' da orky Kommando only choppin' and choppin'.

												Even though Ys Origin is now a relatively old game (it was first released by the end of 2006), it still has plenty to offer to RPG fans:   - Beautiful graphics, both in-game and cutscenes   - Simple and intuitive graphic user interface   - Very fun, rewarding, fast-paced action that hardly gets old   - Challenging bosses that will make you rethink your playing strategy   - Not one, nor two... but three different game stories that seemly complement each otherDefinitely a great introduction to the Ys series and great improvement from the previously released title, The Oath in Felghana, except maybe in the soundtrack which in my humble opinion lacked that trilling component that made me want to carry on shredding monsters just to keep hearing the track. However, this is more than compensated by the deeply intriguing game stories; more than once I found myself playing an extra hour just to find out what was going to happen next.Overall, even if you're one of those players that rush through games (which I highly discourage with this one), Ys Origin is guaranteed to give you a good 30+ hours of gameplay any noteworthy action RPG should.

												It's a great game with difficulty settings that should suit most people; from casuals up to the more hardcore action gamers. Story is not revolutionary but servicable.There's enough content to keep occupied with especially if going for the achievements.It's a fun hack'n'slash experience well suited for a gamepad.			"

												Definitely love this game. Even though this game is straightforward, like no visiting towns, caves or things like that. The entire game takes place in a Tower. I love playing as Toal Fact (Hugo Fact's older brother). He has a few comical encounters with one of the Darklings named Epona regarding Hugo. LOL Definitely recommend this game. Has alot of replay value. :)			"

												Pros: Really great selection of tools with uses in combat and in puzzles, varied and interesting enemy designs, superb boss fights, very energetic soundtrack.Cons: Poor feedback when hit (there's no sound effect, just a red number that pops up that I missed a few times,) Bosses have VERY deep health pools when compared to how easily some enemies will fall so a certain degree of grinding may be necessary, and you can't pause the game when fighting a boss (I think this is to prevent players from teleporting out of the room to avoid a loss or something, but I should still be able to pause the game.)Even with those issues I still had a great time. Strongly recommended.			"

												I rarely finish games, but I finished Ys Origin twice and almost went for a third do-over.The game as its core is quite fun. Mash Z at baddies. Baddies come straight at you, pushing you towards progress. Build that experience multiplier with every hit. Room emptied? Quick, rush to the next one, don't let it fade away! Mash, mash, hack and slash! Faster, Yunica, faster!The part where the game forces you to essentially stop having fun mashing enemies to pieces are decidedly the least fun, and the very first chapter is probably the worst in this regard.For the rest, however, the game doesn't look upon you for pushing recklessly forward: the game recognizes that there is nothing wrong with W+M1 (or, rather, Z+↑); it embraces the euphoria you get by building up your attack chain and going from monster to monster, building up buffs in the progress, leveling up without a break -- there is none of that ""YOU JUST GOT ONE SKILL POINT STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING AND SPEND IT RIGHT THE HELL NOW"" stuff, and the upgrades you CAN buy can wait in between flurries. Hell: the way NPCs in the game described Yunica in their fixed scripts matched perfectly the way I was playing -- accidental Z-mashing-based rolepaying has no right feeling this rewarding.You spend 10 hours finishing the game, and you feel rewarded and spent and awesome. And then the game says you've unlocked a new character.This is where I usually tune out; I don't really tend to do NG+s with rare exceptions. Ys Origin however was just so much fun it earned a chance for one, and oh boy. This new character's plot is completely different from Yunica's; it feels like the sequel to the story, or rather, a better version of it; and indeed my understanding is that it's this second version of the story that gets picked up in the next games.The way he plays, also, is like Yunica squared: for a few boss fights, Yunica could rely on long range attacks to keep safe, but this second character has no ranged options at all. He must get in close and personal and it feels rewarding as hell, even though I've actually been playing on easy throughout -- it's still a game from Japan and I do NOT trust their sense of scale when it comes to difficulty.I enjoyed Ys Origin a lot and it's almost a pit that the third character's plot doesn't seem different enough to warrant a third replay.Get it, get the cards and get smashing.

												So, what is it you want from a game? Pretty visuals? An excellent story? Intense action? A challenge? If the answer to the last two questions are ""yes"", you should try this game. The anime/JRPG style visuals may not be everyone's cup of tea, so take that into account. The story is by no means bad, but nothing that'll keep you at the edge of your seat. But there are some really good reasons why to play this game. First of all, the gameplay. Fast-paced and fluid hack&slash action typical for an ARPG with the difference that it has a vertical dimension as well, adding some platforming to the whole concept. Initially you get to pick between two characters, and can unlock a third one. The story remains more or less the same (it's best described as 3 different points of view), but there are significant differences in how the characters are played, each of the 3 offers a unique gameplay experience. You can pick either a controller or the KB/mouse duo, both work just fine. The configuration tool is user-friendly and offers a lot of freedom in defining your desired configuration.There are five difficulty levels, ranging from ""very easy"" to ""nightmare"". The game is quite challenging, don't be shy to try it on a lower difficulty if you just don't seem to move forward. The strongest point of this game are the numerous and intense boss-battles, which test your reflexes and wits alike. You won't get anywhere with the ""hit it until it stops moving"" idea even on ""very easy"". Expect to hit the retry button numerous times, sometimes it's not obvious what you need to do from the start. Explore and experiment, it's fun! Finished story mode with all 3 characters? The game still has replay value! In the Time Attack mode, you can test your mettle against the game's bosses without having to replay the whole game again. And it doesn't end there. While Time attack can be played right after completing the game with one character, once you clear the story mode with all 3, you gain access to Arena Mode, where you fight waves of enemies from the level of your choice and collect SP (the game's currency) to unlock bonus content. The soundtrack is simply amazing. Masterpiece after masterpiece, greatly adding to the enjoyment the game has to offer.If ""challenge"" is your middle name, then you shouldn't miss this game.The verdict: 8.9/10			"

It's a complete blast of an action RPG. You whack at enemies, and the more you do it in succession, the higher your XP multiplier goes - and therefore, the stronger your character will be.  It combines old-world arcade games with new-type action RPGs. I've rarely had this much fun with any other Steam-available game.			"

The graphics are nothing to write home about, and neither is the narrative, however the solid and tactile ARPG gameplay glued me to the game when not much else did. A fantastic gameplay experience, and with multiple characters with different paths of play it also has great replay value. Recommended for sure.			"

It is not unfair, just tough.  2.  There is a level mechanic, but the game relies more on skill and perseverance.3.  The music, which is stereotypical Japanese power metal, still manages to be perfect for the setting and helps to add energy.4.  There is a story, but it is more about playing the game then watching cut-scenes, instead of the other way around.5.   Has some of the most insanely-fun boss battles in recent memory.  (Which the game knows as there is a boss rush mode).I don't know what else to say.  Great game that takes around 15 hours to complete on normal.   "

Ys Origin is one of best of the serie. Ys games are one of best in the genre hack&slash platformer.  You don't play these games for graphics or story but for the gameplay.  All of rest (graphic, soundtrack, story) is bonus.I first played with Yunica because she is the one who seem more as Adol Christin.

												Ys Origins is the very first of the series (in Ys timeline, not by release date) and sets the stage for the rest of the games.The gameplay is somewhat like the Legend of Zelda/Alundra (for those who had played this game back in the era of the PS1) with the addition of a basic leveling system.The story plays out over the course of 2 character, in which you choose to play through one of those character's storyline and after finishing, can go back and play the other (as well as the 3rd character after you complete the game with one of the first two playable characters). It is recommened that you play the female character first, then the male, then the third character as their storyline is a cannon to the ""main"" characters of the game.This game is also very grindy and the story is bland, but an overall fun game as long as you don't mind the mindnumbing end game grand.I picked this up on sale for roughly $5 USD and would recommend it at this price, but not at it's full price. I only wish Steam had more JRPGs than what is currently offered.			"

												""Ys Origin is a Japanese action role-playing game developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows in 2006."" (Wikipedia, November 2013)I've played this RPG for 45 hours on the hardest of the 5 difficulties (nightmare, hard, normal, easy, very easy) with ""Hugo"" (1 of 3 characters) and completed it by level 52. I found the story to be a run-of-the-mill ""good guy wants power, turns evil temporarily, and repents through the power of friendship/love"". I'm generally not the type of guy to delve into, and enjoy, the story of a game very much anyways, so I didn't mind it. In fact, considering that I look for ""great gameplay"" in games, and what type of gameplay I'll tend to go for, I would practically expect a story to be ""the usual"" in a game (not to say I haven't enjoyed original stories). I don't know how the story goes with the other 2 characters, since I haven't played them yet.This game, played with a top-down camera angle, plays kinda like a shooter when Hugo is the chosen character, as his attacks revolve around shooting magic missiles straight ahead of him. After a quick test run, the other 2 characters appear to revolve around close-range melee combat. On the hardest difficulty level, the bosses offer such a challenge that you'll find yourself grinding a lot, just to gain that extra level or two and be able to defeat the boss at all (and even then, your battle strategy better be near perfect). This game has some simple puzzle-solving, if you can even call it that. You'll find yourself having to press buttons, defeat certain enemies, obtain and use items/skills, and so on. I did enjoy the challenging gameplay, but it would get frustrating at times with bosses, and also 1 time with a certain enemy that can practically insta-kill you (but that you'll still have to deal with). The only thing to do there is keep looking around for equipment and the like, and grind in special spots to gain levels.If you want to know how nice the graphics look, just ""You-Google-Tube"" some gameplay footage on the game. And while you're at it, check out the soundtrack for it as well. It's pretty awesome. As of this post, the game is normally $19.99 USD on Steam and I'd say it's worth the price if you love to spend many hours on a challenging ""battle-grind"" RPG. If it turns-out that you love the game, then you may also love ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", which follows a similar gaming style. You may want to avoid Ys I & II though, which has your main attack revolve around ramming into enemies (like in Hydlide), which ruins any sense of ""gameplay"" (at least in my opinion).			"

												This is one of my most favorite games. The entire game takes place in a giant tower, but you can play as multiple characters and the story changes depending on who you play as. The gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable, and the music is outstanding. The boss fights are a good challenge on hard difficulty and are very fair in that you can dodge just about everything with practice and/or playing very carefully. For me, melee is much more fun, so I recommend against starting with Hugo, but he does get a shield spell that makes the game a lot easier.			"

												Probably the quickest I've ever gone from demo to purchase.As Ys tends to go, it's a ballbuster, but a damn fun one.  Combat is surprisingly flexible for its simplicity.  The set piece boss fights are creative, complex, and completely unforgiving, but for the most part tuned very well -- a player who's practiced up can take them down reliably and feel like a total badass in the process.  Experience gain is tuned to scale based on the level difference between you and your opponent, so you catch up very quickly when underleveled but can always crank out an extra level for an edge against something.There are exceptions, of course.  Kishgal is capable of randomly screwing you depending on which moves he does in succession, and a couple bosses (Gelaldy, Pictimos) are long and tedious enough to stop feeling fun after the first half of their HP bar.  The latter third of the game is extremely melee-unfriendly, and poor Yunica is largely reduced to spamming one special attack.			"

												I absolutely love this game. As many have already have said, there are two characters to play as initially, with a third being unlocked after you beat the game with either of the first two. I recommend playing the game at least three times, once with each character. The order I played in was: Yunica (close/medium-range), Hugo (medium/long-range), then the secret character (very close-range). All three have interwining stories, and you only get the full picture after beating the game with all three. The story itself is interesting, and makes you want to keep playing long after the credits roll. The good thing about Ys Origin is that you don't need any backstory from the previous games, due to this title being a prequel to the rest of the series. The combat is addictive, with the environments and enemies changing often enough so as not to get repetitive. The soundtrack is sublime, and will make you want to listen to it even outside of the game.I played the game on Normal difficulty, and doing so will probably net you 8-10 hours of game for each character. However, I recommend playing on Hard, because grinding even a little bit on Normal will make the game obscenely easy. Overall, if you like action-RPGs, a great soundtrack, and a great story, you can't go wrong with this one.			"

No healing either unless u found standing still but that's useless in boss fights. Highly recommended this game if you are looking for a decent challenge =D			"

												Ys series in general are not very long and their challenge level is fair with minimal grinding required. This one is a bit of exception in length and challenge, but not as negative aspects. While the length for one character is the average of any other Ys, the replay value lies in the fact there are THREE characters in total, each one with their own play style and emphasizing one aspect or another. And the story also changes itself, showing things that happens with that character while it was not on camera to another, or sometimes fate itself will twist and a whole new situation will unfold.For those seeking for challenge, bosses and enemies can be blazed through in easier difficulties, grinded in average ones, or skillfully fought in later difficulties. I could go on and on in an in-depth analysis of this game, but I will keep it short and simple: if you want a good story and challenge, Ys Origin is your game.			"

												While the story isn't really that long and unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, I think you can finish the game in around 8 - 12 hours. There are 3 characters, each with a different story. All three characters have different skills and this allows you to use different tactics for the same boss. Grinding isn't really needed as by the time you get to the final boss you should have the minimum requirement to beat the boss. Overall it is a fun and fast paced ARPG. Just don't play through all 3 characters' story in one shot like I did, it is quite tiring~ XD			"

 Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.) Note 2: I will be comparing this to Oath in Felghana's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.      This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.      For those of you that don't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were ""tweaked"" or ""improved,"" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.      Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).      In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.      The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.      Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.      On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly ""harder""). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.      Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.      This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.      To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.      Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.

												The more I immerse myself in the Ys series, the more enamored I become.  This is one solid little franchise.  There are so many things that Falcom does right in caring for this classic property, and I have high hopes for future Ys games I will be playing.  This is yet another perfect little charming gem of an action RPG.  It mixes 2D sprite animation and seamless 3D architecture to create a style both retro and timeless.  The care and attention payed to the characters, story, music, and ys heritage is truly admirable.Design wise, this game is a typical dungeon crawl, but the challenge is quite thrilling during boss fights.  The exploration aspect can get a bit tedious if you play through the game multiple times in quick succession, but I imagine this can be offset by tweaking difficulty levels to your liking. On that note, the story of Ys Origin plays out with a Roshamon style redundancy; with three individual character's story-lines.  Much of the joy of this game comes from experiencing the events of the narrative from these different perspectives.  Granted, there are slight differences in each Character's narrative, with only one (Claw's) considered 'cannon', but walking through the game in each of their shoes lets you become much more familiar with the characters and the world in which they live.  I can't imagine having only played through this game with a single character, and I found each separate run interesting and challenging due to the different play mechanics.  It's a faithful loveletter to the Lore Falcom has developed for Ys over the last several decades.  The characters, the settings, and even the music is heavily inspired by past games in the franchise.  Now at the time of this writing, I had managed to play the steam releases of Ys 1&2, as well as Oath in Felghana (remake of ys 3).  These games stand perfectly fine on their own story wise, and it is absolutely unnecessary for anyone to have any prior knowledge of the franchise to get your money's worth.  That being said, each entry also helps to paint a beautifully detailed picture of a larger whole.  Falcom seem quite devoted to the world they've created, and the relationship between games is actually quite nuanced.  I'm so very glad I played through this, and I encourage everyone to take it for a spin.  If you're only interested in a charming hack 'n slash romp, by all means coast through it.  If you're at all interested in the story of Ys, I very much encourage you to experience each story line.  On the lower difficulties, each play through should take about 8 hours.  I, myself, played the first round on normal, then coasted through the next two on easier settings for a total playtime of 26 hours.			"

												A prequel to the long-running Ys series, Ys Origins tells the story of Darm Tower before the events of Ys I & II. Unlike most Ys games, you don't play as familiar, red-haired protagonist Adol Christin, but rather one of two characters (there is also a 'secret' third character), the axe-wielding Yunica and the mage Hugo. This is a different take on the series than most entries, and is a welcome change as there is a lot of variety with the playstyles of each character, and this also adds to the replay value as you can play through the game multiple times with different characters, the story being slightly different for each as well. The story is rather bare-bones, but mildly interesting, particularly if you are an Ys fan or a fan of traditional fantasy storylines. Nothing to set the world on fire, but the main characters are likable (particularly Yunica) and the story does not get in the way of the game's main strength: the fast-paced, action-RPG combat. If you've never played an Ys game, particularly the older titles, the game plays as a mix of a top-down hack n' slash and a 2.5 platformer. Many of the skills you gain have dual uses for both platforming and combat, and there is a decent variety of abilities. That being said, there is much more combat than platforming in the game, and while the platforming can be occasionally frustrating, the combat is where the series, and this game in particular, truly shines. Combat requires you to quickly chain together attacks, make smart use of your skills, and avoid enemy attacks by dodging and jumping. Basic enemies are not too difficult, though there is a wide variety of enemy types to fight, all with their different skillsets and strategies. The bosses are the main attraction, being both difficult and surprisingly epic for a game without state-of-the-art graphics. One more thing about this game, and the Ys series as a whole: the music is FANTASTIC! Some of the best videogame music I have ever heard is from this series, and this entry keeps the bar set high. There are quite a few stellar tracks, many of which are boss themes. Overall, I would reccomend this game to any fan of the series, any fan of action RPG's, and any fan of Japanese games. If none of these categories apply to you, then pick this gem up on sale. Trust me, you will not be dissapointed, and maybe you'll become another fan of this underappreciated (but spectacular) series.			"

												I made a Let's Play from it. I think this is worth it.There are a lot of games in the Ys series, several of which are on Steam. This is actually a prequel, set hundreds of years before the main series games.Yet... this is my favorite.The Ys series are action RPGs. What makes them unique is that a level-up should not be underestimated - it makes the difference between getting served by a boss and dominating it. So grinding feels genuinely rewarding, and something you shouldn't have to do much of if you're not playing on higher levels. Plus, the soundtrack absolutely rocks.There is a bit of a Metroid feel as you'll be backtracking and searching around for powerups to help you get further into the tower. There are three characters, and for me the game was never really boring enough not to replay with the other characters. Getting all achievements, however, requires beating the game a total of six times, and on the highest difficulty for three of them. Don't think I'm going for that.The Ys series was never huge on story - you won't find anything revolutionary here. But it's not a problem, since the gameplay more than makes up for it.In summary: Genuinely fun action, great music, and a great intro into the Ys series. GET THIS GAME.			"

												Very cool game, lots of content, and huge replayability. There are 3 characters with different storylines (the third of which is canon), plus there's an abundance of post-game content. This game is an excellently done hack n' slash, one of my favorite games in my library - most played! Definitely worth buying.Edit: I nominated this game for the ""Test of Time"" Award.			"

Ys Origin is an absolutely rock-solid action RPG with a ton of play depth, multiple playable characters, and difficulty levels that make meaningful changes to the gameplay (rather than just modifying damage dealt and received). Even absolute neophytes will be able to clear the game on Very Easy, but every time you go up a level, you have to learn new attack patterns and new ways of dealing with them. The only drawback to the difficulty levels is on the Nightmare difficulty, which pulls the nasty trick of nerfing the XP and SP given by mobs, and turns the game into a long, dull grind.The game opens with two playable characters, and there's a third to be unlocked later. There is also an ""extra"" version of each of the characters with slightly different abilities, an alternate outfit for Yunica, and an unlockable ""arena"" mode that pits you against waves of mobs, complete with online cheaterboards if you're curious who can tweak Cheat Engine the most effectively. That's quite a lot of content!Plot-wise, the game is set in the ancient history of Ys, long before the original Ancient Ys Vanished. This means that Origin is the only Ys game not to feature Adol Christin as the main character (he can be unlocked as a bonus character in the arena, but not in story mode). Instead of Adol, the main characters are important members of the priesthood of Ys, as they seek to contain the spread of demonic energy that's destroying their world. If you're familiar with Ys (particularly the original two games, available on Steam as Ys I & II Chronicles +) there will be lots of material here you'll recognize, but the game is perfectly playable without any Ys background at all.It's hard to go wrong with Ys Origin if you like action JRPGs. There's a lot of play here, and it's a good introduction to the elder statesman of the genre.			"

												Excellent game, hardly any problems to speak of. Would recommend to basically anyone who can still appreciate older style games and who isn't turned off by cheesy japanese storytelling. This game is also very friendly to people with high end PCs, supporting resolutions beyond 1080p and refresh rates beyond 60Hz. The game actually renders very well at higher resolutions, though the character sprites and portraits become somewhat pixelated.Ys Origin is essentially a 3D action platformer in the style of Alundra for PS1, and to some extent the 2D Zelda games. I would compare it to a sped-up Link to the Past. Emphasis is primarily on combat, but also on finding your way through the game. Each area has a few branching sub-areas which you must navigate to find a key to the boss room. This usually involves going through the area until you reack a fork in the road where reaching one end of the fork will activate some switch that will allow you to grab the boss key from the other end of the fork. Combat is very fast and consists of attacking, using special abilities, jumping, and some other moves. You have 3 special abilities that you can use in combat that offer you some mix of damage, utility, and range. The abilities are different for each of the 3 playable characters but serve the same general purpose. Part of the game is figuring out which ability is most effective for the area you are exploring or the enemy you are fighting.The best part about this game is without a doubt the bosses. Every fight throws something completely unexpected, yet refreshingly original at you. Very rarely will you ever go up to a boss and simply whack it until it dies. Almost every boss has a weakness that must be revealed in some way before you get the chance to actually deal damage. And each boss has attacks that you need to dodge in creative ways instead of just running in a circle. I will give the example of what was probably my favorite boss in the game. The boss is basically a centipede where each pair of legs was its own section of body. The way to kill the boss is to destroy each body segment. The challenge lies in the fact that each time you destroy a body segment, it will start spewing poison bombs that explode if left on the ground too long. This severely inhibits your mobility and also throws a lot of extra damage into the mix. Keep in mind the boss is constantly moving, so you not only need to dodge everything, but also catch up to it so you can actually deal damage. By the end of the fight the field is entirely covered in poison bombs and you have to find a way to weave through them, jump on the boss, and kill the last segment before you die. This boss killed me probably 20 times, but it was still a great experience because each time you can make tiny optimizations or notice something new about an attack that will let you avoid it more easily. Though this game actually involves very little actual platforming, the game utilizes 3D space very well. You are constantly moving up and down through the environment which is a nice change from the typical top-down games where everything is just a flat plane. 3D space is even utilized in combat, with airborne enemies that must be taken down with jumping attacks, to boss attacks that can only be dodged by jumping. From my boss example above, the same boss is able to climb on walls, going completely out of your reach. While doing this he will shoot lightning at you, which you must avoid to keep from falling behind. However, you have a special ability that when charged up has a huge vertical range. If you want, you can hit the boss with this move while he is on the wall. This introduces a risk into the fight by letting you hit the boss while he is high up, but you need to come to a stop to use the attack, opening up the possibility of getting hit by the lightning. Many combat moments in the game involes this same sort of risk/reward that weighs more damage against a higher probability of getting hit, which leads me into my next point...This game has no consumable healing items and no way to heal yourself during combat. This is especially relevant during boss fights. You only have one health bar, and you have to kill the boss before he kills you. This makes for very tense fights, knowing that each mistake is permanent, each risk you take is a real risk and can't be immediately undone by healing yourself. These fights are reminiscent of many boss fights in JRPGs where you desperately hope that you can kill the boss before your healers run out of MP. You can't cheese out any boss by spamming healing items each time you take a lot of damage. This game forces you to learn the patterns and exploit the weaknesses of every single boss. The same is true during regular combat, but normal enemies drop health pickups and there is also an accessory in the game that allows you to heal which standing still. Even so, the game sometimes throws extra tough enemies your way, and you are forced to kill the lot of them in one go which can be just as challenging, especially if none of them drop a health pickup. Now for some minor complaints:The game starts throwing really annoying enemies at you late in the game. While I appreciate challening combat where you don't just mash a button until everything dies, these enemies also flat out waste your time either by being extremely resistant to damage or having small, spread out periods of vulnerability.The plot of the game is pretty bottom of the barrel. It's the exact same good vs evil, friendship is power, find your true strength generic japanese crap that we've all heard a million times before. The game isn't quite as cheery as something like Dragon Quest, but you can pretty much predict the exact plot of the game if you've played any other game that follows the same story structure. Here is some stuff that may be good or bad, depending on your tastes:While there are no healing items in the game, you can always just grind levels and become near-invulnerable if you are having trouble with a boss. I would really recomend not doing this, as every boss in the game is beatable in a reasonable amount of tries without this, but it's still possible. Sometimes grinding a bit can really help out, as being underleveled during a boss fight is extremely punishing as you can sometimes be dealing damage in the single digits and taking huge chunks of damage for small mistakes. The game takes place in a tower and only in a tower. This means no towns, you never encounter any new NPCs to talk to, the only ""shop"" is at save points, and the only way to go is up. This does bring about a few perks as well though. If you like streamlined games with no fluff, this is perfect for you. The tower structure also lends itself to being a game with almost zero backtracking through previous levels. The only times you do this are for quick story progression segments. Overall, this game is great and worth playing at least once, if not multiple times with each playable character. It is very reminiscent of older games that were made by a small team of dedicated devs, and you can tell the game was made with love. If you are already a Ys fan, expect something above and beyond. If not, maybe save this one for last becuase I truly think it is the cream of the crop as far as the PC titles go.			"

												I want this game to be the first I reccomend because it deserves no less. Ys Origin has it all: adjustable challenge through many different difficulty levels, many different gaming modes, extremely high replay value through the stories of the three main characters, which should be played in this order: Yunica, Hugo and the third char, each one with a more surprising and amazing story than the previous one, reaching the peak with the third char's story, the canon one, that both blows and completes the other two's stories at the same time. Enjoy the perfect atmosphere that this game has to offer, exploring a dangerous tower while interacting with allies and enemies, making your way towards the surprising ending. So, suck that, Castlevania X; the RPG-platform genre has a new king. To whoever reads this: don't miss this game by any means.			"

												Hi, I've been a fan of Falcom's games since long before they were ever on Steam, lemme tell you why this game owns:- Super satisfying and fast paced action RPG gameplay that's not too simple or too complex.- Three different playable characters with their own unique abilities and stories.- Super awesome soundtrack that accompanies every moment flawlessly.- Can run on a toaster just fine.- Art direction helps keep the dated visuals looking fine even to this day.- Multiple difficulties that match their descriptors, with the higher difficulties being very hard but not unfair.I guess the story is a little weak if you weren't already a fan of the series, and the whole game is just one big dungeon. But this game is first and foremost concerned with delivering a tight and highly polished experience and it delivers in spades. Please play this game.			"

												Is it possible  to have this amount of hours in a game where everyone else played way less than me?yesOh well. that person surely has all the achievments then. *looks it up* wait what D: only like half of theeem?Welcome to ys origin!The Jrpg version of touhou as I often call it. Hell yeah this game is so beautiful and so much fun to play I can't stop it. I always have to  play it again from times to times and I really enjoy every aspect of it. The boss fights are very well made, the normal enemies are awesome, the level system is cool and the skills from all the single characters are absolutely great, the story gets you! just wow! storywise: I recommend to play yunica -> hugo -> claw OR because it's easier Hugo -> yunica -> claw.Please make sure if you want to play the whole game to play the claw as the last character. in the original versions of the game his route was unlocked after completing hugo and yunica. this was changed for the steam version, a mistake in my opinion.The story itself:pretty simple, but amazingWhen you play it for the first time it just gets you. while you become so much stronger, defeat so many enemies and feel like the best the game manages to give you this feel of hopelessness somehow, that even though you're so strong  the enemies are way stronger and that it's like impossible to beat them. the mightyness of the antagonists really makes this story epic. You just feel like you really wanna show them and beat the hell outta them and that you're like an ant standing up before your foe!The characters are all unique and likeable in their own way.I really recommend to play all 3 routes especially because the claw route is the conclusion of the game.The graphics are nothing really special( the game is actually pretty old) but still manage to give this game a great feeling and give the charactersThe music is absolutely fantastic. nothing to say about it other than that. holy maccaroni.this game is a complete 10/10 for me. love every part about it!

												If you're a fan of tough as nails Action-RPG games, with boss fight that demands really on-point reflexes and quick thinking, then this game is for you. The game takes place inside one big tower that you climb, finding items and secrets along the way, and uncovering the reason behind the disappearance of the two Goddess. With 3 Different playthrought, each of them having very different playstyle and a few different bosses, you can get alot of hours of fun. When you finish the story, you can also explore the optional modes : Boss Rush and Arena mode, in which you can test your skills fighting waves of ennemies or bosses.I'd recommend playing on nightmare to experience the full intensity of the boss fights, which really, is what makes the Ys serie so good.

												With its simple 3D environments, beautiful 2d sprite characters and cheesy but epically wonderful music, YS origins reminds me of something that I’d have played on the original PlayStation or the Sega Saturn.  And I mean that as a huge compliment.Caked in classic JRPG atmosphere, simple but lush graphics and addictive arcade style gameplay, YS Origin should yet al the buttons for JRPG fans.  You get a choice of (eventually) 3 characters, all with different playstyles,  and each character follows a different branch of the main story from a slightly different perspective, which means you’ll probably at his for 30 hours to complete all three storylines, which is just enough for this kinda game.  YS forsakes the turn-based combat of most JRPGS for an arcade-action style of button mashing mayhem.  The combat system isn’t very deep, but it’s a hell of a lot of fun in the way that something like Golden Axe or Gauntlet was in the 80s, and magical effects are really beautiful.  However, what really impressed my about YS Origin is the quality of the PC port; its got graphics options galore, has been properly adjusted for PC monitors, supports keyboard and gamepads (go with a gamepad, trust me), and it runs at a constant smooth framerate. Hopefully, Japanese developers will take notice, and this quality of port will become the norm.Fancy a blast down nostalgia lane?  Got an itch for  an action JRPG with simple but addictive gameplay?  Give this a try.			"

												Excellent game.Really, I usually find something to nitpick at, but with Ys Origin, it's darn near impossible, since it's such a solid, satisfying title.STORYLINE: 3/5It's got an entertaining, although kind of cliche, anime-like storyline, that's enough to keep you feeling that you're actually making progress as you play. Nothing out of ordinary here, but not bad either.CONTROLS: 5/5It has fantastic controls. I just finished my first playthrough and started my second one (with another character) using an xbox controller and it plays just awesome. Responsive action, simple, yet rewarding controls. Maybe that's the best part of the whole game, it sounds kind of silly, but it just feels good to control the characters as you go. In a simple sentence: the game just feels amazing on your thumbs as you play.GRAPHICS: 4/5Pretty cool graphics that remind me of PS1's RPG games: anime-like portraits, Ragnarok like sprites, pretty good, overall. The in game effects (such as explosions and fire) are just okay, but the cutscenes are pretty good and nicely rendered.GAMEPLAY: 5/5A simple, intuitive item/level system, with very few choices to make. Reminds me a little of how DMC deals with this kind of thing: you get stronger as the enemies get stronger (no choices in stats), and your weapons compose a little, but handful, arsenal, which you'll have to switch around to get through various enemies/situations. I usually like this kind of system, since it gets me more focused on the gameplay, not on the mechanics, but I do feel they could have done with a little more variety, ability wise. Still, solid system, which absolutely doesn't get frustrating as you go (i.e. no grinding absolutely required, at least on normal dificulty playthroughs).SOUND FX and MUSIC: 3/5Music is pretty cool too, although a bit repetitive. Sound effects are what you'd expect from this kind of game, adds to the good feeling you get from hacking at an enemy (could have used the rumble feature on a controller, though).OVERALL:  4/5Overall, I give this game a solid 4 out of 5 score. It's not a Steam MUST PLAY, but you definitely won't regret going through a couple of playthroughs. If you like old school PS1 RPGs and don't mind (or actually prefer) having little to no control over your character's status and are rather just there for the fun of the combat, I DEFINITELY recommend you get this one.

												This game is a whole lot of fun but it is at its core a prequel. All of the significant plot points and character developments rely on the knowledge of Ys I & II, which you can buy on Steam. If you aren't the type to play 2D games then I would highly recommend Ys: The Oath in Felghana instead of Origin. It plays very similarly but has a pretty engaging closed story and is an absolute blast.If you have played Ys I & II then this is the best game in the series. Origin lets you play through the turmoil that seeds the eventual corruption of Ys. You watch how characters are drawn by fate to play certain roles and see the motifs of the later games form. You get three playable characters with their own stories that justify multiple playthroughs, and they greatly expand on the lore surrounding the Fact line. A strong theme throughout the narrative is whether characters are doomed by fate and their lineage, with an underlying theme of elitism and gender discrimination that get resolved by the end of the story.

												I always enjoy games that utilize the ""Custom main character"" format properly, Ys Origins is a hack-and-slash, Boss fighter adventure game.The keyboard controls could have used a little more work (Namely a more reliable way to properly utilize the dash attack, A mouse is not a correct solution to this problem), Although it's not that difficult to get used to them once you've experimented for a while. Overall it's nothing overly complicated, And is basic enough to understand.The main things I loved about this game wasn't the fact you can play as multiple characters, But rather that elements of the story will change based on who you've selected. The overall plot stays the same, However enough change is made to have one game tell three different stories.			"

												A fantastic action RPG. You'll probably want to play Ys I and II first to properly understand the story, but if you're into challenging bosses with fast gameplay then give this a try.Recommended to do at least one Nightmare difficulty playthrough before you put this down.			"

												Another great YS game, have good storyline. As usual, fast pace action with challenging bosses. Also beautiful artwork. The idea to tell the story with different character point of view is a plus for replayability.Even though the minus is the storyline is to linear, almost no sidequest and/or missable item. Also the control for one of the character is really hard.			"

												Ys Origin showed an extremely unique graphic and art style which was extremely foreign to me when I first started the game. Upon the first few swings of my axe, I knew I was in for an amazing experience. This game's controls and combat system flow so fluently that every kill drew me further and further into the game. Even on Normal Difficulty this game showed the absolute perfect challenge... Hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only on one occassion did I ever beat a boss on the first attempt. Unlike most games where a death to a difficult boss would be frustrating; I never wanted to quit, as every death got me more pumped up than the last.The smooth flow of the game wasn't everything. This games soundtrack took me by storm, as I am a sucker for a game's soundtrack. One amazing song after another... This game never grew dull even for a second. The fact that i have written over 20 words about this game should explain just how much I enjoyed it because I hate reading... and writing... and typing.....Basically what I'm trying to say is this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome, and now has a place in my list of favourite games. :D			"

												This is, so far, one of the most satisfying action games that I have played in recent years. It is deceptively simple in its mechanisms, but it adds layers of different components and tricks as time goes on.  The gameplay is intense, but strategic. The music is equally intense. The game rewards you the faster you cut down foes by rewarding additional XP per hit, but that counter will decrease as time goes on; this encourages you to keep progressing. The boss-fights are intriguing, and are (deservingly) much more difficult than the enemies around them. This requires a more tactical approach than just mashing buttons; you may end up dead before you can blink if you don't pace yourself.  The platforming elements require timing and focus.Your mileage may vary on a few of these next details, but I think that they are good to note. The game doesn't force you through several of the immersion-breaking and random overworld fetch-quests that can detract from other JRPGs, but at the cost of no overword (that I have seen) to explore. I see it as a pro for this particular game as the world around the tower is a wasteland rather than a varied environment to explore. Due to the facts that the game only appears to take place in a tower, that it is an action game based on a relatively simple to use combat system, and that the game is fast-paced, I suspect that some playing this would tire quickly. Play on Nightmare difficulties for getting the most out of the game: truly exhilarating boss-fights.All in all, an excellent game that I recommend highly.			"

 Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.) Note 2: I will be comparing this to Oath in Felghana's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.      This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.      For those of you that don't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were ""tweaked"" or ""improved,"" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.      Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).      In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.      The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.      Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.      On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly ""harder""). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.      Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.      This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.      To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.      Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.

												Ys: Origin is a prequel to the other Ys games. I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much because the main story isn’t about Adol and instead of exploring different areas, the goal is to climb a tower. I expected it to be light on plot and repetitive, but I should have known that the Ys series wouldn’t disappoint. Each area of the tower was unique and varied and I played the game twice with different characters learning more about their stories. The plot was good, the gameplay was lots of fun and Origin lived up to the quality of the later Ys games.			"

Now yes I recommended that you try Oath of Felgana just to test the waters but this game is for those who want to know the backstory behind it all.  Despite it being set in the Tower of Solomon, it has plenty of replayability and each character has their own speed and attack power so choose carefully and go for it.  There will be times where you'll need to consult an FAQ to track your progress because backtracking is involved and you'll be doing a lot of that to move forward.  Is it worth trying out for yourself? Well, you be the judge and find out.			"

Anyway. game is very nicely made. another one that proves you dont need the most advanced graphics to be a good game. This is like a Triforce.... A harmonious union of Gameplay, story and graphics. Otherwise known as... a video game.			"

												A fun little action/RPG to kill time with, especially if you are a fan of the series as a whole. The music is good and the graphics are good for a game that was developed over ten years ago. Only problem is that the game is repetitive and that there is not much difference in gameplay if you are playing multiple playthroughs Still a solid game nonetheless9/10			"

												While the story isn't really that long and unless you are playing on the highest difficulty, I think you can finish the game in around 8 - 12 hours. There are 3 characters, each with a different story. All three characters have different skills and this allows you to use different tactics for the same boss. Grinding isn't really needed as by the time you get to the final boss you should have the minimum requirement to beat the boss. Overall it is a fun and fast paced ARPG. Just don't play through all 3 characters' story in one shot like I did, it is quite tiring~ XD			"

												This is definitely a Classic style Action JRPG. The boss battles are downright cruel and the environment is challenging enough to annoy you, but the smooth, responsive and easy to setup controls, compensated for the difficulties. The backstories are interesting. When you finish the game for the first time, it will unlock the third character, do another playthrough with this character to reveal the whole storyline, it's worth it.			"

												Ys series in general are not very long and their challenge level is fair with minimal grinding required. This one is a bit of exception in length and challenge, but not as negative aspects. While the length for one character is the average of any other Ys, the replay value lies in the fact there are THREE characters in total, each one with their own play style and emphasizing one aspect or another. And the story also changes itself, showing things that happens with that character while it was not on camera to another, or sometimes fate itself will twist and a whole new situation will unfold.For those seeking for challenge, bosses and enemies can be blazed through in easier difficulties, grinded in average ones, or skillfully fought in later difficulties. I could go on and on in an in-depth analysis of this game, but I will keep it short and simple: if you want a good story and challenge, Ys Origin is your game.			"

												If you enjoy playing action role-playing games (particularly those from Japan), Ys Origin is a solid investment.  At first, the level designs and monsters were fairly basic, but this is not so much of an issue as you progress higher up the tower.  The amount of variety in the demon designs and floor designs later on isn't spectacular, but keep in mind this is all going on inside of a tower.  The bosses--I would say--are the only exception.  The level and skill system revolve around finding new equipment and gems.  Although simple in design, there is just enough variety to keep you interested.  The story itself is alright (at least to the point where I am at...), and the characters aren't too bad.  You won't be interacting with them too much anyway.  In order to improve your character's own abilities and the abilities of some of your weapons and other equipment, the game allows players to cash in the SP dropped by defeated demons.  This SP is cashed in at the game's Goddess statues, which also serve as save points.  Generally, the distance between these save points is just the ""right"" distance.  If you don't know what difficulty to play at, I would recommend the ""normal"" difficulty setting.  Normal might seem too easy at first, but the game becomes significantly harder later on.  However, action RPG veterans will likely want to bump up the difficulty a notch or two.  If not at the normal price, then consider adding Ys Origin to your Steam library the next time the game is on sale.			"

												As the first game of the Ys series i played, it was a great experience! It got even better when i found out whilst playing through my first run that actual members of quintet came from famicom! fyi, quintet was a legendary team of game developers who made the gaia series, a trilogy of imo the greatest action rpgs ever made.Anyhows back to Ys: It's full of action, every room you find yourself slashing your way through monsters (or firing your lazers as hugo)! The boss fights are always compelling, i liked the way you could simply jump onto most of the bosses at whack em on the head!The story is compelling, and i won't spoiler, but to understand most of what is going on you should play through at least once with all the characters~I recommend this to anyone who loves action rpgs or hack n' slashes, its a great game and it has brought me to love the world of Ys!

												This is the 1st YS series I've completed thus far. Game run smoothly except a black screen issue with Window 10 during the cut scene that can be resolved easily. YS: Origin is fun and addictive action JRPG with great storyline that does not requires extensive grinding which usually discourage me from continuing a game. Very value added as you get to play as 3 different characters in each story mode to understand what truely happens in the game. Boss fight is challenging and if you can't beat it, leveling up 1~2 levels actually makes the difficulty much more easier. It's exceptionally good for players who simply wants to enjoy beating the game without getting stuck in a stage.			"

The game plays incredibly smoothly, has great mechanics and can be difficult while remaining fair. It also has an excellent soundtrack that can comfortably switch between orchestral pieces and heavier, driving pieces with electric guitar. In all, the game is very well put together with good options for replayability. Most importantly, it is a lot of fun. This is a great entry point for the series and I recommend it highly.			"

												Ys Origin! The game is amazing if only for its music. But the gameplay is awesome too! It is also different from other Ys games because you have mutliple characters with different stories. They go through the same locales, but they have very differenet playing styles and different cutscenes. It reminds me a bit of Sonic Adventure 2, where you have the Hero and Dark paths. The same basic mechanics are on both sides, but the story is different.Either way, it is a really fun game and has difficulty settings from the chill game player to the crazy gamer. It is on the upper escelon of action games that you probably didn't play.			"

												Ys Origin is a fast-paced hack and slash rpg, there is no staying behind and preparing your mana... Thats probably the same as giving away openings to your enemies in this game.I love these kinds of games, and cannot wait for them to release it for the PS Vita! Ys Oath in Felghana runs on the same engine it appears, but if you want another Ys game but a little bit different, pick up Ys Seven, it's awesome.Played this game for 40 minutes, and im already lovin' it! Haven't faced a boss yet, but im guessing it's very much like Oath in Felghana; learn the moves and dogde them, look for openings, and try not to take any damage (make sure you are at the appropriate level for the boss fight!).Don't worry about being bored grinding up levels, it's not all that boring, it's quite addictive if you enjoy this kind of gameplay. the more hits, the bigger the combo, the more XP you earn, and this is very fast-paced!There's loot to pick up, items and armor to find, checkpoints to activate, and magical objects to obtain that gives you special skills! I've played through Ys Seven on my PS Vita, and it took more than 20 hours to complete!Ys Origin is an addictive and fun game that you should check out on youtube. If it strikes your fancy, i recommend you pick it up!			"

												""Ys Origin is a Japanese action role-playing game developed and published by Nihon Falcom for Microsoft Windows in 2006."" (Wikipedia, November 2013)I've played this RPG for 45 hours on the hardest of the 5 difficulties (nightmare, hard, normal, easy, very easy) with ""Hugo"" (1 of 3 characters) and completed it by level 52. I found the story to be a run-of-the-mill ""good guy wants power, turns evil temporarily, and repents through the power of friendship/love"". I'm generally not the type of guy to delve into, and enjoy, the story of a game very much anyways, so I didn't mind it. In fact, considering that I look for ""great gameplay"" in games, and what type of gameplay I'll tend to go for, I would practically expect a story to be ""the usual"" in a game (not to say I haven't enjoyed original stories). I don't know how the story goes with the other 2 characters, since I haven't played them yet.This game, played with a top-down camera angle, plays kinda like a shooter when Hugo is the chosen character, as his attacks revolve around shooting magic missiles straight ahead of him. After a quick test run, the other 2 characters appear to revolve around close-range melee combat. On the hardest difficulty level, the bosses offer such a challenge that you'll find yourself grinding a lot, just to gain that extra level or two and be able to defeat the boss at all (and even then, your battle strategy better be near perfect). This game has some simple puzzle-solving, if you can even call it that. You'll find yourself having to press buttons, defeat certain enemies, obtain and use items/skills, and so on. I did enjoy the challenging gameplay, but it would get frustrating at times with bosses, and also 1 time with a certain enemy that can practically insta-kill you (but that you'll still have to deal with). The only thing to do there is keep looking around for equipment and the like, and grind in special spots to gain levels.If you want to know how nice the graphics look, just ""You-Google-Tube"" some gameplay footage on the game. And while you're at it, check out the soundtrack for it as well. It's pretty awesome. As of this post, the game is normally $19.99 USD on Steam and I'd say it's worth the price if you love to spend many hours on a challenging ""battle-grind"" RPG. If it turns-out that you love the game, then you may also love ""Ys: The Oath in Felghana"", which follows a similar gaming style. You may want to avoid Ys I & II though, which has your main attack revolve around ramming into enemies (like in Hydlide), which ruins any sense of ""gameplay"" (at least in my opinion).			"

												Can't really place why Origin stands out as my favourite in the Ys series, but it just does. The gameplay is fast, fun and fluid and the boss fights are challenging yet rewarding. Youre standard enemies are easy to kill and don't provide much of a challenge at all, they really only exist to grind if you want to when the bosses start kicking you♥♥♥♥♥ Three main story characters, all of which have unique fighting styles and individual stories, really help to make the game feel whole.On their own, the stories are jagged and a bit weak. The writing is VERY amateurish in my opinion, but that adds to the charm of the game. The sometimes hilariously bad dialogue makes it feel as though you're playing through an early 90's anime, but the incredible combat makes up for it. It's a fast paced game but definitely not for everyone. If you're hesitatnt, i'd recommend checking out some gameplay footage or waiting until it goes on sale.			"

												After playing Ys I + 2, and Ys: Oath in Felghana, I had high expectations for this one. They were met and exceeded.* Great music * Great gameplay - boss fights are amazing, and beating a boss on the higher difficulty settings is really satisfying* Responsive controls - if you fail at the game, it's on you, not the controller* Three different characters to play as, with different styles and viewpoints of the game's events* Difficulty options are appreciated. I did a hard playthrough and a couple of easy playthoughs because I was a little more interested in story things than brutal gameplayI'll probably come back to this one later for a nightmare difficulty playthrough. Or three.Only real downside is the game setting and pacing is pretty much the same for all of the characters, so the third playthrough started to wear on me a bit. In hindsight, I shouldn't have played through it 3x without any other games mixed in to keep things fresh.Nice Bonus - the .ogg files work with my mp3 player, unlike Oath of Felghana's.			"

												Good combat and a fair story are the strong points of this game.Extremely linear progression and the fact that you are confined to a tower for pretty much all of the play are it's cons.You play as three characters (a playthrough for each, one being unlockable after finishing with one of the other two) through the story mode to unravel their story as they ascend the demon tower, battling monsters and large bosses along the way. The story itself is fair, with some expected plot twists (and some not so expected) but doesn't have that much in the funny side. Everyone seems more into serious business mode. So if you want something with laughs this isn't really the game.Combat is real time, meaning that for the most part your skill at dodging attacks will determine your success, mostly in the harder difficulties. You don't get healing items nor healing magic either but some enemies drop use-on-pickup items. Some heal, some boost a stat for a time, and there's also currency drops you use to buy upgrades. A gripe I have is that the items and currency are dropped pretty much everywhere when killing monsters and because they disappear over time, you sometimes have to choose between clearing the room or pausing to run around to grab the spread items. Each character has basic attacks, including jump and jump attacks, and obtain magic items through the game that allow them to use special abilities used mainly for battle but are sometimes needed to get past certain parts of the game. There's no puzzles here either so most of the time you are either in combat or reading the story.Speaking of sounds, there's no voice acting here and the music is pretty much midi based. In fact all sounds remind me of the final 16 bit (SuperNES) to early 32 bit (PS1) era games so don't expect a John Williams score here.Visuals are the same. Characters and common enemies are all sprite based(they do have beautiful portraits), while the stage and bosses use very low polygon models, akin to PSP games. Sprites are drawn in the chibi style while portraits use the usual serious anime way. The one complain I have about the visuals is that the whole game takes place in a tower where all rooms are similar in terms of textures and such, only changing their color every few stages. Sure, no room is the same and there's plenty of enemies to get you busy, but I myself like variety of backdrops and open spaces. Then again hard to do when the premise of the game is to explore a big round demon tower.Overall it's a good game I can recommend to throw yourself back with a simple yet effective gameplay, simple visuals that while similar, don't completely bore in my opinion, and a good story to boot.

												Hmmm not sure how I feel about this game. I think it would be 5,000x easier if I had a gamepad to play this with and not just a keyboard and mouse. The controls are infuriating and I haven't tried to see if I can mess with the controls yet. I think if I got a controller this would be way more fun!			"

Ys OriginStoryYou follow the story of Yunica Tovah, Hugo Fact & The Claw and the events that takes place 700 years before Ys 1 and tells the back-story of Ys, Darm Tower, the Black Pearl, the twin goddesses, and the six priests.GameplayYou have the option to play as one of two characters, a third character is playable after completing the game once with either Yunica or hugo on any difficulty level, on five different difficulty levels ranging from very easy to nightmare which is sure to give all types of gamers a challenge. The game can get a bit grindy at times but overall the gameplay is fast and exciting with allot of button smashing that makes you feel like you just went a round at the gym.After you played through with all the characters I suggest you give Time Attack a try which is a mode where you only fight the bosses and try to beat them as fast as possible. The replay value of the story mode is not that great if you ask me, unless you haven't played it in a good while.Unlike Ys 1 & 2 where you run into enemies to damage them you now have a Action/Attack button, as well as a Jump button, which is a nice change from the bump system.SoundThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing which is no surprise since the Ys series always had a great soundtrack.GraphicsThe graphics looks nice on newer as well as a bit older PC's and gives you that RPG feeling.Final wordsAll in all Ys Origin is a great game you shouldn't miss if you are a A-RPG fan.+Boss fights are great and gets your blood pumping.+Amazing soundtrack.-Can get a bit grindy.Score: 8/10 "

												Ys Origin is a highly entertaining ARPG that let's you slice, smash, and burn your ways through demons floor after floor. The first Ys game as far as the lore background of the series is concerned, Ys Origin takes place several hundred years before the events of the first game and portrays several issues that have only been mentioned by name or entirely left in the dark in the previous Ys games.In the game's main mode, you can choose one of two (later three) heroes to reach the top of a mysterious demonic tower in pursuit of two goddesses. Though the game mechanics and the tower itself are identical for all characters, each plays a bit differently - Yunica is a fairly tough melee fighter with useful area of attack special abilities, while Hugo is a range-centric mage with a strong standard attack and largely defensive skills. The third, unlockable character finally is goes full rogue, being capable of dishing out lots of damage in close combat yet also sharing Hugo's fragile nature.Unless you plan to start in nightmare mode right away, the difficulty of the game generally is reasonable. Trash mobs typically do not pose much of a challenge unless you are seriously underleveled (and this problem can be solved with a bit of grinding), but the boss fights more than often will take you multiple tries to find the right strategy. Fortunately, this rarely becomes frustrating, not to the least because the game's fantastic soundtrack is one hell of a motivating factor.Story-wise, the game is okay-ish. Though Ys Origins does answer lots of questions propped open by the earlier games, two of the three playable character follow the old ""THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP(tm)"" plotline, with daddy issues galore. Ys Origins certainly has its moments, the plot will become fairly predictable if you've ever played a JRPG beforeDespite of its minor flaws, Ys Origin still is a more than decent ARPG and one of the better parts in the Ys series.
