												Extremely recommended. One of the best game I have recently played.Keep reading, or download the Demo and try it for yourself. Yes, there is a DEMO available.GameplayYou see stuff from above like, isometric map perspective: you navigate the lands from one hexagonal tile to another. All the time.This costs points. When it's rainy or dark, it will cost more points.When you reach a city hex, you can loot the location. This, also, will costs you points. Sometimes you will find amazing stuff, and sometimes only scraps of paper. But even those could be useful. Actually, when you start to know the game better, every gôddåmn item is useful!You will find more stuff if you use a crowbar, or have a light source with you. But beware as this will make more noise and attract people towards your location.Looting can also just hurt yourself... like roof collapse. Shït happens right?So you loot, equip yourself with what you find, and stroll around. Until some dude approaches and gets to your hex.CombatThe combat is textual. You won't have the map view anymore. But instead, you'll be presented with an interface showing your dude's and opposition's status, and a list of actions you can execute. Everything you will do, like throwing a punch, will have a narrative text describing what's happening. So it's mostly READING ya hear? No explosions there.But don't be fooled... you can trip on the ground and fall. While on the ground you can try and grab the hostile down, you can crawl back and try to escape, drop your stuff and run like hell, etc. A lot of realistic possibilities here. It is extremely hard. Your first encounter will probably be your last.DiseaseGetting hurt, bleeding, being cold, drinking shït water... these will have consequences. Try to disinfect your wounds, patch'em up and don't let 'em getting infected. Be careful of what you eat too... could be POISONOUS you never know muhahah.Unless you are a doctor, in which case you will have a clear descriptions of your symptoms like, ""Cholera 3; final stage; certain death"", you won't know what illness you just caught... you will have ""stomach cramps"", you'll be like ""vomiting""...So just act as in real life: grabs antibiotics, clean every wounds. Don't take any chances. Ever. Why? Because the game has...PermadeathYep. Die and restart the whole game. No save point, and that is intended. You won't bring stuff with you from your last play. Nope, nothing. It's up to YOU to level up. And this is where I disagree on the game mechanics. I am fine with dying and learning. But ya know the beginning of the game starts to be boring once you know it. And redoing the same stuff is just a waste of time. Hence I created a little tool[tacticalfreak.blogspot.com] to actually still save and, well, cheat. I advise players to die a lot first, and when you feel you are ready, just use my tool.But even if you use it to reload an old save, it won't matter much, because...It's randomThe map is randomly generated. But not when you first start the game, nope. It is randomly generated as soon as you discover a tile. So saving the game and loading an old save will still yield something different :DThis is why I am a little ""against"" the permadeath. Loading an old save is not THAT bad. You will experience a whole different game. I would've liked just... ya know, an auto-save every night or something.Anyway except for a few spots in the map that will never change, all the rest is random. Random but fair. You won't like be in a desert without cities for miles ever. They are spawned correctly.Even if you are a new player, you CAN make it. Yes because in the end, it's just logic.Contrary to Faster Than Light (FTL) where there is NO WAY a new player will make it to the end because the randomization is too... random. In NEO Scavenger, the RNG is just right.Crafting stuffAs I said all the items there are useful. Somehow. Because you can craft and even ""uncraft"" stuff. If someone is giving you stuff, or if you finally found something of value... maybe you can try to ""reverse engineer"" it and discover HOW IT WAS BUILT. How awesome is that uh? Found a bow arrow? But you have no idea how to create one yourself? No problem!There are also a lot of crafting recipes there. And many different combinations will work. Like you could use your crowbar to roast meat when you don't have a wood stick! Doesn't matter, both categorizes as a kinda ""shaft."" So it's extremely smart and flexible. If you are lacking you favorite saucepan to boil water... just think a second... can't anything else, more common, be used as a saucepan? Eh, when I found that out, I literally doubled my lifespan. No shït. Think hard.NarrationIt reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2. You had that little description box in the lower left which would describe what was going on. Here it's a bit the same. With random encounters or special places being very well described. There is a lot of dark humor too. If you are not averse to reading you will like it and also find that it's well written.StoryThere is a story. Your first goal will obviously be to survive, and so, to find something to cover your feet :) But after that painful initial phase, you will meet strange people. You will find places of interest. Or you will find new recipes that... use high tech items you had no idea were in the game.The story is interesting and is closely related to the narrative part of the game: the only way to tell you stuff is through old newspapers and stuff. Those are funny as well...OX news reporting hoaxes ;)AudioEvery single one item has its own sound effect. Which is played when you grab the item from you inventory. That's it. But that's HUGE. There is a little music, but it gets a bit repetitive.ConclusionIf you like Fallout, post-apocalyptic worlds, a good narration, turn by turn mechanics and a pretty realistic game then don't hesitate. It's a masterpiece.You still unsure? --> try the demo and make your own opinion.			"

								Be prepared to die...a LOT!  And with ""permadeath"" that means you will be met with a black screen unceremoniously alerting you to your demise, manner of death and hours you managed to keep this poor guy alive.  Now, don't assume that this is put forth as a criticism because that is the appeal to this survival game.  After succumbing to the countless manners of death you begin to appreciate the fragility of humanity in this post-apocalyptic world.  Every decision begins to weigh on the player as you try to balance all the needs of survival.  I suppose there IS a way to ""win"" the game, though I've never seen it.  For me the appeal is simply the test to see how long you can stay alive while dodging the raiders, bandits, the elements, wild beasts, disease, dehydration, famine - I'm sure you get the point.  Go ahead and eat that rancid hunk of meat you found because the immediate fear of famine out-weighs the ramifications of food poisoning you will have to deal with tomorrow.  This is an early access game so there will be problems.  The only bug I encountered was a turn bug that caused the time to keep clicking by until he just died.  Only happened to me once, but it was frustrating just the same.  The developer is aware of the issue and promises a fix.  There may also need to be a few play-balance adjustments because as I said it is really difficult to get deep into the game.  There are lots of interesting traits to choose when beginning the game, but honestly ""toughness,"" ""melee,"" and ""strength"" are the main ones you have to have or you will not survive the first night to even begin to utilize the other abilities.  Combat is unique and interesting once you figure out the order the text reads out, and how the interface deals with multiple enemies.  This is a flash game with tons of depth.			"

								I've played this game on and off for nearly two years. I've followed it's development since it was first announced, and every time I come back I fall in love again. This game combines the brutality of dwarf fortress, the atmosphere of fallout, and world layout of civ to create a true masterpiece. This game is in a class of it's own.			"

												EDIT 10.9.15:I love this game. One time, I got shot by an arrow. I ducked under cover, then pulled the arrow out. Then I stabbed my assailant to death with it. One time, I was attacked by two dogs immediately after starting a game. I was naked (save for a thin hospital gown) and I had no weapons. As they charged me, I grabbed some shards of glass on the ground, and following a lengthy battle that I ultimately won, I used said shards to skin the dogs' carcasses and then made gloves out of them. Then I died of blood loss.One time, I was attacked in the middle of a stormy night by two mutants trying to steal my shopping cart loaded with supplies. After I brained one of them, the other scattered. I gave chase, and dispatched it following a cross-tile pursuit. However, upon return to my camp, my cart was gone. The mutant corpse, mysteriously absent as well. Using my tracking ability, I followed the thief several tiles down, and discovered it was another mutant, slowly pushing my cart southwest, his deceased comrade most unceremoniously stuffed inside with the rest of the contents. I moved in and caved its skull in with one fell swoop. I felt no pity, no remorse. I really needed those 5 empty bottles.10/10 excellent post apocalyptic hobo simulatorIt's worth noting that there are a lot of mods available that greatly expand the game's potential.			"

								I had a Strong Melee Hacker, with lockpicking, a crowbar strap, and a box cart. None could stand in my way, not even the Detroit Mercs could withstand my maniacal crowbar swinging techniques. I was immortal. I confidently strode through the Michigan wastes knowing that I could never die. I came across some water in an urban location. I was a bit parched and decided to sate my thirst on the water. I didn't need to boil it, I was immortal! I drank the water, and a few hours later my charcter began to develop severe diarrhea as my skin turned a horrific shade of blue. I checked my supplies, I had no antibiotics, I needed to get to the health clinic. I desperately made my way to Detroit. 3 hexes away from gate 11 my character died from Cholera. I lost everything and died because I was too lazy to boil my water. 10/10 would play again.			"

								I don't normally write serious reviews. I'm one of those undesirable ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that uploads the ""11/10 uninstall function works great"" review, but NEO Scavenger will be my exception. You have no idea how hard it will be for me to not write ""I murdered a naked guy while wearing a clown mask"", but I will get through it, for this amazing game.Let's start with the basics; you're some random guy (avoiding spoilers) that has just woken from cryogenic sleep during the apocalypse somewhere around the city of Detroit. After a friendly interaction with a lovely creature known as a ""Dogman"", you step outside to  experience the outside world of Michigan... and dang, it's cold. Like, ""Oh my God I can't feel my feet and I'm feeling really sleepy"" cold. After a few deaths and several hours of learning the basics (don't eat random berries or mushrooms you find unless  you know they aren't poisonous, that guy with the broken bottle really wants to eat your leg, and yes, it's cold, put some pants on) you really get into this game. As others have said, however, an ungodly amount of time can be spent on this game, and it can never be taken back. In a sense, it's like DayZ. You spend 3 hours finding a weapon, finding your friends wherever they are on the map, and end up faffing around until some gruesome death by either a glitching zombie or a player that only speaks Russian. This, I believe, is another selling point of NEO Scavenger. In the beginning, you get used to dying. After a while, however, you end up living longer and longer, until one life lasts you hours of real life time. Everything is peachy until that one night you decide to sleep in a forest and forget to set up a noise trap or hide, and you're stabbed to death by some plague-ridden nutcase in your sleep. After a day or two of angry avoidance of the game, you decide to give it a second chance, innocently, you pour more hours into it, only to die in a similar manner. It's a beautiful circle of life (death)!With such extensive content already and more updates to come, NEO Scavenger is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardcore survival games, and/or murdering innocents with his/her bare hands whilst wearing nothing but a Ronald McDonald lookalike mask and a hospital gown. (Damn, I said I wouldn't write that.)			"

												An awesome survival game.Challenging to the newer players, and for myself, with about 60 hours in game, still a struggle to stay alive for long lengths of time.It has multiple playstyles to suit however you'd like to play:   -Want to be a survivalist who uses ranged weaponry to hunt wild animals? Go for it.   -Want to use melee weapons, wreaking havoc upon any foe who walks in your path? Go for it.   -Want to fight for justice, destroying any and all inhumane religious cults that have arisen? Go for it.   -Feel a need to slaughter any human, animal, or whatever the hell you find in the wasteland? Go for it.   -Want to knock people out, steal their shoes, and then leave them barefoot in the middle of a wasteland? Go for it.   -Want to be insane, kill anyone you see, AND become a cannibalistic maniac? I think you know the answer.With multiple in-game skills, the possibilities are endless.  You can be an overweight combat medic, a melee proficient electrician with a high metabolism, a weak and brittle botanist, an athlete with insomnia; There are many different combinations you can choose from.  You just need to find the right kit to suit yourself- with the ability to deal with freezing weather, wild dog attacks, and insane cultists.An awesome game that is definitely worth the money.  The creator of the game is very willing to fix bugs, communicates with the players whenever the chance arises, and listens to any and all feedback.In my book, a definite 10/10			"

												Picked this up on a lark, as I am heavily into survival games lately. I was hesitant due to the low res, pixel graphics, but man am I glad I took a chance on this!What stands out immediately is choice and consequence. You can't have it all. You have to build a character with weaknesses, and weaknesses can just be not having some of the skills you might like to have, or it can be actual weaknesses to give you points to get more benefits.You might take Fragile for example, making you take more damage than normal if you get hit, and you might do this because you really want the points it gives you to take Trapping so you can make fire right away at the start of the game.You might take Strong so you can carry more and Melee so you can close combat better, but this might mean you don't get Ranged skil and therefore cannot make arrows, and have limited range skill with guns and other range weapons.Anyway, you make your choices and take your shot. Into the game you go and immediately your character choices effect your first encounter, in terms of whether you survive, escape, get hurt or kick the ♥♥♥ of the first opponent.You survived the fight (maybe) and now you gotta get fire, you gotta get a weapon, you need clothing, you need shelter, you need a supply of food and water, and you need to get these things without attracting too much attention from the local wildlife. How you do this is up to you and there is little to no help from the game. You gotta figure it out, and fast, cause you are getting cold and soon you'll be needing somewhere to sleep.RnG can help you or hurt you here, and at first I was like, well you need some good rolls to start, but later you learn it's more about playing smart, and persistently scavenging until you get what you want.You have to be concerned about the noise you make, the tracks you leave, and even your scent, as you get through those nail biting first turns until you finally get to the point where you are not struggling and can start to carve your way through the world.Now you start to get pleasantly surprised because you find there is depth in the game. Depth in the combat system, depth in the crafting system, and it's challenging because you are gonna die if you are not careful. You might kill that wolf, but you took a scratch that is gonna get infected because you didn't find or craft any clean bandages, and haven't managed to find something to act as a dis-infectant. Left untreated this may progress to septis, and ultimately death.On the other hand, if you are not careful in combat, being tactical, the wolf just may kill you outright.Items decay, so in the long game you need to be able to get a backup supply... and then you start to find that there is actually a story here... WHAT YOU SAY?!?!?!?! I thought I was just enjoying a really great survival game, and BAM... all of a sudden I ran into some story elements and again realize this modest little game is actually filled with depth and fun, and a reason to keep playing, try to live longer, try to figure out just why and how you came to be here, and what you can do to go beyond surviving.There is a reputation system, and good versus evil behaviour. You can save the damsel in distress or throw in your lot with the bandits. It can be dark, really dark. You don't just kill stuff... you murder it... you rip people apart in scenarios where it's either you or them... fight or die... and sometimes you win just to find out later, you lost.If you give Neo Scavanger half a chance, you'll find a real gem here. A game which has been clearly and cleverly thought out to provide many hours of entertainment. I'm about 168 hours in as I write this, and still haven't seen 60% of the map. Lots and lots of fun to be had for a bargain basement price! Seriously.. if you like survival, buy this!			"

												NEO Scavenger is a turn-based, post-apocalyptic, survival roguelike with perma-death. I also now sometimes fondly call it a Procedural Death Michigan. It's mean, immersive, annoyingly addictive and seems to strongly dislike players wearing right boots (left boots are fine).Basically, you scavenge around (and die after the building crumbles on you), fight other people scavenging around (and die valiantly with monkey wrench in hand) or try to talk to them (and die a turn later by drinking a celebratory made-it-through-the-turn sip of poisoned water), try to kill creatures that would like to eat you almost as much as you'd like to eat them (and die hungry), craft items to help you survive (and die warm because your fire alerted every deadly thing around), keep track of your hunger, thirst, diseases and injuries (and die very informed) or try to get to the seemingly last big hub of civilization (and die trying to get there; or trying to get in; or after you get in; or on your way back out).In short this is a game where you try to make it through the day while figuring out what has happened to your hero and the world - and die trying. I really don't want to spoil this too much for you, but rest assured, whether you prefer dying by traumatic brain injury, blood loss, cholera, dehydration or an angry mob, there are enough options there to suit everyone's tastes. And if that doesn't sound fun to you, go away, I don't like you.-----And here's some actual analysisNEO Scavenger is the chess of survival games, if chess came without an instruction manual and forced you to scramble to understand its rules. It's all about making tactically sound moves, about the constant weighing of risk-reward decisions, but without ever feeling certain you made the right choice. Very much like real life in that way. The gameplay mechanics, while seemingly unforgiving, are actually there to remind you that you are not a badass superhero, just an average person thrown into a huge mess. Combined with the deliberate obfuscation of the player stats, this feeling of vulnerability makes the game surprisingly immersive. It's an exercise in role playing and player driven choices based on gut feeling rather than number crunching.Quite realistically for an average Joe, going in situations guns-a-blazing will rarely be rewarded, running away and hiding your tracks from a bunch of stray dogs may. The combat is a constant dirty struggle of trying to get the upper hand while dancing around your opponent, surprisingly complex and rewarding for something delivered with a few buttons and a bit of text. But even with great equipment and a character with decent combat skills, every fight you survive will leave you weakened, hurt, tired and more vulnerable to the next threat that comes along. In that way, the combat, as well as the deeply simulated survival and sickness mechanics, enhance the constant feeling of being exposed and alone, afraid and uncertain in the middle of a hostile world. You are never allowed to feel safe. You are never allowed to hunker down, build a huge base, put fences around it and kill everything that dares come through. Throughout the game, the mechanics drive you to keep moving on, keep surviving day to day, keep doing mundane inventory management, and keep trying not to die. And almost always failing.But dying here isn't always a bad thing. Since you can't really improve your skills, (though you can add to them in a limited way) you need to die to improve, to learn, to realize how to make better choices next time. You even need to die to learn more of the world, simply because you can never uncover everything in one playthrough. Which brings us to the story.Behind the immersive atmosphere and the fun, unforgiving gameplay mechanics, hides an interesting, complex, well-written story and huge amounts of lore and flavour text delivered both in long screens and in tiny bites literally everywhere you look. The story will never beat you over the head with what you should do next (and it's fair to say you should remain doubtful when it seems to do that), so it is perfectly ignorable if you just enjoy the sandbox game. But it's worth getting into, and it's also worth remembering that every time you think you know all the possible answers to a question, there's likely more there to discover, if only you do things slightly differently next time (by having a different build, carrying different items, making different choices, going down a different path, uncovering different information). The mystery of the story is a sprawling, complicated puzzle, one you will not solve easily, even by finishing the game the first few times.If it looks as if I'm ignoring the game's flaws, it's because to be honest I enjoy the game too much to notice them most of the time. That said, the UI could be friendlier to newcomers (which is a polite way to say it's pretty unintuitive); thankfully it's perfectly serviceable once you get used to it. Also, while obfuscating stats is an interesting and perfectly valid design choice, obfuscating some of the less intuitive game mechanics is simply an annoying hurdle to climb over when you first start out. In more technical matters, the cookie-based save system (one of the few elements there to constantly remind you that this is still a flash game) can be a real pain, the game doesn't play well with many commonly used modern resolutions and the process of adding mods is a bit too archaic and involved for most players these days. Even more importantly, there is a very valid argument to be made about how well a perma-death roguelike game with unforgiving mechanics can still make for a deep story-based experience that is more enjoyable than frustrating.But even with all its problems, as you may have gathered I think this is a great game: the perfect flawed little gem, and in my head already a cult classic.

												TL/DR at endGame is hard, but good.Until you find out the game is using 2-5GB of temporary internet files as your ""save data"" and cleaning your computer wipes your save, every time. Devs started with an internet flash game, and ended with an internet flash game. they can't even code the save files into real save files so that long-run gameplay (about a month or two in in-game 'time') doesn't start lagging. seriously, a game that is not server based and has low quality graphics lagging because devs can't code a proper save file. sad too, it had potential.EDIT:The fact that it is a flash save file IS the issue.the file being deleted upon cleaning your computer is just one of the problems that arise from the issue.If you clean your temporary internet files, even through chrome, firefox, or IE, like any halfway tech savy computer user from time to time, your save file WILL be deleted, as the files are stored in your temporary internet files, which is what gets wiped. This is something the devs SHOULD have anticipated, unless they are idiots who never maintain their computersThere is also the fact that the save file for one game gets HUGE because flash is not meant to save long term memory. While I have over 7TB hard drive space on my computer, so a 6GB save file goes practically unnoticed, this is not the case for everyone, and this also creates bigger problems that are not related to how much space you haveThe biggest issue is that the more you play the more the game lags because of this saving method, as flash games are not meant to continuously read and update a save file that big. The lag isn't apparent at first, but play and survive in the game for a few ingame months. you will start to notice stuttering and lag no matter what kind of computer you are running it on, beacuse the issue is with the game itself and flash player. A 2GB plus flash save file is unacceptable and just bad foresight by the devs, not to mention 6GB+ when you've been playing the game for a while.So yes, you could blame google chrome, firefox, CCCleaner, whatever for the save file deletion. But you have to blame the devs for using such a stupid system. For not knowing how or wanting to code a good save system. THEY are the ones who chose to put a decent sized persistant universe into a flash save file. THEY are the ones who decided to give their game a save system that will eventually make your saves unplayable.You can argue all you want, but the devs are the ones who made the decisions that gave thier game a crippling handicap. Maybe the game was never meant to be anything more than an online flash game, and for that game, that would be ok. But to package it as a game on steam when the game has that kind of major flaw? That is entirely dev screwupEDIT 2:To show that this is not the only issue with the game, but the one that overshadows everything else into making me write a negative review, here's some critiques i gave to an idiot who has his head to far in the sand:""The fact that I cannot rely on my save game's integrity, either due to the way the game saves or the lag in a single player game that is a result of that flaw, is a HUGE deal breaker for me, the rest of the game notwithstanding. The fact that it's a rogue-like game amplifies that, as all of my progress is that much harder to replicate. And as for ""lots and lots"" of content, no offense to the devs on this one, but there just isn't. The creatures and NPCs are pretty basic, storyline is minimal, and ""completing"" this game is both unsatisfactory, and ends the game without the option of continuing, There are also many events in the game that can happen either randomly or from you entering an area that can either kill you no matter what, no matter how geared or skilled you are, just because you chose the wrong option, or even better you chose the right option and it still has a chance of instantly killing you, or can kill you due to you not having one specific item that is absolutely useless under any other curcumstances and normally just takes up space in your pack.There's also an event that only happens when you character is asleep and is basically unblockable that leaves your character permanently blind ( a creature literally steals your eyes) and you have to move one hex at a time to the main city (which takes forever, even if you are close), while every creature and most NPCs that see you trying to murder you, and EVEN IF you make it to the city, you have to pay an ungodly amount of money for cybernetic eyes, JUST to resume your normal play.The thing is, I can look past all that, the other shortcomings of the game, and can still get enjoyment from it. If it weren't for the issues with the save files. Which is why I wrote a negative review citing the save files, because as I said, everything else I could look past as part of the challenge, dealing with a buggy and vengeful game that hates you. But the fact that on top of everything else, one of the main things you expect to have no issues with, your save file, has major issues, is a huge irritation to me.""TL/DR: The game has great potential and is fun if you don't intend to play it for long. But if you play to long the game lags, your save file gets deleted when you clean your temp internet files, and the game hates you more than dark souls			"

												“How long can you survive the post-apocalyptic wastelands of NEO Scavenger?” Asks the developer.To be more precise, It’s a game that will make you cherish plastic bags more than anything else.At one time I did carry three plastic bags at once: One in each hand and one put on the shoulder. Inside these an assortment of the finest junk ever seen by man: Empty bottles, cigarette lighter, a t-shirt, twigs, a sauce pan and even more crumpled plastic bags, in case the current ones rip apart. Let me tell you, plastic bags are the superior container for almost anything you might want to carry at some point in the post-apocalypse.

Oh and don’t drink unboiled water – I did and it was a mistake. A few days later while trying to sneak up to a sleeping stranger at night (To rob him, obviously; I needed a pair of new shoes), I got diarrhea. Uncontrollable stomach cramps made me fall down and curl up into a ball. The moaning woke up the stranger who’s been in a very bad mood. I started to bleed from my nose – probably from a virus like cholera I’ve ingested by drinking the water from a pond days earlier. I was indeed particularly thirsty the last few days.The stranger sprinted towards me and a few moments later, without asking questions, he clubbed me to death with the butt of his rifle – not because of my pain, but to conserve ammo. I think it was for the best, I would have died from internal bleeding anyway. My life was over before I even knew it.The interesting part here is that all of this did not feel “unfair”; I made a mistake hours before (drinking contaminated water) and could have prevented it (by boiling the water). Even after the fact, the symptoms of dehydration gave an indication that something was wrong: I could have ingested medicine immediately, but I didn’t.It’s great that games like this are made.			"

								THIS is the post-apocalyptic hobo life simulator you've all been waiting for. THIS is the game where you scavenge your breakfast, lunch and dinner before scavenging your bed to sleep in the middle of tin cans strung on ropes to trip would-be thieves that would steal your precious squirrel meat so painstakingly caught in the forest. THIS is the game where you scavenge a bow and night vision goggles, craft make-shift arrows and go hobo-night-rambo, looting at night and turning bandits and raiders into pincushions from afar then loot their corpses for boots to sell on the junk market to buy a greasy chicken dinner with the earned money. THIS is the game where you wear a dog-man's pelt as a war trophy as you charge at looters with your meat cleaver and crowbar to steal their junk, then sit on their corpses savouring the handful of gummy bears they had in their pockets. This is Neo Scavenger, and it's the best post-apocalyptic hobo life simulator of all time. Until Neo Scavenger 2 comes out.			"

												I've been playing this game throughout it's development and it quickly became one of my favorite PC games. The game presents you with near limitless ways to approach and handle situations. Food, water, energy, and the environment are all factors that will determine your survival in-game. The combat is slow-paced and challenging, yet rewarding when you manage to win a fight. I can't recommend this game enough. Also, if this game looks interesting to you, try the demo!-Full Release Update: It only got better. Fixes, improvements, more content. Everything you could ask for from a small developer and a shining beacon of what Early Access games should be like.			"

Early Access Review
Introduction: How long can you survive the post-apocalyptic wastelands of NEO Scavenger? This may be the ongoing question asked of the player by it's developers yet, I guaruntee you will be asking youself this each time you load Neo Scavenger regardless of your experience with it's unforgiving world. Even in it's early access state Neo Scavenger accomplishes what many other developers desperately attempt to attain yet fail to accompllish, an incredibly solid title built in a believable and atmospheric world, all the while laughing in it's large budget competitiors faces because there is yet more to come.Overview: Neo Scavenger is a post apocolypic turn based survival strategy game that honors such classics as Fallout and Wasteland while retaining an identity all it's own. Set in an incredibly atmospheric world, the protagonist has recently emerged from a cryo chamber without a memory as to how he got there, who he is or what state the world is in. Within seconds he recieves the answer to the latter in a very unwelcoming way. You soon realize that you will desperately need to scavenge this unhospitable world if you intend on your survival and will have to leave your moral bindings behind if you're to be successful. While traveling you will be encountered by an assortment of undesirables that intend on their own as well and will achieve this at any cost, whether it be thievery, murder or deception. To assure your own instead, you will need to do the same.During your journey, you'll be presented with decisions that must be made and many times without prior knowledge of what may occurr based on your actions. You will pre-emptively strike what you deem to beGameplay: As stated above Neo Scavenger is a turn based survival strategy game with a wide range of varying elements that will affect each new journey you begin. You will be presented with an attribute screen where you must carefully select each according to your playstyle. Each will directly affect what skills you have available in given situations that will come about so, one must choose wiseley. Once your travels begin you will need to manage multiple aspects in regards to your health such as hydration, hunger, restfulness, health/illness, injuries, environment temperatures, weather and more. The decisions you make will directly affect the protagonist accordingly so, one must manage these elements with confidence or otherwise you'll be swiftly presented with a message that you will assuredly see quite often, the death screen. This will come often and without warning aside from your available character management system. With that being said make sure you obsess about the details because, it's all that stands in the way of you and the grim reaper.Aside from illness, fatigue, hunger and the like, you will of coarse encounter a variety of enemies along your journey that also as stated above intend on your demise. Combat is performed via a turn based system which, issues you an incredible assortment of options depending on your original skill/attribute selection which, I must reaffirm must be choen wisely! The options presented during combat range from hide, melee, , kick downed opponent, headbutt, sneak, ranged, retreat, offer/demand surrender, offer/accept cease fire, attempt to talk and countless other available options that are once again available depending on you attribute selection.Do I need to remind you to choose them wisely once again? I do? O.k check it out, this one's gonna hit home a bit more....Unless you carefully choose your attributes, you may within seconds contract any one of the following unpleasant status illnesses or diseases: Blindness, Blisters, Blue Rot, Cholera, Coughing Blood, Crippled Limb, Defoliant Exposure, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Heat Stroke, Hypothermia, Hypovolemic Shock, Poisoned, Sepsis, Shock, VomitingSound fun? No? Then choose wisely my friends, trust me.You will without a doubt die and die often, yet during each playthrough you will obtain more knowledge in regards to how to survive and future strategies that come of it. Graphics: The graphics of Neo Scavenger serve their purpose. They are in no way revolutionary and aren't intended to be, nor needed to be whatsoever. Yet if there were one weakness of Neo Scavanger this would be it. As mentioned above the graphics serve their purpose but, that in no way means that the options available should be so barron. The options available are as basic as it gets and are as folows: Full screen, windowed, 16:9, 4:3, frame rate limiter, filter and stretch. Pretty uneventful to say the least and due to the graphics engine's limitations they do not scale. So expect the presentation to be a bit lackluster. Yet, once again they serve their purpose and it will not ruin your experience whatsoever. So take this section with a grain of salt because, if you're in the market for a game in this genre, graphics are the least of your worries.Sound: The music and sound effects although they may not present themselves often are perfectly crafted to create a tense and fitting atmosphere. Given the situation, the music will accompany and heighten your feeling of desperation within this incredibly depressing world. With each fade in the music will most definitely add an element that most other games cannot match. Considering so, the developers deserve an award for knowing when less is more and Neo Scavenger is a perfect example of that. The echoing sounds of the barron wilderness accompany the simplistic soundtrack design and add to a believable experience. Story: The story although seemingly simplistic and unoriginal at first is where Neo Scavenger will surprise you at every turn and leave you wanting to know more about our most unlucky protagonist. Although at first sight it may seem minimalistic, you will be proven wrong as you progress further into this world of chaos he so sadly awoke to. The story contained in Neo Scavenger will most assuredly be a driving force behind your desire to continue multiple play sessions to discover more about what happened to this once populated land. As you can see by my vagueness, I am doing my best to protect any insight as to specific story elements which, should serve as a hint that it's most definitely there and is most definitely worthwhile. Trust me when I say, there will be many more than one occasion that will leave you in awe and in horror.   Replay Value: The replay value found in Neo Scavanger is second to none and I am by no means stretching my imagination out of bounds to come to that conclusion. The very fundamentals of Neo Scavanger are built to lure the player back into it's world of dessolation, no matter how many times they've played before. With each play through, you will gain knowledge as to how your next session could possibly last longer and you will most definitely feel an urge to apply it for a ""better"" outcome. What will give you an even more increasing desire to launch it again is that, even after you believe you have mastered it's many facets of gameplay.....you will die and die you will, often and mercilessly. Yet regardless, you will most assuredly return once again to the world of Neo Scavenger and enjoy every gut wrenching second. Final (Early Access BETA) Review Score: 8.3/10Although still in Early Access form, I in no way feel it to be a hinderance to come to a determination that Neo Scavenger should find a place in the library of any gamer looking for a title that will surpass their expectations and leave them in shock that they haven't played it before. The developers at Blue Bottle Games have poured an incredible amount of love and attention into their world of solitude and despair which, I guaruntee will leave you feeling the same. If you're in the market for a survival game, give Neo Scavenger a chance!			"

Early Access Review
								Quite possibly one of the best games I have played in the recent months. I got it with a bundle, but NEO Scavenger is honestly worth more than its asking price. It may only be flash, but don't let that deter you. It has one of the most realistic systems I have encountered. The developer is an active member of his own community, and that is very difficult to find these days with titles of this magnitude.I'm not very picky with what I play, but I am picky with what I play often. Since I got it, I have been playing this game every day, dieing every day, and starting anew every day. You die, a lot. But for some reason I always come back to start again, most times directly after the fact. This isn't like Dark Souls difficult, where if you die, you can just load up a save from right before it. No. When you die, you die. You have to start all over again.Each time you start, it is somehow an entirely new experience every time. The maps are randomized, NPC loadouts are randomized, loot and scavenging opportunities are randomized. The only things that don't change are the story, fixed encounters, and your inevitable death in these unforgiving wastes. You can spend hours building up the best loot and getting the best weapons and armor, just to get kicked in the head in your sleep, and have to start all over again. For some reason I have come to enjoy this.The crafting system is remarkable, to say the least. Much more involved than that of Minecraft or Terraria. You are able to use the skills you chose at the start of the game to create new and different items than you could without. Being able to craft items that can possibly save you from a fight with a Dogman or a Blue Frog, keep you fed for a day, or drink clean water, can give you some sense of security. Until you fall asleep and get kicked in the head.This game is not for those that want an easy game, that they can win every opportunity they get. You can be fully armored and have a shotgun in one hand and a crowbar in the other and pulverize the person you're fighting, just to have them throw a rock at you and die of internal bleeding a couple turns later. This game is unforgiving, and even when you're the biggest badass of the wastes... you can still die by eating some berries.I love this game. Plain and simple.			"

Attack of the Barefoot Cannibalistic Showroom DummiesTwo days into my first successful venture into NEO Scavneger, I've resorted to cannibalism. It's not like I really had to - I was taking a nap in a small city when a stranger woke me up. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I took his soul away with a crowbar and noticed that I'm a bit hungry. Checked it - yes, not surprising - I can use a shard on the corpse and scavenge myself some tasty human meat. Two hexes later in the woods, I've made myself a nice BBQ and I'm feasting on that human.As I chew on what was just two hexes ago my rival in an unfair fight, I am suddenly overcome with  disgust. I could have just left the corpse there, and move on to hunt a squirrel or pick some non-poisonous berries. Yet I chose to eat that person. And before doing that I looted him of his hoodie which was in a better condition.But karma got to me quick. I was quickly poisoned in some mysterious way and then something wielding a 12-Gauge Shotgun blew me to bits, all my progress and looting down the drain.NEO Scavenger can be really daunting at first; you'll die a lot. But once you pick it up - it's hard to put it down. It's a wonderful selfishness simulator that is fun and engaging, built on a fantastic crafting system which brings out the curious child in you. The ""old"" graphics do not deter from the enjoyment, quite the opposite – they only make it eerier and more atmospheric. The soundtrack is great too and generally it feels like a lot of thought was given to the game. I haven't delved into the lore of the game yet but there are newspapers lying around with bits of info and it seems that there's a bigger story which unfolds as you manage to survive and stay alive. Unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds, not at all; you can also go great strides (even without turning into a cannibal) and then get blown away by a shotgun or catch a disease. This could hinder the experience for some players who focus on storylines and want to complete the game – take to heart that this will be VERY HARD. This game is hardcore as it gets and it doesn't hold your hand at all.The best advice is to watch let's plays etc and if you do pick up the game, try it for yourself before picking up a guide. You WILL pick up a guide ultimately but try to experience it without any aid at all. It'll produce unique experiences in which you'll end up dead (in your hospital gown usually). Overall this is worth much more than its price tag, a very refreshing entry to the world of roguelike which does it very very right - a sort of improved UnReal World with frightening creatures and a darker theme.

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger is a turn-based, roguelike scavenging game. I like it a lot, because it's gritty, fairly in-depth and more realistic than almost every other survival game.NEO Scavenger first asks you to choose your perks/flaws: Botanist, Strong, Myopia, etc. There are no XP and levels, so, mostly, what you see is what you get. After selecting your starting skills, you are thrown into the game barefoot and with only a hospital gown.Your first order of business is finding the basics of survival: shoes (one left and one right!), warm clothes, a lighter, a crowbar for scavenging, a sleeping bag, tools to obtain clean food and water and something to carry all this stuff around. In fact, the very first treasures you'll scavenge are probably disposable plastic grocery bags. They're very fragile, but they're tiny, weigh nothing and will serve as your first backpack. Those bad boys are little life savers, you have to love them! We should probably produce and dump more plastic bags all over the place for fututre survivors, right now. What do you think of that, environmentalists?From then on, you'll also need to find all the other things you need to survive: clean rags for wounds, alcohol for disinfection, antibiotics, painkillers, a firearm with ammo, gloves, a gasmask for polluted areas, crafting tools, binoculars, noisemakers to warn you of intruders during the night, etc. One of the game's main qualities is that the list of things needed to survive effectively is very, very long, but you can also make do with just the essentials.Contemporary technology is surprisingly useless. A found computer might have no battery, then a found battery might have no charge in it, then a charged battery will reveal the computer is password-locked, then you'll hack it (if you picked that skill)... only to discover the computer only contains pictures of cats. On the other hand, a cheap plastic bottle filled with safe drinking water is always a useful commodity. Is that social commentary or what?Weapons are also imporant, but not nearly as much as in most survival games. It's possible to completely avoid all combat with a peace-loving build.Speaking of which, combat is a strange numberless affair, where you choose broad actions (run forward/back, take cover, trip enemy, threaten). The only numeric value is range, which is enormously important depending on your fighting style. What you do get are surprisingly graphic descriptions of your situation: ""You have passed out from unbearable pain"" or ""You have died from acute bleeding to the lungs"". Ouch. As in real life, he who strikes first usually wins. It's also possible to win a fight and die from your injuries not long afterwards. All in all, fights are terrying (as they should be), the results are sometimes unpredictable and fighting fair is always a stupid idea. Did I mention you can be killed in your sleep (and vice-versa)?There's also crafting, there's always crafting. Except here it's realistic. You're not going to craft an assault rifle with rocks in NEO Scavenger. In fact, a good ol'fire is probably the number one recipe. Sorry, no fire by friction if you haven't chosen the Trapper skill at character creation. Making fire without an external source is really not that easy without training. Another essential crafting recipe is: Fire + Water + Receptacle = Boiled (sterile) Water. Don't tell me it's boring until, weakened by diarrhea from drinking dodgy water, you are punched to death by a hobo. By the way, the game doesn't tell you what makes you sick: you only know you messed up somewhere when symptoms start showing up.The game leaves the player with three general survival strategies: use nature's gifts to provide for your needs, scavenge cities for pre-apocalypse technology or... murder every survivor in sight for the contents of their shopping bags, RAWR!The game has a main storyline, but as of right now it's pretty short. And did I tell you THIS GAME HAS NO ZOMBIES? Yay!The game has two main flaws. First, the game could do a better job helping you find points of interest. The map is very large and it's not obvious where the important areas are. The second is almost a praise: I want more of it! I want more items, more weapons, more unique areas, more special encounters, more animals. MOAR! The possibilites of common household items having ingenious survival uses is almost endless. Variety in this game is good, but not great, but things are still being added to the game (and there are mods).While I recommend NEO Scavenger, it is in Early-Access at 99% complete, so it might be worth waiting a bit if you want the best first experience possible. Yet even right now, it's still a pretty great game and an impressive achievement as the work of a single man.In conclusion, I'll quote Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith which sums up the game's worth pretty well:""NEO Scavenger is the only survival game that feels like it has anything to do with survival.""

												If the original fallout, dayz, stalker, the original wasteland and FTL somehow managed to procreate and make a new game, that game would be NEO scavenger. A very deep and challenging game where boots are just as much a reason to be happy then finding a gun. This brutal game will kill you many many times. Perma death is the feature that is key in this game. Its probabily the most accurate representation of a post apocolyptic world and a representation on how we all would do in it...That is embarisingly bad. Probabily the best ""survival"" game out there. Alot better then the endless zombie survival games or other rubish. Plus this one has a story told somewhat in the style of dark souls. That is peicing togethere what happened to you. I managed to beat the game 14 hours in. You live, You Fight, You get dysentary then you die a horrible death.			"

								This is my first experience with a 'serious' roguelike, and I have to say that I'm extremely impressed.  The exploratory gameplay is exciting and nerve-wracking at the same time, and the unpredictable nature of events in the game means you'll spend much of your time simply trying to plan ahead for every contingency.  This coupled with the constant threat of permanent death creates a very engaging experience.If I had to point out a flaw, it would be that the interfaces are generally not very streamlined, which can slow down your gameplay a little bit, depending on what you're doing.

												I like turn-based games.  I like survival games.  I like rogue-like games.  So a turn-based, rogue-like survival game?  Sign me up!  Except not for this turn-based, rogue-like survival game please.IMHO rogue-like games like FTL and Don't Starve succeed because they're a streamlined experience, which makes ""dying part of the fun"".  Starting a new game is always exciting and you're confident you can learn from your past mistakes so you'll survive longer this time 'round.This is where NEO falls short.  The dev had a vision and built the game to match that vision.  But if his vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland does not align with your vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, prepare to encounter all sorts of frustratingly illogical, immersion-breaking events.People call FTL brutally hard and overly random, but I ""get it"" - it makes sense to me when I play.  I can learn from past mistakes and play better.  NEO makes no sense to me.  The game design decisions are just weird, the interface is clunky, the graphics are grotesque.  Dying for no clear reason, when things seem to be going swimmingly right up until you die, *may* be realistic (?) in the dev's world, but not mine.You get the same kind of all-of-a-sudden deaths in Don't Starve but it's always clear that ""I shouldn't have attacked that Pig Man just for kicks"" or ""I shouldn't have tried to chop that last tree before lighting my campfire"" or ""I should have abandoned my hunt for gold and hunted berries instead, so I wouldn't starve"".Playing NEO is like being put in a straight-jacket designed by the dev.  ""Play my way or not at all"".  Okay dude - IF your way makes logical sense and there's a clear progression from A-to-B-to-C-to-You Died.   Going A-to-R-to-D-to-You Died does not help me live longer next time!  So ""I shouldn't scavenge that random house the way I've scavenged every other house so far, because I should have known the roof was going to cave in""?  or ""I shouldn't have tried to run away from that particular encounter because I should have known I would trip, fall on my ♥♥♥ and not be able to stand up again even though I'm healthy, rested and well-fed""?  How do I avoid either of those situations next time around?  That's two of the dozens of deaths that will leave you scratching your head going ""REALLY?!?"".Forumites will tell you, take this skill, that skill and the other skill and you'll never die.  Okay, but what if I *don't want* to take those three specific skills.  What if I want to build the character *I want to play*?  In that case, prepare for many, many, many frustrating deaths because you're not playing his game the way the Dev wants you to.I don't get some of these other reviews:  ""Dogman killed me while I slept despite the fact that I put down multiple noise traps, Thumb's Up 10/10.""  WTF?  Is that a joke?  It's not helpful.  ""Stabbed a guy three times then kicked him in the head when he was down.  He was hurt, bleeding out and on the edge of unconsciousness but he got up, landed one lucky punch and I was immediately unconscious, Thumb's Up 10/10"".   Troll reviews like that are turning this Reviews tab into a joke.			"

												Day 30: found some pimp and he wanted me to give his ""lady"" some medical attention, I decided to put some dirty rags on the gaping wound. She is probably going to die of an infection, but hey he gave me 500 dollars so who's complaining?Day 40: finally got to a civilized area, I got in line to get in the city but I wasn't allowed in because I didn't have what appears to be a bracelet for cool kids. Right after that some dude with a neat hat told me to follow him, I didn't listen to him because he was boring, when he began looking at me like he wanted an answer I got nervous and shouted ""it's a trap!"", he was impressed of my trap finding skills so he gave me a cool kids bracelet or something. I put it on so I looked cool in front of the people who kicked nerds out of the line to the city, when they saw my watch they let me in. Luckily because I sold my twenty left footed gumboots and some poisonous berries I was able to afford eye surgeryDay 50: I set up three noise traps, one tarp shelter and a sleeping bag somewhere in the forest, also I killed around six Dogmen without being hit. I also learned to make tea.... that's cool right? Anyway I digress, later that day I was stabbed by some cultist from Isis or blue frog, one of those two, so I poured some boiled water onto my open wound and covered it with a clean piece of cloth. Now there is a 0% chance of getting an infectionDay 60: people started running away from me on sight, maybe it has to do with the fact I'm wearing the skin of a Dogman as a vest and squirrels as gloves not to mention I'm carrying a loaded hunting rifle while having one strapped to my back with no ammo. I also have a nifty broad spear that is covered with the blood of my past twenty or so enemies, also I have a sled with extra fire wood in itDay 65: a melon head was no nice as to bring me a shopping cart basket with no wheels! That is now where I'm going keep all 10 of my left footed shoes.I've been proceeding to kill as many evil people as I can, I don't care if they won't bother me I kill them because them because they are on my lawn, I only spare ATN warriors and any other possible neutral that is holding a gun.Day 70: Never taking my talisman off again.... Don't ask why...Day 80: Just remembered I was supposed to talk to that guy with the hat like 39 days ago. Better not go back there, instead I will go explore whatever is north from my baseDay 83: the nearest source of water is 3 hexes away, better drink my own ♥♥♥♥Day 84: Note to self the yellow liquid is not ♥♥♥♥, it is an energy drinkDay 85: I was almost starving to death until I came across a true messiah, a looter with tomato sauce sachets it was so nice of him to uhh… die for meDay 86: I just ate four forest hexes worth of edible berries and mushroomsDay 90: I am beginning an investment; from this day forth I swear to sell all of my Dogmen skin to replace my eyes with robotic night vision ones. Or so the people around the city for cool kids said I couldDay 100: Came back to base, I found several guns and some ammo during the scavengingDay 105: I made a sling, time to get some looters ‘stoned’Day 110: Today I was shot by a Bad Mutha who had a pistol. Rocks weren’t working so I killed him with my spear and soaked the wound with alcohol and bandaged it with clean rags. I looted his body to find he had a left footed flip flop, gummy bears and tomato sauce sachets.Day 112: my arms are moderately wounded and bleeding; I was attacked by two Dogmen during the night. Also I now have two more Dogman coats. My injuries are nothing that boiled water, bandages, rest and a little painkiller can’t fix.Day 113: my base is full of Dogman coats. I have either gotta move ‘em over to another hex or take a hike to DMC and sell them allDay 150: I can’t stand living anymore, I need to end this, I have realized this land has no hope, so why should I, tonight I take off the talisman again.END			"

												A hardcore survivalist game. By hardcore, I'm talking perma death, just about everything can kill you easily, and you're kind of lady luck's ♥♥♥♥♥ in regards to how well you can do sometimes. That said, this is a great game. It's a thinking man's title, borderline unfair (I mean that in a begrudging good way),  and it will take you a long time to really master the concept of it. Coupled with a gigantic procedurally generated world and you'll find yourself playing a new set of variables each time, particularly as you can pick a handful of your starting skills before stepping into the frying pan that is NEO Scavenger.Story-wise, it's kind of an end of the world scenario, except more dealing with mutants, mad men, and bandits, rather than zombies. The plot is kind of backseated to the gameplay, however. I found almost all the NPCs to be universally hostile or locked into a constant fight/flight mentality. Don't expect dialogue or too much revealing information- your character wakes up as a corpsicle in a cryo vat and you're basically thrust into an unknown landscape. You have to gather what you need to survive and you need to do it FAST. Freezing to death is very easy and this game does not hold a newcomer's hand whatsoever. You will be hunted, attacked remorselessly, robbed, and yes, you can literally be killed in one round by the wrong person if you're unlucky. As such, this is about SURVIVAL. Not racking up xp and going nuts with a pea shooter.While I like NEO Scavenger, there's some things that are a needless hassle about the gameplay. The interface is extremely clunky for your items, the crafting system is a bit vague (I have a sharp edge like the recipe says... I can't harvest this dog because...?), and the biggest issue to me, is the game saves via Flash cookies, not on Steam.Imagine my disgust when I kept finding my save games erased after every play session. Hours and hours, gone. So I checked my Flash and found I had it enabled to allow cookies to be saved. So something else was deleting them. According to the developers, it could be one's antivirus or any of a number of things. With all due respect, I don't really care to go searching every minute infrastructural maintenance program I have to find out which program is deleting the cookies beyond Flash and what might need an exclusion to NEO- this should have been saved in the Steam Cloud or however many other games here do it without issue. I really REALLY wish the developers would have done something about this instead forcing the player to find a meta solution. Unfortunately, from what I've read, they're not really doing anymore updates and the game is considered completed. :/ Which is a shame, because I loved everything else about this.I would heartily recommend NEO but the issue with saves is not something I can overlook after finding this out several hours in. If the developers would or could somehow make the game save within Steam and not through cookies, I will happily change this to a Recommendation. As of now, I reluctantly can't do that.			"

												As is it is a great TBS Scavenger/survival game. It has the perfect Luck/Skill game and liken to Fallout gameplay. There is nothing more fun then setting up a camp and building up a sustanable inventory. If you like TBS or some form of survival game this is the game for you.Now that the game is offically out I'd say this is the best game I've played in the TBS/survial game tag.			"

								Ooooooh baby!      There are no words to express how amazing this game is. Except you know, amazing! Never in my life have I loved a semi-text based game so much. This game combines grim 2d graphics, immense crafting, and the consequences of your choices into one massive and great post-apocalyptic world simulator. The game has an amazing storyline, and whoever wrote the everything for this game deserves an amazing raise in their job. This is a game where you just have to play it, to see what it is truly capable of.			"

Don't let the semi-clunky user interface and middle-of-the road pixel graphics sway you; NEO Scavenger is an utterly addicting turn-based survival roguelike game that will steal your time.---So I have the wifey take this for a test drive, since I'm lazy and want to lay on the couch. I figure this run would end pretty quick, because I know death is apparently frequent in this game (aka roguelike). I turn around to eat a bag of chocolate, and before I know it the hobo main character is wearing six t-shirts, a hoodie, a hospital gown, a size 7 left shoe, and a size 9 right boot.Wow. That escalated quickly. More like NEO Scavenger: Hobo Simulator 2015Plastic baggies are literally a currency in this world. We had one on our back, one in each hand, and about 6 spare ones stashed in the others. Nuts.Not even to mention the inventory tetris that I just witnessed. Literally level 9,000 sh*t going on here. If you are OCD or have hoarding tendencies, be forewarned.---What was so fun about this game is that you really feel the excitement as you rise up and gather better and better gear. There is alot of strategy and exploration that keeps things fresh. The story elements are present, but are never bothersome.Pros:+Quite addictive.+Very deep and complex interactions. Lots of attention to detail with crafting and how items interact. How clothing functions, etc. Further, there are lots of ways to go about a situation.+Feels fair. We actually got quite far on the first run or so.Cons:-Interface feels clunky at first, but isn't that bad when you get past the learning curve.-Music is almost non-existant. Fine enough with me because bad music is bad.-The combat system leaves something to be desired. Thankfully the game is not centered around it.Yeah totally worth full price - lots of really fun replay value here. "

												You're battered, bruised, bleeding and experiencing the symptons from one of the most deadliest diseases known in this post-apocalyptic landscape. Your sleep was interrupted last night after the rustling of cans awoke you. Barley managing to roll away as a crowbar struck where your head would have been less then a second ago. You catch a brief glimpse of your assailent: raggedand erratic with the souless eyes of a killer. He hits you, the cold metal smashing your arm as you clamber to your feet. Your eyes still adjusting to the darkness, you miss your swing, the cold steel of your meet cleaver slashing the air in front of your attacker. He reponds with a swing of his own, smahing into your ribs... hard, bones cracking under the force.You prepare to dodge, mentally readying yourself, watching for any twitch of movement. It pays off, you notice his legs kneel, powering themselves for a leap. At the last moment you step aside, watching him tackle past you into the rubble. A swift slice to the head lacerates immensly as he trys to make sense of what happens. The next few moments of the battle went fast. Your kicks met either his head or torso repeatedly, denying him any chance of standing upright. A stray slice here with your trusty cleaver made short work of his frrail body.Eventually, your slashes and kicks are wasted energy, the bloody mess becoming an outlet for your rage.During the fight you had noticed an important feature about the mans attire. A paitents gown with a deep blue sash, signifying him as a carrier of the 'Blue Rot' disease.It's too far a walk to the city to be cured at the early, treatable stage. Let alone your wallet wan't fat enough to pay for the bills for the procedure. Your rage doen't subside for what seems an eternity, slicing at the once human-like mess over and over, your rage overcoming you. At some point of time, you must have dropped the cleaver, because now you were punching at the chunky mess that was the mans skull. You had been defeated before, knocked unconcious, left for dead with nothing except for the clothes that merciful scavengers didnt steal from your body. Bullet wounds, lacerations, bruises, concussions, broken ribs and limbs, hunger, dehydration, sleep deprevation and even sickness from wounds left untreated. Every form of pain and punishment had been inflicted onto you. But Everytime you bounced back, fresh with scars from your victories. man and beast fell before you all the same. The wild environment of post-apocolypse detroit had you at the knifes edge at every moment, but every time you pulled a trick from your sleeve.But this time was different. You saved yourself to live another day, but not to live to see the end of the week. Right now the blue rot was creeping though your veins, infecting every pore of your body. Within a few days you wil be dead, no amount of trickery or wit could save you from this situation.Your days are numbered, death is imminent. You don't bother falling back to sleep. Dead men don't need sleep. You wander aimlessly and painfully through the night, leaving your possessions and your killer's corpse behind. At dawnbreak, you feel hungry eyes linger on you. Your hunter had been following you at least an hour but you didn't care, his means to your end would be quicker then suffering pain of blue rot.You let the towering, werewolf-esque creature approach you slowly at a distance. You reach for cleaver, a final battle and a warriors death. But your hand grabs aimlessly at your waist as it dawns on you that your precious weapon of steel was a 4-hour walk behind you, stuck halfway through your attackers leg.You stand still, without purpose, without hope, as the beast charges for you. He leaps at you, claw ready to swipe. You try to dodge, instinct priotising survival rather thant wishing to die but it was too late. The claws enter your skull effortlessly, the pain is incredible, agonising to levels of extreme. It takes one more slice from the beast to end your life and your journey ends.If you made it to the end of this text crawl wondering why i would write something so long, it's because i felt NEOscavenger required more than a simple review like: ""Got shot in head while asleep 420/10""The above story was a more descriptive, but true, experience i had with one of my more longer playthroughs.NEOscavenger is harsh, brutal and if it were human, would probably kill puppies for the heck of it. Every journey with your character, every battle, every scavenge attempt, every time you press that sleep button, can end your playthrough abrubtly and heart-breakenly if you aren't careful enough. Fights can go from one-sided victories or soul-crushing losses within moments. Dehydration seems to kick in when there is no water source for kilometers, and hunger when the only food source was that scavenger you just slaughtered... Traits allow for unique and differing playthroughs. Posiitives and negatives balacing eachother out. A myopic tank, the athletic botanist, the frail ranger, a Medical mechanic. The combat: a turn-based sequence of text describing the events of the battle, are some of the most sweat-inducing fearful moments that i have experienced in gaming. With a bit of imagination, fights in NEOscavenger are brutally intense, every option increasing your chances of winning or dieing.There are no easy victories, no fights won unscarred, no journey left unhindered by some problem, some gnawing concern that would later illicit your demise. My playtime says 20hrs: but if you counted the time i've spent in both the demo, and less than legal copies of the game, i've spent time almost quadruple that.If your looking for a game that expects nothing more then your full attention to stay alive and healthy, and are still somehow not convinced by the plethoria of reviews before mine, look no further then NEOscavenger  "

												From my time playing the early access version: I thought this was just going to be some weird little thing i'd play once and throw in the backlog forever. Two and a half hours later I'm crawling after a concussed blind man who stabbed me in the head with an arrow. I have to get up before him so I can kick him unconscious and dump his pockets onto the ground. He has a beef jerky that I eat immediately. I bandage up my head, pop some painkillers and shuffle my bleeding, bruised, hypothermic self back into the woods in search of water. This game is awesome.			"

												Although NEO Scavenger doesn't have the fancy graphics of titles with huge budgets and numerous developers, it manages to do a lot more with a lot less. Scraping by and surviving in a world in which almost everything and everyone would rather see you dead (and in which death is permanent) may not sound fun on paper, but the game manages to create that addictive just-one-more-turn quality that's a sign of a great game. Thanks to the excellent music and writing, the game also manages to pull off an impressive amount of immersion and atmosphere with the limitations of the isometric, hexagonal world.Unlike a lot of early access games with more staff and so less of an excuse, the developer has been communicative and responsive throughout which I can only think has led to a better game.NEO Scavenger is a testament to what one guy with vision and dedication can do.

Early Access Review
								Today I lived for 6 days and 15.8 hours.  I will play again soon. What if I could live for a week or a month?  What if I could make it to the ""glow""?  What if there is actually an end to this game?  I need not guides -- I like grit.  I like randomly dying from cardiac arrest.  I like knowing that I will FREEZE TO DEATH -- if I'm running around outside naked like an idiot.  I like knowing that at the end of the session my decisions mattered.  Sometimes it feels a bit like RNG might be getting me down...but mostly its just challenging.  I keep living long enough to get more tidbits of the story.  I see something new each time I play.  If you want instant gratification...this game might not be for you.  If you want a game where choices matter and death is permanent, try it.			"

See that’s how they get you.  They make a reasonably priced game and the game is well made don’t get me wrong, however that’s where the plot thickens.Before you know it, you pay for the game, load it up and poof… 5 hours gone.  You don’t seem to notice it but you go to work the next day when you get home your soon looking around and wondering how in the world is another 5 hours just… gone.  One moment my wife is yelling at me and 5 hours later she is snoring in the other room but I never noticed.How did they do that and how do I sue?Thank you for a great game. "

												Having followed this game during the end tail of its beta development, I am pleased to say that it's been as much fun in day one as it was on release.  It's not without its frustrations, but these frustrations are part of the rogue-like mechanic (why can't I find a pair of boots, dammit! ...also, I died again).Also, the game is moddable.  So if there's something you want to tweak (within the constraints of the engine), you can learn to do so or see if someone else did so already.There is still a lot about this game I haven't discovered, as I still need to range outside of the ""just survive"" part and delve into the mysteries hinted at here and there.  But overall, it's been an enjoyable ride.  If you didn't pick this up in a Humble Bundle or during Beta, now's a good time to do so!			"

												NEO Scavenger is a really intense survival game. You can make a character based off of different skills and survival tactics. Depending on what you chose, your experience with the game will change. If you take Medical Knowledge, you can tend your wounds faster, or if you take Melee, you will be able to fight better. It's a very brutal and unforgiving game. If you mess up, it could cost you your life. Perma-death is a thing so you really want to be careful.  The descriptions of what you do in combat is very descriptive and really helps with immersion.Pros:- It's very fun- Rewarding if you come across some good gear- Very realistic in the mechanicsCons:- no animations or visuals during combat- Purely text based (could be a good thing if you like that, I do)- near impossible on your first few lives.- UI takes some time to get used toOver all, it's a very brutal, but fun survival game, and I am really glad that I got it. If you enjoy wilderness survival games, this one will not dissapoint you.			"

												A very unique gameplay experience. Here was my first time playing.Day 1:What is this place? Oh interesting. So we have cryo chambers. this game is pretty nic-OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT*uses the power of nature to kill a lethal creature*cool.*climbs out window and doesnt bleed from chards for some reason*Time to explore.*time passes*ooh, whats this? I'm...shivering?Huh I better find clothes.*time passes*I'm thirsty? better drink this river water.{PLAYER HAS DIAREHHA}WHAT? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?*time passes*Oh god im freezing to death and now im hungry.*night time*I'll sleep in this abandoned office building.{PLAYER HAS DIED FROM HYPOTHERMIA}Wow.Very tough and will take many tries to actually live long.I think this game is a ""  Don't Starve [www.dontstarvegame.com] "" like game where you try to avoid dying as long as possible. It's going to happen. It's rogue-like and very tough. Whether you die from Hunger, Thirst, Hypothermia, or Diarrhea, this game will still be memorable.PROS AND CONS:----------------------------------------+ Customizable stats. You can be very tough or an electrician, whatever floats your boat.+ Very hard. This game shows no mercy and shoves you right in. (googling crafting tutorials might be smart)+ Crafting. This game is full of unique crafting where you can craft anything from a fire to a wheelbarrow.+ Interacting with others. It feels like it isnt just you out there. The world is bustling with Raiders, Looters, and nice people who you can kill, steal from, or just say hi to.+ Strategical fighting. The first game I've ever seen with a ""Threaten"" option in the middle of combat.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Single Player only. This game would be boring with multiplayer, but I wanted to note this just in case you didnt know.- Loot Spawning. Sometimes you'll find nothing in a locked shed. Sometimes in an empty field you'll find a loaded shotgun. The loot spawns sometimes are unrealistic.- 2D artstyle. I personally am ok with the 2D, but it must be noted you are buying a 2D game.- Unusual death. Sometimes you will be well fed, well quenched, and well slept, but die in your sleep from a monster.I overall would give this game an 8/10.			"

												When I originally bought this game several years ago, it was on a random whim during a sale.  I played it for about 15 minutes, and was so turned off by the way it looks and the unintuitive interface that I pretty much immediately uninstalled it.  This was a big mistake.I recently re-installed it, determined to give it another shot, and what I discovered, underneath the (genuinely off-putting) flash game look and feel, is a game of truly staggering complexity and compelling depth.NEO Scavenger is a game in which you can wrap a rag around your face when exploring buildings to avoid inhaling toxic mold, pry open the lock on a storage shed with your crowbar, find an empty soup can and a left shoe, and pump your fists into the air in triumph IRL because now you won't have to worry about getting blistered feet, and you can boil the water you've been finding to make it safe for consumption.  Now, if only you had some pants...Similarly, no other game has ever filled me with such joy and sheer relief at finding an adult-sized backpack.  Such an item enables you to carry enough wood and water that you don't have to keep stopping every few spaces to make camp, and you can make much better time on foot towards that mysterious glow in the East!One game, I was attacked by a feral dog, who I beat to death with my bare hands, falling down into the mud and becoming exhausted.  Using a shard of glass, I skinned the beast after it died from internal hemmorhaging brought on by my pummeling.  I took its meat and cooked it over a fire, overjoyed that I'd figured out how to do so.  Delicious, life-giving dog meat.  I used its hide to wrap around the glass shards and make a crude shiv, not knowing what else to do with it.  I was then set upon by a bandit who'd heard my struggles with the dog, to whom I surrendered, knowing I stood no chance.  He left me naked and near death from hypothermia.  I ran into the woods and quickly built a fire as night fell, plotting my revenge, sleeping fitfully on the ground.  When dawn broke, I went to the nearest building and by sheer chance, found some clothing and a crowbar.  I went in search of the bandit who took my dog meat, only to find him dead near some other buildings.  The wastes are cruel indeed.If you miss Wasteland 1, if you think Fallout 2 really badly needed detailed wound dressing and immune system mechanics, this is the game for you.  It would be really nice if you could choose to play as a woman, but privately I suspect that the creator didn't want to deal with modeling pregnancy or the menstrual cycle.  Can't say as I blame him.			"

												Hands down one of the best games out there.It's like a single-player Rust roguelike set in a Fallout style post-apocalyptic wasteland with a dash of dwarf fortress adventure mode.Outstanding but not overbearing or mandatory story. You can just ignore it and survive, or you can persue it and enjoy the eerie and compelling narrative.Incredible, constantly changing and progressing combat. Tons of variables including fatigue, damage type, range, and even intimidation make sure that the combat stays complex, deep into the game. The graphics might look off-putting at first, but they're exactly where they need to be. After five minutes of play, you're completely immersed.Salvaging is wonderful. Do I explore the crumbling apartment building? It might collapse. I could use a torch so I can see better and maybe not hurt myself, but then it's more likely that something angry will see the light and come for me.I can't give it enough praise. I don't play single players games, but I LOVE playing this and comparing stories with my friends.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the crafting system is a bit clunky, and a lot of things aren't explained as well as they could be.

Early Access Review
								How I LOVE this game!It has the extensiveness of a great exploration and scavenging game, but it actually has a -goal-, including stories, quests and npc's but without revealing everything in the first 5 minutes of playing. In fact, after almost 18 hours of playing I get the feeling I'm only scratching the surface of finding out what's really going on - who I am and what I am supposed to be doing. The guidance you get is intuitive but directions are given sparingly. There are loads of stats kept, you get an idea of that when you die - everything you achieved is being summed up, giving you hints of events that have been set in motion.Gonna start another round right NOW			"

												This is a truly excellent game, and I'm glad to see it's getting some press, although not as much as it deserves.I knew nothing about this game going in. I got it as part of a Humble Bundle and figured it was worth a try. I think I played it for about 5 hours straight that first time. It's probably the greatest random find I've had.You have various perks and handicaps that you select to build your character, so you can choose to have excellent vision and mechanical skill but be a weak, feeble insomniac. After you create your character, you wake up in a hospital, with no idea what's going on and why the world has gone to hell around you. Immediately, you have to deal with a dogman who's charging down the hallway towards you. Your traits will affect how you can deal with it. Afterwards, you venture into the outside world. It is bleak and largely empty. You'll set off, with nothing but the hospital gown on your back. You can forage for food and water, but you should really make sure that the food's fresh. Do you know what berries are poisonous? Can you trust that water? Explore a little further and you'll see some ruined buildings. Scavenge in them and you might find some actual clothes to keep you warm, maybe some preserved foodstuffs or a cell phone. Be careful, though, and try not to make too much noise.You see someone on the horizon. You wonder whether they can explain what happened, but then you notice the rough spear that they're wielding. They charge at you, and you try to run. You can't get away fast enough, so you try to fight them off with a broken bottle you've picked up. You take the spear in the shoulder, and you stagger with the pain, but you get in an incredibly lucky thrust with the bottle and your opponent goes down. You shred some of your clothes and wrap the makeshift bandages around your wounds, but it's too late--infection has taken hold. In your last conscious moments you watch night fall, and you see a glow in the distance. It may be an illusion created by your feverish mind, but it almost looks like city lights...Each playthrough is memorable in this game, even the ones where you freeze to death the first night. If you survive in this strange new world, you can find people and locations that will help you find out background about this world. There is a story here, but you have to go searching for it. Even if you don't find all the backstory, you still have a tale of desperate survival that's incredibly compelling. I heartily recommend the game to anyone who's interested in survival games.			"

												I don't think this is a bad a game per se, I think it is a game that suffers from poor design choices that make it a lot less fun than it could be with just a little more thought and understanding of what makes a game fun. The basic premise is promising - post-apocalyptic survivor wakes up with nothing and is left to fend for themselves.Unfortunately, you are totally at the mercy of the RNG in this game, meaning that one bad result = game over. Given how almost all mechanics apart from crafting in the game are RNG-based, that means a lot of die rolls and a lot of potential for that one unlucky roll to come up. This is particularly evident in combat, where one lucky roll/critical hit means game over. You can mitigate this somewhat by trying to avoid combat. But you will not be entirely able to avoid combat and retreating is, you guessed it, RNG-based. Now of course, RNG-based games always feature bad luck - it's what the R stands for after all. What separates the wheat from the chaff (and where NEO Scavenger desperately falls short) is whether you can recover from ""bad luck"", i.e. to what extent you are at the mercy of factors outside of your control. Good games always give the player a sense of control over their own destiny – even if the RNG is brutal. When I play something like nethack and die, I normally think, ""had I done XYZ differently, I might have survived "". NEO Scavenger is far too unforgiving in this respect. A single hit can one-shot you. An unlucky stumble in combat can mean game over. However much you can hedge your bets, the nature of a RNG means that at some point you will be unlucky. When I die in NEO Scavenger I think, “had the RNG been kinder, I might have survived”. That's a bad sign.This is a real shame, because the combat in itself is interesting and tactical enough to be engaging initially. But a few games in, and combat no longer interests me. Why not just throw a die at the start and see if I get one-shotted and save me the hassle of trying to be tactical/retreat? This sums up my core problem with NEO Scavenger: it feels like the game is a single dice throw that simply determines how and when you will die; not whether you will die. And that's why it’s not fun.Other ways to die include dying of hypothermia (= the RNG didn’t spawn enough clothes in the first ~10 turns), infected wounds (=the RNG didn’t spawn a fire-proof canister for boiling water; or alcohol) etc. It’s essentially a glorified version of Snakes & Ladders or Ludo, games determined purely by luck of the dice. There are a number of other obvious flaws that would be forgivable if the game itself was fun: Flash is a terrible choice of platform, there are several bugs still in the game (e.g. the act of changing, not wearing, footwear gives you blisters; visual glitches) and the interface (particularly crafting) is clunky to say the least. But none of this would matter if the core game was actually fun.			"

												Great game if you like scavenging and inventory management because you'll be able to loot lots of stuff and then put that stuff in many different pockets. Do you want to keep that precious rock in your pants? You could keep it in your training hoodie. Or maybe in a shopping bag. Ok, shopping bag it is. But how do you want to hold that shopping bag? In your hand? Other hand? Maybe on your shoulder?Oh, and you'll die a lot so don't get attached to that shopping bag.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a deep and thoughtful turn-based survival/exploration game with an addictive, ruthless roguelike play style.  You will awaken, helpless and practically naked, in a hostile world.  You will scrounge through ruins for scraps you can cobble together into gear (with one of the best crafting systems I've seen anywhere).  You will encounter hostile inhabitants, maybe kill them, probably die anyway of festering wounds.  Then, you'll play again. "

This game is hard but it being hard makes the game more fun. I would love to see this game become local multiplayer. As this game continues to evolve I will support it all the way.

								I purchased this game after playing the free demo and reading off a note on Darkwood's page from a developer stating its awesomeness. I was not let down. On the surface it looks a little confusing, but even in alpha state there's a lot of depth, a huge crafting list, very few bugs and a fun, immersive atmosphere. Your choices feel extremely important all the way through, and the realism of some of the crafting and health mechanics is wonderful.If you like survival games, are tired of zombies and enjoy being more tactical, this turn-based apocalyptic survival sim will become one of your favorites.

												NEO Scavenger is a kind of game where you need to keep an eye on everything, your wounds, your diseases, your equipment, hunger, thirst. It might give you a feeling the game is just another boring survival, but this is something that is worth checking out. It's half text based, but it has inventory managing and all that stuff a cool RPG game should have. In NEO Scavenger you don't level up or train, you are the human you always been, and no matter if you are unarmed, or have a full equipment including a shotgun, someone might come at night and butcher you in your sleep just because you forgot to set up that noise trap. It's a 100% survival game.			"

												NEO Scavenger is something of an oddity among survival games, in that it is extremely good. It's an intriguing mashup of genres - take The Road crossed with The Mist with a little dash of Blade Runner and throw in a sprinkling of cryptozoology and Unsolved Mysteries and you've got NEO Scavenger in a nutshell. It works extremely well despite this hodgepodge of influences, and the world at no point feels contrived or artificial.In any case, I'm getting ahead of myself: at the beginning of the game, none of this concerns you. Waking up in a deserted cryo-facility three-quarters naked and knowing nothing but your name, your most immediate priority is survival. You have several routes to achieve this, but all of them involve the same basic points: eat, drink, sleep, stay warm, don't get sick and don't get wounded, and if you do get wounded, take care of yourself promptly. You accomplish this basic survival through two main methods. The first is scavenging, which involves travelling across the hex-based overworld map, choosing a tile to scavenge, and then choosing a specific location within that tile to scour, and at last choosing what abilities and items you'll use in the process. The yields are seldom all that great, but this is the game where you will feel exuberantly grateful for plastic shopping bags, worn flip flops, plastic bottles and old pots - where an intact shopping cart by comparison is an unimaginable score. Most of these things you use in crafting, in which you turn things you find into marginally more useful things.If it sounds easy, believe me when I say it's not. Comestibles are scarce, and there's only so much nutrition you can get out of 50-year-old bags of chips and snack cakes. The pressing threat of starvation can lower you to the point where you're wandering across the land eating every little thing that seems the least bit edible to buy a few more hours of life, a threatening prospect when your character lacks the botanical skill to identify poisonous foodstuffs.What to do when you run into a stray feral dog thus becomes a no-brainer. When pressed enough, you might even contemplate the unthinkable. Encounters with both animals, people and other things are both somewhat rare and appropriately tense. You most often can't judge a person's intentions by sight alone, and trying to talk things out can leave you extremely vulnerable if they turn out hostile. In some cases, if you stumble onto a face-to-face encounter with someone, you may not even try to talk, given that even that moment of hesitation would be enough for them to stick a meat cleaver in your skull.The combat in this game is a little bit of an odd duck. It's a bit similar to the original Wasteland, turn based, highly abstracted and without a tactical map - every enemy has a number representing their distance from you, and you have a number of options - advance or fall back, charge or run away. If your target is within range of your weapon, you can attack, and you can pull various special maneuvers or defensive moves depending on the circumstances. It can get a bit mechanical if you know what you're doing and are fairly well kitted, but when you're more down on your luck it can be fairly exciting in an 'oh god please let me live through this' sort of way, as playing it safe can become less justified if it means prolonging an encounter where every moment threatens death. Altogether though, the combat lacks dilemmas, in that there is almost always an objectively optimal action to take in each given situation. Not that it doesn't still have interesting situations - enemies with guns are an interesting example, as you have to weigh the possibility that they're bluffing with that of them actually having bullets and plan accordingly, and this is after all a game where you can win the fight but die slowly and painfully in your camp of an infected cut, huddled up in a sweaty sleeping bag and shivering with fever.Death, I should mention, comes easy and takes many forms, if that wasn't already clear. If a scavenger stumbled onto your camp while you sleep, there's little you can do. Even if you manage to wake in time, you might be better off running blindly rather than risking a fight in the dark. But you don't need to fight to die. Cholera, food poisoning, diarrhea, infection, hypothermia, exposure to chemicals, yet more exotic diseases - there's plenty of ways to die and none of them are pleasant. One of my bigger problems with the game plays into this - there's certain encounters where you're given choices that can kill you instantly. On one hand, this makes every choice feel grave. On the other, it's kind of a cheap shot, and you can suffer immense penalties from consequences you had no way of foreseeing.One of the things that I found immensely interesting as a possible consequence of the above is how the wasteland comes to warp your sense of morality. Whereas in other games you might be inclined to do good because you think you're a good person, here, the stress of constantly looming starvation, predation by other humans and the ease with which death comes can make you rather disinclined to stick your neck out for others. Even if you throw a good deed or two out now and then, putting yourself in harm's way for someone else's benefit is not something that the world encourages. If you find yourself in a state of pressing enough need, you might even find reason to screw an innocent over for your own benefit. Once you're put in that situation, you kind of start to sympathize with all the people trying to kill you for your stuff. At the very least, you can't really blame them any more, not when they're in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation as you. In that way, the game is an excellent illustration of how irrelevant morality becomes when survival is at stake, and the horror that results from that.The game does have story, I should mention, and even a vague sort of plot. The writing is very good, the world building is great and the atmosphere is amazing. I should warn you that this game is incredibly bleak - it's not the sort of wacky post-apocalyptic amusement park of the more recent Fallout games, or even the relative optimism of the originals and FONV - it is a world of misery, starvation, murder, cannibalism, despair, negligence, scarcity and extinction. It isn't actively malicious, the depiction of suffering is not gratuitous - the world is callously indifferent, and this comes across in the writing marvelously. The world doesn't center around the protagonist, and for most purposes you're just another wasteland ragman whom nobody gives a hoot about. Some locations and encounters could have used a little more fleshing out - in one particular instance I imagined that my character could have the opportunity to finally get some answers about the state of things in the world, but to my disappointment I couldn't even ask about even the littlest point of interest. Incidentally, I found that the odd bits of old newspaper offering scattered details about the world's backstory far more interesting than the plot involving the protagonist's past.In that vein, one of my bigger problems was a relative lack of content. There's plenty for the price, but a few more locations, conversations, quests, NPCs, cryptids to encounter and supernatural horrors would have done wonders for a relatively small investment. In the course of my first successful playthrough, I've seen just about everything there is from one point of view. There's still time to start new playthroughs and see how things turn out for different choices and to explore bits of missed content, but overall there's still less than I'd have liked, in an ideal world.Ultimately though, NEO Scavenger was one of my favourite video game experiences of recent memory. It's engaging and atmospheric, and weaves gameplay and narrative seamlessly together. More games should try to be like NEO Scavenger.			"

												Best survival game ever.1st life: tried to make a feral dog my companion then died2nd life: couldn’t find any food other than berries and mushrooms then died.3rd life: ran into a fellow surviver. He wasn't so nice, then died.4th life: Mellon Heads are mean… Then died.5th life: Hiding behind cover didn’t work,then died.6th life: couldn’t find cloths or fire to keep warm and died.7th life: it didn’t stop raining so i got hypothermia and died8th life: i tied to beat the crap out of a bad mutha but kept missing due to loss of blood and died.9th life: some guy with a crow bar tried to attack me. After beating the crap out of him he ran so i tackled him and kicked him in the head till he died. I then cut him up into little tiny pieces, took his crowbar and moved on. 2 mellow heads found me, i beat them with the crow bar, cut them up, put them in a shopping cart i found, cooked them and ate them. Got in another fight, crushed his head, cut him up, and kept his meat around for later. Some guy with a .308 rifle heard me looting and followed my tracks. He shot me in the gut while i ran at him. I ducked behind some cover and bandaged up before moved up from cover to cover until i could stab him with a pointy stick. I killed the guy with the gun and survived the gunshot wound only to later die from it getting infected.Long story short, get a melee skill. You'll need it. You'll die a lot but eventually you'll get lucky, kill someone, and eat their corpse for survival. This game is really hardcore survival so prepare to cry a little bit. Just keep strong, never loose hope, have fun and just maybe you'll survive.Cons:-Theres lots of BAD random encounters that you want to try your luck on but DONT. If something even SEEMS like a bad idea. Thats because it is and you WILL DIE.-i wish is was a mobile app so i could play it all day.			"

												Let me just say this at the outset: even though I've put more than 50 hours into NEO Scavenger, I still haven't beaten the game. Not because it's dense (it is), not because it requires you to wrestle with brutal RNG (it does), and not because it can kill you whenever it darn well pleases even after hours of scavenging and gearing up (it can--and it will). I haven't beaten this game simply because I haven't felt the need.There is a story here: after picking your traits (ranging from combat and technical expertise to wilderness lore) and weaknesses (like nearsightedness and physical fragility) you wake up in a cryogenic facility in a world struck by a mysterious apocalypse. At first you have nothing but your name, a hospital gown, and a mysterious amulet. But with a lot of scavenging and a lot more luck, you can find and craft the gear necessary to fend off the raiders, disease-ridden cultists, and horrifying creatures that roam the wilds as you search for your identity and uncover the secrets of the world.The game is broken up into two sections: the hex-based overworld and text-based encounters. On the overworld, you move from hex to hex to get from Point A to Point B, stopping at urban hexes to scavenge for items and wilderness hexes to scavenge/hunt for food. When you enter the same hex as an NPC, you initiate an encounter in which you can choose to offer a ceasefire and go your separate ways, or engage in combat (the more likely event). Scavenging, combat, and most story events are presented in a choose-your-own-adventure-style: the situation is explained to you in detail and you can decide from a number of options (others being open or closed to you depending on your traits and equipment). Most choices you make are basically dice rolls. In combat, for example, dodging and attacking requires you to roll your luck against your opponent. Actions that are unlocked by specific traits or items (for example, luring an enemy into a trap with your trapping skill) are always successful. But because of the nature of the game, it doesn't always matter how careful and prepared you are: you can and will be one-shotted by powerful enemies. Even average enemies can kill you if they sneak up on you in your sleep, or get lucky with a good strike, or if you fall during combat and can't manage to get up. And if you die, that's it. You have to start from the beginning.So with that said, if you get this game and want to beat it, prepare to be frustrated. Prepare to lose a lot of important rolls. Prepare to get a game over based on trial and error in which a single choice leads to your death without any warning or indication beforehand. And if none of these things bother you, then prepare for a lot of reading and a lot of experimentation just to find out how to craft a decent starting weapon or light a fire.If, however, you're like me and don't care about finishing the game, then you will find a surprisingly satisfying survival simulation with brutal combat and a crafting system that will make you feel like a genius. It's perfectly possible to ignore the main quest, set up camp somewhere, and live day by day off the land and your luck. In fact, I'd suggest you do this for your first few playthroughs--even if you ultimately want to beat the game--because you'll learn what works and what doesn't.Here's the bottom line: NEO Scavenger is a dense game that doesn't have much in the way of flash. But it's got a lot of depth and surprising complexity. It's a game that relies a lot on luck; you can fight and kill a giant man-wolf-beast with a spear, then die the next day because of some bad water. But this can be mitigated to some extent by knowledge, which you will only gain from playing--and dying--a lot.			"

												This game is *almost* good, but like many roguelikes I've seen come around, the devs ultimately seemed more concerned with making the game hard than making the game fun. Most interactions with this game are like this:Player: Oh boy, I found a gun!NEO Scavenger: But you didn't find any clothes in the first two turns, so I'm going to have to kill you.or:Player: Oh boy, clothes *and* guns!NEO Scavenger: Guess what? Disease time! Have fun dying from something completely out of your control!I understand the need for realism, but there's a point where that has to bow to gameplay and NEO Scavenger just often kills the player out of nowhere and pisses away a few hours of progress. Oh yeah, this game is permadeath-only, which already alienates everyone who actually likes not losing hours of progress due to unfair BS. There should be challenges, yes, but the player should never be put in a unwinnable situation if they themselves weren't the ones who put themselves in it. I'd be a bit more forgiving if this game HAD A PROPER SAVE SYSTEM, but since it doesn't, I can't forgive it for destroying several playthroughs simply because I rolled a bad number.			"

								NEO Scavenger has that ""special game"" feeling.  By that I mean, a game where the possibilities seem limitless, and you're carried away into a new world on adventure.  The last game to do this for me was Crusader Kings 2.It is also an example of classic ""simple to learn, hard to master"" design. Most of the systems (combat, crafting, movement, line of sight etc.) are very straightforward, and easy to grasp.  But put them all together, and almost everything you do is a meaningful choice that will continue to affect you throughout the game.Also, my favourite contemporary novel is The Road, by Cormac Mccarthy, and this is as close as you are going to get to experiencing that chill when someone asks:  ""What are you eating?""

												Alright, look. I love the game. I do, really. It's awesome, it's fun, it's addictive, and honestly it could teach people a few things about surviving in such a situation that they can't depend on society anymore. Almost all the techniques in the game are solid survival techniques that could very well save your life in the real world. But after a series of deaths before I could even get enough supplies to make the journey east (which I understand is a roguelike feature, but bear with me.), I felt the need to write this review. One word, ladies and gentlemen: Yezinka. There's only one of them in the game world, and it wanders the map until it encounters your player. When it does, it hovers around in the hexes around you, and waits for you to inevitably have to sleep. You can't kill it by jumping it during the day because it can manage to sprint somewhere around 12 paces per move, while you can manage at best 4. It's also very difficult to hit with ranged weaponry (never got to try melee). Now here's the lemon in the wound: When you go to sleep, it immediately beelines for you, and steals your eyes. You can do NOTHING about it. You get around two turns, which is enough to stand up and start to look for it, and suddenly your eyes are gone. You can't do anything to recover them unless you've happened to encounter this late in the game and are near the city, and have been hoarding enough cash for cybersurgery. I say you need to be near the city because the condition ""No Eyes"" seems to flag you and every single enemy creature on the map drops what they're doing and attempts to kill you. I made a valiant effort and managed to kill two bandits and a dog before I was just overwhelmed with going into a new battle every turn (every other turn very VERY occasionally). Maybe if I were given a chance to pack up the things I had and try to luck my way to the city and sell everything I had for a single eye, I wouldn't have such a problem with this. Maybe if I were allowed to live for a bit and get a balancing attribute after a few turns that mitigated the fact that I can't see anymore, that'd be fine too. But as it is, if luck allows this broken monstrosity to seek you out without being killed by other wild animals or lucky NPCs, you are screwed, and there's no preparation at all that you can attempt to save yourself. I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that has a chance of giving the player such an enormous middle finger. But if you can get past that and you think it's not something that will bother you, then buy this game. The Yezinka is an enormous infected zit on the face of an otherwise outstanding game.			"

												This game is an excellent example of post-apocolyptic, open world Survival games. It combines elements of survival, combat strategy, crafting, perma-death, inventory management, rpg, and a real sense of danger just lurking around every hex -- mostly in that order, I'd say. It's also turn-based rogue-like with the map changing slightly each time you begin a new journey. Do not let the modest graphics fool you -- they will be the least of your concerns, I assure you. The combat system is actually rather realistic! Based on the character ablities and flaws you choose from the beginning, the combat system allows you to pick from quite a few options such as Charging your opponent, Headbutting, Tackling them to the ground, franticly retreating, sneaking, taking cover, sneaking behind cover, Offer to Talk, Melee combat, kick while down, shooting a ranged weapon -- too many to name, here. Choose wisely, or face the consequenses. I really enjoy the combat aspect of this game, but I imagine there are lots of players who would perhaps prefer stealth over Strength, and trade-based ablilities such as Botanist or Hacking over Athletisism. You can choose from flaws (Examples: bad metabolism, fatiques faster) as well, which allow you pick another ability or two to boost your luck. And it is almost always luck. I'm currently playing a character with the traits Strong, Melee, Athletic, Botany, and for my flaw -Metabolism.I have no idea who I am, but I appear to be a hulking, savage vegetarian. It's been 14 days, and I've killed at least 24 people -- I'm losing count, and can no longer remember any of their faces. I've been alerting many opportunists while  scavenging with a pickaxe and a lighter, but in turn, I've killed most all of those who couldn't escape. I'm hunting. Am I even human, anymore? At least I haven't resorted to cannibalism... yet.. and I'm sick with infection somehow. I found a couple of white pills, but without any knowledge of what they are, I fear the result. I've made a temporary home in a high-rise for at least 4 days now, only venturing outside to eat berries and mushrooms, and to gather water while I wait out whatever has me sick. Hopefully, I can make it through just one more night.....I have yet to finish the RPG portion of this game, but so far the stories and context are both quite fun to read.I played quite a bit before it was released, and it's also available in your browser! I only wish it was multiplayer compatable!!!			"

												One of those games where you (inevitably) die and then immediately ask yourself, 'Ok what can I do this next time around to avoid that?'  It's not about your 'progress' as much as it is about the single experience.Maybe this time I'll find a car, maybe I'll become a warlord, maybe I won't find shoes and will freeze to death after 5 turns....I actually was able to get some decent progress after a very short period of time, but then realized that neglecting hypothermia just isn't a viable strategy, so I died.  Despite the odds of survival, I'm looking forward to playing well into the evening.			"

												Hey smartass, if you think Fallout 4 is too easy, why not come and try your hand at some NEO Scavenger? After feral dogs jump up and rip your face off with their teeth for the fifth time, I bet you'll appreciate having a robot butler to care for you, you big cosseted ghost town lover!Yeah, you think you're hot ♥♥♥♥ because you dunked a few Fat Mans into a Super Mutant's face? You're nothing. You have never been in a post-apocalyptic wasteland until you're running around, frantically searching for clothes in abandoned buildings to keep from freezing to death. You haven't lived because you haven't frantically searched for a soup pan to boil water with, because you know all the water laying around is an invitation to kill you. You haven't really survived because you know that the world knows about fifteen different ways to snuff your life out, and is cold and indifferent about everyone one of those ways because that's how hardcore and brutal planet Earth is. You haven't known the true terror of conflict as another one of your kind stalks you with a hunting rifle for all the batteries and water bottles you have.You like being in constant danger? Good, because that's how the game masks its short length. From the very start, half of the game's goal is just living long enough to reach the Megacity of Detroit. It's a short walk, but it's a short walk fraught with danger that will kill people dead (especially if you decide you're too good for guns and try to go for a Melee-only character). It's an open world and there's all sorts of fun secrets to find. If you live long enough to get there, that is.But if you do, you'll suddenly realize just how cramped it all seems. And yet, it feels a bit unreasonable to ask for more, because the journey to finding the secret is a bunch of little experiences in and of itself.Also the random encounter roleplaying sequences do a great job illustrating how depressingly hostile the world is, but also rarely try to kill you outright. And I understand why they're there - even the hardest of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the wasteland will go down easy - but VERY SUDDENLY losing a character I've grown to love after playing for thirty hours carting ♥♥♥♥ back and forth to the DMC because I chose poorly really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not saying this is entirely a bad thing (I was choosing rather carelessly), but a little forewarning to sudden death is appreciated.Anyway! If you want to play Super Hardcore mode in NEO Scavenger, take your dumb little talisman off and see how hard the game gets. Then you can complain about it to me in the comment section, you lily-livered aluminium can collector.			"

												NEO Scavenger is not without its faults. The crafting system is tedious to sort through and use repeatedly, and the game doesn't always give you a fair shake- I remember one run specifically in which my character froze to death before he could find clothes, another where he was killed instantaneously by an assailant he never saw, and for the love of God, NEVER, EVER TAKE OFF THE AMULET YOU START WITH. Just... DON'T do it.That being said, I can recommend NEO Scavenger regardless because, even in spite of some debatably fair play, I'm still coming back to it, because I don't want it to beat me. That feeling is the hallmark of all true roguelikes.			"

												Could not stop playing Neo Scavenger for weeks after picking it up. Can't recommend it highly enough. Aside from having solid gameplay/balance, it also checks off some of these important boxes for a survival game:-frequent painful death (took me a dozen playthroughs to survive past a few days)-lots of clutter to collect, most of which has use based on your strategy-meaningful loadout variety (very different strategies/experience based on initial skill choices)-compelling story progression; you'll get a bit further each time before dying or making an irreversible poor choice-does a good job of setting an ominous dystopian post-apocalyptic wasteland cyperpunk toneIn terms of critique, I have to admit it does feel a bit sparse in terms of core content. Not only does the excellent foundation beg for an expansion of material (you could say that about any quality game), but certain items, mechanics, and gameplay elements clearly feel unfinished. The main story line is short as well, but feels much longer than it is because of how hard it is to progess through it without dying. Luckily there is a small but active modding community that has done some impressive things to expand the game in terms of content as well as mechanics. Anyway, Neo Scavenger isn’t perfect but as one of the few games I’ve ever purchased at full price, I’m comfortable saying its worth it.  "

Player has begun transformation into a Wendingo.NEO Scavenger is a turn based isometric roguelite survival sandbox role-playing game. In the at first bare feet of Philip Kindred, dazing panicked out of a cryogenic facility, the plotline tasks the player, in addition to surviving, with finding their forgotten past and any background on the Michigan wasteland. The menus are unintuitive and a bit of a mess to navigate effectively, but eventually it becomes more or less second nature. Remarkably detailed sprites represent everything in the game world, including your ""paper doll"" character avatar. There's really not much else to say about the graphics: it's not a super high tech 3D game. The screenshots should give an idea of how it will look like.On the sound front, the effects are equally simple: crunchy footsteps when moving on the map, cracking and popping firewood when you get a campfire going. The little slurp sound when consuming water is especially satisfying when you're heavily dehydrated, even if it may only buy you some time in the end. Music is ominous when it does trigger.You start the game by choosing your character's desired positive skills and negative traits - aside from Unstoppable and Elusive reputations and one surgery, you gain no more skills or traits throughout the game, so choose wisely what you'll stick with on your playthrough. Your character then wakes from a cryo pod, with an imposing and lethal dogman approaching his location. Your abilities and any found items can provide additional responses to encounters and combat, even some which may not be immediately apparent.Once having escaped from or dealt with the dogman, you're pressured into finding means of regulating your temperature, quenching your hunger and thirst, and any other bodily ailments. Scavenging is a big part of the game, but even bigger is smart scavenging. Moving on the map leaves trails, which get more intense if you decide to run, if you're suffering from certain ailments or if you're pure and simply bleeding. Searching for loot in promissing places is always a tradeoff between the chance of winning something, the risk of being stuck or hurt by collapsing structures, and of making a big enough racket that you get spotted.Combat is a difficult affair; it's less about striking with the biggest stick than it is about dancing around your enemy and exploiting any vulnerable states while covering your own flank, and exploiting the environment whenever possible. In general, fallen combat entities are at the greatest risk, as they can't do anything but crawl, roll dodge and get up. For a pleasant change from the norm, melee weapons have their own ranges: a crowbar will reach further than your own two fists. Firearms, of course, are even deadlier, but they use hard to find, expensive munition, and are cumbersome to store.Once combat is resolved, the surviving party needs to tend to their wounds. A fairly in-depth medical system presents itself with bruises and cuts, which may bleed, and demand different types of care. Pain accumulates from multiple wounds or a couple severe ones, like crippled limbs, and too much pain will interfere negatively with all of your activities, culminating in passing out (usually a death sentence in combat). Blood loss remains a concern both in and outside of combat, as penalties to your physical prowess and temperature regulation pile up if you run low, but using dirty rags to bandage wounds is generally a bad idea. In the longer term, immune system strength determines how easily you're able to fight back against things like cholera and infected wounds. The standard survival needs appear too, and they, too, negatively affect your actions if you go too hungry, thirsty, tired, carry too much load, and are too hot/cold.The game does seem to have an unintrusive overarching plotline, with the first player nudge appearing in the first night: the distant lights, promise and opportunities of the Detroit Mega City. Trudging through marshes and ruined suburbs and high rises, popping pills to keep the pain of fighting under control, setting noise makers when camping to stand a chance at catching trespassers before they do you in, going cannibalistic, random encounters with unfavourable actions and outcomes, are all just some of the things you'll face on your journey to survive in Michigan.While permadeath remains a staple of modern, indie survival games, it is a bit of a shame to lose the progress of a highly developed plotline to seemingly random deaths. I guess that's what makes this game that little bit more special than the droves of survival sandbox games coming out in recent years: a sense of purpose.It is a good game with great replayability. Definitely recommended with a small sale.			"

												If you're looking for an intense, unforgiving turn-based isometric strategy surivival game with perma-death I recommend you give this a try, although I do recommend picking it up when it's on sale, $15,- seems a bit of a steep price in my opinion.You start off the game by creating your character, selecting strenghts and weaknesses, after which the proverbial ♥♥♥♥ immediately hits the fan.You find yourself just awoken from cryo-sleep in a facility when you notice a strange-looking beast approaching you. You can deal with this using strenghts you've previously selected, after taking care of the wolf-like creature you start to wonder where you are, or who you are, you remember next to nothing, and as you set foot outside the facility you notice everything has changed, buildings are in poor condition, and there are no signs of life to be found.You must scavenge for survival, your first order of business is protecting yourself from the elements, finding clothes is your #1 priority. After getting yourself warmed up and safe from hypothermia, you should probably find a way of protecting yourself, and scavenging for weapons can be a tedious task, but the excitement you get from finding a mint-condition rifle or shotgun is more than worth it, I won't spoil any more of the game, but I will say this: it's extremely unforgiving and I myself have never survived for more than 25 days, unraveling quite a portion of the story, but not close to all of it.TL;DRNEO Scavenger is an unforgiving and exciting survival game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the genre, but you will die. A LOT.Happy scavenging ;)			"

												You can die of diarrhea11/10 would diarrhea againWell, I did not expect 232 people to find my review helpful. That probably means I need to improve it. I mean, diarrhea is only one of the many things in this game. NEO Scavenger is a pretty tough survival game. Unlike most other survival games, this one is more strategic, and isn't first/third/ResidentEvil camera. It's like a hex-turn-based board game. When you begin a new game in NEO Scavenger, you're greeted with a page. Basically, you can pick traits to help you in your adventure (Botany lets you see if a certain mushroom is safe to eat, Lockpicking lets you break into locked buildings, etc.). There's also Flaws. Things like Insomniac will make sleeping more difficulty, and Metabolism will require you to eat more. Of course, some Flaws have positives. Metabolism, for instance, slightly increases healing. It's possible to encounter friendly NPC's, or ones that want to punch you until you recieve a concussion and die. Of course, there's a way to protect yourself from hostile NPC's (or you just want to kill friendly NPC's). There's a variety of weapons. It could be a Butcher Knife, a Shotgun, a bunch of pebbles (for the daring), and a Crowbar. There's obviously more, but those are a few.Speaking of NPC's, there's strange critters roaming around the world of NEO Scavenger. Ever wanted to encounter a DogMan? Or this creepy humanoid-like thing that wants eyes? It's in this game, and the latter is pretty creepy.NEO Scavenger has random encounters. You can encounter things like: a broken-down car with a sleeping bed inside, a tank with people inside, a dog, or some other stuff (that can be a little screwed up). There's also some set locations in the game. The game is randomized, but there are a few areas that are always there. For example, a large city, and a strange house. There's a few more, but you can look for those (or just Google them).NEO Scavenger has a looting feature. You can scavenge abandoned houses, buildings, and more. You might find worthless junk (like the almighty pebbles), or you might find a backpack, or even a gun! There's also left/right shoes. The quest for shoes begins begins as soon as you begin. Walking barefoot is no fun, and neither is freezing! Finding shoes and warm clothing is important at the beginning. You game will be cut short if you don't find these items ASAP.Well, there's probably a bunch of other stuff I may have forgotten to mention, but if I remember, I will surely add it in.Do get this game. There's also a demo, so try that out, too.			"

Early Access Review
								There are so many reasons to buy this. I'm not going to bang on too much. I will say that it's games like these (and Prison Architect, Kerbal Space Program, Papers Please etc) that restore my faith in game development. You don't need AAA budgets and staff to make a game that will grip people and make them want to play. You just need gameplay, care and attention and immersion. That's what this game brings to the table, in spades. You're alone in the wilderness. You'll die, a lot, but it'll feel like winning. In every game you'll see something new, try things a little differently, last a little longer sometimes, die within hours at other times. Nothing is ever bland. The graphics, though basic by standards today, detract from the experience not a jot. You know those games where you buy them in a sale and never play them, only to try on a rainy Sunday and realise you've been playing it all week? This is such a gem. £7 is a steal. There's nothing more you need to know. Buy it now.			"

												Very fun game. Honestly, there isn't really much I would recommend that the developers change, they were very thorough in making this game. Certainly nothing game-breaking (so far). Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.* Lot's of fun for the file size. It has a sense of brutality without relying on gore to get the message across. I recommend when you play this game that you do *not* look anything up first. The game is intuitive, and a great deal  of fun can be had by messing up. This is a great game for just getting on and having fun. If I had to think of a downside, it would be difficult but I would say there are two. The first would be that it is simple, and those that want fancy 3d graphics or a complex game should look to a different genre altogether. Second would be replayability. It has a good story, but there is something disappointing about each part of the story fleshed out: that's one fewer mystery for later. Of course, you can say that about any story-oriented game. Again, I would say that the keyword here is intuitive. Easy to pick up the mechanics, more difficult to use them effectively, but overally the difficulty is anywhere from mild to moderate. This isn't an 'easy' game per-se, but it certainly isn't hard. It is a game where risk and reward are both quite high in most encounters. A small slip up can cost you dearly, a well timed strike can earn you incredibly useful loot, so long as you have the space to carry it all. By far the most scarce resource in the game is space. You can't carry everything you find in the beginning, so deciding what is most valuable can be a very tough decision.All of the above serve to make it the ideal rogue-like game IMO.*EDIT: About the bugs, I should mention that there is a minor graphics bug where items will appear partly off-screen, and cannot be selected from boxes. This is uncommon, however, and easily fixed by switching between fullscreen and minimized (you can end in whatever screen you prefer). Probably not worth mentioning except that I had said ""Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.""EDIT 2: One other critisism: This game does not offer difficulty settings at this time. Initially, it seems difficult. After a few hours, it does seem slightly easy. Hopefully that will change in time, but with a sense of ease often comes recklessness (at least in my case), counteracting any potential for this game to become boring. It still remains a very fun game, and I look forward to updates.			"

												This is a good game let me tell you why as I recall the last moments of my last life:I had kept this character alive and well for a good 15ish days when suddenly in the middle of nowhere he began vomiting. I was worried but I had some Antacids on me so I swallowed them and kept going unknowing of what was happening. about a day later I saw I had a disease called 'blue rot' it was stage three. Having no clue of what this was and fearing for my characters life I looked it up on the wiki. Turns out naturally I only had a 30% change to survive it but If I found a certain NPC in a certain place (I wont tell you here) Then I could be cured and immunized. the problem was that in 72 hours there was a 70% chance I would be dead. Panicked by this I began to search the map frantically to the point where I was running through a forest at night when something approached me... I searched and searched but couldn't find anything due to the low light conditions I was stuck in. Then suddenly I was slashed in the stomach by what was revealed to be a dogman (think of a werewolf with no human form.) Startled I took my equipped crowbar and smacked it in the face stunning him. This didn't come without a cost however as the dogman swung again causing my leg to start bleeding profusely. I saw that the beast was stunned took my opportunity and ran while I could through sheer luck I lost it.  Wearily I continued my search for this illusive NPC well into my second sleepless night when I saw them. My dogman problem had tripled. Three dogmen 20m away. I didn't want to use it but I saw no other option. I took out the only item of value I had (a pistol with a full mag) from my bag and began to shoot knowing that running was out of the question due to their speed. 6/7 of the shots hit the pack but they were starting to close the distance. I took my bow from by back dropping the pistol and began to unload all five of my arrows into them. One of the dogmen had collapsed due to the pain I had inflicted but that still left two. There was now only 5m between me and them, my two sleepless night had left me on the verge of collapsing and even if I somehow survived this the blue rot would likely kill me. I wanted to die a hero at least. I dropped everything but my trusty crowbar. I braced for impact then swung with all my might at their leader. I was immediately slashed, battered and bruised but I had nearly got the leader at least. It was then that my sleepless nights  combined with effectively a marathon got the better of me. My battered body unable to continue collapsed of sleep deprivation and there unconscious I was torn to pieces and devoured by dogmen.This was only of of the epic moments of this life. From this game I have so many stories I could tell from wandering out of the cryo chamber for the first time to reveal the ruined world I was surrounded in to hunting a deer for an entire day with a single spear to turn its skin into a bag of which I hauled around the best cuts of meat I could get from it. This game is an experience and I recommend trying unless you don't like to read because to become really immersed then you need to read all the text they present to you.			"

												""...solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""Such is life in the ""state of nature"" described in Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes. NEO Scavenger illustrates this state more accurately than most survival games. Here you are not completely alone with wildlife in a sandbox like in The Long Dark (actually my personal favourite); but you're also not stranded on an island with mutant cannibals like in The Forest. Instead, you find yourself competing for resources with other survivors, some of them in desperate conditions like you are at first, and others thriving in the desolation and lawlessness. Once you manage to grasp the basics of survival, after several ""nasty, brutish, short"" attempts resulting in horrible deaths, you will also thrive in this chaos.This is a game built upon brutal trial and error, and the errors will often cost you all the progress you've made, with all the cool loot you've scavenged. But each death makes you stronger, smarter, more adapted: you live, you die, you live again. And it's this very brutality that makes it so rewarding. Even when you are several days in, thriving in the chaos like a badass, you can still get seriously sick and die abruptly, no matter how much you try to avoid the inevitable. But you soldier on. I did, and somehow I made it to the ending, which, according to this Reddit post, is very hard to reach even after several tries. Here[dumptext.com] (MASSIVE SPOILERS) is my ending log, just in case anyone wants to check or compare.It also stands apart as an RPG as much as a survival game. Openly influenced by classic tabletop RPGs with creative problem solving through skills, it feels somewhat like playing the original Fallout for the first time once again (and that also means dealing with clunky mechanics). The encounters with characters and factions often have branching storylines and different, sometimes irreversible outcomes. The writing is a bit too purple sometimes, but that's a genre thing, and considering that it's a one-man development team, it's still better than the writing in many AAA games.The gameplay mechanics can be quite irritating at first, so I can only advise that you pick up on the hotkeys ASAP and get used to them, it'll make life easier and counterbalance the addictivity of the scavenging mechanic, the real rough core of the game, which manages to keep you busy for hours and hours while you search for that one left boot in good condition or whatever. Realism isn't a defining factor exactly, but it's well-balanced so that it plays like a challenge, but also not complete scarcity. There is loot aplenty once you learn how to optimise the scavenging.I've put 109 hours into it according to Steam, but since it is a game that you can just leave in the background while you browse, I didn't spend every hour playing it in a frenzy. This is a game that walks the fine line between casual and hardcore in a fascinating way. It's a background game that can hook your attention for hours in between other things that might hook your attention. And I believe it has immense replay value beyond the seemingly endless cycle of scavenging and dying. I intend to try another character build at some point and see how the story will develop.The universe created by the dev has potential to develop into a franchise and evolve into bigger, more complex gameplay mechanics, and I don't mean necessarily in first-person, though that could be interesting. As a launching effort, NEO Scav is a brilliant little game, a real diamond in the rough of clunky mechanics. Yet it could be much more than that.			"

												A hardcore RPG that doesn't give you any real direction after it kicks you unceremoniously into its world to find the your story on your own, if you can survive long enough.  This game combines a hardcore sandbox survival game and a story of your character trying to find out who they are, and why they are here into one of the best gaming experiences I've encountered in a very long time.  Expect to die and restart several times while first playing NEO Scavenger, there is no reloading, only learning from your last playthrough's mistakes.			"

Early Access Review
								After a particularly long 4-hour session (of multiple deaths) and many other playthroughs, I'm going to give a review of this game, and it's pretty harsh.Neo Scavenger is a game that has possiblity emanating from its mechanics. The writing is beautiful and manages to capture most any scenario that you're put into. Generally, it prides itself on being a survival, inventory-managing (think Deus Ex) roguelike that is incredibly unforgiving. Maybe a little too unforgiving.Generally, when I lose a roguelike or a game in general, it'd be nice to have some idea of what I was doing /wrong/. I don't have that sense while playing Neo Scavenger. Most every playthrough, I think I am playing at the top of my game, as best as possible. Enemies can randomly hit you in the head with their fist and instantly kill you, even if you're geared up to the max. Unless you get ridiculously lucky, the cold of the environment WILL kill you. Eating the wrong things WILL kill you. If you got unlucky and didn't find a town, the cold or wolves or zombies or bandits WILL kill you.It has stopped being fun to play. The UI is there. The mechanics are all there. The combat is thrilling. The art is there, the writing is there, and dammit I want this game to be so much more than it actually is. If you really want a hyper-realistic survival game, especially one as complicated as this one, then I can recommend it wholeheartedly. But if you're looking for an enjoyable, frantic gaming experience (as so many other survival games hope to achieve), Neo Scavenger unfortunately is far, far too luck-based to give any sense of accomplishment.In addition, over the 5 months I stopped playing, the ""skill ceiling"" or ""endgame"" has gotten no higher or larger as far as I can tell. A legendary melee weapon (the crowbar) is handed out basically for free, the warmest clothing can be found in nearly every building, and one corpse's food can sustain you forever, as can the numerous woods, rivers etc. If you don't start out with certain skills (botany comes to mind) then you'll be stuck relying on finding towns to survive. and you CAN'T get new skills aside from the implants that I've never seen.Overall, I think that with a bit of patching Neo Scavenger could be a great, renowned game. It's not that it needs polish; it needs content, and it needs a difficulty that scales directly with how skilled you are, and skill should /matter/ more than it does.			"

												Massive potential, awesome story, great fun and highly addictive but just when you think you're starting to win, you open the game to find your save file has evaporated.  This happens once, you think oh well try again.  After the tenth time you finally get jack of the game and move on.If developers are going to create a game with Perma-death, the golden rule is the only person who can kill the character is the player and their choices. Not glitches and bugs.Sorry but I'm moving on.			"

												An absolute masterpeice. If you enjoy a post appocolyptic scavanging and survival game with semi-randomly genorated areas,  this is the game for you.A chilling and brutal game of survival . Remember: Do what it takes. Kill your fellow man if need be. Or be the nice guy, see how long you last. There is a plot, but it's entierly optional. I would say more about it, but I try and keep my reviews spoiler free.  This game is not for those who want a casual survival like minecraft. This is for those who want a survival game. One step wrong and you will find yourself with a broken leg and cut Realisticly difficult and challenging, this game keeps me coming back for more every time. Each time I get a bit stronger, a little bit wiser. The music convays the mood and atmosphere perfectly. an eeriee sense of despiration .Overall I give this gem a 9/10. Absolutely reccomended for any who want a more intense survival.			"

												NEO Scavenger has to be one of my all time favorite games. Even when it was back in early access. The first time I tried it out, I played for six hours straight. That's a long time for me. I was just so in love with it.There is a storyline to follow, but you don't have to watch the story unfold with each playthrough, because NEO Scavenger doesn't hold your hand...at all. Whether you want to find more information about your life and what has happened to the world is up to you. Personally, I just like to see how long I can survive in this messed up wasteland.This game does have a steep learning curve, but once you figure things out, you'll be set to survive for weeks. And while some say the graphics are too unbearable to live with, I don't mind them. I think they are part of the charm that sucked me into the game in the first place.To be sure that this game is for you, check out the demo before you spend your fifteen bucks. That's what it's there for, right?			"

								Okay, Take the classic Fallout games and Combine them with Dungeons and Dragons.Now you have NEO Scavenger.NEO Scavenger is an overall fantastic game.If you enjoyed the classic Fallout games or if you enjoy playing tabletop RPGs such as DnD this game may appeal to you.NOTE: This review is based solely on my opinion, Do not be angry with me if you do not agree with my opinions.Pros- Retro Graphics to deliver a sense of Nostalgia. (Some people love em others hate em.) - Advanced Character Creation (Very similar to Project Zomboid) Traits and Flaws system makes endless character potentialTraits can help you survive, Such as using a skill to make fires from scratch- Complete Open WorldMove Spaces much like a tabletop RPG- Entriguing Lore- Awesome Choice-Based Turn Combat- Choices in Encounters allow for Interesting Outcomes- Good Inventory System, As well as Injury.- Fresh Scavenging SystemUse Skills + Items to increase items found, Random events while scavenging (Roof Collapse)Cons- Cruel Learning Curve (Not Necessarialy bad, Personally I like it.)- Relatively Short Storyline (Still in Progress)- Somewhat Linear StartWould be nice to be able to create your own character and spawn at a random location- Esscentials are difficult to findOverall I would say this game is a solid 9/10,This game is worth buying if you areA: A fan of older Fallout gamesB: A fan of Tabletop RPGsC: BothD: A Bad Mutha			"

												One of the best roguelike experiences I've encountered, everything about this game is lovable and enjoyable, though in the beginning it can be very unforgiving. After you start you (or at least I did) will die many times from freezing without knowing what to do about it. Later you realise what you should do (or google it) and you get into the game a lot. There is quite a lot to explore, although the game could have a lot more content than it's having. However considering that it's not a big project and not many people are working on it, it's understandable.Still, the price is quite high for what you get. It has a lot of replayability to a certain point, but after you reach that point and explore it all, there is nothing more to do. Updates bring something new quite often, but it's not really enough to keep you playing. I would advise buying it on at least 70% sale, or in a bundle or something. 8/10 Would join blue frogs			"

ATMOSPHERE:You (a random guy) wake up from a cryogenic sleep chamber, and have no recollection of anything. Not even who you are. Your goal is to make it to ""The Glow"" or Detroit Mega City as you may learn to call it both. Your goal is to make it here, exploring along the way, better equipping yourself with the task of finding out who you are. This is how I would imagine a post-apocalyptic Detroit happening.Constantly being bombarded by the ruthless Dogmen, and Bad Muthas, a Detroit street gang of brutal, thuggish cannibals who will NOT hesitate to attack you on sight. Also strangers and looters equipped with scoped hunting rifles, and Detroit Mega City Guards with rifles, shotguns, and full SWAT-type gear ready to exterminate you.You will be excited as ever to just find a pair of old plastic shopping bags and a shard of glass or a broken bottle to arm yourself with. Every little space in your inventory counts, so space management is almost as important to your survival as dealing with combat scenarios with a cool, calm, level head.GAMEPLAY:You will need to scavenge for loot while maintaining low visibility, otherwise if you think you're tough enough you can brazenly move into an abandoned building, scavenge it loudly and roughly, and hope someone or something doesn't hear or see you. The choices you make for every little situation in this game need to be approached with clear thinking, and taking into account repercussions of your actions is seriously encouraged for this experience.You will have random encounters within the story line and others along your travels.You may succomb to diseases from exposure to sick people, bad weather (hypothermia and pneumonia), food poisoning, and even BREATHING toxic fumes over time.You will wake up to people stealing your supplies and food or attempting to bash your skull in with a stone. Then be forced to make the decision to flee in complete terror, sneak up on the thief in the dark and take them by surprise, or just stand up from your sleep and attack them in a raging fury.If you can get past the clunky UI and lack of animation or intimate graphical control, this game is a dirty gem just waiting to be appreciated by the next ""arachaeologist"" who finds it. I never pictured myself enjoying a game that's 60% text-based, but I quickly fell in love with this game. Here, you can learn quickly from past mistakes and keep pushing forward. If you ever thought it was hard to survive in other ""survival"" games, this is FAR more unforgiving but also more rewarding to experience. True-to-life combat system that allows your simplest mistakes to be exploted by your enemy, possibly resulting in your death or serious injury.OVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:9.5/10Even if you hate text-based games, or games with hexes (I certainly did), you may find yourself immersed and deeply invested into this game. I highly recommend this for anyone who appreciates post-apocalyptic roleplaying games and/or heavy survival. Even at full retail price this is a worthwhile purchase. The game has a few flaws, but all are so minor and outweighed greatly by what good there is in the game that you quickly forget they exist or have trouble noticing them to begin with. Very reminiscent of the first game of the Fallout series, more so than the second, but this game has its own unique flavour.			"

												NEO Scavenger is an extremely difficult game at first. It doesn't hold your hand and you have to really think about the attirbutes to give to your character before the start of the game. Anything can kill you, even the smallest mistake. I accidentally clicked on the wrong type of berry and poisoned myself. There was nothing I could do as my character just got sicker and sicker. With all that said, it is an extremely rewarding game once you figure out a plan to survive. Each time you last a little longer in the game feels like a vitory and the story in the background is very interesting as well. I recommend reading the newspapers. Not all of the ariticles are important but it does make the world feel a little more alive and gives you clues on what could have happened to the character you play.			"

								This game is very addicting. At first it requires some time to get use to the proper steps to survive. I'm getting more fluent at playing but I can die at any point.

												A game you could easily get addicted to. You'll get lucky and find 4000 worth of equipment. You'll get unlucky and get instantly killed by a cannibal with nothing but an empty water bottle. There is some background story, several skills and different ways of surviving, and even more ways to thrive. Fair word of warning, the game is flash-based, so it's easy for it to overload flash, which could corropt your save or just make the game lag after a long time of surviving.			"

												NEO Scavenger is relentlessly brutal, surprisingly nuanced, and unapologetically old-school.It's a game where even after hours of play, the same enemies you started out fighting are still quite capable of ripping your throat out... if you get sloppy.  The elements are a real hazard, not just window-dressing.  Getting sick, getting thirsty, getting hungry, all affect how much you can do and how fast you can do it.And then there's Detroit.

												I was surviving for a week. Had a scoped rifle with some ammo hanging on my shoulder, a broad spear in my hand, I was in some army shoes, a nice pair of cargo pants, a hoodie with 3 layers of stuff underneath which was perfect for the weather. Had drinkable water for days, even more food, a full medkit, more stuff in my travois. Had an impressive kill-streak behind me.I was walking towards a town when I heard a rumble of a car's engine from somewhere in the town. It was there for a brief moment and then it faded. I was not far from ""Zom-Zom"".Feeling sleepy. I set up a camp with a fire in a small house, place some noise-traps around.Just killed 2 dogs on my way here. Poor creatures. But they didnt die in vain. I skinned them. Roasted their meat.Ate a chunk. Mmm... Wonder how it was before. I chuckled, ironically, because I can't remember a thing. But it doesn't matter now. Not here. The only things that matter here are skills and luck. And I had plenty. For now.Tomorrow I am going to scavenge the area around ""Zom-Zom"" and finally deсide whether I want to go in or not.It was late in the night. Had no watch to prove it to myself, but I had no need in that. I found a spot to lie down. Closed my eyes. I faded out quickly which is a rare thing to encounter being insomniac.Then someone slit my throat with a glass shiv while I was sleeping.10/10 Would die again.			"

												The main problem with NEO Scavenger is, sadly, the scavenging. While there's a decent bit of good writing to be found,  you'll probably never discover it unless you edit the game files or get incredibly lucky with your scavenging rewards, as health, weariness and thirst tick down with absurd speeds, areas get tapped out of resources in no-time(meaning that setting up a camp, which is necessary unless you get ridiculously lucky finding backpacks, etc. is useless) and all your items decay with ridiculous rapidity, too. You'll never really get to actually PLAY the game, is the thing, you'll be stuck doing nothing but grinding berries, cured meat and boiled water(which you can only get if you're lucky enough to find a saucepan), and then when you finally get enough of it to start moving somewhere... your backpack falls apart and you have to leave it all behind.But, okay, let's say you're good at management and overcome that hurdle. Then you may find one of the twenty or so locations you can interact with beyond scavenging(in a map of thousands of hexes, and only a few of them look any different from the surrounding generic town hexes)... and whatever you do roughly has a 50% chance of instakilling you or losing you all your carried stuff.So now, good luck, you can do all your grinding again! Hope you're lucky enough to find a saucepan early on this time around, too, or you may as well just restart.The combat also boasts a lot of choices to make, but it boils down to either: Have a ranged weapon, keep distance, shoot shoot shoot, or have melee weapon, close distance, beat beat beat. A few of the other options might occasionally be tempting if the game gave any indication of how likely they were to succeed or not(say, percentages or odds or something) rather than just vaguely suggesting a ""high"" or ""low"" chance(what's high? 50+%? 75+%? 95+%?).Long story short: Needs more obvious mechanics, needs less busywork to pad out playtime, needs to make consequences of choices more predictable/obvious OR it needs some sort of save function. It feels like someone played FTL and A Dark Room and wanted to copy them without understanding them.			"

												First of all: if you paid $15 for this game, you've underpaid. Sunk more than 90 hours in this game (online and offline) and I STILL can't see half of the content and this is just vanilla. I made the mistake of adding a mod to this game and holy crap...still can't see past 10% of the content without either dying, getting completely wrapped up in a spawn and exploration run and enjoy the hell out of simply trying to LIVE long enough!NEO Scavenger's one of those games that no matter how much you die, live, fail, respawn, mix your talents up and roll again...you want to play some more. I've clocked almost 20 hours in the DEMO alone and when I bought the game, I bought copies for friends and sat many a night down in Teamspeak and we've compared survival times and setups and this game suceeds in making you declare ""One...more...game...""I turned this into a serious review just because I've joined the forums, added input and done a bit of bug submission as well and even the community is together despite it being a lone-dev game.PROS:-A very good ""One more game..."" setup.-A lot of the in-game recipes are common sense based. Combine...and see what happens.-The turn-based battle system with different movesets depending on your talents is functional and efficent. That feeling of satisfaction when you stab a feral dog to death with a wooden spear crafted by your own hands and sharpened with a glass shard.-The storyline so far is intriguing and you get this sense of ""Where am I? Who am I? What is going on?"" constantly.-Because of the game's setting and environment, finding so much as a shopping bag to hold your stuff feels like the greatest success. You'll know what I mean when you play.-The idea of drinking water straight from a pond is hazardous at best.-Eat berries, dog flesh, human flesh, cooked food, soup, scavenged snack cakes. The world is your buffet table!-Josh Culler's submissions for the soundtrack of this game are short...but VERY, VERY suitable. CONS:-The game is programmed for Flash. Depending on your PC and stats and some measure of bad luck-you ARE going to get some frustrate-level crashes. Save often and make sure the game doesn't bug out randomly because it pretty much means you're going to lose your progress. It doesn't happen often but when it does...damn. Hard luck. TIP: run the game in fullscreen and set your cache for Flash at 10MB to prevent random lockups.-The game tilts itself against you unfairly sometimes, especially when you decide to settle down in an area for extended time and the enemy spawn rate tends to increase. Not exactly fair when you're someone who likes having a ""base"" to call home but the gameplay is meant to keep you mobile. Not stuck in one spot. Explore at will but know that if you hang around somewhere long enough, the game WILL start pushing you out to go do something else or go somewhere.-The amount of enemies that can populate one tile per battle sometimes goes a little overboard. Nothing more rage inducing than getting strangled to death in your sleep by 4 enemies, 3 of whom took apart your noise traps and the other strangled you to death with a pounce. Not sure if this is intentional but it still is frustrating when it happens.-Not all the recipes work seamlessly. Sometimes you HAVE to check your recipe book to see if you've learned it by accident and you need to click the RECIPE to craft said item in the first place.-No way to repair items CURRENTLY at the time of this review without mod assistance. It's pretty annoying to have to play vanilla, find a backpack on 3% and lose it the next turn to decay, go play a mod and then come back to find out that there are still some minor frustrations.The reason I approve this game is because the community contributes ideas, help, bug reports and helps design its own mods. So far there's 3 main stable ones that are available at the website forums and they add SO MUCH to the game already. You know you've succeeded with a game when people are climbing over themselves to add content and mods to your game, free of charge. VERDICT:Buy this if you like roguelikes, turn based and making decisions via micromanagement of inventory and move turns. You'll spend a good few hours with this game and still find yourself coming back for more. The gods help you if you add a mod. Might as well quit your day job while you're ahead! :DAnd now for your typical funny lines: Always use Botany.Wounds infected?Tannin Tea!Thirsty?Tannin Tea!Pooping blood?Tannin Tea!Vomiting?Tannin Tea!Wanna make money?Tannin Tea!Infected and sick?Tannin Tea!Surrounded by 6 Dogmen and all you have is a rock?Tannin Tea!Tannin Tea!

You will die alot until you learn how to stay alive with the massive amount of game mechanics which have been handed to you. Blue bottle games have given us a fantastic RPG with strategy elements to make the game challenging. I would recommended to anyone who doesnt care about fantastic graphics but are here for a unique and brilliant experience which this game can provided to you. For the orignal price it is a steal and is perfect for anyone who wants just a game to play while bored.			"

												Download the free demo and use the neo scavenger wiki at wikia to look up information. If you enjoy the demo then you'll definitely enjoy the full game. If you enjoy scavenging and survival games then this is a great one for you. I would love to see more content and a clearer plot, but I've gotten an easy 80 hours out of learning how to survive and eventually thrive in the harsh world.This is much closer to a roguelike (not the rogue-lite garbage that is out now) in a survival setting than anything else I've played. You'll gradually learn what works and what doesn't work over the course of multiple play throughs and the rules are FAIR not just RNG. Strong + Melee + Broad spear = win until you learn the game. I also pick Hiding + Insomnia to round out my build, but that's just preference. Insomnia is a manageable negative trait.			"

Early Access Review
								I went into this game hesitantly after doing some research on it and I haven't regretted it.  I'm a huge fan of survival/apocalypse type games and, although I'm not too keen on permadeaths and rogue-likes, in this game, it doesn't bother me as much.  NEO Scavenger is challenging and requires a lot of conservative thought if you hope to survive as every decision, every chioce and every action you make, matters.As of writing this, the game is still in Early Access but it is definitely playable.  My only gripe is that combat is extremely stressful (well, for me it is) and I can't help but feel that the AI cheats.  Even when I do my utmost best to hide and cover my tracks to try and avoid combat it's almost as if the enemies are psychic and always find me regardless.In my opinion it feels more like a simulation than a game, in that, sometimes I'm not having fun.  Situations will arise where I second and third-guess every move I make and wonder if the next turn will be my last.  Sometimes I'm under so much duress I need to take a break to let my adrenaline subside.  Not that this is a bad thing, mind you.  I suppose I just get too immersed. NEO Scavenger is a great game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the hardcore survival genre.			"

You'll die again and again from dogmen, hypothermia, cholera, and frog cultists, just to name a few, but everytime it's a learning experience. There's also several solid mods available that add a huge variety of new items, locations and new ways to bite the dust!			"

												I think there are only slightly more redeeming qualities to this game than there are bad ones, so this is only a ""recommend"" because ""meh"" wasn't really a choice.The game is very tedious. One thing that survival games tend to forget is that survival is a very tedious business, and they compress the timeframe a bit for emphasis of that particular aspect, but that just tends to make it even more tedious. This tends to detract from exploration or story-telling: you can't care about those things if the only priority you can possibly have is just making it to the next day. NEO Scavenger seems like it has a very rich and detailed story behind it and a setting that has the potential to be deeply immersive, but none of that matters if you simply die within the first week most of the time. It doesn't help that the game is somewhat obtuse about a lot of extremely important mechanics, such as the combat system, or health, or that drinking unfiltered water pretty much guarantees that you get cholera or are poisoned. Sure, that last one is pretty obvious in retrospect, but what that implies is that a decent portion of the time you have is going to be spent sterilizing all your water, and hoarding water, etc., which is just about as fun as it sounds. Item durability is also a terrible system. I don't think it was ever fun or strictly necessary in any game in which it was ever implemented. Yes, on some level, it intuitively makes sense, but it's overly simplistic in its implementation and just keeps forcing you to obsessively hunt for more junk.The skill system is interesting at face value, but your choices are limited from the start, and since they're fixed this drastically limits the options available to you (particularly at the start of the game) and you are always made painfully aware of it whenever you craft or interact with anything. It doesn't help that some are incredibly useless or situational.Permadeath is a good thing, I guess, but it also discourages the player from taking risks. There is always an element of risk in everything, but if you're dealing with an unknown and don't know how to assess the risk, you will eventually come to the conclusion that chancing it isn't worth it in most situations, which, again, runs counter to the player's natural drive for exploration. If you're gonna have permadeath in a game, that's great and all, but you gotta throw the player a bit more of a bone here.I think this game certainly has potential so I'm not gonna trash it utterly. But it is a very very lukewarm recommend at best, at least for now.			"

												As of the recommendation, I've played about 10 hours, plus 4 in the demo, although the two are acceptably different experiences. Came nowhere near to advancing the story out of all my playthroughs, reaching the ""glow,"" but the game's fun to gamble a try each time. Sometimes I'll find a good pair of boots. If I'm lucky, they'll be a match and a left and a right foot boot. Sometimes I've just died in the first day from getting eaten alive by a pack of feral dogs that tracked me down.The ultimate goal is staying alive while you're dragged along on the storyline. You may even get an obscure hint or two about the story at the beginning based on what skill you picked for the playthrough. But all along the way, remember; you'll never ""win"" a fight, you've just survived it.			"

												This game is way more complex, detailed, and downright fun than I expected it to be. Some of the negative reviews I read complained about how the random nature of some of the game elements can screw you over, regardless of how well you've prepared-- while I have had this happen to me (more than once), I think that it's just a reality of this style of game, and careful planning can lessen the risk. I think my biggest complaint would be that there do still seem to be some kinks in the system: for instance, I just lost my most recent game because I got locked in the combat screen until I died, AFTER I had already killed the enemy. That said, this game is overall interesting and really well conceived; if you like tile-based adventure games, this one is definitely for you.			"

												It feels like I've still just scratched the surface but it has been a pretty unique survival roguelike experience that introduces a mix of new mechanics that work together quite well.  + character attributes: it's not like a typical roguelike where you have you basic generic stats and grind xp. You pick out traits to help define your character (melee, ranged, mechanic, athletic, strong etc) and can pick weaknesses as well which let you get more points on good traits as a tradeoff and allow you to try to balance unique builds. These attributes influence completely what sort of actions you'll have available to you, how you handle conflicts, crafting, trying to find shelter, heat, food and so on. They define and influence your decisions way beyond the normal str,int,con type character building.+ crafting : there is quite a complex crafting system in place that is entirely based on resources available and the traits you picked. If you find just the right ingredients in the early game to make a decent weapon or clothes you'll have a much easier time, otherwise you'll want to avoid conflicts and scavange more. +(mostly) combat : deciding whether to fight, and how to fight is very important here.. not because you fight all the time but because the stakes are high and a few bad streaks could see you left bleeding in a field far from your shelter. I like this change to slightly more realistic combat. There's no visible health bar, it's all about waiting till you get a chance to strike, wounding your opponent, and then kicking while they are down. Not particularly heroic but if you make a mistake that leaves you vulnerable and they get a hit in, they'll do the same to you. It comes down primarily to trying to get in range for your weapon, stay out of range from theirs, and defend yourself until you have an opportunity. For example, if you have a melee weapon you can try to rush them but you risk falling on your butt at which point you'd be an open target, or you can advance normally but they'll be able to back away. - combat balance: My con with this is that your weapons make all the difference and with the random nature and limited weapon types, you can either be useless in combat or feel like there was no risk. In my first play through I believe I hit a guy with a pocket knife like 20 times until he ran away after punching me and then I bled to death. In my second playthrough I tied a knife to a stick to make a spear, with a range of 3 is the longest melee weapon. And then proceeded to kill everyone that didn't have a gun without a scratch because they couldn't get near me without getting stabbed. And those with guns I could sneak on fairly easy and then once I hit them they were too wounded to fight back. It went from combat being impossible to being 'meh'.			"

												This is honeslty the best game I have every played.

Even UnReal, which is now my second favorited, does not trump this game. Beyond its amazing survival elements this games story is very mysterious and intriguing, something that most survival games have no part of. Look at The Long Dark or The Woods, while they are slated to have stories there is none at this current moment. NEO Scavenger delivers everything I could have ever wantd out of a game and I would say the only thing that would make it better is a reboot in a 3D engine.

												If Neo Scavenger were never updated again, I’d still revisit every once in a while. Where else can I feel the guilt of stripping the trousers from a dead man and then the delight of finding a cigarette lighter and a few twigs in the pockets? It’s a world of many mucky wonders.			"

												I have been thinking for a while whether this game should get a thumbs up or a thumbs down from me. In the end, I'm going with a reluctant thumbs up, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale.NEO Scavenger is a post-apocalyptic roguelike survivalist game that is also often dubbed a hobo simulator. For good reason: you start the game waking up in a facility with nothing but a hospital gown, a wrist strap and a strange talisman. Once you start playing and get to look at your inventory screen, you will notice that you do not actually have any inventory space. This game does not give you an abstract bag to store your items in. You can carry whatever you carry around in your hand - if you want more, you will need to scavenge a cardboard box or a plastic shopping bag to carry your stuff in (the former you have to carry in your hand, the latter can be used as a backpack). If you are good enough at scavenging, you may eventually be able to find something better, such as a children's backpack - a legit travelling backpack is a luxury you'll have to search a lot for, and either way, even these backpacks will be extremely limiting, so you do have to carefully pick and choose what to carry with you. Eventually, you can get a much bigger inventory by finding an abandoned shopping cart or other similar vehicle you can lug your items around in, but that makes it harder to run away if you get into trouble (unless you ditch the cart and just run for your life).Anyway, there are strict inventory constraints and you also have to deal with rapid wear and tear on your equipment - some shoddy stuff (hand-crafted weapons, sandals) might fall apart after just a short period of use. You also have to deal with finding food and water - and beyond that, you have to make sure the food is edible, the water is not contaminated, and beyond that, to find a same place to sleep, to find a pair of shoes (that don't give you blisters when you walk in them), and to survive all the encounters out there. All this makes for a very gritty and tough survivalist game and this is actually the strong point of NEO Scavenger. The 'feel' is really good and the challenges of this game are rather unique - not many games have you struggle for basic necessities like this one. Death is permanent - no reloads.There are three major weak points, though, which you should be aware of. One of them would not be enough to spoil the game, but the three of them together do, or at least get close to doing so... it is up to you to decide if they are big enough red flags for you.First: NEO Scavenger's survivalism is based around an extensive crafting system. You need to craft in order to ensure your water is not infected (drinking all the water you find makes things much harder, though it's actually possible to survive with the constant diarrhea and other illnesses you get from doing so if you are lucky enough), to light fires for warmth and cooking, to craft primitive weapons and more. The crafting system is quite cumbersome, though, which is a major problem when it is so necessary to use it. It is hard to get into at first, hard to understand all the different options you have, and the interface is a bit unwieldy in general.Second: The developers originally started programming this game in Flash, which (according to their own admission, even) turned out to be a pretty bad idea, but they never rebuilt it in a more suitable environment. This means that the game has a few quirks and a few very nasty bugs. Saves seem to have a tendency to get corrupted every now and then, and while there is an autosave option, that introduces other problems in turn (I had my minimap data get wiped while autosave was on).[Note: apparently some autosave bugs were just recently fixed a few days after writing this review. So there's that.]Third: despite being a roguelike, this game lacks something most roguelikes have, which is extensive replayability. Unlike in most RLs, there is no leveling or character development - your guy doesn't get any stronger or weaker throughout the game (aside from illnesses/injuries and other temporary buffs/debuffs), so the progression in the game stems solely from you exploring newer areas and finding stronger enemies. There is also only one start (no races/classes, no different starting scenarios) so if you've completed the game once, you've seen it all... aside from any optional areas you might have missed the first time around. Further, quite a few of the challenges in the game don't even stem from poor scavenging strategy or combat - sometimes you just get a brief ""choose your own adventure"" segment where you have to click on various options and hope that you aren't instakilled. Common sense and caution can generally get you through these encounters, but still, this doesn't help replayability. Further, though it takes a while to learn how to survive early on, the game is not actually that hard later on once you're set and since it is easy to just run away from the majority of foes (plus there's little reason to fight them when you can't get XP or essential loot from them - you can get everything you need from just scavenging), you just need to learn what options to click (or not to click) in the choose-your-own-adventure segments and you know how to win.Well, NEO Scavenger is a good hobo simulator, but not a very good roguelike. So I guess that whether you should buy the game depends on whether you're looking for the former or the latter. It's a fun little game with an interesting story (and you'll have some interesting stories of your own to tell on the forum after you play), but it just isn't something that will keep you occupied for hundreds of hours, replaying it again and again. Its hobo simulator aspect is good enough for me to barely justify a recommendation, however.			"

												I think my most memorable moment in this game came from late in the game (right next to the end I later found out) where my character had an oppourtunity for a good life in the post apocalypse, and I selected the option that would put me on that path. Only to have him suffer the worst possible death, one without my control. And while this could be considered cheap, in the moment of personal heartbreak that followed was the most I have been affected by a game in my memory. Sure the game has its faults here and there, but any game that can do that to me deserves to be played.			"

								I don't even know where to start trying to convince you that Neo Scavenger is the best game I've played since FTL. Is it that I've played for 24 hours in about 3 days? Is it that it's basically a turn based Fallout 3 except that you count your bullets in twos not two hundreds - (if you're even lucky enough to find a gun that is...)? Could it be that if you survive (which you probably wont) you will be introduced to a completely awesome setting change that has blown my mind?The answer is yes, yes, and yes. Try the demo. Buy the game. This ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing solid 10/10 video game pleasure.			"

												I recommend this game with some reservations. I commend the developer's brutal commitment to total realism that make this game an extremely tough experience. the intriguing game world, and attention to detail. The game truly does make you thankful for objects as trivial as a shirt or even a worn out shoe. That being said, the game is hard enough that sometimes it feels as if it is unfair. On many occasions I would sit down for a session and be having fun until a single dog or man with a gun kills me and ruins hours of progress. The permadeath system creates a feeling that you've wasted your time whenever you die from something you can't avoid. I feel as if a progression system, saved games, or a checkpoint, perhaps at the end of each day, could go a long way to combat these issues. If you are looking for a turely brutal survival experience with immense attention to detail, this may be the game for you, provided you are able to deal with some of my previously mentioned grievances. The game has a few major flaws but has enough redeeming qualities for me to give it a recommendation.			"

												Ever play a game that made you want to throw your computer out the window, and then 5 minutes later want to play another round?...that's NEO Scavenger.If you frustrate too easily, if you don't like random difficulty spikes, if you can't have fun when the game isn't ""fair"" all the time, if you don't like to lose... this might not be the game for you.You'll have the deck stacked against you right from the start most of the time. Just making it a day or two might seem impossible. Then you'll have that run of luck and manage to gather a small fortune, and even come to think of yourself as neigh invincible, only to succumb to some kind of horrible infection because you forgot to wear an air filter and accidentally inhaled some spores.This game is not fair. It wasn't meant to be fair. That's part of the beauty.There's a small but awesome modding community for this game, as well... and they've managed to add quite a bit of additional content to the game. Definitely worth checking out after you've played the base game for a while and want an expanded experience.			"

												I will try to keep it brief and describe my games in a very brief manner. Each number, represents a different game from the start.1. I came out of the building, felt disoriented and not sure what to do. Something nasty came to me and attacked. I tried to defend myself but I bled out after the series of injuries.2. This time I had time to wander some more, I found some mushrooms, berries, sharpened a big stick and waited for trouble... but I froze to death.3. Shortly after I came out, the feral dog sneaked on me and attacked. I was fighing furiously with my punches, until I damaged his brain with concussions. I would have never thought that reading about the combat could be so exciting: bruises, cuts, bites, concussions, bleedings... all those details were amazing. My brain did the rest, imaging myself fighting for life with this dog. When he dropped dead, I patched up my wounds, took some painkillers and gutted him, took 2 small pieces of raw meat into my small medkit and moved along to find some clothes before I freeze to death again. I went to the city and scavenged it. I found plenty of goody goodies: crowbar with strap, binoculars with strap too!, cardboard box, cargo pants (with pockets!=more slots, yea!), T-shirt and some straps. Now, I am afraid to go out, because I don't want to loose all my treasure :( . T-shirt, cargo pants, hospistal gown on top of it all, holding crowbar in one hand and cardboard box with my treasure in the other one... time to move on. I go to the next building, I must be lucky, plenty of other  goods but I have no space to take it... First dillemma: break bottle and use it to make small campfire or leave it as a container for water later on? To hell with it... I might not live so long and I need warmth. OMFG! I had not enough points and had to end the turn, now the sun is gone... After a while it came out again, now I sit in front of a campfire, eating a cooked dog meat and think what to do next. The fire is not big enough, I move to the forest for more wood, some stranger attacks me, I try to talk to with him, he's confused but still charges at me... Time to cave his head in with the brand new crowbar. WTF!? He is some kind of a boxer! He keeps punching me and avoiding my crowbar! I cough up with blood and have got internal bleeding! After a short fight, I pass out and this guy is checking for loot on me... I wake up, beaten drastically, he retreated. MOTHERF**ER stole my cardboard box with goodies!!! I was on my way back to the camp when I have found an old car and a sleeping bag in it. Resting in the filhty but warm sleeping bag in abandoned IT office building, curing my heavy injuries, a mysterious horror creature woke me up. I had to run away, leaving my sleeping bag behind... After a while of running away, I had to go back, the cold rain has started to rain and it was a night... I know that my end is near but I keep sneaking in the dark trying to get into my warm sleeping bag... I just hope it is not sleeping in it... LMAO I threatened it with my crowbar and it ran away!!! I can't believe it!@ Sleeping, resting and healing in my precious filthy sleeping bag. After many hours, something is creeping on me once again. It's dark and we do not see each other yet, I will run away, I need some water anyways. It was a feral dog, I took some bites and I am bleeding but the dog is dead. I rest some more, take a bottle and go to look for some water, I find a small lake, drink a lot and take some with me, in a small plastic bottle.NO SAVE DATA FOUND... great... just f*cking great... Game is made in flash, so when I was cleaning my pc with ccleaner, it must have deleted some macromedia old cookies and my save file... how f*ucking hard can it be, to make seperate none-flash savegame file!?4. Tracked and killed by Merga Wraith5. - Chopped a poor fellow to death with a meat cleaver... He refused to fall back. No regrets.- WTF!? I met three bandits cooking something (I was hungry), there was also a terrified woman with a little baby in her arms. I had not a lot of options, but I think I have picked the wrong one! They have cracked her skull with a crowbar!!! "" What happens next is not worth mentioning, apart from feed. You can't remember how long it's been since you have eaten that well."" WTF HAVE I DONE!?- apart from all that, I am doing incredibly well. Got two shoes, nice clothes, meat cleaver to defend myself, made a campfire and cleaned some dirt rags for future needs. The only thing that bothers me is the guy with a rifle wandering around me somewhere.- ok he tried to kill me when I went to sleep! He shot at me! I took cover and now he offers to talk! Oh, no buddy I am coming to get your with my meat cleaver now! He keeps shooting and missing because I use covers, soon brand new rifle with a scope will be mine! Lmao, I chopped him to death! xD			"

												I'm gonna keep this shortThis game is pretty dope, it's a really atmospheric and simple game, yet complex. Whenever you make a mistake you either get killed and learn what you did was wrong, or you spam click, survive, and ignore it. One of my only issues with the game is that the A.I. Is a bit unrealistic, for example, I found an unconscious man and waited for him to wake up, wondering if I'd be able to help him, but the second he woke up he charged me and I had to kill him. In an actual situation like this a normal person would try talking first or possibly surrendering. Another issue is when while your sleeping in a shelter with a noise trap enemies practically spawn standing on your chest with a shotgun in your mouth. That about does it with my complaints, but all in all it's a very fun and addicting game, I'm having a hard time putting it down.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a rather simple, yet in-depth post-apocalyptic strategy RPG game(woah lots of adjectives). You start off in a Cryo Facility and find yourself roaming a world ravaged by an unknown apocalpyse. The game is turn-based so you have enough time to carefully plan your next move, or end up perishing. The game offers lots of choices as to how you're going to proceed. Fight or Flight? Eat or not? Explore or abandon? The RPG elements are great and there is a lot of detail in the overall health system(pain, blood, temperature...), lots of possible customization, all of it affecting your player(having a rough air filter just might save you from an allergic reaction, or the inhalation of toxic spores). The game takes time to master and lots of luck as well, even after 10 hours I still find new things around the game(randomly generated map, but still unable to scavenge all of it), and still find the dumbest ways to die.10/10, slipped and fell, died whilst unconscious. (jk) PROTIP: Start with Medic and Botanist Perks.>I'd give it a 10/10>Pros: Leaves you to imagine most of it, great customization, detailed health and inventory system, replayability, hard and challenging, lots of points of interest, many more great things!>Cons: Sometimes you won't be able to really understand something until it kills you.

												So I really, really wanted to like this game, because the amount of potential in this game is absolutely tremendous. The interplay between different systems and the really neat environment and design decisions should have made a great game.It didn't. There's not enough content for this game to shine, and because there's so little content the problems it has are made starkly apparent. Permadeath is not an inherently good or bad decision, but what it does in a game like NEO Scavenger is force the player through the same few bits of content over and over again. That content has an optimized solution, which means the first 5-10 minutes of every play-through are doing the exact same thing, every time, with no reason or reward from deviating from it. And then you end up at one of the pieces of game content that you _did_ play before, with functionally identical choices. And then you die, fairly or unfairly (and this game _loves_ unfair deaths; there are a number of places where you can die in a narrative scene because you didn't tag a skill!), and you get to do it again.A simulation game has to hide its brain to be deeply rewarding. This doesn't, and the narrative and the neat bits do not carry it through. Buy it for a couple bucks and play it once or twice, but at list price it is emphatically not worth your money because it will not respect your time.			"

You have to have some degree of faith that your choices will play out in your favor. They usually lead to your death until you learn more about the game. It's very much about survival, staying safe, luring other threats into traps or each other... and scavenging. Remains, food, parts. You're allways scavenging and the overall aim is to set yourself up for survival.First impressions count for a lot, and this game is Early Access which hurts it somewhat, esp. the lack of variety in a game where you die and start over so much. NEO Scavenger attempts to offer a niche gameplay experience, a bit like FTL or Papers, Please, where gameplay and style are different enough to make it something unique. Unfortunatly, it's current Early Access status makes it clumsier and less satisfying to play, and promises such as ""This isn't even my final form!"" usually end up dissapointing. However, this could be a very good game and trying the demo wont cost you a thing.Recommended for fans of turn based combat, realism, crafting, survival, adventures, Fallout, and games where graphics take a back seat to gameplay, strategy and athmosphere.

However, this could be a very good game and trying the demo wont cost you a thing.Recommended for fans of turn based combat, realism, crafting, survival, adventures, Fallout, and games where graphics take a back seat to gameplay, strategy and athmosphere.

								I dont have any gripes about this game other than the fact it swallowed my whole afternoon. The games great, has a good story line and keeps you thinking and on your toes. I would like the story artwork to be a little better (still pictures when you read passages) but i feel like thats the theme they are going for. Hardly a complaint.For $10 i say clear your afternoon, sit around with a bowl of spaghetti and a mate and make a game of it.Really enjoying it.			"

												Made it ALL the way to day 6 before making the fatal error of flanking a ""sleeping dogman"". It was then I realized how tense I became throughout that whole altercation (mainly because I knew I ♥♥♥♥ed up).11/10 Would forget to breathe during Dogman fight again.Seriously though, an amazing game. My only request (if I may) is, because of the low survival rate, perhaps randomizing the beginning a lot more; allow more stat customization.			"

												This is an excellent game!!! dont give too much about the graphics (they will have their charme later anyway) and you will find a jewel among post apocalyptic-steampunk-survival games. You start out in a laboratory and dont know who or what you are and must find it out. In a tile round based system you will have to find clothes, food, water and weapons to survive in the wilderness. This is actually the only game i like which is turn based and i hope the story will be updated as there could be more story driven content so far. The Game however is great (immersive), logical (crafting recipes) and makes you wanna explore the whole world within. 9,8/10  BRAVO			"

												I wanted to like it.  Biggest problem is the interface.  If only the interface was half  as good as Sword of the Stars: The Pit.  Because there is a great crafting and exploration and combat game hidden behind the Choose-yer-own-adventure style interface.  And it's roguelike permadeath with simplistic graphics.  I nearly deleted it once before, and then I found myself wanting to play it again because I seem to have a masochistic streak.  But after losing two 4-5 hour games, for basically no good reason, it's too brutal to play for me.  Maybe if it had a better interface.  I found the setting intriguing, I'll read up on their wiki... but it's not a game for me.   Too annoyed after the last game.  Deleting....			"

												To be honest I wasn't really paying attention to this game for the longest time. The setting is a ""woke up post apocalypse in a world gone to ♥♥♥♥ w no idea how it got that way,"" in a real Fallout-esque type of game, but then it plays out a lot closer to  Long Live the Queen or something. It's pretty different and honestly super engrossing and fantastic.			"

												You think everything is going well, you think you're safe in this world. But then you go to sleep and a dogman rips you to peices. 10/10 would be ripped to peices again.But to be more serious the game is well made and the permadeath feature makes the game force you to learn from past mistakes, dying of hypothermia, getting shot to death by a bad mutha. All things that can be avoided. You live and learn in this game. The game may be basic but offers a wide array of replay to anyone. Dont like to bash people over the head with a club then avoid mele and pick ranged or the other way arround. The play style is up to you.So yes, i recommend this game, even more so if you get it on sale.			"

												If you like Fallout and you like survival games, Neo Scavenger is the game for you. It's one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time, with tons of exploration, meaningful choices with actual consequences, and tons of different ways to approach any problem. Most challenges are easily overcome if you're prepared, but the same challenges can still easily kill you if you rush in, and in most cases you only get one chance. Enemy threats are easily distinguishable on the world map, with all NPCs shown wearing the equipment they're carrying, which lets you guess at their faction, disposition, and danger level. Also, you get to kick a dogman's ♥♥♥ with your bare hands.Pros:- Exploration- Meaningful consequences to choices- Lots of interactions and events- Great art- Traits used often and in useful waysCons:- Somewhat limited variety crafting system- Crafting slows down noticeably when carrying lots of items, and may break sometimes- You -will- spend a lot of time playing inventory tetris- Be warned, this is a permadeath game (for those who this is a con)			"

								At first the amount of things happening in NEO Scavenger was overwhelming, but with time and practice I learned how to play, slowly understanding the wasteland. This game is fun, punishing, and definitely unforgiving. I really enjoy the Hex tiles that makes up the world map, the combat is rather deep, and it's a game that rewards thinking outside what you'd initially expect. This game is deep and smart and will make you sweat buckets as you carefully navigate perils.Definitely a must play if this kind of micromanaging is your kind of jam~			"

								Fantastic game, and gives you a real challenge. Considering there can only be one save file, and that when you die, your save file is deleted (permanent death), it keeps you on edge. When I end up dying after weeks of in-game survival, amassing a collection of fantastic gear, I don't feel angry or frustrated, so much as I feel optimism for the next try in this wasteland. It feels like every time I play, I learn something new. It will take a long time before the game begins to feel monotonous or annoying.

								Ok, to start out I want to say I love this game and any criticisms is because I want it to be better ok? Good! So in Neo Scavenger you are basically given one of two goals: A-Survive Or B-Story based playthroughs. to tell you the average life expectancy of any character is really not a for sure answer just because of the learning curve, this game takes micro-managing to quite a substantial level and unless you keep up with it you're gonna bleed out of your eyes and you won't notice because you didn't read the red text! Another great thing about this game is the combat system, rather than having a ""Health Bar"" it has more of a...""How much ♥♥♥♥ can you Eat Before you die"" bar, now what I mean by this is you can take hits to the face with a Crowbar and still have a chance of survival, even though at that point you'd probably be ""earing ♥♥♥♥"" thus the name! Genius! There is of course the as always Eating, Drinking, sleeping bars, but this game is kind of speacial due to it's tempature and pain bars, tempature is pretty self-explanatory so I'm going to stick to the ""Pain"" bar. It basically shows how badly your player is feeling so for example if he fell down he'd probably have a bum knee and that produces a bruise and minor pain, but if some dude rushes you with a cleaver and starts hacking into your stomach with it, he's gonna feel a little differently, And to wrap it up let's talk about the less than wanted things of about the game. Because of it's damage system and the random number generators you can sometimes get killed pretty ridiculously, for example I was killed once with a stick because he hit me in the head hard enough...Now while I like the damage system beacuse of it's complexity, that has to be fixed and I believe they are working on bugs like that, secondly the random number generator can be a real ♥♥♥ sometimes and even when you are supposed to be getting loot because you have a full loot chance bar you get nothing, I believe the developer is also looking into this. I really love this game and even though there are some rough patches I really hope the devolper can sand them down and hopefully bring this game to full potential! (Modding is involved in the game I did not cover it though because Steam doesn't have a Mod Page for it. Oh and by the way sorry for how long it is, there's just so much greatness in the game that giving it half a sentance didn't sit well with me.)			"

								A brutally hard survival game. If you are feeling a masochist, pick this.Jokes aside, although the only control you have on you caracter is on the inventory management and choosing which actions to perform, I can assure you that this is one of the most complex survival games available in Steam. Due to it's level of difficulty, I suggest you play this on short bursts (as on the first playthroughts you won't last that long anyway :P )PROS:-Excellent atmosphere that absorves you into it's post-apocaliptyc setting.-The sound is great, from the realistic effects to the music.-Every choice has a consequence, even a choice as deceptevly simple as drinking a bottle of water that you just found-I would dare to say that the depth of the game's survival mechanics are unparalelled.-There is an actual main storyline to this game shall you choose to follow it.CONS:-It is a very difficult game. I have 6+ hours on this game by the time I am writing this, and I still take a beating every time. I tottaly understand if many people are put off by it.-The learning curve: I will be honest. This game has TONS of trial and error. Only after the first 5 playthroughs(about 2 hours of playing), you will be able to understand why you have died. From there, the game gets more satisfying, but adding to the complex interface and the fact that the game almost begs you to seek vital information (such as important crafting recipes) to the game's wiki page.Having said that, if you are looking for a challenge, you certainly have one here. If I were to call this game by other name, it would be Bear Grylls Simulator.			"

We finally come to version 1.0, and I am so excited about it.

								The most realistic and intuitive survival game up to date. Minimalist graphics and audio lets imagination take place and the game is therefore immersive. Permadeath seems harsh the first few times, but after playing for a while you understand it is a requirement for this type of game (otherwise you would save/load at each small obstacle or mistake). Getting looted while sleeping in an unprepared campsite, dying of infection due to fatigue and untended wounds, starving or freezing to death... All these ""options"" make for a great game with completely different approaches. The palette of skills proposed during the setup phase allows for different gameplays.			"

												TLDR:  A good turn based survival game with neat setting and mechanics.NEO Scavenger is a turn-based survival game whose difficulty I'd call 'tough but fair' once you get the  hang of the mechanics.  You play as Philip Kindred, a man who has lost most of his memories after being rudely awakened from his cryogenic-sleep pod in the near future.  The game is set in post-apocalyptic Michigan, with a mix of supernatural/horror and sci-fi elements.  Overall it reminds me of Fallout 1 and 2 in terms of tone and atmosphere.Something you should definitely be aware of before buying: Permadeath!  There is only one save slot in NEO Scavenger and when you die the game deletes the savegame, forcing you to start over.  However you can get around this fairly simply by manually backing up your savegame files after you save, so even players who don't like permadeath should still be able to enjoy NEO Scavenger if they save often and remember to back up those save files.  (I believe there is also a mod that adds multiple save slots, or that automatically backs up your save game, or something like that.  I never tried it out myself, so I can't comment on it.)NEO Scavenger is a text heavy game, and there is no narrator or voice acting.  Talking with friendly NPCs and fighting hostile ones both involve plenty of text.  Not that the game doesn't have a good UI too, but the lore and details of the game are all conveyed through text.Speaking of which, the story of the game is told rather subtly, which I like but some people might not.  You'll have to search for clues to who you are and what's going on in the world.  Talking to NPCs, investigating strange locations, even simply finding and reading ancient newspaper article could tell you something important about the world of NEO Scavenger.  My point is you are going to have to really explore the game to uncover the plot.There is an end to the story after which you cannot keep playing, but the game is pretty clear that going to that area is a fairly big deal and you are never forced to do so.One of my favorite ways NEO Scavenger tells you about the world (and lets you tell the game what sort of person 'your' Philip Kindred is) is through random events.  These events will pop up occasionally as you explore the map, present you with a situation/problem, and a number of choices to deal with said situation/problem.  They're a bit like a single-page Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games.  Though sometimes a bad choice can get you eaten, so keep what I said about backing up your saves in mind if you dislike permadeath.  I've found several dozen of them so far and the choices and their outcomes are generally very satisfying.  There was one that actually let me ask for more information before deciding whether to help a slightly suspicious person, which is something I've often lamented a lack of in other games.There's also a small modding scene, despite the lack of Steam Workshop support (flash and steam don't work well together apparently).  Check out the forums of the Blue Bottle Games website or Nexus mods for those.Finally, I just want to mention that the actual total hours I've played this game are at least twice of what Steam says it is.  This is because I bought the game through the developers website and generally play the version I downloaded there.  Speaking of which. if you do decide you want to buy the full game, you can get NEO Scavenger DRM free on Good Old Games, or directly through the Blue Bottle Games website.			"

												This is an awesome hex-based/turn-based post-apoc rpg that I added somewhat casually to my wishlist and found myself thoroughly hooked on once I played it. The game is VERY reminscent, genre aside, of Darklands, in that you have several text roleplay adventures that can be encountered either randomly or in permanent places whilst roaming a decently-sized over map (I actually wanna play that too now!). You can also encounter enemies (and you'll sure as hell encounter them), gather in forests, loot in buildings, and just overall scavenge your way to your next safe haven... or unknown!The game is very fun and fufils that thrill/gamble factor with almost every action you take, as it is very luck-based with a few ways to bend it in your favor. It can be a little aggrivating on occasion (what game isn't?), but once you master what to look out for and keep in the early stages of the game, it seems pretty much clear sailing. Contrary to some of the frustrated negative reviews regarding permadeath, there is only a handful of situations where a player will die outside of usual combat, and most can be avoided by using your head and your wits. (spoiler example:  choosing to label yourself ""stock"" at a warehouse club which clears caters for some sort of human trafficking, i mean really :P  )All-in-all I would recommend this game to anyone who is comfortable with the genre tags; this gaming style is considered fairly dated by today's standards but it absolutely holds up, well and truly making up for it in storyline and gritty mortal desperation!

												NEO Scavenger was on my wishlist for a long time, $15 seemed steep for a graphics/text game, let alone a rogue-like. Well, I got drunk one night and impulsively hit 'buy'. So now I have it, and I like it enough to give a review, which I don't usually do.NEO is brutal. This isn't the type of game where you play the ultra-altruistic ""Hero"" that saves everybody and looks good doing it. You'll live a lot longer if you take the attitude of ""desperate homeless guy that doesn't want to get involved in your ♥♥♥♥"". When you die, it's over. No going back to a previous save. You just start over from scratch.The learning curve is a little bit steep, but so rewarding once you get there. My first several hours I went through at least half a dozen deaths. I learned to avoid fights. To clean my wounds before bandaging them. I learned to not ever eat yellow berries. I rage quit twice. I came back twice.Now, I've got a rifle (with ELEVEN bullets!), a warm coat and enough clean water to last me a week. I'm unstoppable, king of all there is in this wasteland. Except that I'm not. I still run away from everything that moves, I only camp in secluded buildings, diligently cover my tracks behind me and always keep an eye over my shoulder.And that's how it should be. I survived for this long because I learned how to live in the wasteland. I didn't get a bunch of XP from slaughtering hundreds of enemies and then suddenly become immune to a bullet to the brainpan.That's what I love about this game. The ""XP"" is your own damn brain. Learning how to craft the things you need. How to avoid those looters in the distance. Knowing that I've gotten as far as I have by not making mistakes. NEO has an outrageous amount of complexity that you would never know exists until you go looking for it. If you're on the fence, just buy it. Well worth the money spent.One last tip: If you're new, take botany. Makes the game a little more forgiving since you won't really have to worry about food & drink. "

												If agonising over inventory in RPGs is your thing, this game is heaven. Unforgiving, brutal, but deeply rewarding. A grade above the slew of survival game sludge on the market at the moment, this game is a throwback to the golden era of 1990's PC classics, rewarding patience and forethought.			"

												In light of the fact that this game is done being developed, I've decided to rewrite my review.A fantastic game in which you have to survive in a world that isn't so much out to kill you as it just doesn't care that you exist. You don't get superpowers, crazy damage resistence, favorable loot spawns or anything like that, you are just another person scrounging a living off the wasteland that used to be Michigan. I'd give it a 10/10And in case that doesn't convince you, there's a demo you can try out to get an idea of what the game is like. Don't waste your time reading more reviews, go get started!			"

Early Access Review
								Definently one of the gems of Early Access.A cruel survival game, the developers eye for details is very noticeable in the world, characters, items as well as the crafting system. With an atmosphere reminding of a great title like Fallout you can't go wrong.It took me several attempts before I was able to survive more than a few days, the learning curve might seem steep but you need to be able to learn from your mistakes and work through that. Some times it can just be dumb luck, or bad luck, sometimes you learn a lesson (don't eat the wrong berries!)Fight against the elements, your own needs, and the countless bandits & beasts that roam the wasteland.As with all Early Access titles, beware that the game is under early development and can become subject to radical changes, re-balancing and wipes. I have yet to find any game-breaking bugs (or many other bugs for that matter) even tho I'm playing the latest beta version.Will be very interesting to see the final product, best of luck to you Daniel :)			"

												Brilliant game with a real feeling of fear and post apocalyptic gameplay. The problem with the game is that it is ridiculously chance derived and geared towards grinding. Yes I understand it is a ""rogue like game"" but it takes the worst elements of rogue like and runs under them with a banner off a cliff. Practically the only way to play this game for more then a few minutes is by save scumming through it but even with that its so tedious and repetitive that the novelty  behind this game wears off fast. The story-line is almost nonexistent and is stringed out like a carrot on a stick. Its sad because I want to like this game. It has all of the essential qualities of being an amazing game and had the developers spent a little more time working on it then this would have been one of my favorite games. Sadly they didn't spend the extra time and this is just kind of a mediocre game that has some cool ideas behind it that aren't fully developed.			"

												As a game, this is an admirable failure.  As an artistic experience, it succeeds, but not in a way that makes for a playable video game.  The bottom line, however, is that you almost certainly should not play it.The writing is excellent, and not just by video game standards.  The dev could write good sci-fi fiction.The game has permadeath.  The core game loop is good, but clunky.  Progress is punishing.  It takes 10 real life minutes to make a bunch of arrows, which aren't particularly effective, but they're what you get.  I recommend the sling.  Even taking all precautions, you can die instantly because a dogman or blue frog pops up at close proximity or in your sleep and kills you in one round.  You realize that there's nothing you could have done, and often there's nothing you can learn from to prevent it in the future.  Because getting a character into survival state, which allows exploring the story, takes several hours, the clunkiness becomes an insane ping-pong of clicks (left screen, right screen, ten ping-pong clicks to sleep; seven to scavenge a single building; repeat until you die or quit, then repeat some more).  I view this as an artistic statement about life that, like the sudden and unpreventable deaths, cannot be understood until wearily experienced.The problem is that the game breaks into choose-your-own-adventure encounters that are both the reason to play the game and what breaks it.  A majority of the options in these encounters will instantly end your game.  Single encounters will have branching choices, the majority of which will end your game.  They cannot be predicted.  Because of their branching nature and the immense real life time to get to the point where you see them, you cannot realistically finish the game.  Further, the game hard-limits your exploration; you get X number of choices, then time's up.  The internet is full of gnashing and wailing, true believers who spent over 100 hours on the game begging the dev to release the text files of the end-game, which he basically did by telling people what to search for in the XML files.If you do buy it, some guy made a batch file that acts as a save-game manager.  Get it.			"

												I don't know, maybe this game gets as good as I keep seeing people say it is after you survive a little while and get some gear, but that's the thing: I can't. Every game I played started and ended the same way: I wandered around, scavenged for items, found nothing or barely anything (one game I found some pants; another, a multitool; every other game I would find a single shoe), then got attacked and killed. No matter if I tried to run or hide, I would eventually get attacked by an enemy and die. I couldn't fight, because I found no weapons. I was constantly getting sick, because I found no clothes. I'm all for games being tough, but when literally all I'm finding everywhere I go is dirty rags and plastic shopping bags, it's not fun. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and should look up strategies on how to survive, but I think games should have a minimum amount of playability without having to use outside resources, and this one doesn't, so I can't recommend it. I'm sad about that, because I followed it through Early Access and waited to play until release, really looking forward to it, but there's not holding your hand and there's not giving you any direction at all, and this game falls into the latter category for me. Your experience may vary.			"

								I let my curiosity draw me into a lit-up warehouse pumping industrial tunes and full of ragged and sick looking stragglers. I survived an arena battle put on by some deprvied sickos. I may or may not have eaten human meat. I encountered two bandits and managed to cripple one badly with a crowbar. I was eventually tackled and beaten to death by his flashlight-weilding sidekick. I survived just under 2 days. Amazing game. If you have a love for rogue-likes and ""story making"" games then you should support NEO Scavenger. It can only get better from here.			"

								+ Versatile crafting system where recipes are discovered either by random tinkering or by little ""scraps of paper"" found in the world.+ Multiple skills which have an important impact on playstyle. Whether combat is even worth it or not depends a lot on your skills - avoidance is very often the better option.+ Crafting is actually very important and useful.+ Very few, if any, items which act as a be-all-end-all.+ Except for early hypothermia, if you die, it was most likely a bad decision on your part. Often, the connection between cause and effect is extremely convoluted and indirect.+ Multiple survival factors which have to be controlled in unique ways.+ Interesting combat system that doesn't make the player the automatic most likely victor.- Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death.

								This game is incredble. I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a dialog-based survival game! From the moment you awake from cryo sleep the first thing you will realize that it has lots of protential to be a great game. So i recommend you help the developers make this into the best dialog-based survival game in 2014!!!!P.S: Don't forget getting into combat knowing that this NPC has better loot then you. So you do the impossible. You dodge the incoming blow from his monkey wrench,then you do a few blows to his stomach. Thus making the NPC fall and have a fructured rib and coughing blood. Then you finish him with 5 kicks to the face while the NPC is on the ground. Also giving him a concussion and eventullay dieing from blood loss. After doing the impossible you can loot the NPC's cloth,weapons,antibiotic,etc.Now, your that OP guy that no NPC wnats to mess with :DGoodbye!!!			"

												If Omega (a very early massive PC roguelike), Wasteland (first PC post-apocalyptic roleplaying game), and Shadowrun had three-way that somehow resulted in a retro-graphic third-person isometric RPG with a vague but cool storyline, this would be it. The strongest parts of this game are not what is said, but rather what is left unsaid. It is terrifyingly addictive, and has a great deal of replay value.

								So, basically you have lost all your memory after waking up from Cryo Sleep, in an abandoned Cryo Facility in an extremely cold Michigan.You then start looting stuff, most importantly clothes for warmth before the night falls and you freeze to death, then food, and then a weapon to have atleast small chances of winning a fight you might get into.The game has a very good story line, not gonna spoil it.What I like on this game the most, is that it's simple and complex at the same time.That means it's mainly hex 'n' text based, you will not encounter any animations besides rain and snow (if you make it that far, that is.)And you can simply just go around loot stuff and use them against people and for you.But you can also do alot more, like for smallest examples, boil river / lake / marsh water to sterilize it instead of directly drinking it and risking infections and illnesses.Or you could take a branch and sharpen it with a knife, or add sharp objects into it to make it a broad spear.The combat also, pretty simple yet complex.You CAN win a fight by simply repeatedly pushing the attack button, but you can also win a fight by playing much more tactically, luring people into traps, using the environment to your help etc, and win that fight even better without any injuries.You can either follow the storyline, finding out who you are / were, or you can just do open world play and survive in the harsh environment.It might look like a simple game at first, but I promise you that there's A WHOLE LOT MORE into this.The crafting system is VERY deep, and you can craft QUITE alot, I'm playing it since a long time (before steam release) and still haven't had every single crafted item in the game.It has a wiki with alot of hints and tips about everything in the game.Also, for modders:It has modding support, VERY easy at that.To add just about anything, that is encounters, items, combat moves etc.. you just have to add some new lines into the .xml file, and the forum includes alot of documentation on how to do that.I do recommend this game because it's simply awesome and has a very long and big replayability rate.Also, did I mention the map gets randomized every time you play (besides the story hexes) ?

												NEO scavenger is, without a doubt, the best surprise I've got through Humble Bundle. What at first seemed a little interesting survival game turned out to be a massive and addictive experience, with the most detailed survival mechanics you've ever seen (except maybe Project Zomboid).In NEO Scavenger, death is considered a sure thing, the question is how long you will last for. Survive the cold, survive the wounds. Survive the infection, survive the unboiled water you were forced to drink because you had no way to make a fire. Survive the blisters you got because you hadn't found boots yet, while a dogman chases you. Survive the poisoning you got eating unidentified mushrooms. And worst of all, survive the people (NPCs) who want what you've managed to gather.The world has unique lore, setting a post-apocalyptic world with paranormal phenomenons happening left and right, but extremely well presented, gradually giving you the information, which is spread through conversations, pieces of newspapers and others.The atmosphere is similar(ly angsty) to those of Dark Souls, or EVE online, but more personal and centered around the desperate situation your character wakes up into, like Spec Ops: The Line.The combat is quite simple and brutal: He who connects the first hit usually wins. This enforces a visceral and all-or-nothing mindset, with no place for holding resources back, and a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" policy that makes you question your own acts as a player.Both combat and map gameplay are turn-based, and reward thinking carefully about your next move, since the game works with permanent iron man mode (dying deletes the save file) to ensure that you're adequately kept on your toes.Overall, this is the best survival game I've ever played, and definitely the best one-man-made game out there: 10/10			"

												Absolutely fantastic game.Neo Scavenger sets out to do what many RPGs attempt, but often times get caught up in the mechanics of their own genre and fail to pull off. Every decision you make in Neo Scavenger echoes into your immediate future, often times setting you up for a failure that, with practice, you can foresee and avoid. It's just so well designed, I can find only a few flaws, and those can easily be ironed out before the game is finished.Tons of content, easy to pick up, lots of fun strategic decisions, and best of all an intriguing story that makes you want to keep taking the more dangerous path just to find out more.

								Although the graphics can be out right disgusting and the learning curve in the game is at an all time high. With countless early game deaths due to hypothermia or a nasty encounter. If you are willing to stick around to find that right strategy, this one has quickly become an addictive addition to my collection. I wholeheartedly suggest to the fans of survival games to give this one a try at the very least the demo. For the faint of heart or quick tempered steer clear. This title is full of conditions that will have even the heartiest adventure tripping over your own two feet.(in some cases quite literally) But if you are looking for a new challenge to this genre you will make a happy new find in this game.

Not a lot of though games on the market, now if you could have followers and make your own settlement kinda thing along with a way to regain equipment lost from the last Charactor making a new mode called Sandbox or something would be cool. I've probably have been killed by a pack of dogs then anything else in this game to be honest. While on the topic of dogs, while hiding inside of a building for i.e the cryo cell 17(or what ever its called) something with High levels of everything you would need to stay safe/hidden from the outside world/elements. Animals shouldnt beable to get to you they don't have hands to open doors or at lest have it so you can border your self off from people cuze sleeping is the second deadlist thing in this game to do. With all that said i would give this game an 8.5-10. keep up the good work!			"

								This is a great game that I have a hard time putting down. It's difficult, it's complicated, it's awesome. This has a pretty steep learning curve, but the challenges of simply surviving bring with it the really rewaring feeling of surving another day. Because it's turn based, you can walk away from this game without worrying about anything going wrong. As a father of two young kids, that's perfect! This is absolutely a game worth buying, particularly if you're a fan of the ""survival"" genre.			"

								Words truly are hard to find to accurately describe this game. First word that comes to mind however is addiction. I am most definitely addicted to this game. The world is unforgiving, ever-changing, and surprisingly immersive. The game is a continuous challenge that seems to have a mind of its own; coaxing you on at times, then ruthlessly crushing your hopes and dreams the next instant. Its infuriating, awesome, and addicting. Buy it.  "

												Absolutely fantastic game.Neo Scavenger sets out to do what many RPGs attempt, but often times get caught up in the mechanics of their own genre and fail to pull off. Every decision you make in Neo Scavenger echoes into your immediate future, often times setting you up for a failure that, with practice, you can foresee and avoid. It's just so well designed, I can find only a few flaws, and those can easily be ironed out before the game is finished.Tons of content, easy to pick up, lots of fun strategic decisions, and best of all an intriguing story that makes you want to keep taking the more dangerous path just to find out more.

								I let my curiosity draw me into a lit-up warehouse pumping industrial tunes and full of ragged and sick looking stragglers. I survived an arena battle put on by some deprvied sickos. I may or may not have eaten human meat. I encountered two bandits and managed to cripple one badly with a crowbar. I was eventually tackled and beaten to death by his flashlight-weilding sidekick. I survived just under 2 days. Amazing game. If you have a love for rogue-likes and ""story making"" games then you should support NEO Scavenger. It can only get better from here.			"

								+ Versatile crafting system where recipes are discovered either by random tinkering or by little ""scraps of paper"" found in the world.+ Multiple skills which have an important impact on playstyle. Whether combat is even worth it or not depends a lot on your skills - avoidance is very often the better option.+ Crafting is actually very important and useful.+ Very few, if any, items which act as a be-all-end-all.+ Except for early hypothermia, if you die, it was most likely a bad decision on your part. Often, the connection between cause and effect is extremely convoluted and indirect.+ Multiple survival factors which have to be controlled in unique ways.+ Interesting combat system that doesn't make the player the automatic most likely victor.- Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death. Player has frozen to death.(read: the early stages of the game are aggravating.)- No substantial SFX or graphics.- Scavenging, while an important feature, is lacking in depth. It will hopefully see some kind of minigame attached later in the beta.92 / 100			"

								So, basically you have lost all your memory after waking up from Cryo Sleep, in an abandoned Cryo Facility in an extremely cold Michigan.You then start looting stuff, most importantly clothes for warmth before the night falls and you freeze to death, then food, and then a weapon to have atleast small chances of winning a fight you might get into.The game has a very good story line, not gonna spoil it.What I like on this game the most, is that it's simple and complex at the same time.That means it's mainly hex 'n' text based, you will not encounter any animations besides rain and snow (if you make it that far, that is.)And you can simply just go around loot stuff and use them against people and for you.But you can also do alot more, like for smallest examples, boil river / lake / marsh water to sterilize it instead of directly drinking it and risking infections and illnesses.Or you could take a branch and sharpen it with a knife, or add sharp objects into it to make it a broad spear.The combat also, pretty simple yet complex.You CAN win a fight by simply repeatedly pushing the attack button, but you can also win a fight by playing much more tactically, luring people into traps, using the environment to your help etc, and win that fight even better without any injuries.You can either follow the storyline, finding out who you are / were, or you can just do open world play and survive in the harsh environment.It might look like a simple game at first, but I promise you that there's A WHOLE LOT MORE into this.The crafting system is VERY deep, and you can craft QUITE alot, I'm playing it since a long time (before steam release) and still haven't had every single crafted item in the game.It has a wiki with alot of hints and tips about everything in the game.Also, for modders:It has modding support, VERY easy at that.To add just about anything, that is encounters, items, combat moves etc.. you just have to add some new lines into the .xml file, and the forum includes alot of documentation on how to do that.I do recommend this game because it's simply awesome and has a very long and big replayability rate.Also, did I mention the map gets randomized every time you play (besides the story hexes) ?

								Although the graphics can be out right disgusting and the learning curve in the game is at an all time high. With countless early game deaths due to hypothermia or a nasty encounter. If you are willing to stick around to find that right strategy, this one has quickly become an addictive addition to my collection. I wholeheartedly suggest to the fans of survival games to give this one a try at the very least the demo. For the faint of heart or quick tempered steer clear. This title is full of conditions that will have even the heartiest adventure tripping over your own two feet.(in some cases quite literally) But if you are looking for a new challenge to this genre you will make a happy new find in this game.

												This is a wonderful little roguelike survival, scavenging, crafting and exploration game. Trait based character system, wound based health, inventory micromanagement, CYOA segments and merciless combat. You can survive with a little luck and careful planning, but you will be ruthlessly punished for any mistakes. This is one of those games that has crawled into my head and taken up a permanent residence there. I can't stop coming back to it. Good developer too. Highly recommended.			"

								I had already recommended the game but I felt that it should be changed. Here we go! Review 2.0BUY IT NOW!PROS...- More in-depth than any other post-apocolypse (if that's how you spell it XD) survival games I have ever played.- Kinda funny predicaments (again, can't spell) like hopelessly running from a ""Mega Wraith"" (you'll understand once you see it) until you pass out and get your head LITTERALLY CRUSHED by it- Story is not nessecary. Really, you can just jump in, not read anything and still have a good time. Great for when you don't have a lot of time to spend- Addicting. Beacuse you die so much *see CONS* you constantly have that Flappy-Bird-ish ""The next life will be better"" mentalityCONS...- More expensive than I would like but maybe thats just me- Still in early access so there are occasional bugs (which I still haven't found) and some item combos that arent there.- Really hard. Since it's randomly generated, it takes a whole lot of luck to not die beofore you can even - Too much cussing in the main story. Remember that this is an indie game so there aren't the same standards as some other titles. BUT REALLY! I warn you that there is a sence were every 3 words (yes I counted) they drop the F-bomb.Overall, it's a great game and deserves to be played. At least try the demo to get a taste of what the core of it really is.30phil1 wrote a review30phil1 posted the review30phil1 played NEO Scavenger30phil1's head was crushed by Mega Wraith's grasp30phil1 died of trumatic brain injury*End Turn*			"

								To state it simply as I can, there is no way that I can do enough to recommend NEO Scavenger as highly as it deserves.  In the Kentucky Derby of the rather numerous games (a few of which have or are solid enough to merit at least some serious note) in this generally broad set of the Post-Apocalyptic/Survival genre of the current/modern PC scene, NEO Scavenger is a Thoroughbred Champion of the most uncomplicated sort.  The thundering hooves of the race set the pace out of the gate, nearly beating a tattoo on your ribs from within the moment you find yourself thawed and unceremoniously deposited into a world that appears to not only have been blasted and scarred by the now typical arsenal of Post-Apocalyptica, but also one haunted by Werewolf-like monsters -among a number of others-  that are both imminently fatal, but also understated in a way that for my own part recalls the same sort of creeping, crawling, truly psychological horror upon my initial encounters with some of Lovecraft's more authentically gripping horrors.  With a pedigree of the caliber that NEO Scavenger boasts for itself in my ever so discerning gaming tastes, the more atypical or ""monstrous and supernatural"" of the associations piercing my own memory and stretching all the way back to 1931 and the horror that rose from Y'ha-nthlei to consume and squat over Innsmouth as the Dagon's Deep Ones.  The second major thread is likely more easily expected and certainly open to being related to by a (vastly) wider audience in the sense of the overall and yet still growing popularity of the genre, this association springs forward over (the next two and three) centuries, bathed in the near incandescence of the white washed mediocrity of the just shy of unending faux 1950s Apple Pie-Americana and all consuming oceans of nuclear fire and equally inescapable Fallout.  In contrast to the almost stark bleakness that Lovecraft instilled in me at times - without being overtly apocalyptic; whereas Fallout inspired and from time to time continues to inspire the notion that humanity might well resist and rise again on the dark side of whatever Great Catastrophe it happens to be this time.  And it is certainly a blend of these personal, half-imagined (and again, doubly personalized) inspirations and senses of direction for my gaming imagination that are invoked upon finding my way out into NEO Scavenger's wide-open Michigan, a great American state that it would seem will take a little more than a single puny Apocalypse to wipe off the map altogether.I imagine that aside from being a logical decision for a one-man marching band, along with/and cost-effective from the angle of overhead and production costs, the old-school vibe and streamlined everything go a great ways in the direction of encouraging the individual player to engage the game in a way that other, more modern examples do not and cannot allow for.  Specifically, there aren't so many details, so many aspects of the experience predetermined by hard-coded and visualized default automatically and inescapably included in the Scavenging experience from the mouse click on.The Crafting System is a standout aspect of the Gameplay Mechanics for NEO Scavenger, which speaks to a bit of that aforementioned logic - it being pretty pointless to spend an entire game scavenging for junk that doesn't, or can't be combined with something to do or become anything useful.  The type and variety of that junk you'll be so happily scavenging is at a fair balance at the moment - though more melee and/or ranged (re: improvised DMRs/battle rifles) weapons of any stripe and variety, as well as pretty much any new items at all will always make me happy.  The combat system is similarly uncomplicated and crisp, though perhaps taking a game session or two for many of the more fast-paced FPS-twitchy gamers of the here and now.It's these invitations to the individual imagination that - along with the perfectly applied Game Mechanics- are the most easy and obvious examples of the true genius you can find here.  Or, to restate it again in final summary, there's so much about NEO Scavenger that will allow the gamer to become as immersed in and rewarded by their experience as the breadth, depth and staying power of their imagination will allow.

								(EDIT: Fixed a terrible typo that changed the meaning of one sentence into the very opposite.)Even during its beta stage NEO Scavenger feels like a completed and a released game. It can be intense (provided you have the imagination), it can be (actually it WILL be) evil and it can be forgiving (for a brief second before you run into a pack of dogmen who rip you apart).NEO is also ridiculously cheap for it's value. Of course, I'm not trying to encourage a higher price, I'm just thanking Daniel for his reasonable pricing. (Take that Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes)I can't recommend this enough. After getting the game I sunk a ridiculous amount of time into it in a single weekend. I recommend starting off completely blind. No wikis. No gameplay videos. Just jump in. After dying horribly a few times, you can begin checking a few things out from the wiki. OH and I URGE you to read all the messages at the bottom of the screen during combat (you can click the box to expand). Then just let your imagination fly and get all the horribly violent moments carved deep into your brains. If your imagination is anything like mine, you're gonna find this game to be one of the most ruthlessly violent games you've played and it doesn't even graphically show you any of the scenes.Now, I understand this is not a game for everyone. If you don't enjoy reading a lot of text, that is not a reason to stay away. You don't have to read any of it. But if you don't enjoy slow paced, the original Fallout-like games with survival and tension, you might as well stay away. But if you know someone who likes that kind of stuff, please, tell them about NEO Scavenger.			"

												NEO Scavenger is a great survival game/roguelike set in a post apocalyptic Michigan setting with supernatural and cyperpunk elements. Emphasis on those elements taking a back seat to survival with perma-death.You will die a lot. Engaging in combat can be very fatal, but it works both ways. The more you get hit, the worst you get, but the same applies to the other ""guy"".Perhapes the most harrowing aspects after you figure out how to survive and thrive in the harsh overworld is the special and random encounters, which are a seperate game in themselves. They can result in instant death based on your choices, so you have to choose wisely. As a word of advice, don't take risks! (You are not superman!)			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so this game is ... addictive. A nice post apocalyptic setup with one of the most detailed crafting systems I've ever seen. Also the game makes real use of the character skills, just like in old school RPG's - ain't got melee skill? Well, ain't gonna craft the best melee weapons, for example. As it is some kind of rouge like, there's no saving to be safe, it's just go for it and hope that you won't mess up, which leads to some pretty frustrating moments but also is part of the addictive character of the game. Closed the game more then one time during my 15 ingame hours but came back every time to start a new character. The combat system is kind of strange in the first few tries but as soon as you get the hang of it, it is really fun. It works turn based and you choose your actions as the enemies choose theirs, after that the outcome is shown in a textfield with lots of pretty brutal stuff, from arrows to the knee to wolffangs to your face. The graphic is not up to date, instead it is real outdated but this game is not about graphics, it's about imagination. Many encounters contain lots and lots of written text (remember Fallout 1/2 or Baldurs Gate conversations? - you won't find those conversations but massive ambient text). Features: - nice ambient text- great crafting system, starting from making glas shards out of bottles over crafting armor from hides and furs to upgrade weapons with scopes for example- huge bunch of neat items with degeneration- deep skillsystem with skills giving options on encounters (but skills are chosen on character creation and can't be trained)- big range of enemies starting from cannibal gangs over strange mutants up to paramilitary townguards (if you decide to attack them) - extensive character needs, from hunger and thirst over induced pain to warmth (yes, you can freeze and expect to do so often in the beginning)-rouge like: saving only by leaving the game, a dead character stays dead but a nice little statistic when died shows some of the players accomplishments - one of the most stable early access games I've ever played with a range of features and stuff that outruns some released games by far - big, randomly created (open) world with some points of interest - devs active on steam forumIf you like challenging games which are more about ambient then shiny graphics, show those devs some love and give it a try (there's also a demo which I highly recommend to play to be sure this kind of game suites you).

												NEO Scavenger is a great roguelike survival RPG. Playing it, you really get the impression that the experience of surviving (or not surviving, probably) in a post-apocalyptic future would be this difficult. I recommend it with a few warnings:- It's a Flash game. That fact annoyed me for some reason when I learned it. Probably because there's no animation and it feels kind of ""cheap."" It creates the impression of a big, hex-based board game. Also, I'm not sure if it's because of the Flash-based game engine, but I lost all of my ""map"" progress when the game failed to save properly once.- The pixelated, retro-style graphics work, but they don't cover up the fact that the game is rather ugly--and not because of the apocalyptic setting.- There is some groan-inducing writing. Most of the writing is nice, though. It's not anything that detracts from the experience.- The game is random to a fault sometimes. You're going to come across things that can instantly kill you. Or they'll come across you while you're sleeping. It's not fun to lose hours of progress when a thug caves in your head with a monkey wrench because you picked a poor campsite...or RNGesus didn't give you his blessing.- Despite the game's randnomness, certain events never change. When you die, you're going to have to redo certain key events to be able to have a decent chance of advancing to the real progression. This can become monotonous after a few new games.- There are no save slots. This is unconditionally an ironman-mode game. That wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't the occasional corrupted save file.If you're interested in the genre and you understand that this is a game you might never complete because it's just so damned unforgiving, you can get a lot of fulfilling hours out of this.

Early Access Review
								A fresh take on the old rouge-like with great new game play systems that integrate seamlessly into the genre we know and love.The exploratory gameplay is engaging and nerve-wracking at the same time, and the unpredictable nature of events in the game means you'll spend much of your time simply trying to plan ahead for every contingency. This coupled with the constant threat of permanent death creates a very engaging experience. You never quite know what will happen once you step out of the Cryo Facility.  It truly defines survival, a lot of times on fresh starts I'd freeze to death on the first night since I couldn't find proper clothing, now that's realistic. There's a lot of potential here and I can't wait to see what the devs do with it.			"

								This game is like a drug, the well known syndrome of ""one more turn"". There is always something to discover, something to scare you or something to kill you. After countless deaths by ghosts, dogmen, cannibals and once because of very bad diarrhea, I still come back to the game, trying out different skill combination. The semi-random layout of the map (random scavange locations + fixed special locations), there is always an insentive to explore and see the world. Random encounters make every venture to a city that much more interessting. The slow pace of the game is perfect for people who want to take it slow, or like me, need time to actually figure out what they want to do. Combat is also refreshingly slow, gives you time to think over your moves and select the best option at the given moment (will you headbutt your opponent or dodge his next attack, hoping he will be vulnerable to counter attack).I hope the game evolves in the same way, presenting us with more dangerous creatures that stalk you in the night and more unique places that make you sit for a moment and carefully choose your next action, because permadeath is never that far away.

This game's exterior is rather simple, but once you get in and start playing, you will no doubt be in awe of the depth of its mechanics. The amount of freedom in the choices you can make, and how they affect you living or dying (sometimes terribly...) is unprecedented. Almost everything you could think of doing in order to survive in a post-apocalyptic world is in some way built into this game. and it not even finished yet!

								NEO Scavenger is the best roguelike to grace steam in some time. It's not about grinding, leveling up or anything like that. It's far more of a roguelike survival simulation. Only unlike Waywards island sim this game is more akin to the movie The Road or th S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It's desperateand meaningful combat involves you sneaking around, pulling people down, parrying, stabbing, swinging and doing everything you can to win. While a win feels great, the person you're facing is often in the same shoes as you. As for graphics everything is nicely drawn. Icons are easy to see and understand, the world is big but easy to navigate, the hand drawn figures range from average to awesome. It's not the best looking game but it's got a gritty atmosphere about it and it works great with the music.As for the sim part, this game just shines. Plastic bags will rip and you'll lose items, certain items can't be put into shopping carts because of the wholes in the frame, you'll be dumping pills out of small pill containers and putting them into larger ones so you can carry more. For a turn based game played on a hex grid, this is game can really get to you. I definitely suggest picking it up.			"

You will die a lot at first until you get the hang of it. There's excitement in trying to survive with little to nothing and the darkness of the combat without the need for complex graphics.

								If you ever wanted a game that blends Oregon Trail and Fallout but with total emphasis on player response-ability (yes I mean response-ability) then go try the demo of this game right now. Although brutal from the start (I survived 3 hours my first playthrough), the more you play this game and the more time you devote to figuring out what skills/items/reactions will help you survive depending on the given situation (Hint: run) the more satisfying it is when you reach the point of gun-toting, berry-eating, sleeping-bag-sleeping, Dogman slaying badass, ONLY to die of diarrhea (RIP colon). And in the total stupor of ""how did... that... why?"" begin another playthrough and start the whole brutal endeavor all over again- BUT this time ready to defeat the mutated Detroit Diarrhea of the future with the knowledge gleaned from your frothy death (Hint #2: boil your damn water). Excellent! Fine! Stupendous! Here we go again! Thanks to procedurally generated environments, the game feels fresh every time you restart it. New buildings to scavenge, new bandits to hoot and holler at, and the realization that the best weapon of all in this game isn't your .308 rifle with 2 bullets, but simply the knowhow to just run the hell away and live another night. I will recommend this game to anyone I give a damn about and use it as a litmus to test to see if I'll get a hold of them when the world goes to ♥♥♥♥.

												NEO Scavenger is a very different game. I haven't played many like it, and certainly not any that I have enjoyed as much. It's a complicatedly simple game. It nearly masters survival against the elements, finding and cleaning water to drink, gathering plants for food or beating a deer to death with your bare hands for food.It's style will put a lot of people off. It is a text game at it's descriptive and story core, something I am absolutely fine with, coupled with a hex based pixelated landscape. The controls are entirely mouse based or a combination of mouse and keyboard, and while it can seem strange and complex at first, a few playthroughs and you'll master them.Another thing that will put people off is it's genre. It is that, no common, ""rouge-like."" When you die, you're kaput for good, and you start another play through. I liken it to Faster Than Light, in that aspect. Not just for it's art style and rouge-likeness, but for how you can upgrade your character, or ship/crew in FTL, and progress in the story only to die horrbily.One great thing about NEO Scavenger is it's story. What is its story? I can tell you that you play as Philip Kindred who, after some odd years of cryo-stasis, wakes up in a world vastly different from what used to be. Kindred doesn't know that, of course, since he's conviently lost his memory. That's what you learn at the start, and that's where the story can end for you.You can spend all of your time in NEO Scavenger simply getting better loot and surviving for as long as possible. The only way to advance the story is to seek it out activly. On the surface, it's a great survival rouge-like, but under the surface lies a vast and complex story filled with multiple branches, characters, challenges, and intrigue. There is an ending to the game. I didn't even know there was one, and I've been playing since early access. Honestly, I die or screw up before I make it far in the story.The storytelling is all driven by you. You see a strange glow at night, follow it for a few days, and suddenly you find yourself surounded by life at the Detriot Mega City. What is this strange DMC? Ask some people, read some newpaper scraps you find while scavenging. Or don't. Go somewhere else, advance the story in a different way. I've found three ways you can ""start"" the story, and all of them require you to think and act proactivly.The enemies and lore behind them is also great. I won't spoil what they are, but this game is supposed to be a realistic survival sim-like thing while also having deep roots in the supernatural. If you wonder to yourself,"" Oh my god, what the hell is that creature from the bowels of my worst nightmares,"" then google it and you'll likely find an real urban legend from Michigan that the enemy was based on.NEO Scavenger is one of the best games in existence, in my opinion. Unlike a lot of other games, it has a demo! If you're on the fence, play the demo. If you think you like it, buy it without a doubt and get into it. I don't rate games, but for the sake of this review, I give it a 9.5/10. Why a 9.5, you ask. Because I'm super biased about this game, but I admit it's not perfect. So go play the demo, fall in love, and buy this game. Throw yourself full heartedly into the world and lore that surrounds NEO Scavenger. Explore the DMC, find awesome old-world loot, investigate strange amusement parks, derilect cities, and even face otherworldly horrors in the pursuit of Philip Kindred's epic story.Or don't. It's up to you, but be warned: you'll likely freeze do death anyway. Seriously, Michigan is cold and it rains a lot. I'm talking ALL the time. ♥♥♥♥ rain.Oh, and go ahead, take off that talisman. Seriously, it's no big deal.Just don't lose it. Ever. "

												This game can be frustrating at first, the first few (many) lives you play will often end in the same ways: freezing, beaten to death while you're half naked, more freezing.

								A pretty outstanding game.It's a hexagonbase survival strategy game, that stresses on finding equipment to endure the elements, finding food, water, and medicine to survive. In a post apocalyptic world, it's you and you alone that must brave the outside world where anything could be your enemy.It's a scavanger game, you loot anything you are able to and keep anything useful, anything from nuts and bolts to nightvision goggles and assault rifles. Eventually you will have a character that you have put a bit of time and effort into creating, this is where the game gets fun.I really enjoy this game. It just recently came out a few months ago, I believe, and the dev is already coming out with patches, and helpful fixes towards the game. So, there's always new stuff to look forward to.If you play scavanging games, and you enjoy the satisfaction of trying to survive as long as you can.Then, I suggest you give this title a try.It even has a demo; if you are still unsure.

Early Access Review
								One of the best survival games I have played; where it's a dog eats dog world. Hunger sets in if you don't consume food, you can die from dehydration, freeze to death, bleed to death, die from infection and poison; the odds are stacked against you. However, the same goes for everyone else in Neo Scavenger, as well. It isn't like other games, where they severly penalize you but the conditions does not effect the enemy. Far from it, scavengers you find along the way can bleed to their demise and freeze and perish in the cold if they have no clothing, just like the way you can in the given conditions.If you pick this game up, be prepared to scream at times, and die countless more. Each death comes with learning to play better, and the learning curve is extremely steep. This game is literally based on Marxism, and it truly is a brutal, unforgiving atmosphere. Do not underestimate the enemy, and if you encounter two or more at once, do not be frugal. It's better to use that ammunition and live another day, than die and start over. Gear up and learn how to survive; and good luck.			"

												This is basically ""The Road"" as a videogame. You drag a shopping cart filled with junk through a desolate wasteland, desperately scrounge for a meal, and the apex of your day is finding a shoe in working condition for the correct foot. You'll be lucky to wake up tomorrow and even luckier to still have your things.The game features an incredibly in depth health system, which makes you vulnerable to blisters, infections, blood loss, diarrhea, allergies, hypothermia, dehydration, starvation...and other awful experiences I haven't had the pleasure to face yet. Combat is possible, but very very risky and the odds must be considered carefully. There is some kind of plot, but I haven't progressed enough to fully grasp it. There are, however, occasional side quests and the writing is consistently very good. Try it out. I don't like survival games, generally, but this one took a hold of me.			"

								Great game that is really addicting , it reminds me alot of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. Only down side I have found is that it really punish you hard in the begining making your chanses of surviving the first night a reall challenge (some times you should be happy if you manage to survive the first hours). Other then that it have a great crafting system so far ( the game is not complet yet from what I understand so I guess more stuff will be added down the line) it also have a great shelter system making it really fun trying to build your ""own""  place to hide out at , all around it is a great game with alot of potential			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game.  I enjoy roguelikes (I love Nethack) and survival games as a genre, but I can't recommend this one.In the end, it's too easy to die without any foreknowledge, making the game feel a lot like playing roulette.  In my most recent game, I walked into a hex that appeared unoccupied, but in fact hid a dogman who killed me before I even spotted him.  I'm used to dying frequently playing games like Nethack, but I always feel like it's my fault, or that there was something I could have done to prevent my most recent death.  I do not have this feeling when playing Neo Scavenger.The UI is also very cumbersome (e.g., trying to navigate the craft menus, or trying to move things around in your inventory between vehicles and a box, etc.), coupled with tons of annoying fiddling in order to play even near-optimally (like always making/lighting torches when you scavenge, or trying to put on the 3 best shirts you have found), means that most of the time you're fighting the UI instead of making interesting decisions.  The simple fact that you can't tell whether water in a bottle is purified or not without dumping it out exemplifies what I mean.  Instead of looking for a bottle [water (purified)], you just have to dump out all your bottles until you find one containing purified water, take a drink, then put all the water back in the bottles.  It's madness.			"

												Day one.I wake up in a cryogenic facility, Instantly approached by a hulking monster. Remembering my knowledge and previous work in a garden, I decide to smash plants against my skin to scare the monster away. It works. I proceede to leave, Gathering pebbles and bark for my future domination of the world.Day two.I find out that bark does not protect me from hypothermia, And decide to scavange for clothes instead. Finding a shoe and a t-shirt, I dress. From rags to riches, They always say.Day three. I am approached by a random man wearing a hoodie with a glass bottle. Thinking he is bringing me a gift, I attempt to speak with him, Only to have my head wildly bashed in with said bottle, The last words going through my head being; ""I wonder if my shoe fell apart.""----All sillyness aside, Neo Scavanger is an amazing game. It includes the perfect mixture of roguelike mechanics, Mixed with a interesting if sparse text based story. The complexity of the game itself is astounding, Considering that it's a flash. The only cons i could point out would be the fact that it is currently out of any major development, Though it is majorly bug free and full of content, As well as major modability in its current form. All in all, Worth the money.			"

												Man I totally understand the love I see for this game but I just can't get behind it. I enjoyed this game and have alot of respect for roguelike game that manages to tell an intersting and detailed story. Ultimately the reason I have to give this the thumbs down is because of the terrible user interface and menu system that just flat out needs to be better.The game is a challenging one unfortunetly most of the challenge I faced was figuring out to navigate the complete mess of a menu system. Now once you get the menu system down the experience is much improved. I was reminded of how awful the menu system was after I had to put the game down for a few weeks and came back to find I had forgotten some of the ins and outs of the game and I just can't bring myself to try it again.I can handle bad graphics and some game play flaws but there are just too many here for me to ignore. There's some stuff to like here but overall its just not worth the price tag. 4/10			"

												This is an interesting game concept and nicely fleshed out lore (as far as i can tell) and i would very much like to see a more developed version in future.I do not regret having bought this title and see my small money as contribution to the developers further endeavours, but after some hours the gameplay feels to poor and unrewarding to keep on playing. Do not get me wrong, i like hard games, but this one feels of balance. Needless to say that combat mechanics are very outdated, but interaction with NPCs in general feel stale and lifeless and there is no good way to interact in a meaningful way - only stomping other peoples heads or getting stomped...I am aware that this game was developed by one single man, so hats off to you Sir. Hope we will see more of your work, but i will pass on this from now on...Bottom line: If you want to try it out, go ahead, but do not expect your experience to be particularly rewarding.			"

												So far this is an okay game it's pretty rough for most new players since every choice you make might lead to your character death and I've kept dying but that's because I've been learning it the hardway, if you go around and look at a few let's play and read some of the Guides you'll find the game somewhat easier.I've been playing this game for a while now and after a while it does get a bit repetitive I keep trying to explore places but find it lacking in content could be just me.It's an okay game overall, I had a great adventure and even manage to write a story about it! Enjoy!**Story may contain Spoiler**This is the story of my latest adventureDay 1: I woke up in a strange facility, I have no clue who am I and why am I here.. Suddenly! Surprise Dogman appeared! I beat the living s**t out of it like there was no tomorrow until it stopped twitching.It was a good work out I don't remember when was the last time I had a work out or if I even work out at all. My stomach made a rumbling noise so I went to search the place for food but only found a green bag with a white cross sign inside it was just a bunch of dumb pills.. I stared at the dead dog like creature feeling somewhat regretful for killing.. perhaps it was just trying to help me.. So I chopped his body into pieces and brought some wood from the nearby forest to make fire to cook it.""This is what it would've wanted me to do"" I thought to myself silently thanking it for becoming a meal and a coat but also silently hating it at the same time for not bringing any condiments with it.After satisfying my stomach I went to stroll into the nearest town looking for any sign of civilization but nobody was here the streets were empty and ocassionally I'd see a few skeletons laying around, perhaps it's halloween and they're having a huge hide and seek event.. YES! that could only be the most logical reason!I looked around inside buildings ocassionally taking items with me ""I'm just gonna borrow this stuff I'm sure they wouldn't mind"" I thought to myself as I grabbed as much stuff as I could carry.It was starting to get dark and I was afraid if a stranger would walk up to me and offer me a sugar free candy, so I went back to the facility I woke up in and decided to call it home.I saw a faint glow of light in the distance and I knew it.. they were hiding from me.. nobody hides from me.. nobo.. *falls asleep* zzzZZZzzzZZZzz...Day 2: I had a good sleep last night but my stomach was beginning to complain again.. I went out and made myself a hardened spear before heading out any further.. just in case I encounter any stranger danger..As I headed out toward where I last saw the glow of light I spotted more Town! as I sprinted toward the town I came across a friendly stranger.He was carrying a revolver he must be dressing up as a cowboy and he was also wearing a pair of croc so I asked him to give me all of his stuff because my stuff sucks, but he refused and start to charge at me, The nerve of some people I tell you! So I poked him on the head with my sharp stick, he fell and was crawling away from me as he beg for mercy so I gave him what he wanted and kept poking him with my sharp stick until he was no longer in pain.I was pretty happy that I could borrow his croc I saw that cool kids wear these kind of sho- err sandals..? what ever it is.. the cool kids on the old worn out poster wear it so I'm a cool kid now.OH! and he also had an expired cracker and some ketchup! So I hack him and whack him and chop him since there's no point to let him go to waste no siree! he would've want me to eat him or else he would've told me stories about starving childrens in some distant foreign land! So being the civilized human being I am, I cooked him as best as I could with the few ingridients he had on him that I'm sure would've made Gordon Ramsay proud.Today was a good day I said to myself as I went to sleep.Day 3: A noise woke me up today.. it was a guy! He tried to take my precious empty bottle in the corner! “My Precious!!!” I shouted as I charge toward him and knocked some debris toward him, the debris made him vulnerable and as he tries to recover I stabbed him with my sharp pointy stick and carved a hole in his right arm.I kept stabbing him with my pointy stick as I hissed at him aggressively, nobody touches my precious! Nobody but me!I lacerated, gashed and carved him into pieces there was no mercy.. it was the sacrifice my precious neede- Oohh!! He had a crowbar! Now I can dress up as Gordon Freemsay the Angry crazy canibalistic chef with a Phd!And so I ventured out as Gordon Freemsay! Suddenly 3 Dog appeared! I knew it.. I should’ve double tapped him when I last met him at Galaxy News Radio.. now he reappeared before me as an actual 3 Dog! So I demolished one of the closest dog’s head using my crowbar! That really got the attention of the other 2 Dog and again I demolished the other dog head, it seem that knocked some sense to the last dog as it tries to fall back from me but it knew.. it knew it was too late.. it knew that it had done f**ked up and “WHACK!!” that was the last thing it heard.. “nobody.. mess with Gordon Freemsay..” I said to it in a silent hiss.As I went on my way I was again approached by more meanies.. they just don’t know when to quit..After slaughtering about 2 more Dog and 2 Stranger with an angry mother issue, I went off to go shopping for a sauce pan and back pack and found a cool sled and since I’m not a thief I left my plastic shopping bag with some rotting left over cooked human meat as a trade in case the owner came back.It was another great day, I cooked some water from a nearby lake so I can wash my boo-boo away and bottle some more in case I made some more boo-boo.I also did an art and craft project by stringing small can with a handful of strings and pebbles it made music if people step or trip on them! It will be a great addition to my house!Day 4: My art and craft project ringed in the middle of the night.. *sigh* I guess it’s time for a midnight snack, it was a dogie! “Chinese food it is then” I lured it into a trap but it still managed to scratch my coat before I stabbed a new nose into it’s lung and bled all over the floor.Great.. now I’m gonna have to clean that up.. *sigh* why do they have to make things difficult I grumble to myself as I enjoy my midnight snack and went back to sleep but as soon as I closed my eyes another stranger ringed my welcome bell.. I got up and quickly took cover.. I couldn’t see where or who this stranger was so I lashed out and swinged my sharp pointy stick wildly to where I think he’s at but this stranger managed to shred my upper left leg, I fell to the ground and just then I knew.. I done goofed.. and all the horrible things I’ve done.. I’ve become a monster.. and I didn’t want to acknowledge that.. I was in denial all this time.. this is it.. my time has finally come.. I am ready.. do your worst Karma.. and just like that I passed out.....Everything was silent.. I woke up.. there was a bright light as if the sun was shining upon me.....Wait a minute.. it actually is the sun! And sure enough! there he was.. The f**ker that tried to kill me! Laying on the ground with a hole in his chest.. Boy~! I sure didn’t learn a single thing from that experience so I cut that f**ker up and ate him. It sure was a glorious day in this man army! And it was pretty nice of him to bring me a hunting rifle with a scope, strap and there's even a bullet in it aww that's so sweet of him.I enjoyed the rest of the day munching on the left over while reading the outdated newspaper man.. I wish I had some fava beans and a nice chianti to go with this live- shh!! There were noises outside.. and sure it was another stranger waiting in the nearby outskirt of the forest.. and so Gordon Freemsay continues his rampage in this post-apocalyptic world..			"

								I haven't reviewed anything on Steam yet, but I had to review NEO Scavenger because this game deserves so much praise. It completely caught me by surprise and is a great example of Early Access done right. I paid the $9.99 awhile ago and I felt it was completely worth it, and after the frequent updates and improvements, it definitely continues to be worth the money. While I do think the UI needs to be cleaned up a little and the story could be fleshed out more, NEO Scavenger is still a great game. From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things. There are some flaws and it isn't for everyone, but check out the demo and support a developer that does Early Access right. I've so far put nearly 30 hours into NEO Scavenger and I'll definitely be adding to that number as time goes on			"

								Everything I want in a game of this style. It has an extremely detailed items/storage system, and the turn-based survival aspects  are executed almost flawlessly. It is an unforgiving game, and takes some getting used to in order to survive more than a day or two! However, once you start to understand how things work, it's a lot of fun to go further and further every time. My only complaints would probably be the crafting menu, which has too limited a space to display all items sometimes, and the seriously OP behavior of Wolf-Man packs and their leaders, which can take more damage than any other NPC I've encountered so far. Other than that though, it's pretty much my favorite survival game that isn't DayZ.			"

Once your character dies (which will happen many many times) you will have to start over, but it will only make you more invested in the wellbeing of your next incarnation. There is a compelling story, but it's something you will have to pry out of it over several playthroughs to get some kind of coherence to it all.			"

OK now that is out of the way let me say a couple of things this game is not your friend at all nor will it ever want to be try to be or anything the whole game is rng in a nutshell. my best example i was playing and i drank unpurified water well i didnt think it bothered me that badly well my character contracts Cholera after i last that ordeal i end up gaining another sickness after that and die very shortly after ending my run in which i had my weapon my backpack my gun and my way around the wastes all gone because i learned that dirty water will screw you in the long run. I would not suggest this game if your the kind of person who like to know whats going to happen and when it will happen this game will spit in your face and make you think differently about your a approach to it each time. Final notes Hardened Sharpened Stick too op'd please nerf :0			"

								If you like hardcore RPGs and value gameplay over graphics, you should definitely give this a try. Very fun and extremely addictive. It reminds me quite a bit of the original Fallout games, although it plays quite differently. There are some bugs and balance issues, but for an under-dev game that's apparently being created by one man, it's fairly polished.NOTE: Try to demo to get a feeling for the gameplay, but note that the demo lacks a lot of features and has a number of bugs that are already fixed in the paid early release version.

								I have spent years looking for a true survivor game, one that didn't have a core around zombies or a nuclear wasteland, and starting out with nothing but basic cloths and skills. You have to scavenge, craft, and use your wits to survive. There has only been one game that has ever done it right, and this is it Neo Scavenger.Neo, is and has been my favorite indie game for the last several years, it's difficulty is brutal but not unfairly so, you need to think and use your skills to survive, as a single fight you were sure to win, could end in a second as your attacker trips you and kick your head in. This is not a game around fighting to live, it's a game about making the right choice at that moment just to live another day. Even if you die, you want to jump right back in, so pick up a copy today. No really, right now, this game is worth every penny of $10, and guess what? It's not even done yet. This game has my 100% backing and support.Look forward to:Amazing atmosphereCrafting is expansive and rewardingYour skills will define how you will surviveendless hours of addicting and amazing gameplayDifficult until you get used to how things works in this world.

								This is game suprised me with how fun it is. Its very addicting and very fun. The best I can compare it too is DnD tabletop gameplay. Its turn based and you control your character, explore, scavange and stuff like that, where every turn it gives you a new situation or just something. The gameplay mechanics with the menu could be better, but it is in early alpha so Im pretty sure it wil get better.

								Neo scavanger Is a awsome game period, Dont let the screen shots or videos fool you this game is great its crazy in depth and the plot is tried and true, the game is so amazing that I could cut down a tree limb and combine it with a tarp I had found to make a lean to, or take a pot and fire to boil my water to make it safe to drink, These are just a small sample of the variety of things you can create, it almost feels like if you can think it you can do it, Very few games other than project zomboid (also an amazing game) seem to be able to give you this sense of depth, The game is played by reading text and moving your character in a grid overworld kinda like final fantasy tactics, I will admit from screenshots I said this game will suck and its not for me....Boy was I wrong just get the demo play it and Im sure you will buy it, This is the only game I have ever played that I killed a man just for his left boot, This game is hard it wants you to die, but each time you do you learn from it and the next time you will go a little farther this style of gameplay is very rewarding do yourself a favor and pick up neo scavanger, In its current early access state I give it a 9/10 amazing.

								Everything I want in a game of this style. It has an extremely detailed items/storage system, and the turn-based survival aspects  are executed almost flawlessly. It is an unforgiving game, and takes some getting used to in order to survive more than a day or two! However, once you start to understand how things work, it's a lot of fun to go further and further every time. My only complaints would probably be the crafting menu, which has too limited a space to display all items sometimes, and the seriously OP behavior of Wolf-Man packs and their leaders, which can take more damage than any other NPC I've encountered so far. Other than that though, it's pretty much my favorite survival game that isn't DayZ.			"

								A really interesting mix of survival and strategy. It has a really engrossing crafting system that will take a bit of research to fully utilise but, with the help of the wiki, this should be no problem. My only issue would be the lack of any sort of tutorial (as of yet) but seeing as it's only in alpha this should be coming down the pipe line quite soon. Totally worth the price tag.			"

								NEO Scavenger now has my full recommendation.This game has some deep tactical roots to it. A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. “Scavenger” is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival. You wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn’t mention any shoes or memories. You’re barefoot and it’s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there’s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.Sounds interesting, right? Like “28 Days Later” meets “DayZ”. I couldn’t tell you, because basically I’ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it... Starvation. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.Hydration. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.Hypothermia. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.Brain damage and severe blood loss. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat. The turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy. Wounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn’t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.Luckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.  Storage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.Light sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition. There are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn’t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn’t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.The slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game’s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom. 8.5/10			"

												I strongly recommend playing this game. Despite the lack of luscious graphics, the imagry you create in your head while playing NEO Scavenger will stay with you for a long time. Once your character dies (which will happen many many times) you will have to start over, but it will only make you more invested in the wellbeing of your next incarnation. There is a compelling story, but it's something you will have to pry out of it over several playthroughs to get some kind of coherence to it all.			"

								I stumbled across this game while searching through for survival games. I took a look at the screenshots, and wasn't drawn to this game at all, however I saw there was a demo, and so decided to give it a go. To my surprise, I loved it almost instantly. It's different, something unexpected in this day and age of games. After playing the demo for 20 minutes I knew I wanted to buy it, and so I did. It's a very reasonable price, in my eyes, for what you get in the game, I could easily spend hours on this game at once. The main challenge? Surviving for longer than you did the time before. The map is sort of half randomised, the main places of interest always in the same place, but forests, hills, towns, all completely random, so there's always something slightly different at the start of the game.Yes it's in early access, and maybe there'll be some more added to the storyline, maybe some more items, but for me it feels almost finished already, all full package, and I would totally reccommend at least trying the demo for this game. Give it a chance, even if you think you won't like it.			"

								This game is unlike any I have played in the last two decades. I recommend it to anyone who wants a turn-based hex RPG. Set in a post-apocolyptic Lovecraftian Michigan, your character emerges from a crygenic vat to step into a race against time. You can die from dehydration, starvation, disease  and hypothermia, in addition to wounds inflicted by the various denizens surrounding the Motor City's wastelands. This hard setting is further amplified by the decision not to include a leveling system. Each time you play, you learn more about the game mechanics and possibilities. You can augment your character with four of a dozen advantages, as well as about six disadvantages. Thes combination of these influence your play style, as some opportunities only present themselves to those with a given trait. For those who love to play first-person shooter ""RPG"" as murder hobos, this is not the game for you. It is more reminiscent of games from the late 1980s and early 1990s in that it tells its story in a piecemeal fashion with only one Rouge-like save option. While you can engage in combat, you will frequently die. Stealth, scavanging and crafting reveal much more of the story, and further contribute to the desperation as you try to unravel not only how you came to be cycled out of the cryogenics tank, but also what happened to create this near-future landscape. Expect to die a lot. And enjoy it.			"

								First and foremost, do not take my above playtime as my experience, I've bought it on Desura and the Website, and I wanted a third save and to give an additional amount of money to the devs. (Why can't I just give you money?!) Anyhow, this is Neo Scavenger in a nutshell:      Cold. How long has it been since I've been warm. A day? Ten? I don't know any more, time seems so eternal out here, and I've lost track of it. I don't know anything but pain, fear, and cold these days... and hunger. I tried building a campfire a while back, and that damned Bandit left me bleeding and scarred. I went looking for some medical equipment later that night, an an apartment collapsed on me. I'm weak and tired, but I'm too afraid to sleep... But I can afford to close my eyes a bit, right?...     ""Give up all your f***ing gear if you want to live!"" Before I'm even fully aware, I'm staring into the muzzle of a revolver. I panic and begin to scream, and he whacks me across the face with the revolver's butt.     ""What? You f***ing deaf? Hand it all over!"" I'm not deaf, but I'm not stupid either. If I hand over all this gear, I might live a while longer, but I'd still die. Slower and even more painfully than if he shot me. Besides, he might even be bluffing? Before he knows what's happening, I slam a heavy punch into his chest, knocking the wind out of his lungs and freezing him for a moment. Not one to waste, I use that moment. I grab a heavy-looking stone on the ground and begin to pummel him. In the dark, I see nothing but a vague grey shape. I slam the stone into his stomach, and he screams in pain. I pummel him even further, and further... Long after he dies, I'm still hitting him with the stone. My arms are aching and my head is pulsing, but I keep hitting the battered corpse. Finally, I relent. More out of exhaustion and pain rather than any sense of logic.     Then, I sleep. Fitfully and weakly at first, but soon enough, my fatigue catches up to me, and I rest. When I wake up, the full realization of what I'd done caught up to me. The ""bandit"" was a starving emaciated skeletal husk, and his revolver was a rusted abomination that was more likely to explode rather than fire. I begin to suck in a hitching, weak breath as I sob. That could have been me, and it probably would be before long...     It's been a while since I killed that man, but the heavy black weight of it hangs heavily on my shoulders. I hate my own existence, and have long considered suicide... If this isn't hell, then what is it? Just as I begin to slip the bottle of sedatives out of my pocket, I see a man approaching me. I haven't seen another sould in so long... and I feel genuine joy and excitement at the prospect of talking to someone... Maybe even make a friend? I begin to rush towards him, hands in the air to signify my friendliness. Before I know what happens, I am knocked aside the head, and looted.     This is Neo Scavenger, and though your adventure may not last as long, or be as miserly, you will experience the highs and lows of survival. You will wonder: ""Why? Why did it have to end this way?"" And you will face many hard choices.     Do both your practical intellect and your inner masochist a favour, and buy this game. It's well worth it's price.			"

								NEO Scavenger is a rogue-like survival game that was originally made in Flash.You control a character with amnesia or a version of memory loss, it is your job to make sure you survive in the vast post-apocalyptic landscape filled with mutants and raiders. The game involves turn-based combat and crafting which both give the game that unique gameplay style that makes it stand out amongst other titles. (May not sound like it, but it really is different)The game is hard, I really do mean hard. The rogue-like genre means that when you die or lose in game you will need to restart from the beginning, it also means that each map is procedurally generated and so there will never be the same items or NPC's in a single location. With the difficulty aside the game is really fun with a lot of replayability, there is no real storyline yet but it will be soon implemented according to the dev.At the time of writing this review it is still in the beta stage of development and also in Early Access, from what I have seen and played it is one of the few Early Access games that haven't disappointed me.

												The game has a large learning curve, figuring out how to get clean water, clean bandages, creating fires, making weapons like spears and using animal hides to your advantage. The games fun comes from learning this and becoming better from your mistakes. i have played this game for almost 250 hours and i still find it fun.			"

								Unlike Pixel Piracy, this game is being develped by competent focused people with a workplan that keeps the early backers fully informed of what to expect. This work ethics are indeed rare amongst Indie studios. The developers sholud be praised by the responsability they take upon assuring the quality of their product, if only that. Good news is the game is, in all the sense of the word great. A post-apocalyptic don't starve with RPG elements, this game left me incredibly happy and fulfilled to the point that, and I almost never say this, think the asking price for the release is not high enough. This Game is worth your money and the developers deserve it. I cannot recomended it enough. If you're a fan of don't starve and/or rogue-likes/lites this is it, you can't go wrong. It might register as 0 hours played, but I played a good solid 10 hours of it while my internet was down. "

								This game is amazing. Despite it still being developed this game has (and still is) blowing me away. Although It doesn't have a full developed story and they're still developing it it's great. Combat gives you tons of options. The environment is pretty immersive with the day and night cycle and player health maintaining etc. And when you Do get to see other major areas like cities the scenes of people eating and watching performers put a huge smile on my face. Not to mention the potential for it. Shoutout to BlueBottleGames for a great first game.QUICK VERSION-Great Turn Based Combat-Great Graphics that remind you of a modernized 8-bit still (you know what I mean)-Amazing Scenes-A MUST buy for 10$ (or less on sales)			"

												This is the most realistic survival game I have ever played, and due to the current stance of the industry I doubt anything will beat it for a very long time.The game mechanics are ridiculously realistic. Seriously, sometimes I die within the first 2 minutes of playing. Each and every single move you take could be your last, and this is not a game that becomes easy over time as you learn how to play it. This is a true survival game unlike any other.The mechanics are very balanced, and you have to do many things to survive. The crafting and inventory system is very nice, as it allows for a lot of customisation. Do not let the graphics of this game fool you, as the gameplay is what matters here. I personally really like the art style and retro feel to the game anyway.If you really want to know how much time the developer spent on making this game, here is an example: If you try and put minature items such as pebbles into a shopping cart, it won't work because in real life the pebbles would fall through the wire framing of the cart. Despite this being a very minor and insignificant example, it goes to show you how much the developer cares about the game.			"

								A fantastic game, a true retro feel. If you are looking for something with graphics this isnt the game. If you are looking to kill a bandit with a sharpend stick to loot him for a boot a crummy tshirt and a quarter full lighter then this is your game. The perma death system makes you take fewer risks (you know, actually trying to survive) The skill system is pretty good, though at the time of this review isnt fully implemented. The only thing i have against this game is if you use a cleaner like CC cleaner it will wipe your saved game. SO keep that in mind, you dont want to wipe your flash cache when playing this one. 9/10, would play again...if i wernt still keeping it in a window while i work.Update 8/30/14 The game has been updated to have more enemies, more items, more story. Every addition is very cool. I've never seen an unfinished game that added things so quickly and so smoothly. They are really on adding content. This is fast becoming one of my favorite games of all time. Best 10 bucks i ever spent.			"

								This game makes time vanish at an alarming rate. Either it's really good, or I keep being abducted by aliens while playing it.Seriously, this is some enthraling sandbox gameplay, right here. The simple, old school graphics allow for a level of complexity you can't get in your Elder Scrolls or your Far Cries.Right now, for example, I'm doing great, except that I've been sloppy about hiding tracks around my camp site, and scumbags are gathering around me. They won't atack, probably because I've killed a couple of them in one on one fights, but they aren't going away, and I don't think I can take them all down if they decide to come at me in a group. I'll probably have to relocate under cover of darkness.Amazing stuff. And it isn't even finshed, yet!			"

								It is not often you find a roguelike where all the tables are even from the start. Where the skill of you, the player, makes all the difference, and not simply how much time you have spent making your character stronger. That won't happen in this game. On top of all of that, and no matter how much gear you find, how good a weapon you have, how sharp your skills have become. There will always be something that can kill you.As day breaks, I spot hiding in the nearby woods, a creature that is both man and beast. To my luck, I find the target unawares, at rest. Creeping in closer, spear in hand, I get in close, so close, hoping that the beast will not notice. The rain works in my favor here, and before the beast has a chance to act, I pull back and plunge my spear deep into the creatures eye socket. Your life, can end just as easily.After the battle, I take out my trusty pocketknife and get to work, pulling the flesh from the bone, and using my skills to keep the pelt in one piece. Trophy in hand, I sling the pelt over my shoulders. Both as proof of my skills in combat, but also, I will not freeze. Not tonight.			"

Early Access Review
								NEO Scavenger now has my full recommendation.This game has some deep tactical roots to it. A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. “Scavenger” is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival. You wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn’t mention any shoes or memories. You’re barefoot and it’s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there’s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.Sounds interesting, right? Like “28 Days Later” meets “DayZ”. I couldn’t tell you, because basically I’ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it... Starvation. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.Hydration. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.Hypothermia. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.Brain damage and severe blood loss. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat. The turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy. Wounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn’t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.Luckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.  Storage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.Light sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition. There are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn’t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn’t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.The slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game’s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom. 8.5/10			"

												Highly recommend this game, it is a great survival game as well as it keeps its self interesting with tons of unique events, a couple of very unique locations which your very actions there can lead to profit, horrific injury or even sudden and terrible death, every action you make counts, no way to boil water? take a risk at drinking unidentified water and see if you die or not, hungry as hell nothing to eat? resort to canniblism to much and you go insane, as well as you'll have a faction hunting you down, get to confident? well a couple of dogmen will fix that! This game is great no two playthroughs are the same, each one presents different struggles for you to power through, or die trying, you may spend many days trying to find a pot or can to boil water with to die from waterborne diseases, you may end up being horrificly injured and try to do your best to survive it and end up barely surviving after weeks of hard work, this game is hard and punishing, it will abliterate you just like a real appocalypse will, definetely recomend this game			"

								First and foremost, do not take my above playtime as my experience, I've bought it on Desura and the Website, and I wanted a third save and to give an additional amount of money to the devs. (Why can't I just give you money?!) Anyhow, this is Neo Scavenger in a nutshell:      Cold. How long has it been since I've been warm. A day? Ten? I don't know any more, time seems so eternal out here, and I've lost track of it. I don't know anything but pain, fear, and cold these days... and hunger. I tried building a campfire a while back, and that damned Bandit left me bleeding and scarred. I went looking for some medical equipment later that night, an an apartment collapsed on me. I'm weak and tired, but I'm too afraid to sleep... But I can afford to close my eyes a bit, right?...     ""Give up all your f***ing gear if you want to live!"" Before I'm even fully aware, I'm staring into the muzzle of a revolver. I panic and begin to scream, and he whacks me across the face with the revolver's butt.     ""What? You f***ing deaf? Hand it all over!"" I'm not deaf, but I'm not stupid either. If I hand over all this gear, I might live a while longer, but I'd still die. Slower and even more painfully than if he shot me. Besides, he might even be bluffing? Before he knows what's happening, I slam a heavy punch into his chest, knocking the wind out of his lungs and freezing him for a moment. Not one to waste, I use that moment. I grab a heavy-looking stone on the ground and begin to pummel him. In the dark, I see nothing but a vague grey shape. I slam the stone into his stomach, and he screams in pain. I pummel him even further, and further... Long after he dies, I'm still hitting him with the stone. My arms are aching and my head is pulsing, but I keep hitting the battered corpse. Finally, I relent. More out of exhaustion and pain rather than any sense of logic.     Then, I sleep. Fitfully and weakly at first, but soon enough, my fatigue catches up to me, and I rest. When I wake up, the full realization of what I'd done caught up to me. The ""bandit"" was a starving emaciated skeletal husk, and his revolver was a rusted abomination that was more likely to explode rather than fire. I begin to suck in a hitching, weak breath as I sob. That could have been me, and it probably would be before long...     It's been a while since I killed that man, but the heavy black weight of it hangs heavily on my shoulders. I hate my own existence, and have long considered suicide... If this isn't hell, then what is it? Just as I begin to slip the bottle of sedatives out of my pocket, I see a man approaching me. I haven't seen another sould in so long... and I feel genuine joy and excitement at the prospect of talking to someone... Maybe even make a friend? I begin to rush towards him, hands in the air to signify my friendliness. Before I know what happens, I am knocked aside the head, and looted.     This is Neo Scavenger, and though your adventure may not last as long, or be as miserly, you will experience the highs and lows of survival. You will wonder: ""Why? Why did it have to end this way?"" And you will face many hard choices.     Do both your practical intellect and your inner masochist a favour, and buy this game. It's well worth it's price.			"

								I haven't reviewed anything on Steam yet, but I had to review NEO Scavenger because this game deserves so much praise. It completely caught me by surprise and is a great example of Early Access done right. I paid the $9.99 awhile ago and I felt it was completely worth it, and after the frequent updates and improvements, it definitely continues to be worth the money. While I do think the UI needs to be cleaned up a little and the story could be fleshed out more, NEO Scavenger is still a great game. From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things. There are some flaws and it isn't for everyone, but check out the demo and support a developer that does Early Access right. I've so far put nearly 30 hours into NEO Scavenger and I'll definitely be adding to that number as time goes on			"

												Really steep learning curve, but every play through makes you want to get further than the next.  The fact that you can feel absolutely invincible at one moment and then be clinging to life, praying for a critical hit just a few turns down is awesome.			"

Early Access Review
								I spent a lot of time looking for a good scavenging/crafting/surviving experience. Since stalker: call of pripyat I felt kind of left in the bench, but Neo scavenger totaly have potential for it! It feels like actual surviving, having to find food, clothes, shelter, water, tools, weapons, decide if you run or fight in an encounter, craft things etc. every mistakes can be paid the high price, the global experience is impressively convincing!The game's really hard tho, I keep dying in so many different ways, which is great as surviving shouldn't be easy, but the permadeath makes it really hard on the player, you barely start to get some good stuffs and die to start from the beghining again. It's really frustrating, but the difficulty of the game make it so deliciously painful ^^The game is still on developement so criticizing is probably prematured, but i'd like to signal that the rarity and price of ammunitions makes it unworthy to equip anything else than melee weapons, also (maybe it's a bug) when the cart broke i lost all my stuffs inside on many occasions, which doesn't make sens, as if the cart broke the stuffs shouldn't just disapear and be on the ground for me to save what i can... And last thing, the food/water mechanism isn't really logic, as you'll starve almost as fast as you'll get dehydrated, eating 50kg of berries will feed you for barely a few hours and they're pretty hard to find when you need them.Here's a few thing I'd love to see implemented/improved, hopefully devs would read it (who knows ^^) and find some indeas interesting, also maybe some things i suggest here are allready in the game/planed and I haven't found out yet, sorry if it happen:-Ability to cancel last action, as sometime i click on the wrong square or make mistakes while crafting.-Fixing the strarvation system: human body can last over 40 days without food, it doesn't make sense to die from starvation after barely 2 days. Maybe splitting ""well fed"" with ""hungry"" and ""bulk"", where ""hungry"" would affect your action points, fight capability, scavenging ability etc. While ""bulk"" would be your global ""well fed"" status, going from overweight (which inflict handicap), to anorexic which make ""hunger"" constantly low and starvation deadly. Also the meat spoils really fast, i'm not sure if it's unrealistic but why not some ways to make it last longer, like an hermetic bag, lunch boxes, thermal backpack or something.-The combat interface is pretty hard to understand, sometime i just get attacked out of nowhere while sleeping (which is pretty cool), but the guy turns out to be badly stuffed and wreck me out in couple hits, leaving me no other option than crie while watching my character die in horrible pain. Maybe something signaling the global risk of the oponent and/or chances of successfull attacks, dodges, escapes etc. Just so we know if we can try a fight or just drop all our ♥♥♥♥♥ out and run the hell away.-How can't a medic + botanic find some antidotes in forests? I keep dying from poisoning without having any chance of reaching the clinic. Also, items in general lacks a description of their effects as well as statuses leave you wondering how to fix them i'd like to have a hint of what everything does or need to be fixed (for ex: antibiotics: can heal X, or dissentry: can be healed with X).-When crafting, have a picture of each craftable item in the recipes list, this would ease a lot the recipe's browsing.-Pliz, just pliz, more ammunitions, I gave up using any weapon as i take hours to find only 3 bullets, and allways for the one weapon you don't have, i love to shoot things, but in a week of playing I had the chance to do so about 3 times only.-I would LOVE to be able to fix items, for example taking parts of one gun to fix another gun, it makes a lot of sense and have been seen in many crafting/rogue-like games (such as fallout or 7days to die), I really love that feature as you don't waste good finds (like guns, backpacks, carts etc...) just because you allready have one that's in a barely better condition.-More shopz! there is only one shop, and it's near town which mean if you want to farm cash, buy ammunitions, buy food etc. You'll have to go all the way there, across that lifeless desert of empty buildings and rude people that won't let you kill and eat them, I died a LOT starving just trying to reach it, why not itinerant sellers or random shops in some ruins?-Ability to settle. I mean it's a surviving game, greatly done, but you can't make you home anywhere, why not the ability to choose a place to fortify, stock food, make confortable shelter, medical supplies, and (why not) working benches that allows you to fix things, craft more, that require tools to enable some special crafts etc. -Definitly more scavenging places, and more specifics ones, like pharmacies, gunshops, supermarkets, factories... We all love those.-Reinforce the ""friendly encounters"" potential, right now it's mostly neutral/ennemy, maybe we could meet some people that help us, offer trades, indicate to locations etc.-The ability to loot money from innocent victi... people i killed in legitimate defense, I mean there is money in the game, how come no one carry any? -More weapons and more craftability in weapons, like the ability to upgrade a rifle (kind of like in stalker, i really loved that feature) to make it more deadly. Also the ability to craft bullets would be nice.-Skill learning, I don't get why there is so much slots available while you can't chose more than 5 to about 8 skills, i get it for the start, but then i'd like to have a way to learn new skills ingame after a while.-Even biger map. I know this one is huge allready, but in the end there's nothing but one city and the start facility (plus the ruins of course) I'd love to see more special places, more terrains, more climates... more surprises!-More hunting potential, I managed to kill a dear once, but with no ammunitions and no way to come near them and oneshot them, it's really hard to get any, so the moral choice of rather eating or not human flesh become a rethorical question: you just can't survive without your daily bad mutha's barbecue, I'd like to play it ""nice guy"" sometime and eat only berries and animal meat, but it need more dears and squirels, and even bunnies, rats, birds etc.. Traps also are underated, we should be able to put one in the forest and come back later to see if it caught something.-Maps markers, like if i have to drop my loot for some reason, I can mark the place to come back later, this could combine with the previous traps comment to know where you had put a trap, and make you come back to check them before your catch get stolen (by a thief or another animal) or spoils.-More detailed medicinal interraction: risks of local wound infection (that can turn to septisemia of not cured), specific intervention required (tools needed to pull out an arrow, suturation, hemoragy, broken bones etc.)-Difficulty choice/save game, as it's pretty frustrating to start all over everytime you die, i'd personnally like to be able to save my games at some points, maybe make it hard like having to find a saving location in the map etc.  An alternative would be to propose 2 game modes: hardcore (permadeath) and softcore (respaw with penalties).-Zombies, lol joke, the game is allready great, it doesn't even need zombies (i'm not sure some zombie-like creatures would ruin it tho).That's about all I can think of right now, but anyway the game rocks! I really hope you guys will push it to the best of it's potential, and for the players still hesitating: go for it! It's worth every penny!			"

								This game is genuinely superb. There are many, many ways in which you can approach the simple task you are given - survive, and all of them are satysfying yet challenging. All the traits you get to choose while creating your character are massively useful and impactful and you can only take a few, heavily influencing how you play. What's more, the game is suprisingly fair for a rougelike - i've been killed without any chance at defending or escaping only once, while sleeping in some town ruins (which is obviously not a smart idea as these are heavily contested by looters and scavengers and i should have expected something like that to happen). The combat system is very entertaining and has some neat depth to it, at least when you are fighting on even ground. If you assault a random, starving unarmed guy with a spear there won't be any challenge, but with the same spear you can try to take on mutants, soldiers, and hunting-rifle wielding manhunters if you have the right traits and choose your moves wisely. Or you can lure those guys into some other guys, have them fight, and then move in to scavenge their stuff. Or just run and try to avoid them. Your life often depends on decisions like that, and it's quite brilliant.			"

								With more than 30 hours of gametime, I can happily say that this game is awesome. Only a few games have ever really left me wanting to play a little more, and this is one of them.That being said though, this game is brutal. One minute you are killing Bad Muthas left and right and the next moment your clawed to death by a Dogman, or shot by a high powered rifle. This game never lets you have it easy, and even if you think that you can survive forever, think again. I personally tried to fight the Detroit Megacity Gaurds, it didn't end well. I also took off the bronze talisman, just to see why I had it, that didn't end to well, either.This game is one of the best survival games I've ever played, and I will continue to play this game long into the future.

								That game is now in my favorite games ever played.It's one of those rare games that you get a feeling of accomplishment when you get some valuable loot and manage to keep it for a long period of time. Even if you die and have to start back from the cryo lab and the beginning is always the same, it's really easy to have a completly different experience while you play. You will never encounter the same enemy during your first travel to one place and you will really need luck to survive some obstacles (for example, someone steal all your stuff while you sleep, including your clothes. The amount luck you'll need to survive that is really really big).You know that you've progressed in this game when you look back at the main event that happened during your journey. From when you left that cryo lab with only a hospital gown with you and when you just killed 5 dogman with your rifle and your compound bow.Speaking of combat, this is one of the games where you feel more cruel when you kill someone than in a FPS game, and you dont even see it happen! It's just click and hope to read something that is good for you! Even if you are not reading a book each time you use an attack, you'll feel very cruel when you'll read that he died by lung bleeding, so you basically caused him to drown in his own blood.Anyway, go buy this game now! Its really worth it!15/10 "

												This game is great!  Paid for itself the first day.  Ultimate replayability, the crafting system is excellent, no lack of challenge and great stories.  I feel like this should be the alpha version of this game as there is soooo much potential here.  Stirke a deal with sid meyer's if you can, but either way this game needs to be much bigger and available everywhere. Needs more spawn locations, add animated battle sequences (though I wouldn't mess too much with the battle system you've got), more craftables (this suggestion will never change, you can never have too many craftables), online maps, more gangs, recruit a crew and start your own gang and the obvious one, upgradeable and interchangeable skills.  I realize this game has just recently released and not a moment too soon.  Despite my long list of suggested improvements for future patches/releases, this game is a solid WIN!  (though I did manage to sneak past most of the story line and beat the game by wandering to the north, so you might want to address that too).  I highly recommend to everyone who enjoys turn-base, post-apocalyptic and/or crafting survival, styles. I would buy it as a phone app too.  Keep up the good work guys and gals!  and never forget about us mac gamers.  We know we're a pain to accomodate, but we need the mac for work (most of us) and I lose out on money to sacrifice disk space to run games, but that's our level of dedication.			"

												Note: I bought and played mostly on the GOG version of the game, hence why I have less than 2 hours in Steam. I probably logged over 100 hours.Anyways...What this game does right is giving you lots of options when it comes to survival. Too often survival games feel limited, like things you should be able to do easily in a real life situation just aren't available in game. A couple examples that come to mind:- Need to boil something but don't have a cooking pot? Use a tin can!- Need to make fire but don't have a lighter? Rub two sticks together or use sunlight and a piece of glass!- Need a container to carry items but don't have a backpack? Use a plastic shopping bag!- Need bandages? Rip clothes, get rags. Need clean bandages? Boil rags.- Need string? Rip rags.Nice features include:- 'Building' your camp: pick an abandoned building with the appliances you need, place traps, leave a sleeping bag... Not a whole lot of options but you do feel like you have your own personal secure spot you can come back to.- An engaging storyline that makes you want to find out about what happened to the world and yourself. An interesting lore as well.- Lots of crafting options to get the stuff you need to survive.- Skills that give you special abilities- Pretty good learning curve: you'll have to keep trying at first until you learn the basics. Then you'll manage to survive fairly well, and you'll still have many more things to learn and discover. There's lots of stuff you'll have to figure out on your own (or you can use the wiki).- Overall, enough content to keep you engaged for many hours.- Low hardware requirements. Will probably run on that $200 laptop you bought to take notes in class (check the specs to be sure though).Cons:- The game is text-based with a graphical interface. Nothing is animated, few things are drawn, most is just described through text. The combat system especially takes some getting used too as well. It's very playable and some people like that style, but for some people it's a deal-breaker. So be warned.- Only one save/permadeath (although you can easily circumvent that).- Not being able to pick all skills can make the game feel limited, forcing you to play again to explore other things (you can mod the game to get all skills though).- The randomness can be harsh sometimes and force you to restart many times before you'll get lucky, have a good start and actually get somewhere.- Many random encounters don't have a ""good"" resolution to them, sometimes making you feel like the game just ties your hands excessively and won't let you try hard enough, or making you feel like your skills are useless. Some encounters can actually punish you severely, with no way for you to predict that your decisions will lead to a really bad outcome. This is in deep contrast with the rest of the game where you have so many options to accomplish what you want to do.Overall I recommend it to people who enjoy the survival genre, have the patience to fail, learn and try again repeatedly, and who can overlook the game sometimes throwing you in tough situations without you being able to do anything about it. People who aren't so hardcore can just mod the game a bit to make it easier and can circumvent the one save/permadeath feature.			"

								This game is thugerific as ♥♥♥♥, I love stalking some ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ bad mutha, waiting until he's sleeping, and kill his ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ with my bare ♥♥♥♥in' hands, then eat his dead, rotting corpse. It's ♥♥♥♥ing great, and as of late has given me urges revolving around cannibalism. Thank you dcfedor, for helping me realise my true lifestyle. Whelp it's about to be dark out, and I'm hungry as ♥♥♥♥. This game gets a trill/10, I'm gonna go gnaw on someone's kidney now.			"

Early Access Review
								I spent a lot of time looking for a good scavenging/crafting/surviving experience. Since stalker: call of pripyat I felt kind of left in the bench, but Neo scavenger totaly have potential for it! It feels like actual surviving, having to find food, clothes, shelter, water, tools, weapons, decide if you run or fight in an encounter, craft things etc. every mistakes can be paid the high price, the global experience is impressively convincing!The game's really hard tho, I keep dying in so many different ways, which is great as surviving shouldn't be easy, but the permadeath makes it really hard on the player, you barely start to get some good stuffs and die to start from the beghining again. It's really frustrating, but the difficulty of the game make it so deliciously painful ^^The game is still on developement so criticizing is probably prematured, but i'd like to signal that the rarity and price of ammunitions makes it unworthy to equip anything else than melee weapons, also (maybe it's a bug) when the cart broke i lost all my stuffs inside on many occasions, which doesn't make sens, as if the cart broke the stuffs shouldn't just disapear and be on the ground for me to save what i can... And last thing, the food/water mechanism isn't really logic, as you'll starve almost as fast as you'll get dehydrated, eating 50kg of berries will feed you for barely a few hours and they're pretty hard to find when you need them.Here's a few thing I'd love to see implemented/improved, hopefully devs would read it (who knows ^^) and find some indeas interesting, also maybe some things i suggest here are allready in the game/planed and I haven't found out yet, sorry if it happen:-Ability to cancel last action, as sometime i click on the wrong square or make mistakes while crafting.-Fixing the strarvation system: human body can last over 40 days without food, it doesn't make sense to die from starvation after barely 2 days. Maybe splitting ""well fed"" with ""hungry"" and ""bulk"", where ""hungry"" would affect your action points, fight capability, scavenging ability etc. While ""bulk"" would be your global ""well fed"" status, going from overweight (which inflict handicap), to anorexic which make ""hunger"" constantly low and starvation deadly. Also the meat spoils really fast, i'm not sure if it's unrealistic but why not some ways to make it last longer, like an hermetic bag, lunch boxes, thermal backpack or something.-The combat interface is pretty hard to understand, sometime i just get attacked out of nowhere while sleeping (which is pretty cool), but the guy turns out to be badly stuffed and wreck me out in couple hits, leaving me no other option than crie while watching my character die in horrible pain. Maybe something signaling the global risk of the oponent and/or chances of successfull attacks, dodges, escapes etc. Just so we know if we can try a fight or just drop all our ♥♥♥♥♥ out and run the hell away.-How can't a medic + botanic find some antidotes in forests? I keep dying from poisoning without having any chance of reaching the clinic. Also, items in general lacks a description of their effects as well as statuses leave you wondering how to fix them i'd like to have a hint of what everything does or need to be fixed (for ex: antibiotics: can heal X, or dissentry: can be healed with X).-When crafting, have a picture of each craftable item in the recipes list, this would ease a lot the recipe's browsing.-Pliz, just pliz, more ammunitions, I gave up using any weapon as i take hours to find only 3 bullets, and allways for the one weapon you don't have, i love to shoot things, but in a week of playing I had the chance to do so about 3 times only.-I would LOVE to be able to fix items, for example taking parts of one gun to fix another gun, it makes a lot of sense and have been seen in many crafting/rogue-like games (such as fallout or 7days to die), I really love that feature as you don't waste good finds (like guns, backpacks, carts etc...) just because you allready have one that's in a barely better condition.-More shopz! there is only one shop, and it's near town which mean if you want to farm cash, buy ammunitions, buy food etc. You'll have to go all the way there, across that lifeless desert of empty buildings and rude people that won't let you kill and eat them, I died a LOT starving just trying to reach it, why not itinerant sellers or random shops in some ruins?-Ability to settle. I mean it's a surviving game, greatly done, but you can't make you home anywhere, why not the ability to choose a place to fortify, stock food, make confortable shelter, medical supplies, and (why not) working benches that allows you to fix things, craft more, that require tools to enable some special crafts etc. -Definitly more scavenging places, and more specifics ones, like pharmacies, gunshops, supermarkets, factories... We all love those.-Reinforce the ""friendly encounters"" potential, right now it's mostly neutral/ennemy, maybe we could meet some people that help us, offer trades, indicate to locations etc.-The ability to loot money from innocent victi... people i killed in legitimate defense, I mean there is money in the game, how come no one carry any? -More weapons and more craftability in weapons, like the ability to upgrade a rifle (kind of like in stalker, i really loved that feature) to make it more deadly. Also the ability to craft bullets would be nice.-Skill learning, I don't get why there is so much slots available while you can't chose more than 5 to about 8 skills, i get it for the start, but then i'd like to have a way to learn new skills ingame after a while.-Even biger map. I know this one is huge allready, but in the end there's nothing but one city and the start facility (plus the ruins of course) I'd love to see more special places, more terrains, more climates... more surprises!-More hunting potential, I managed to kill a dear once, but with no ammunitions and no way to come near them and oneshot them, it's really hard to get any, so the moral choice of rather eating or not human flesh become a rethorical question: you just can't survive without your daily bad mutha's barbecue, I'd like to play it ""nice guy"" sometime and eat only berries and animal meat, but it need more dears and squirels, and even bunnies, rats, birds etc.. Traps also are underated, we should be able to put one in the forest and come back later to see if it caught something.-Maps markers, like if i have to drop my loot for some reason, I can mark the place to come back later, this could combine with the previous traps comment to know where you had put a trap, and make you come back to check them before your catch get stolen (by a thief or another animal) or spoils.-More detailed medicinal interraction: risks of local wound infection (that can turn to septisemia of not cured), specific intervention required (tools needed to pull out an arrow, suturation, hemoragy, broken bones etc.)-Difficulty choice/save game, as it's pretty frustrating to start all over everytime you die, i'd personnally like to be able to save my games at some points, maybe make it hard like having to find a saving location in the map etc.  An alternative would be to propose 2 game modes: hardcore (permadeath) and softcore (respaw with penalties).-Zombies, lol joke, the game is allready great, it doesn't even need zombies (i'm not sure some zombie-like creatures would ruin it tho).That's about all I can think of right now, but anyway the game rocks! I really hope you guys will push it to the best of it's potential, and for the players still hesitating: go for it! It's worth every penny!			"

												You know those survival first person games like Rust, Day Z, The Forest, etc., etc., etc.,? This game is hundreds of times more complex, yet somehow easier to play and more enjoyable. Sure, there's no multilayer, but you don't need it. Not only does it have the perfect lonely, post apocalyptic vibe pulsing through it the entire time you play it, it also has a wonderful cyberpunk sense of a style and flair.It's not perfect, the UI and Crafting can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to learn, some skill don't line up how you want them too, but it's worth every penny you spend on it.

								Really great game. VERY addictive, so if you don't have much time to play games this may not be for you. Even in early access this game is very polished and I have yet to encounter a single bug. The choices you make during character creation significantly impact the way you play, and the threat of death from a variety of sources is omnipresent. Although the game is fairly complex, it's also pretty easy to get into because everything works as one would expect it to. For instance, I didn't need a guide or anything to figure out how to craft a campfire on my first attempt. That's not to say this game is easy, far from it: you are pretty much guaranteed to die a few times pretty quickly until you get the hang of things, but deaths in this game don't feel cheap or frustrating and I've never had a death that I didn't learn something from. Pretty much everything in this game is solid; the only thing I could say I want is more content because I have so loved what I have experienced that I want more.			"

								Very engrossing survival game where it actually feels like you struggle to survive. You have to watch what you eat and drink, make sure you’re clothed properly, and as the title suggest, scavenge the world for supplies and materials. Every time you play it's different, and it can come down to skill and some luck. There are interesting skills that provide you with a variety of crafting options that may otherwise be unavailable, or perks such as the ability to find more loot, get better information on your medical state, or craft certain items. Pretty good story (although I haven't gotten very far because I die a lot :D) Highly recommend to anyone who is into more hardcore survival games. The interface seemed strange at first, but after a few tries the combat and exploration became very engrossing, which I was not expecting from the screenshots. Highly recommended!			"

								I have only one request: Simplfy and add a bit more detail to the crafting system.-When using numerous items in the crafting area, it was difficult to tell what items I was using for the final product.Other then that, this game is intense.I spent about 5 hours dying by the hands of the Merga Wraith, wondering how to avoid it, only to check a guide and find it was because of the damned bronze talisman you begin with. DON'T TAKE THAT DAMN THING OFF, EVER!After that, the game became easier, but not by much. The mostly text based action and story is amazing, I made it quite far (I'd like to think), to a place called the Hidden Lake after reaching Detroit. The story quickly turned from post apocalypse action and survival to a suspenseful horror tale in a manner of seconds. And then I DIED?!?!?! ""What the Hell!?"" I was thinking the perma-death couldn't be anymore annoying (in a good way) but now I'm even more compelled to make it back there and best that area :DGreat stuff guys.Good thriller/suspense mixed with post-apocalyptic turn based text rpg.It may be old school but it doesn't hold anything back10/10			"

								Why I have stopped playing NEO Scavenger.  First of all congratulations on creating this game.  Its a very very good game. This is the first and possibly only review I have ever been compelled to write on steam and its something to be said for the quality of this game that I want to save this game for me and not put it in my discard pile. I hesitated about giving this a yes review for the reason that there is no save function.  I get what you are trying to do with death being death however after spending over one hundred hours and near twenty or thirty attempts just to get as far as the gate of detroit (once)... in the last three cases doing nothing but hunting and hiding in a forest making leather armour (mod?) for nigh on twenty hours of play time only to be slaughtered by two dog men half an hour after setting out for the city then doing the same thing in another game, spending this time ten hours (of real life time)  in a forest making leather armour only to be slaughtered by three men as soon as I left the forest not even being able to run away and then doing the same thing, ten hours in a forest hunting and making armour,  only to be slaughtered while I slept without even waking up even though I had multiple noise traps in place.  Then I tried cheating using a mod to add every skill but it had lost its charm because of this becoming too easy.  I dont want a walkthough,  want a hard playthrough but please not a hundred of them, I dont have the time. I have stopped playing this game because I dont have this sort of time to spend to get no where in a game.  I choose not to play again to try and get somewhere in the plot only then to later get slaughtered having spent a hundred hours progressing the plot and have to start all over again.  I want to play it through and I commend you for having this idea to have this ""when your dead your dead"" idea but I actually have a real life to survive in and I simply dont have time to spend too much of it locked into this game.  Yes, have an Iron man mode for the realism of the survival aspect of the game, but until there is a save function I will not be returning to this game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a hundred hours to spend just to get out of the starting blocks.EDIT... I have changed this from NO to YES to NO to YES... Its too good not to reccomend.  And... then... I started another game... Dan... I hate you... I love you... I hate you... I love you... please add an iron man function your driving me insane.			"

								Well, I've bought quite a few games this year, and with the year almost over, I can say this is my favorite this year. Yes, it handily beats Bioshock Infinte in my book. Sure, I love Post Apoc, I love turn based, and I especially love a game that requires real thinking and planning, so it hits many of my buttons. Still amazes me that a small team like this can beat a game with a $100 million budget like Infinate.I just hope that they keep up on improving this game and make it into a true classic. The main things missing are better UI, more of everything, and ironing out a few bugs.			"

								even though this game is still an EAG its quite fun to play, survival in this game is rather well done...if you dont pick one of the traits at the begining say for example botany, you will have almost no idea wether the mushrooms and berries you scavenge from forrest and grass are either edible or poisonous! it pays to look over the traits and pick what you think will be best as most times until you find a balance you may struggle to survive.....but thats what makes this game so good, its literally attempting to survive in a world where everything has gone crazy and the skills you pick can ither help you or be your downfall.

Early Access Review
								A nice premise - old style hex adventure, but with the usual apocalyse scenario.Its far from easy, for example anyone thinking of rushing headlong against mobs the moment you start should think again or you will die, and it will happen often. Sneak around scavenging for clothing, weapons... craft those bits of junk into something useable. Then go out again - you'll still get killed, but perhaps less often. This is a game of learning and trial & error. You will learn as you die. And you will learn as you survive. Its something of a slow burner. You WILL come back to it after a period of frustration. It'll sit there somewhere in your mind, suggesting you have another go - maybe this time...Permadeath has to be in the game or would essentially ruin the story, and essentially this is the driving force - this game can be replayed with different information based on your skillset - perhaps some things that would be hidden would be revealed.I feel some things that need improving - crafting for example is good, but would be best if it remembered every combination you'd come up with from previous games (rather like the old son of in the old rogue type games. This has some previous recipes but not many, and trying to remember them all yourself is absurd.Also something that (I think) needs changing to a degree is the way loot is calculated - many times you can obtain a hoard from scavenging with almost no chance to gain anything, but then you can repeatedly find nothing when you have a good chance. Certain skills improve or reduce this, but I think too much in some cases.Basically here is a potentially good game, which needs many more refinements before it can really be considered complete.I enjoy this sort of game, but I really wonder if I'm actually anything better than totally rubbish at them. The fact is that despite any faults - any time you have what you deem to be a completely unfair death or when you were just starting to do well for once then along comes... a big nasty monster... at least you have the knowledge of what doesnt work next time, or a different skill to pick - maybe you'll endure the early multitude of deaths and finish the game - perhaps I really am rubbish at it, maybe it (the game) needs balancing, or maybe it always will be just a tad too hard.In conclusion:I'd play it more if I didnt die as often, if I got to see slightly more of the story.All too often you go through the initial stages then die in a low level battle. Perhaps if you were just left sometimes with your stuff robbed - at least you had a little chance...7/10 (with potential to be 9/10)**SPOILER ALERT**Leave the talisman alone.			"

								This game is a bit of a hard sell at first. The user interface is not exactly intuitive, and the graphics are nice but a bit retro.If you overcome these initial scepticisms though, what you'll find is a game that is a mixture of ""A dark room"" (minus the initial set-up phase), ""Minecraft"" (minus the blocky 3d graphics) and any Rougelike (so expect to die frequently).The basic setup is always the same: you wake up in some kind of cryo-lab, and the world outside has turned into a post-apocalyptic dystopia similar to ""The Walking Dead"" or ""28 Days Later"".You have to find out about your own past and uncover the secret of what happened to the world.You walk around the landscape on hex-grids, scavenging the woods or the remains of long-gone cities for clothes, food, water and weapons, while avoiding (at least initially) other NPCs or animals, most of which want to see you dead. You can craft things together with recipes you find scattered around randomly, and from time to time you find pieces of newspapers which tell you a bit about what has happened.The environment is highly dynamic, you have different weather patterns which impact your sight (when you find a scope or binoculars, you can even increase your visible range), and many other scavengers are roaming the area on their own (one nice example: I once found a corpse, looted it and moved his stuff into my hideout, just to find him chopped to bits of meat when I came back the next day... and of course the killer was not far off and killed me a few minutes later...)The story unfolds bit by bit (you have to survive the first night to even get an idea on where you should be moving), and even though I not yet come very far in the story yet (did I mention it is very easy to die in this game?) it is a game I will keep on coming back for ""just one more try...""The only downside (IMHO) is that there is no way of saving the game (except for the ""save&quit"" function), so every death is permanent. And since it's written in Flash there's no easy way of getting the save data out for bakup purposes. But that just shows that it's a real Roguelike at heart...			"

								This game is an awesome mix of survival, scavenger, skyrim, and a turn based combat game. The map is huge, consisting of hexagons which may or may not have item already on the ground, indicated by a box. The looking glass indicated scavenging. The tent indicates your camp sites, and finally the red feet indicate whether someone or you have been there recently.This game is not for the faint of heart. In the beginning, you die frequently and most often by things you wouldn't normally expect. There are NPC who are homicidal and roaming the wilds looking to 'scavenge' off your newly dead body. At first I could only last a few hours, and then I quickly learned the skills necessary to survive longer. My average now is 3 to 5 days. The skill/flaw system can be a little frustrating, and there aren't many of either. It could definitely use more of both to allow a better customization of the characters skills and flaws.On top of that, there is not a way to customize the characters name, gender, or gender-based clothing, at least none that I have discovered. This is truly a survive or die game. Weather, injuries, cold, hunger, thirst, disease, poison, and combat can all kill you. There are also random hex's that have NPC run stores in which you can trade things for money or for other items. The only city I have found as of yet is Detroit.The one resounding issue I have with this game is once you are dead... you are dead. There is no way to save unless you want to dink around in your computers files to rig up some kind save system. While the character is still alive, you can save and come back to your one save, but after death it disappears and you have to start over. I don't see a point in that system, but then again.. I didn't make the game. I think this game has some real potential. It can be frustrating, and seem difficult but failing has helped me learn how to survive longer and pick the skills necessary to survive. There are little things that I think could be corrected like in-game items, or the way in which skills are used. My favorite skills to use would be Trapping, Botany, Medic, Hiding, Tracking, Electrician, Mechanic, and a few others. I'd like to see a sewing skill and possibly the ability to take/train an animal companion. I know if I were trying to survive, I would try to find a dog to help protect my stuff, and me while sleeping.I am concerned though that the developers are making the game significantly harder, so I think the option to choose a skill level from safe - ultimate survivor could be used to allow many different people with varied experiences with games like this could play casually or have a challenge. I like being able to play through a game and then go back through it collecting all of the little dodads and whatnot. In conclusion, I love the basis of this game. I think a few things that need to be changed are the save games, a few additional items in game, a few additional skills and a few changes to how the skills work, a better skill/flaw menu, addition of companions, as well as a difficulty setting.A bug that I think I have found would be while wearing different shoes, or a single shoe still gives the negative effects of being barefoot. However if the two shoes are the same, the effect goes away.Great game, my fiance and I are addicted to it. Keep up the good work!			"

								Now I can't say much about the end game bits (If there even is an End game this game seems to last forever) but what I can say about this new update today, is it is WHOLEFULY welcomed. This update makes it so much better, gives a better balance to the beginning skills and some thing alittle bit less noticable is the beginning area is now dotted with more cities and towns which really increase your chances of finding some cloths or a backpack which are damnedfully welcomed. Now these changes do make the game slightly easier but hell this was probably the hardest game I own in my library. Now it's only the hardest game I own still. Lemme say how hard this bloody game is, it's harder than probably all the Darksoul bosses put in to one fight. I mean the environment will kill you, if a Bad Motha doesn't beat your brains out while you sleep, or the infamous shadow that just makes you explode basically. Even for a early access game I must be honest I feel like I'm getting a full game that is complete. I rarely find bugs, or any imbalaces. The Dev does a AAA job of keeping up with the community and the game. I've had a few early access games and by far this Dev really takes care of this game, like all devs should. So if you're a fan of Hexagon RPG, Survival, Mystery, Action, Adventure, Strategy, Turnbased Fun... or even one of those applies to you, I'd highly recommend getting this game. For $10 you honestly cannot go wrong with this game. 10/10 Would get stoned to death again.			"

								For me this game is in a very good way to become one of the best survival games out there, altough it still is in ""Early Access"" it already shows alot of potential.It has a small learning curve but nothing too complicated.The roguelike side of the game makes it always feel fresh every run you start (yes, you'll die... alot)			"

								Well well well.  Now this is something quite good and interesting.This game has pleasently took me by surprise and I'm enjoying whats on offer so far.  Best way I can sort of explain this, is basically a Tactics style game with Text Adventure Role Playing elements set in an apocolyptic environment, coupled with...I guess Day Z/Rust style scavenging.I'm only just starting to understand the basics of the game, however it is quite enjoyable.  Basically you are person thats escaped from a facility and you must try and uncover who you are.  To do this you must survive going through the world and scavenging stuff that you need.  To do this, you enter locations and you must decide if its worth it to scavenge there or not.  You may find nothing or the mother load!...or a trap and a jackass waiting to cave your skull in with a crowbar.I like how my first OMG YES!! moment was when I found a backpack so I could carry more stuff.  I guess thats the best part of it.  The thrill of finding those essential bits and pieces that you need and surviving those moments where you are attacked.The combat requires you to be thoughtful and tactical, until someone gives in or dies.  So you have to read the text box to see what is going on in that fight and do what you can accordingly.  One mess up and you are done.I like whats been done with this game.  You get the feel that everything is your enemy, from the human, the creatures and the world itself.  Hell you are just as likely to freeze to death as you are to be bludgeoned to death.  It will keep you on your toes.Give this a game a try, it will keep you engrossed for a long time and for what...a 60-70MB download?  I'm behind that all the way.			"

Early Access Review
								Why I have stopped playing NEO Scavenger.  First of all congratulations on creating this game.  Its a very very good game. This is the first and possibly only review I have ever been compelled to write on steam and its something to be said for the quality of this game that I want to save this game for me and not put it in my discard pile. I hesitated about giving this a yes review for the reason that there is no save function.  I get what you are trying to do with death being death however after spending over one hundred hours and near twenty or thirty attempts just to get as far as the gate of detroit (once)... in the last three cases doing nothing but hunting and hiding in a forest making leather armour (mod?) for nigh on twenty hours of play time only to be slaughtered by two dog men half an hour after setting out for the city then doing the same thing in another game, spending this time ten hours (of real life time)  in a forest making leather armour only to be slaughtered by three men as soon as I left the forest not even being able to run away and then doing the same thing, ten hours in a forest hunting and making armour,  only to be slaughtered while I slept without even waking up even though I had multiple noise traps in place.  Then I tried cheating using a mod to add every skill but it had lost its charm because of this becoming too easy.  I dont want a walkthough,  want a hard playthrough but please not a hundred of them, I dont have the time. I have stopped playing this game because I dont have this sort of time to spend to get no where in a game.  I choose not to play again to try and get somewhere in the plot only then to later get slaughtered having spent a hundred hours progressing the plot and have to start all over again.  I want to play it through and I commend you for having this idea to have this ""when your dead your dead"" idea but I actually have a real life to survive in and I simply dont have time to spend too much of it locked into this game.  Yes, have an Iron man mode for the realism of the survival aspect of the game, but until there is a save function I will not be returning to this game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a hundred hours to spend just to get out of the starting blocks.EDIT... I have changed this from NO to YES to NO to YES... Its too good not to reccomend.  And... then... I started another game... Dan... I hate you... I love you... I hate you... I love you... please add an iron man function your driving me insane.			"

								I discovered this game through a blog post linked through Kerbal Space Program about how failure can be a good element of a game. Obviously, this raises a big flag about the difficulty of the game. I enjoy realism and brutal challenge in games though, so I investigated and tried the demo on their website. I loved it. It's basically a classic rogue-like, but takes place in post-apocalyptic michigan.I've died from the coldI've died from infectionI've died from lootersI've died from thirstI've only played for a few hours and already chalked up an impressive range of tragic ends. Each time you die, you take away a valuable lesson on survival in the games harsh, unforgiving world. Any fans of difficult rogue-likes or open-world adventure games should DEFINITELY check it out.

High replay value with the options to customize your traits, and randomization of maps, and good events, crafting, and locations. I also like the fact the game is kind of hardcore...it makes sense if you're trying to survive.Just a few notes on the game1. The game has a high learning curve. But don't worry it can be mastered2.

												This is quite possibly the most well-thought-out game I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I can't speak from experience as to how accurate this game nails the zombie apocalypse because personally I have not been in one, but from the fact that I'm a zombie fanatic I can say this game is quite realistic when it comes to living in a wasteland.You wake up in a cryogenic facility with something (You later find out it's one of the game's meany creatures, a Dogman) trying to break in. You select your skills and use them to your advantage to defeat the beast, and then you are sent into the massive and unforgiving world that is NEO: Scavenger.This game absolutely nails scavenging. You search around for ages finding useless, irrelevant items such as string and broken glass bottles but that feeling of pure, unadulterated satisfaction when you find some of the more useful items such as a backpack or especially a crowbar, is amazing. Don't get me wrong, this game is unforgiving. As you'll read down below, someone didn't feel like boiling the water they found, got cholera, and died. That's the kind of thing you have to expect on a daily basis from this game. I once forgot to set my noise trap and was murdered by a guy with a meat cleaver in my sleep. I had a shotgun and a noise trap, but it was in my backpack and I didn't feel like getting it out. Another time, I shot and killed a deer, took the meat, put it in my backpack and forgot to cure it, and proceeded to eat it a few hours later after it had spoiled. I got some sort of weird disease and died after hours of diahorrea and blood loss. And while it's unforgiving, it's ultimately very satisfying to play. You find youself getting killed, cursing the game out, and then coming back a few hours later for seconds. And that one rare playthrough where you don't die a horrible, painful death, you just feel awesome. I have tons of screenshots I've taken of the various times when I've had a surplus of stuff.Also the developer, Daniel, is always reaching out to his fans. I'm personally friends with him here on Steam because I wanted to ask a question, so I shot him a friend request and he responded.If you are thinking about getting this game, get this game.If you are not thinking about getting this game, get this game.If you hate this game with a passion, get this game.If you're going to propose to your SO, buy them this game and put it in a virtual box.

								Well, I've bought quite a few games this year, and with the year almost over, I can say this is my favorite this year. Yes, it handily beats Bioshock Infinte in my book. Sure, I love Post Apoc, I love turn based, and I especially love a game that requires real thinking and planning, so it hits many of my buttons. Still amazes me that a small team like this can beat a game with a $100 million budget like Infinate.I just hope that they keep up on improving this game and make it into a true classic. The main things missing are better UI, more of everything, and ironing out a few bugs.			"

								even though this game is still an EAG its quite fun to play, survival in this game is rather well done...if you dont pick one of the traits at the begining say for example botany, you will have almost no idea wether the mushrooms and berries you scavenge from forrest and grass are either edible or poisonous! it pays to look over the traits and pick what you think will be best as most times until you find a balance you may struggle to survive.....but thats what makes this game so good, its literally attempting to survive in a world where everything has gone crazy and the skills you pick can ither help you or be your downfall.

								This game is utterly amazing.  Don't be put off by the mildly ugly graphics.  You will forget them in no time.  What makes this game mind blowing is that it is a rogue-ish game with permadeath, yet it doesn't feel like it.  Sure, the first few times you play you are going to measure your lifespan in hours, but once you get the hang of it you realize that survival is all up to you and completely possible for very long periods of time.  I am writting this after burning a solid 6 hours on this game in a single sitting.  In that entire time I had thrills, upsets, and close calls, but never died.  This is a rougalike game to be sure, but don't let that cause you to run screaming.The survival aspects of this game are absolutely awesome.  You find yourself searching for food and water, planning ahead, and deciding when it is worth a risky encounter.  There is no ""I am a bad guy"" badge on people.  See a fellow stranger in the distance?  It is up to you if you want to use surprise to take out a possible threat, or wave and see if he is friendly and wants to talk.  Do you risk a fire to boil water, knowing it might attract a threat?  When it gets dark, do you stumble blindly looking for a good camp, or take a risky spot in the open and hope for the best?  What do you do when you wake up to find a melon head stolen your weapon and backpack; grab a stick and give chase, stalk them, what?  There are always so many options, and that doesn't even get into the tactical turn based combat!The combat, while simple on its face is complex and interesting.  Planning is rewarded, but so is on the spot craftiness.   The the game never demands a split second decision, so you have time to ponder your move and roll the dice.  It lets you do so many crafty things and it tends to behave as you would expect.  For instance, imagine you come accross some scary looking person who looks like they want to eat you, and have a host of options.  Do you sneak in close and try and stab him with your trust spear, hoping that this game awesome wound system will let you stun and cripple the guy before he realizes you are there?  Do you try and slip away before he sees  you?  Maybe you decide to bluff and at a distance try pointing your rifle (with no bullets in it) at him, trying to scare him off, if he charges anyways, flip that rifle around and show him the butt of it.  You can jump out of concleament and egg him on, hoping in the rush to get  to you he gives you a solid opening to land the first blow.  Perhaps you get out your old butchers cleaver and start the fight by charging him over onto the ground, and hacking him apart before he can get up.  Hey, he might not even a bad guy, you can always just wave from a distance offering friendly chat and see what he does.This game is so unassuming, but it is solildly on my top 5 for 2014, and for the value for the price, it is easily #1.  It says ""early access"", but as far as I can tell, this is a full game.  This game is an absolute gem.  The worst thing about this game is that there are so many things that might scare people off from what is an awesome experience; perm death, ugly graphics, early access, a slightly obscure interface (until you get the hang of it), and a strange theme.  Don't let any of these things scare you off.  This game is amazing!  I can't even imagine what it will be once it is out of early access.  Don't wait for a sale, buy it now.			"

Early Access Review
								I've sunk at least 50 hours into this game (I used to play the demo a lot...I was broke!) and I can honestly say that this is one of the best work-in-progress games I have ever played. That's not to say that this game is flawless. The games combat system is designed to be extremely punishing. Therefore adding a risk vs. reward element into most things you can do. However, even when equipped with the best gear, it often comes down to random luck. I've flat out shot people in the head, had them survive, stay concious and then shoot through my helmet and kill me. Other times, I've shot people in the leg and had them die. It honestly feels like I'm playing turn-based Call Of Duty when using guns. The melee system is even worse. It doesn't really matter what weapon you have or what armor you're wearing if you face a dogman (or any other creature for that matter) and attempt to melee it you're screwed.Also, this game being in a post-apocalyptic setting, you have to scavenge for resources (food, water, clothing, armor, etc.). While normally I would be all for this type of mechanic, especially considering the setting, the speed you run through your resources is ridiculous and, at times, can make the game extremely boring as you get stuck in an endless cycle of, find city, scavenge city, use resources found in city, repeat. While this isn't always true, it is for a large majority of the time. However, the story elements that are slowly being implemented are making this game much more dynamic and the resource system is becoming less and less of an issue.Where this game shines and puts it head and shoulders about the competition is its realism. Most games shy away from the possibilities of what a post-apocalyptic society could become, but not NEO Scavenger. From the arena, to the gated city of Detroit, this game feels extremely realistic in its setting, something many other games can't claim.If this game was released today, I'd give it a 6/10. But for an early access game, easily a 8/10.			"

Early Access Review
								(Disclaimer: English is not my native language, expect some typos and grammar errors.)Oh my.... Where do I start?I came to find this game thanks to ''James Recommends'' from Extra Credits. So I knew that, based on his review, this game was going to be good. But... when I played it, I realized that my expectatives of ''Good'' were an utter underestimation. The game wasn't ''Good'', it was ''DAMN EPIC!!''.For a game with less than 100MB of size, this game stands WAAAAAY HIGHER than many Million Dollars AAA titles when it comes to survival; not even Fallout:New Vegas or State of Decay can hold a candle to NS when it comes to TRUE SURVIVAL. Which, when combined with Rogue-like makes for a WHOLE NEW GAME every time you play it; one in which you can never know if you'll succeed or fail until either of them shows up (Like when I found the Crowbar, some Binoculars and a Sauce Pan on the first town and I thought I was winning, only to freeze to death because I never found any shoes or clothes).Unlike in those games where you charge into a group of enemies with just a knife and an angry roar, knowing that if you die, you can just hit the Load Save button, in this game, you gotta think out real carefully each of your moves. Just as you would do if you were in the player's shoes (or bare feet). This makes the game feel extremely real and complex. ''Do you sneak up on that scavenger to kill him while he's asleep to steal his shoes and his gun? You already know that almost every gun you see lacks ammo, but what if this one's loaded? What if you trip on something and wake him up? You could end up losing all you've gathered so far, and there's a high chance you won't encounter most of that stuff again.''That's the feeling you get. And that's not something I've been able to feel with any AAA titles.Just a warning, tho; be prepared to die a thousand times, even right after the start. More than once I stepped into the first area just to be torn to shreds by a Feral Dog.My only critics to this game are the following:-Crafting Instructions are just too vague.The crafting system's utterly complex, but the instructions and recipes are even worse. You can't just figure out what do they say or what do they require until you go read the wiki. Perhaps if the items had some sort of Status Screen that told you what properties do they have, it'd be much easier to do this, as just figuring it out can take THOUSANDS of tries.-The Full Map is too hard to understand.At simple glance it looks just like a 300% Zoom on a SNES-era Sprite. You can't even tell what's what and even those places that are marked, it's hard to make out WHERE is the mark, as all you see is a big word. (Dunno if the iSlab or Smarphone's GPS Apps make it look better. Never gotten any of those.). I know this must be hard to do with a randomized map, but right now, there's just no real purpose to use the Full Map other than locating the Glow.-The Full Bottles' colors are confusing.Whiskey are orange-colored when full of whiskey, but also when full of water. Same goes for the Corn-a-Colas which are yellow. This can lead to a lot of confusion at the time of picking up stuff or even drinking. More than once I've been carrying around whiskey bottles filled with both water and whiskey and I've accidentaly drank Whiskey because I thought it was water and got drunk, which often led to death. This issue can be easily fixed with a couple palette swaps, so I hope it's fixed by the time the game leaves Early Access.-MOAR STUFF!No, seriously, this game needs more stuff, it's already cool enough as it is, but it could be even cooler. The current Item Pool is just too small for such a neigh-infinite world of random possiblities, so it's a bit sad that, once you manage to get some clothes and shoes to stay alive, they're almost always THE SAME. (Your shoes, the Hoodie, three shirts, some Cargo Pants and a Backpack if you're lucky are what you always end up wearing.). A game this big should have at least twelve variants of every piece of cloth or shoes.Aside from those, I have no other complains. This game has the markings of an Indie Masterpiece, and so far, it hasn't let me down. So I hope it has become even more of a Masterpiece by the time it leaves Early Access.			"

												The game does do a post-apoplectic where its a struggle to gather things to survive. It seems a little lacking in depth as some things are binary yes/no coded like if you don't take the melee skill at the start you will never make better spears and by never I mean never because as far as I know you will never get new skills. The combat system is well done. Given the time and money budget I think the game does well for where it sits in the market. I did overall prefer going to historical based Unreal World (not yet on steam).  Neo Scavenger is light enough on drive space I still have it on somewhere and can poke at it from time to time.			"

Then one day I spotted a dogman outside my camp, but before I could pursue it, it became dawn, so I had to reteat so I could make it back to camp in time. I got into my sleeping bag and thought, ""I'm going to catch that beast with my bow and war club,"" and fell asleep. Well, I wake up and look about, and not 2 feet away from me is that sneaky beaky dogman who, apparently, got past ALL of my noise traps and killed me before I could even get up. 10/10 would die from a ninja dogman again			"

												Still havent survived past 12 days but I can say without a doubt one of my favorite titles recently released. Dying Light? Dogmen are scarier. Call of Duty? This is a gods work compared to that peice of garbage. Stranded Deep? Great game but this is better. Of all my recently played and bought titles this will probably take the top spot. There is nothing quite like beating a douches head in with a crowbar who thought he could take you on with his sharpened stick, then taking his shoes.I r8 8/8 g8 game m8			"

												Amazing survival game combining survival with turn based formula and best rogue-like elements (all hail the perma-death). You will freeze, you will starve, you will thrist, and you will be having sooo much fun.. And then you will find a gun, and be the happiest survivor :D After that you will learn, that its not just pointless walking, there is a lot of mystery around, quests, and interesting encounters. I would strongly recommend this game to everyone who loves survival games!How does the first encounter with the game look? (shameless plug)

												Extremely punishing and deep post-apocalyptic survival game set in an interesting universe with detailed and fun mechanics. This game may not be deep enough to provide more than 30 hours of play, but it is well worth the price and it is certainly one of the most memorable experiences I've had with a survival game. The permadeath can be cirumvented for those who don't find that to be their niche, but regardless of how you play, you will truly feel like an inhabitant of the wasteland. Only STALKER has given this vibe up until now, great game, totally recommend it.			"

								Hoplessly addicted, thats what I am. There are several indie gems out there but I have to admit that this one is the best I've played. Why? Probably because it reminds me so much of the original Wasteland and does well to hold me over till the I get the money for the second. You play as a man with no real memory of who he is and wakes up in a post apocalyptic world, except it doesn't use the cliched desert wasteland or zombie infested urban feista. No, it sets itself apart by creating its own twisted world. In the game you move along a hex map and scavange for supplies. These supplies range from balls of twine and floss to civilian grade weapons and military grade technology. You are able to craft a varity of things out of seemingly usless items. My favorite being the sled (plastic sled + medium length twine, rope, floss, etc.) which allows me to carry more things BUT i am unable to run making combat difficult. Combat takes a bit getting use to but not for very long. It's turn based where you select what you do and you do it then your opponent takes their turn. Simple and when combined with your imagination, downright enjoyable. Even in early acess this game is so well polished I would believe it to be complete, though I'm glade it isn't because I would love to see more and more items and craftable objects. This is a must for fans of classic RPGs, Fallout(original), Wasteland, The Road(both book and movie), and Fallen Paragon(a book I highly recommend find it on Amazon).			"

												Yeah it's hardish.. perma death with limited resources and an environment that can kill you easily (hypothermia, stavation, thirst)...all good stuff for an RPG in theory... but ultimately it's needlessly repeative in combat coupled with constant random encounters day and night that will probably kill you, mix with perma death and it makes a frustrating and somewhat boaring game due to so much ""try 'n die"". To give you an idea of the game, I survived a few  days finally and ran into a guy who  I traded the medalion your character has for a rifle (fair trade and no warning about the risk) and apparently  that means I get a MergaWriaththat follows me until it kills me... yeah that sort of thing in a game is ♥♥♥♥ poor design and serves no purpose other than the kill player so they keep the medallion until the end game. But without a wiki to tell I should not have traded it, I would not know this until the second or third time I got the MergaWriath...Is it worth the purchase price ($5) I paid? Well I've played it for a couple of hours so it was cheaper than a movie......But probably less enjoyable, I doubt I'll play it much due to the frustration levels it does bring to the RPG genre.It is aimed at hard core rpg gamers who like to die a lot and often for reasons beyond their control....

								It's hard to stop hitting the retry button on this game. While there's no hand-holding in this survivalist/sci-fi RPG, every loss gives you a bit of knowledge about how to survive better on the next playtrough. While most everything about the game is minimalist (lofi-graphics and text/icon turn-based combat), the game's approach to describing characters and events forces you to assess your decisions not based on a sheet of numbers or a cookie-cutter game sprite, but on what you know about your capabilities, and what you can see of the problem(s) you face. It's a great aesthetic that forces you to be your character instead of just playing them. It's a great game, and getting better.			"

												This game can be really brutal, and it can also be pretty easy. it can be really easy and then suddenly really brutal.I think the worst thing about the game is its reliance on random number generation, you can end up being railroaded through bad luck which is really dis-empowering as a player, you end up feeling like you get screwed over by bad luck more than through your own bad choices.The game is still good though and really sells its atmosphere well. the games not relly my cup of tea but I still enjoyed a few hours of play.Not sure its worth the price tag, there are better games for cheaper on steam though.

								With the ability to download a demo, this developer has shown that they understand and care about their customers. Too many early access games ask you to fork out money on the promise that there will be more to come. Neo Scavenger reminds me of fun, hour-wasting, indie games I used to play on CD-ROMs that came free with gaming magazines. It currently plays as a complete game, with some minor bugs, and has a great early nineties retro art style that I love. Would recommend supporting this developer and this game.			"

								Having played this game for almost two years, it's pretty good, the gameplay has somewhat of a leaning curve, the isometric view is good as all the events (which there are plenty of even now) is also good, it has a large variety of skills, which really change the way you play the game.Replayability is really high in a game like this and this is no exception, you will most definitely die the first times, in fact always, but that's the joy of the game, trying different setups for your character. From having medical skills to have the skills to make your own jacket of animal skin.Try the demo, you won't regret it if you like this genre.			"

								This game is amazing, It has all the features of a game that i love, Apocalypse/Survival and such. It is also very challenging, you start out with nothing and have to scavenge and search for everything, Food, Water, Shelter play an important role to your life in the Wasteland, even has bandits and monsters. The game feels very real to me as well.I love it!! Thanks for the amazing game Dev.			"

								Cheesy game play? Not really at all. Graphics and interface are not 'high speed' but the game is about choices, and not letting yourself get beat down. 11 hours I made it. Oh joy! Very inventory management intensive. If you want to keep something better figure out how to fit it in whatever you may have at hand. Pretty cool crafting so far to. I made a shiv and a spear pretty quick. I also figured out to sacrifice a sleeping man to escape a death right at the start. This is not a forgiving game either. I got knocked down and then beaten to death by two guys and was not able to get up and defend myself. Ouch. Pretty neat little distraction here.


So it ended pretty quick in NEO

								I didn't think it would be worth $10. I was wrong, its easily worth $20, and the game isn't even completely finished yet.Its kind of like FTL, its challenging, you fail regularly, you have to learn the old fashioned way.Currently still addicted, and could easily see myself coming back to this game for years to come.I Highly Recommend this game.Its amazing how the simple elements, such as story, sound, risk, and even unexpected death come to be so much fun.

												It's a great game and worth the 5€ purchase BUT the downside is not having some kind of a checkpoint mechanic. The game is pretty long and hard, but by design choice (roguelike) there's permadeath. As you die you will see yourself doing the same things troughout the game, and it becomes a bit repetitive after 20 times.You can hack trough the save games though and if you're not a hardcore player you might just have to do it to see the ending of the game.

												Two eyes flickered open and heavy breaths followed as she awoke from the nightmare. Her body shot upward from the sleeping bag. She felt her grip on it loosen as she began to calm down. Her eyes adjusted to the dim lighting of the shed.  She listened to her racing heart and the rain on the shed’s metal roof.For a moment, a mere moment, the girl felt relaxed by the noise. Rain was soothing. The unbroken rhythm of each drop.But the ease was lost when she heard a grumbling noise from the pit of her stomach. Her eyes traveled to her stomach. She placed her hands on her stomach, and tried to remember a time where she felt full. As proof, she wore a protruding ribcage.Her attention was then drawn to the door of the shed. She could go out and search for food, risk death for food. Or stay here safe from the outside world and risk starvation.Another grumble from her stomach made up her mind. The young girl found the dagger behind her dirty pillow. She gazed at it’s worn appearance for a moment. A dagger was not much but she had not much else.With as must courage as she could muster, she slid out of the sleeping bag and crept slowly out of the shed. With one last look at the place she considered home, a dusty area with only one hole for light to penetrate through and a small space, she turned away from the shed.Her eyes looked around the forest and felt goosebumps as rain tickled her skin.        The air was coated in a thick fog and the air was stale. What little left of trees stood, but various scraps decorated the ground.        At the age of fifteen, she had been on her own since she was five. Well that what she could remember at least. Whatever happened to the world, she could not recall. The only thing she could recall was her name, or what she had been called at the time. Merida.    Merida shivered feeling the rain soak into her clothes, or what little there was of her clothes.    The scrawny young girl moved away from the shed. She crept through the forest, feeling her muscles tense. A few snarls, growls and footsteps reminded her that she was not alone in the woods. It was dangerous here.      A few moments of walking and she heard something. A bush rustled. Her eyes darted to the bush and she stopped suddenly. She moved quickly behind a log across from the bush. A small rabbit wandered out of the bush. It's ears twitched for a moment. Luckily, it seemed to not have noticed Merida's presence. The rabbit sniffed at the ground for a moment and turned it's back to the log.      Hunger outranked patience, and Merida suddenly leaped forward towards the rabbit. She aimed her dagger for the creature, but missed. The rabbit, startled, begin to ran. Merida eagerly chased the rabbit farther. Her legs ached as she forced herself to continue.  It wasn't until a while, when Merida managed to chase it to the outskirts of the forest. Caught up in the chase, she had not noticed where she was until she tripped on a tin can. She fell down the hill and into the heaps of scraps.      The dagger in her hand had slipped from her grasp. It fell along with her.      With a sudden stop downward, she caught a glimpse of the rabbit running through the scrapyard. Her eyes wandered around, and she felt fear gnaw at her. She had never been here before. She had never left the forest before.      Merida tried to catch her breath. Her small body was not strong enough for the run. Pain engulfed her right leg. She noticed a red liquid spilling from her leg. A large cut rested on her knee. Various scratches decorated her body as well.      She guessed the fall into the scraps had managed to give her the mark, along with the blade of the dagger. Tears threatened to seep out her eyes but she dare not cry.      The girl struggled to stand. But her leg was badly injured and the weight of body was too much.      So she crawled forward. After a few attempts, the girl gave up. The pain in her leg was unbearable.      There she lay, amongst the scraps, with a still empty belly, a damaged body and lost hopes.      'There's no one, no one here to help me..', she thought to herself in despair.      With that, she shut her eyes, and awaited death. She knew she was not dying at the moment; but without shelter, food, and with her wound, she didn't think she'd last a night.***      Night was present when she heard the noise of the beasts. Creatures of all variety were known to come out at night time. Her eyes tried to make out her surroundings in the darkness.      The night brought cold air to her. She shivered, and wished for her shed. At least it was shelter there.      Merida heard something rustle near the scraps. She shook in a terrified motion as the sound came closer. Clomp. Clomp. It almost sounded like footsteps. Merida tried to move her legs, but they felt numb.    She struggled to move, anything to avoid what ever it was.    The noise drew closer. All she could manage to do was hold her breath. A light as well, a red glow, was now close to her. She tried to avoid looking towards whatever it was, in fear that it would see her glancing.    The noise was now there near her. And the glow surrounded her. She close her eyes in fear. Suddenly, something cold and metallic touched her. She opened her eyes slowly, and saw two glowing eyes looking at her. The glow showed a mechanical being made of metal, gears and scraps.      And that was when she drifted into darkness.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  I liked the crafting elements, and the randomization of everything.  I'd say it's a non-traditional rogue-like rather than a rogue-lite, because you really only gain a little knowledge from each time you play.The game's definitely worth a try, and I felt the price was right on the money for what you get.

												This game is for extreme hardcore strategists or masochists. If you are the one, then go ahead and buy it. My experience in this game didn't give me a lot of satisfaction nor fun. You just die, no matter what you do, no matter where you go. You will freeze to death or be killed by... anything. There is no rollback and you get permadeath. There are close to none information about your character and chances of succes of the actions you make. There is a weird combat system: even with a ""strong"", ""melee"" and ""tough"" perks you die, eventually. 50% of desicions you make is the Luck based, plus another 50% is the Curiosity, combined together will lead you to death.The concept is very good, but the implementation is still needs a lot of work.Combining with the other issues I would wait for improved version.

												I want to like this game.  It is unique but so unplayable.  I have both the Melee and Strong perks which should make the character adept at melee combat.  Basically everything you encounter one shots you.  Even with perks you still miss all the time.  Somehow every other human npc combatant can actually land their attacks but you always miss.  Badmutha charges and falls down in front of you.  Miss, miss, badmutha stands up, miss, badmutha one shots you.  Not fun.  Not reasonable.  Completely broken.			"

												PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!! The best survival game out there, very immersive and you actually feel like a 'Wastelander'. This game is all about dying and living. The first couple times you play are challenging but you start to pick things up. How to make fires so you don't freeze to death, boil water, make meat last longer, make clean rags, what to do and what not to do when you engage other people, etc. After that the game is quite enjoyable. Each time you die you learn what you did wrong and survive even longer. Who knows, maybe you'll live long enough to see the snow ;D			"

								An amazing game, reminds me very much of Fallout 1 and 2, only MUCH more forgiving. Still, that doesn't take away from this game's playabilitiy - in fact, my fondest memories are that of my first character. who died something like 6 hours into the game from hypothermia. The crafting system is great, if in need of a bit of refinement. Combat is fun, and sometimes a little bit scary. The environment is what REALLY takes the cake though, I haven't played a 2D game that's ever given me the willies so bad. Definitely a solid 8/10 in my book, and I only see it getting better!			"

												I gotta say, it's pretty sad that this game only has ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" review rates. I purchased this game because I saw my brother play it one day, and it looked like a good game to pass the time, maybe when I was downloading something or needed something to do while I was about to go somewhere. So I paid for the game, and launched it, and found it extremely difficult to play. It took me maybe 2 hours to figure out where to go, what to do, and how to survive. But once I did, it began opening new windows in the world of NEO Scavenger. I got really far, then one day while fighting a DMC Guard, was fatally shot in the chest and killed. I thought to myself, ""No big deal, I'll just do it again."" So I did. And I died of a disease called The Blue Rot. I continued playing. Died of a bandit. Continued playing...and playing...and playing....Eventually I went upstairs and I found out that I had been playing the game for 3 hours, but what seemed to be only 30 minutes to me. In other words, the ten dollars I spent on this game lasted a whole long while.PROS OF THIS GAME-Time consuming, and very, very fun.-Don't need a super computer to run it.-Download time is literally 3 minutes.-There generally is no raging at your monitor included with this game.-The creativity put into this game is flippin' amazing.-Totally worth the ten dollars.CONS OF THIS GAME-Mild glitches can interrupt gameplay (NOTE THAT IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS)-If you're someone who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands, don't buy this.-This game sucks the life essence out of you and your friends.-Updates generally come rather slowly.Anyway, this game is great and you need to buy it.

Depending on your skill, you can do so much, and with updates being consistant, this game can be the next Fallout. The only thing you have to know is that this is Permadeath, you die, and you have to start over, but dont let that deter you. This game is for anyone who loves the post-apocolyptic settings as well as scavenging, as well as Fallout series fans.			"

Very immersive and intense gameplay as I have to allot time and attention to different aspects of survival, such as food and water, hiding from groups of humans or mutants, taking advantage of the lone bandit, crafting and scavenging for clothes and gear, spending my nights shivering and wary of looters.If you like games such as Project Zomboid and FTL: Faster Than Light for the apocalyptic atmosphere, critical decision making, and unforgiving gameplay, then you will definitely love NEO Scavenger.

												The info:In NEO Scavenger you will be fighting not only the vicious denizens of a post apocalyptic world; but nature itself.Between the cold, hunger and baddies you will have a hard time surviving.Finding something as simple as a potato chip bag seems like an accomplishment in this game as you will always be struggling to find ways to carry all the loot you find and and tools you need.Every item in the game has a health and when that health runs out, it's gone forever and just like in real life if you find a old shopping bag it might have a hole or two in it so there is always the chance that loot you find will already be near useless. Having to decide whether to go on with a sword that has 1% use left in it verses the completely fine stick just laying there will become a easy choice. But figuring out if the small pocket knife is better to take with you because it takes up less space or if it's worth losing that extra storage to a base ball bat is a much harder to decide.Every choice in NEO Scavenger could mean regret or death in the next few turns or happiness and success.  Some things to note before buying:If you like not being able to save your progress then this game is fore you. The only option you have is to 'save' game; which acquaints to going back to the start screen or quitting the game and being able to pick up where you left off however you soon realize it's not really saving anything the first time you die your save is gone. When you die you have to start over again with nothing . . .from the beginning. For me I really get depressed when I worked really hard to get what I got only to die because it was cold or because I drank some bad water.The good:ChallengingTons of content to seehigh replay valueThe bad:The random nature of  encounters and item generation is very unforgiving at times and often ends with your character being killed after only a few turns.A limited (small) set of starting skills to choose from.

												This game is one that won't leave you unsatisfied as it is brutally hard, and when you die you rarely get upset and think; ""I could have done that instead"" or ""maybe that wasn't a good idea, I should avoid doing it again"" (only time I've gotten upset is when I die fighting a bad medusa gang member, almost dieing, then getting killed by a stray dog)1. The game is terrible when it comes to forgiving mistakes, which makes it brutally fun as you either get punished or punish others for making a bad move like attacking you without weapons while you have a large knife and the strong skill. It can also destroy you if you make a bad move and give you no chance to save yourself2. The npcs seem player like, some either hunting you down and causing trouble just because they can, others thanking you for not trying to stab them while on their way to go do something. Some ignore you too. Great realism to how some people see, like they would act in an event like this3. It's a hard game, both to learn and play when you at least think you have the ropes down, a pocketknife, and a yellow canary lighter in your jean pockets since your grocery bag is full of more grocery bags and food. And don't think ""oh it must be the bad kind of hard because you need to learn stuff yourself and everything is brutal"" since it's a fun game and the only time the game isn't hard is maybe the first few moves when absolutely nothing can move yet and get you. It's a good kind of hard that makes you feel warm with the feels for your characters health and well being as he try's to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened and why he can't remember ♥♥♥♥.4. Even when you think you got things going well it can still go bad. The run I was the most equipped on was ended by a dogman who was hungry for human flesh, mine to be specific after he killed an npc and ditched the body. This keeps you on your toes as you sneak from building to building hopping to find a crowbar or bow or at least a lighter while the building doesn't give away under your feet and you fall to your doom or fall down some stairs and hit your head, breaking your neck and dieing right away.I live the game, also a great tip is don't take your necklace off, no gear, no matter how strong, is worth taking it off. If you need it that badly then make room for it. Keep your yellow canary lighter close by and what ever odd tool turned melee weapon and named ""mr head basher"" or ""stabby stabby craby"" or ""I dunno what the hell to name this"" ready to bash/Stab what ever wanders close enough at night, even a deer or bunny			"

												This game is one that won't leave you unsatisfied as it is brutally hard, and when you die you rarely get upset and think; ""I could have done that instead"" or ""maybe that wasn't a good idea, I should avoid doing it again"" (only time I've gotten upset is when I die fighting a bad medusa gang member, almost dieing, then getting killed by a stray dog)1.

								This hex-based, turn-based, post-apocolyptic, survival exploration game is quite unique and fun. The gameplay largely centers around exploring abandoned cities searching for useful items and shelter. One of the best features of the game is the level of detail in everything, every item serves a purpose and every decision has its pros and cons. The combat is extremely brutal in spite of being text based, as the descriptions are very specific and make you think about what exactly you have done; eg 'You kick the enemy breaking their ribs and punctured their lung, they bleed to death.' There are a lot of hazards you can succumb to, such as temperature, sickness, bleeding and starvation.Overall I reccomend this game to anyone who likes challenging tactical turn based games, particularly permadeath roguelike style ones.

It's innawoods simulator, minus the slavshit.Brutal survivalism and inventory management - I like how it takes cold, sleep, pain, and disease in ways that most so-called survival games overlook. This makes for a realistic and engaging but utterly merciless game. There is no save scumming in this game. Ironmode only. Too hard? Just give up, casual, and go back to Minecraft.If you want to play it on easy mode, get Strong, Melee, Botany, and Trapper. Get Myopia and Fast Metabolism as negative traits. Make a cloak out of the Dogman and get to Detroit, then make tannin tea from the forests near the sprawl and sell it until you can get into DMC, get eye implants, then as much equipment as you think you need to get going; this will compensate for your disadvantages. Still, never get cocky - one false step and it's over; I've died multiple times from being careless even when I had a full set of nanomachine healing thingies and plentiful supplies.			"

								A lot to learn, and a lot of things that can go right and a lot can go wrong. Lots of opprotunities to do things, and the world is yours to explore. Tip; Start out with Melee/Tough/Strong, Eagle Eye, Trapping, and fight the Dogman. You'll need Eagle Eye to see the mutiltool in the room. Leave the room, then go back to the cryo building and then, you'll need to craft the multitool with the Trapping Skill, and the Dogman corpse. It'll give you one of the best starting out points, able to fight off hypothermia fairly easily.			"

								Right now, it is a promising start for a Roguelike-like. The game offers an interesting spin on the survival genre, by almost singlemindedly focusing on resource gathering. Every mechanic of the game is geared toward that. You'll spend most of the time looking at a grid-based inventory screen, playing Tetris with items. This is no Diablo, though, and what you bring with you might make the difference between life and death.Food-clocks are a pretty common mechanic in traditional Roguelikes and many offshoots (Think of the advancing rebel army in FTL). Time and resource based constraints are a good way to keep the player on its toes, forcing him to push forward instead of farming lower level content to gain advantage. NEO Scavenger doesn't joke with time constraints. Get some clothing fast or it's unlikely you'll make past the first night. There are some balancing issue though, mostly due to the random world generation. Sometimes jeans are harder to find than sleds for some reason. Sometime, there are miles between your initial spawning location and any useful city hex tile.While dying like this might be realistic in a post-apocalyptic setting, it's kinda frustrating to experience more than a couple times.Also, there's a story going on; and by that, I mean a real story, not an emergent one - with quests, characters and dialogues. Not something you see everyday in these type of games. I'm not particularly bothered by it, but I wish I could opt out of it altogether and strike out on my own, handling my own business. The main issue I have with it is that, due to the nature of the game, you're going to see the same text-adventure inserts and lore pieces again and again. With all its quirks and unfinished or unpolished mechanics - combat is especially dull and clunky at the moment - it's shaping to be an interesting and unique game.			"

												  You wake up to the sound of freezing rain on makeshift tarp shelter. You take a quick look through your gear making sure nothing has been stolen in the night. Shoving the pieces of your shelter into your pack and throwing your hide cloak around your shoulders you take off through the pouring rain.      You rummage through a few houses not finding much, these where the first places to get scavenger after everything went to ****. As you exit the last house on the street tearing an old tee shirt into rags, suddenly hearing a loud clatter you throw yourself to the ground and watch as a large figure resembling Werewolf from old story's lumbers past. It passes by and you release a breath you didn't know you where holding in. Unslinging the rifle from your shoulder you top off the magazine, fighting a dog man today is not something you wish to happen.        A few days later you stand atop a hill scanning the area with half a binocular you keep slung around your neck searching for any movement while munching on a handful of berries. After several hours you see the flash a blue sash moving out of the tree line, a blue frog preacher not friendly and normally carrying somewhat valuable objects you will have no remorse from ending this ones life. Moving closer as to not waste your valuable ammunition you line up a shot from your rifle. With a loud accompanying crack the figure drops to the ground motionless. as you get close the man jumps to his feet and sprints back into the tree line, Swear under your breath you give chase into the dense forest.       He couldnt have gotten far you think to yourself examining the blood trail. The trees seem to press closer on you and your draw a small revolver from your cargo pants pocket, your rifle would be ineffective at these close ranges. The blue sash makes it easy to find the lifeless body after a few minutes. Your so focous on looting the corpse you almost don't hear the rustle of foliage, you grab your pistol from where it lay beside the body and scan the woods searching for the source of the sound. A single shot whipes by your head and you throw yourself behind a log still searching for your attacker. You take a deep breath staying here is suicide, you lung forward from behind the log in a full on sprint. Stumbling over the overgrown roots of the trees you feel relieved as you see the light streaming for the edge of the forest. In all fairness you almost make it before the second shot rings out catching you in the leg. Gritting your teeth against the pain you fire blindly behind you as you break out into the field. You leap into the tall grass silently thanking what ever god stays about for the concealment. The third shot hits you in the back going through your lung, you cough blood flying from your mouth and then the fourth and final shot the only you don't hear finally ends your pain. Neo Scavenger is a post apocalyptic survival simulator. You must contend with food, water, the cold, the weight of your equipment, wild beasts and other people in your struggle to simply stay alive. Neo scavenger also adds in sides mission and a story although i must admit i have no lived long enough to complete any of them. Also random events can happen while moving about the hexagonal landscape ranging from slave auctions to abandon camps. Combat is turn based and visceral in its descriptions, enough to make you slightly uncomfortable with each killing blow. A skill is also in place allowing you to change your play style with each life keeping the game fresh. There can be quite a lot of reading in parts however its is done very very well, each line adds more to the atmosphere and does a good job of giving a visual of the surrounding area. This is a brutal unforgiving game Death comes quickly to the unknowing and the unprepared. Its not everyone's game by far taking up a niche role in giving a somewhat realistic survival game, probably the closest ive found to a proper simulator.  I give NeoScavenger an 8.5/10  Menus can be rather clunky at times and starting off as a new player can be rather brutal but once you grown acclimated to the environment it becomes a rather masochistic joy to play. Just be wary of purchasing and watch some footage and play to free demo to see if you think you would enjoy the game.			"

												It looks so good! It sounded like the survival game I'd been wanting for YEARS! But after scavenging only 2 abandoned towns I was shot at and constantly stunned until I died. I was Tough and had clothes on, not sure if that improves my defense or not, and I was behind cover. Infact getting behind cover was the one single action I was able to pull off.In my many playthroughs since I have never been able to find another frying pan or torch, and things were even harder. Finding a lighter is so damn hard that I usually starve to death. Or if I just try waiting it out and eating mushrooms in forests, I end up dying of sickness. This isn't a game about surviving, it's a game about taking a while to die. 2 days is my usual record.This game relies so incredibly heavily on luck that it just isn't fun. But survival is all about strategy, so this works out horribly. I've tried building a great shelter, but died of sickness. Tried never staying in one spot, but got mauled. There are only ways to lose and no ways to win. Also with the very small amount of recipes available, you'd think the game would give you hints on when you need just 1 more item to make something. Dragging the skills into the crafting table is just really monotonous. It should be doing this itself! It's the Minecraft crafting table all over again, with no user-friendliness.And the skills, they were a selling point for me, but now that I've gotten to play it I only pick the same skills each time. They are just not at all balanced. This is what I'd expect from a game still in beta. I thought I'd be avoiding these huge flaws in a finished game. Incredibly dissapointing. I've tried other survival roguelikes and they were pretty bad too in there own ways.Starting to wonder if this genre combo simply can never work.UPDATE: Same day I post this, a wonderful person tells me about a free game in beta called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's got more content than I can handle! And despite it's wonky controls, it has a very clear crafting system, and loads of methods for getting materials. It's also far more immersive with you actually exploring the areas yourself. Just hope you don't need graphics, because that's the game's only flaw. To play it like Neo Scavenger, just turn zombies off and NPCs on. And finally, when you die in it, you learn from it. You play better next time. Something I sadly can't say about Neo Scavenger, where it's difficulty is based on a dice roll.			"

												One day a man named Greg woke up in a testing chamber, Greg saw a dog-man hybrid coming at him so he dove though a window to escape the fearsome creature. Afther that, Greg went up from the chambers to a place called Zom Zom's and saw some people. Greg, Not being a good person, first thought of how he could kill them with nothing but his fists. Greg grabbed a large branch and waited for one to come to him. A man with a revolver came at Greg and was telling him to drop his medical garb and his branch.Greg, who got atttached to his garb, ran right at the man and beat him till he was on the floor unconsious. Greg grabbed the man's shoes and revolver and 2 bullets and ran to the right of Zom. Greg found a strangely dressed man in black armor and a shotgun. Greg wanted that shotgun, but knew he had to get closer and make sure his bullet counted. The man offered to talk to Greg, but Greg just walked casually twards him. The man, thinking he just wanted to be closer when they talked, started to move closer also. Greg walked right into the man, lifted the gun, and shot him. Greg was astonished when the bullet totally missed the man. Greg stood there in shocked silence while the man lifted his shotgun and blasted Greg in the chest point blank.			"

												I'm writing this just because last review is negative and it's awfully long, so many people will just see the negative vote and skip the game, and that's not fair.THIS IS A GREAT ROGUELIKE GAME.You will have to face countless problems, challanges and foes. The game has a huge variety of items and recipes you will have to use during the game. Surviving it's not easy and requires practice. The first games you will freeze to death or starve within the first few turns.IF YOU DON'T LIKE ROGUELIKE GAMES, DON'T BUYOf course, it's a roguelike game. If you don't like the genre, don't buy this game because, guess what? It will have all roguelike characteristics!It's gonna be repetitive and frustrating and you will have to do the same things over and over again.CONCLUSIONThis said, there is absolutely no reason to give this game a negative vote. As a ROGUELIKE, it is absolutely prefect. "

Certain parts of the story send shivers up my spine- I feel as though im almost reading post-apocalypse book at times. Very very well done.

								I received a key through the official site over a year ago (hence the low Steam ""play time"") and am really enjoying my experience.  I'm still a bit fuzzy on the crafting (I still haven't figured out how to make a campfire, LOL), but it's fun going around and beating up bandits with crowbars and the like to steal their stuff.  I'm a big fan of the survival genre in general, though I don't often see a turn-based survival game done this well.  It also has a choose your own adventure vibe at times with your traits and perks modding the available outcomes.  Well worth the ten bucks, in my opinion.

												I know I will get flamed for this, but this game is just too hard. Period. End of story.I do not understand the modern trend of making these rogue-type games with no difficulty slider. (Teleglitch, I am looking at you.) I mean, you make a game to garner profits, then make that game so hard that only die-hards will even bother to buy it, and that is somehow the new model? Why not make the game approachable to a lot more people by having a difficulty slider, and then special achievements for those brave enough to try the hardest settings?Far Cry Primal, for example: It has an easy setting that a 3-year-old can play, but it also has a very very very difficult survivor expert mode that 99.9% of players will never even play, let alone beat. Often, with games like Far Cry and Metro and Fallout, I beat it on an easy setting first, then go back for punishment later. I get a lot of hours out of these games, and the key: they are FUN. I mean, I am not necessarily asking for excessive hand-holding like the quest indicators in Skyrim, but just asking for a decent save system and a difficulty slider.Games like Teleglitch and NEO Scavenger are absolutely terrible for the elitist attitudes they promote. Those games have nothing to do with FUN and everything to do with hollow acomplishments few people can even relate to. So why am I angry or even bothering? I am bothering because other than the difficulty levels, these games are interesting and COULD BE a lot of fun.Consider the absurdity of Teleglitch. That game advertises hundreds of custom guns, but guess what? 99% of those guns you will never find or even get to shoot on this side of 1000 hours of play due solely to the difficulty of the game. I just do not think that is cool. For this nightmare, NEO Scavenger, I have put in quite a few hours, and I have never even found a gun. Ever. Never won a fight. Ever. I fixed the HVAC heater, fixed the electricity, found sleeping and mummy bags, found shopping carts, and really that is about it, and I always always always died for stupid reasons that in real life would never happen. So sad that the difference between a no-star review and a 5-star review is the simple addition of a difficulty slider and custom achievements.			"

												While I really like the concept and everything:1) The menus are clunky.  This whole game revolves around those menus, so the game is clunky.2) Of the 10 tries or so, my character continually froze to death even if I had layered a shirt over a hoodie with pants and boots and slept in sheltered areas.3) The combat is awkward and does not feel engaging.4) Finding something to store my items was extremely difficult, so normally I'd only have a shiv or something.5) Crafting is strange and it's not clear what you can/should build.  You learn more about what you can make the more you play, and sometimes you even find recipes, but finding those items again by the time you need them seems somewhat unlikely.I feel like this could be spruced up and be far more exciting, but as it currently stands I cannot recommend it.

												If you like survival and scavenging games, and this is on sale, then buy it. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this game. I like hard games, but I don't like when I don't understand why my character died this time or even from what. Certain skills are also a must-have, more or less, which means that you can't play it with the character you'd like (well you can but you'll die much faster/easier) but rather with the character that suits the game.

You can, and -usually will- die just from wandering around, because apparently your character is some sort of lizard who can't stand temperate climates. This is just one of the many flaws; but the most glaring. This game punishes new players hard. It's very, very difficult to get into. I've yet to survive a single day game time. Unless you're willing to die hundreds of times, just to get to a reasonable point, you're better off not bothering.Immensely frustrating, seldom rewarding. And even then, you're going to die and lose all your cool stuff, so why even bother?TL:DR.If you're the sort of person who likes post apocalyptia; and enjoys inserting thumbtacks into their perineum; this is your game. If you enjoy post apocalyptia, but are sane, and don't feel like starting the same game ninety times just to get anywhere; look elsewhere for games.Definitely not recommended.			"

												I like that game, really, but it feels like an incomplete one. I started enjoing it thanks to the multiple wikias guides... but come on, that's where and when gameplay fails. Also there are some basic bugs, like losing the combat turn while changing weapon, even if you had the weapon ready in the other hand; or losing the combat turn if you check your inventory (just looking at it); and an Autosave bug that will disable almost all locations on the map so you're forced to start another game if you want to follow the plot... right, the plot. I felt like something is missing. Dialogues are well written but I just thought ""why can't I start a new life on Detroit instead of roaming like a hobo?"", no, it can't be done. Because... ok I won't spoil it, but, it's like the game has only few endings that left me still with a lot of unanswered questions in mind. It's a game released 1 and a half year ago, and I think developer should need a big hand on upgrade that nice project.It's a nice dream, and playing it leaves me just wondering how would it be once completed.

 TL;DR Neo Scavenger is a brutal 2D survival game set in a supernatural apocalypse where you try survive the wasteland of everything that wants, can, and will kill you should they ever get their claws on you. Also permadeath is on. A shining example of gameplay over graphics. Game Detail Name: Neo ScavengerGenre: Survival, Strategic Inventory ManagementPersonal score: I never knew masochism and sadism was an art form till today. Fun. What is Neo Scavenger Neo Scavenger is a 2D survival game set in a hex based world where a devastation has happened to the world and well, apocalypse thing happen and you are a survivor of it. In first glance the innocent looking graphic and the non threatening looking trailer may throw you off on how brutal this game is but as people often say, 'you don't know hell till you been there' read on. Permadeath is on btw. 1:Gameplay The main gist of Neo scavenger gameplay is well, scavenging old ruins of buildings and forest  to follow the trail of barebone story. Each hex has a protection value from beeing seen, comfort and how alert you can be when something goes near you. Each of this stats can be improved by items, shelter and other craftable. A low protection from the enviromental will make your character slowly freezes during the night and if their body temperature is already low enough they will die. A low alert level will cause your character to not wake up when threats are nearby and bandits/looter/stuff can kill you in your sleep and you will die. A low comfort will cause your character to fight less efficiently and you might suddenly fall asleep and you will die.Adding to that, the map is hex form and you have a limited numbers of move during the day and far less during the night to move around, scavenge or perform one of the many in game action before needing to end your turn for the AI to move. On each hex you can scavenge supplies with city tiles having more supplies but comes at the increase risk of being discovered by bandits and obtaining injuries. Scavenging is extremely important in this game because it is your only way of getting randomized loots early game. Pretty much everything you need can be obtain by scavenging. Which might leads to a fight should you encounter bandits while on the move.Fighting in Neo Scavenger is a game of chances and luck. A fully kited out bandit can still be defeated by you wielding nothing more than a rock but such a thing would of course take extreme luck due to the hidden diceroll system. Based on the perks you have chosen special attacks may not be available to you and only to the perk wielder. A few way fights can be resolve is through killing your opponent, dominating them and causing them to surrender or simply point your gun at them and watch them flee. Even an empty gun works occasionally to fool the AI seeing as in real life you would of course not attack the man with a gun even though its empty but you don't know that.Should you get wounded in Neo Scavenger you will have to treat them to prevent the blood loss from draining too much and yes it regenerates slowly. Wound treatment has their own special menu where you apply splints, bandages and meds to your character. Left unchecked a large wound has the potential to end your playthrough instantly. Also water and berries you collected are often time poisones because the game isn't hard enough. This might cause disease that has a similar effect to a tired status or in worse case scenario cause a total system failure which leads to your death.From all the materials you gathered from the scavenging you can use the crafting menu to create items. A wood with a sharp object will yield a spear that you can use to attack. Container with strings and stones will yield a noisemaker to increase the alert level of your campsite. Many other options exist for the player to find themselves.The player character will also experience hunger and thirst which can be reduce by eating and drinking, failure to do so will lead to death. But as mentioned earlier, most of the water and food you find in the forest where the risks are low are poisonous and consuming them will lead to death.Inventory management in Neo scavenger are quite realistic in terms of real life, your character has only 2 hands and thus can only hold 1 item in each hands without a bag. With a bag this frees up 1 hand for combat and allows more item to be carried but a bag is not your only means of carrying. Side pockets in pants, shirt and even a sledge can be found and use to help you carry more items which is especially important during end game where you often have to make far away expedition. Any item being held or use will eventually degrade before completely break down into nothing and in fact most of the things found in the wild are actually used goods and so they already have lowered durability. To beat the coldness of the night without a good shelter multiple cloths can be worn on top of each other to increase heat levels during the night and prevent freezing to death.The day and night system is also quite important. During the day enemies can spot you from further away and the same holds true for you and the during the night the decreased line of sight cause your action points to be less that during the day.As you traverse the deadly world of Neo Scavenger you might come across strange landmarks or building that will lead you to a random event. Success of survival and loot gain depends on the players perks chosen and dialog choices.And lastly the perks. During character creation you can choose several perks with perk points limiting the amount. The best perks are usually the most expensive but to help player with that negative perks can also be chosen that frees up point for more positive perks. 2:Sound Utilizing more ambient noises instead of spoken dialogs the world of neo scavenger is truly brought to life, The forest shakes and the ruined city exhibit an eerie feeling as the player explores it. But well, good filler is better than no filler. 3:Graphics Everything is sprite based no exception. The characters are sprites, the menu utilizes sprites and even the backgrounds are sprites but like other sprites these are well done enough to pass the inspection. You can clearly tell what an item is at a glance which should be the most important thing in a survival game like this.At least they do look pretty. Conclusion You will die a lot in this game. That is a fact and i hope i emphasized it enough. But the game definitely do not hold your hand at all from the moment you walk out of the facility till the next moment your guts spilled out from getting stabbed by an alcohol bottle. This game is intense. Fan of survival game should definitely get it.FInal verdict: Yes. TIPS! FIND A SHOE, SERIOUSLY.FIND SOME CLOTHES TOO WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SHOE.YOU WILL DIE. AND IT'S PERMAD DEATH SO GET READY TO RESTART A LOT.BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS....don't eat those red berries.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The world of this game holds many secrets. The map can look shallow and empty at first, but if you wander around long enough you can find some really creepy or just cool locations.  Hidden lake for example The combat in this game has almost no limitations, even in most dire situtaion you can come up on top. At least i had one encounter with that happening. There was a guy with a shotgun, i had only a crowbar. I lured him to me without revealing myself, broke both his arms and took the shotty. I felt like a complete badass and you will too.

												This is the kind of game STEAM Greenlight was created for not iOS games, horrible Russian FPS and hidden item puzzle games. I am listed as having only 3.2 hours on STEAM but I have played this game for many hours. Despite being built on a somewhat janky engine NEO Scavenger is a fantastic game. You will die often like many rougue-likes but slowly but surely you will improve with each game. Its more realistic than most games as well e.g. being a nice guy rarely comes out in your favor in the post-apocalyptic US of A.  I can't recommend this game enough especially if you are a fan of roguelikes. Experiment a bit with skills. Just because you picked tough doesn't mean you will survive your first violent encounter. The game is updated frequently enough that everytime I have played the game has been improved in some way. In fact the last time I actually made it to the city there wasn't much you could do there. I hope the game continues to be updated and I still hope for more variety in items BUT the developer has ensured that each playthrough is challenging but fair.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Text turned based game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play the game on Fullscreen and windowed mode.You are able to change the GUI (Screen ratio).There is a Master Volume and you can change the Volume every 10%.There is a Sound Volume and you can change the Volume every 10%.There is a Music Volume and you can change hte Volume every 10%.You are able to set a FPS Limit.You can mute the sound entirely.Toggling the Auto save button.About the game.You start off in a Perk selection menu, Each bar has their own ammount of Points and you only start with 15 Points.Flaws are there to make your game harder but they wil give you points to spend on your perks again.When you are at Map Grid. You will a Grid Field and at your left some clickable things and status.  On Top left, you see your movement. Then below that your hunger meter, Then Thirst, Then Rest, Then Weight limit, Then comfortable, Temperature and Hurt. Below that you will see some Colored Bars. Like End turn, Run, Scavenge, Hide, track and others. You are most likely hit from the encounter so Click on the ground that u are currently standing on, Then Scavenge and search around for medkit supplies, Then right click on it *or drag it to ur hands). Then use sheet on the wounds and you are good to go for now. If you are Scavenging and you found items, Click on the Character portrait under CONFIRM to see the items. Then CLICK on the items left and see if you can bring it with you. The LEFT SCREEN FIELD ARE ITEMS ON THE GROUND, THIS IS NOT YOUR INVENTORY. That is on the right side.  If you see Red Footprints, this could be yours or from a nearby unit. You are able to hide your Footprints aswell. Sleeping bags are a useful tool to increase ""Hyporthemia"", Sleep to increase your temperature.Might look confusing at the start.Game is Post Spamming.Music is weird.Basic Sound quality.Hard game to understand at the beginning.Requires patience and willing to understand the game.Random Generated worlds and items.Day and Night Cyclus.Game could be REALLY unpunishing or has some ""unfair"" moments.It's filled with enemies from time to time and sometimes you can't do anything about it. With a chance of dying.Other things.Pressing Escape bar button will change your size to window mode.Use Sleeping bags to increase your temperature and you won't freeze to death.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10			"

												If you ever wanted to play a hobo simulator, this is it.  If you manage not to get RNG'd into the dirt some compelling storytelling awaits you, although you could always avoid it and just try to survive as long as possible.PROS:- Excellent atmosphere.- Smart writing.  It's both verbose and short when it needs to be.- Mod-friendly.- Great for both short and long gameplay sessions.- Visceral combat.  Ripping an arrow out of your arm ans stabbin a man to death with it has a certain appeal.- Sensible crafting system and multiple skill combinations encourage different playstyles.CONS:- It's not winning any graphics awards.  Fortunately this doesn't draw away from the strength of the gameplay, but still...I could see someone not digging the look.- The RNG God really holds power over this game.  It's hard not to feel like the whole world is against you when you can't find a pair of shoes and your shopping bag full of whiskey and twinkies rips open.  Which leads to my next point.- The whole world is pretty much out to get you.  There are a couple of somehwat less hostile areas but for the most part everything in this game wants to kill you.  It's like Australia, except Michigan.- Visceral combat.  It's pretty soul-crushing to finally find a backpack and a decent pair of shoes only to later discover that someone has beat your head in with a sauce pan while you were asleep.			"

												One of the greatest hardcore and realism simulation games.It's little Role-play because you need to choose your good and bad traits.It's Apocalyptic world with lots of strangers, bad and good factions.In this game you will have NO FRIENDS.Nobody will help you except guards in guarding area.Nobody will heal you for Free.Nobody will give you Free Stuff.AND Everyone will want your (not free) stuff.This game is about your death in wildness or city :)My verdict about this game is:1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play "

												I killed the dogman, wore his fur and cured his meat.Gathered clothes, had matching shoes, and started a camp in the Cryo Facility. I was on my way to fixing the heat and electrical systems.And then I showed mercy to two feral dogs outside of my camp. I let them whimper away bleeding from their wounds.They came back with more dogs.I should have never stockpiled so many cured meats.10/10 would fight dogman again.11/10 would build Strong + Melee again to get tape of me kicking dogmans ♥♥♥.

												You will keep dying and trying again. I wouldn't even imagine i can make a coat out of the dogman, boil water to purify it, and that berries can be lethal without looking up on YT tho :D so many options, so many ways to play it. You need a lot of luck too. Getting killed is very easy - respect your life.I've lost very good equipped character over a bad combat move VERY often. miss the target, tumble, get dazed, and the hunter becomes pray.it is difficult, and such a lovely and enternaining way. I like it.			"

								Actually a fun game, although not worth the $10 in its current state. Its rather in-depth but limited at the same time. The game needs loads more content and has the potential to be an even better game than it currently is.			"

								Great game. I have to admit at the begining when i died every 15 hours was frustrating, then i began to look at those buttons on the screen and discovered crafting, now it is just pretty dang awesome. In fights it would be a little better if you had a better idea of what was happening, and it is really confusing at the begining, but it was very fun discovering things about the game. I do recomend if you buy this game mayber to look at a quick guide. not a full one as those ruin the fun but a small one to get you sorted with the crafting system and the  such. 9/10 i cant wait to see how it developes.

								NEO ScavengerNEO Scavenger is a game that wants you to die. Even more than that, it is a game that wants to kill you. Brutally and rapidly if possible, but slowly will work just as well. From hypothermia to bandit attacks to starving to death, it pulls no punches in the “you’re going to die” department. It is an unforgiving game and makes no apologies about it. Quite frankly, that’s one of the reasons it succeeds so well. Before you go running off without reading further, allow me a moment to elaborate. A single paragraph is all I’m asking.You see, NEO Scavenger also wants you to succeed. It does supply you with the tools and skills you need in order to survive. It simply doesn’t hold your hand or coddle you along the way. You begin simply enough. You start the game by picking your few basic skills and you wake up on the floor of a cryogenic freezing lab with something mean heading your way. Your journey has just begun in earnest. You may use your chosen skills to assist with the incoming creature, via feeding it another survivor or simply locking the door. The skills you have chosen to outfit yourself often change the game in this way, leading to all kinds of different outcomes to little problems like this. It’s undeniably gratifying to halt an enemy attack by using your hacking skill to drop a cryogenic tank and feeding the creature a reality television star. Let’s be honest; who hasn’t wanted to do that at one point or another?Are you still with me? I thought that might get your attention. The aim of the game is fairly simple; find out who you are and what happened to the world. Things take place in a post-apocalyptic environment, and you have no memory of any of it. It’s fairly standard, but it plays out relatively well nonetheless. Hints are revealed through old newspapers you find scattered about and obvious visual cues. Your hand is never held at any point, there is no tutorial, and there are no retries. When you die, it is game over and you start again from the beginning. NEO Scavenger is a harsh, unforgiving piece of work. But you also get a little better each time, get a little further, and learn a little more. It’s tough, often seems unfair, and is always exciting.Technically, it is a pretty solid game. It’s still in development, so it does have its share of bugs and incomplete features, but what is currently present does work well and you shouldn’t be deterred from giving it a shot if you find yourself at all interested. Over the course of the next few months it will be fleshed out and cleaned up, and it’s looking like it will become a great little game. I would recommend it easily enough, especially considering the $10 price tag attached to it. If you think you might be interested, and don’t mind a rough edge or two, give it a shot. If you think you can take the abuse, that is.  "
