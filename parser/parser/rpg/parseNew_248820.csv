Mayday, mayday, oh stuff it, HEEEEELP...You've crashed. On a planet. It's a planet made up of wierd and strange things, creatures that up until your arrival quite likely existed in peace and harmony, and then you brought yourself, your mass of crates which have scattered around the landscape, and the teleporters you so desperately need to get back to your now scuffed up transport ship to get out of dodge. Whilst on the surface the game is very much a case of guns blazing and murder everything in sight, as you dig into the lore and entries of the game, what you'll learn is that the planet was more or less *fine* until the ship crashlanded, spewed it's cargo all over the shop and you, in your size twelves and large caliber weapons, decided to cut a swathe through the landscape to get out.Congratulations, you are the risk of rain the locals keep talking about. Don't you feel just awesome?Tightly tuned, finely balanced, class based roguelite gameplay...Starting the game the first time gives you access to the beginner class - Commando. This class is a good place to learn how to deal with the game, and a balanced set of skills that should see you progress at a reasonable rate. All the unlockable classes are tailored towards specific styles of play, and generally require specialist approaches to get the most out of them. A good example is the enforcer, which is far slower and less mobile than the commando, but due to his riot shield, can essentially soak -ridiculous- quantities of damage from the direction he's facing.Later classes are even more specialised, opening up classes that work from afar, or specialise in deployables or traps, or have other means of dealing with situations. In short, every class feels unique, and has their own combos and specific ways to work things out. Furthermore, with the items that you can collect, every class will evolve differently based on the drops you find. The Enforcer in one playthrough will be an entirely different Enforcer in the next. Even if there are some items you'll ideally want to grab each time.The importance of good design and a great soundtrackThe graphics might be pixel art, which by this stage you'd think have been done to death, but on the contrary, the clear, concise design and the very well thought out vision ensure that this game always looks stylish and well presented. This is a game that revels in looking good, and always ensures that the player is in control of what's going on, even when there's a -lot- going on at once.Combined with the precise and well balanced combat, along with the great sense of atmosphere, is potentially one of the best soundtracks of recent times, going alongside things such as Don't Starve, Deus Ex : Human Revolution, and Really Big Sky. A good soundtrack sells the atmosphere, and in this case it's been captured perfectly, possibly one of the best soundtracks in my library.Deep replayability and a stellar atmosphere combinedRisk of rain was one of my top picks when I bought it, this has not changed and it still remains one of the greatest games available on steam. Along with the legends like FTL, like Dungeons of Dredmor, Risk of Rain should be considered essential gaming for anyone who wants to get their hands into the genre of ""Roguelites"" that contains things like Spelunky and co.Verdict : EssentialWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Stop adding me without even saying anything. Jesus Christ have some decency serious review? serious review. Risk of Rain is an extremely addictive arcade style 2D platformer shoot-em-up with roguelike elements.Gameplay consists of dying a lot attempting to reach and activate the stage exit teleporter in each level, there are a total of 6 levels to complete per game before achieving TOTAL VICTORYOnline Co-Op, many characters with their own unique playstyle, randomly generated level layouts, and loads of items keep gameplay fresh and exciting so you can just get goat hooves and syringes and win instantlyGameplayTight, responsive controls and enough characters to pick a playstyle that you enjoy make this an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.GraphicsA charming, simple artstyle with smooth animations makes this game a treat for the eyes.SoundAn expertly done soundtrack brings a LOT to the table, sound quality is good, sound effects aren't obnoxious.StoryA very ambigous story, no definite answers are given, but clues are relayed through item logs and monster descriptions.Multiplayer?This game features both local and online co-op, the co-op system (especially online) is a bit excruciatingly buggy, but very fun to play with friends.Fun?The artstyle, gameplay, and unpredictability of this game make for an extremely enjoyable time.  Category Score   Gameplay 10/10   Graphics 10/10   Sound 10/10   Story 10/10   Multiplayer? Local and online co-op.   Fun? Yes!   Overall 10/10  "

I wish there were more Roguelikes that was on the scale of Risk Of Rain.What's Risk Of Rain?Risk Of Rain is a platforming rouglike with it's own interesting universe, easy to understand controls, and crazy gameplay.This is one of the few games that will help you feel like a god. The amount of power you can gain, from being a lowly survivor of the UES Contact Light that dies from a single bite to walking into rooms and watching the universe collapse every time you press ""Z"".Every character that you play stands out from each other, having their own attacks, look, and feel. Not ONE character feels underpowered or overpowered compared to the rest.Although this game doesn't have the absurd number of items like Binding Of Isaac has...what it DOES have is how every item is viable and doesn't completely topple your playstyle over if you get it. While this does mean there aren't many ""weapon changing items"", I find so much joy in even finding a common item, as it brings me one step closer to absolute destruction.That's the joy I find in this game, it's to get as powerful as possible and go as long as possible. There's a nice story under it all (and good reason as to why the items in the game are even there) and if you really think about what you're doing...You're the villain of this story, whenever you like it or not. The only way you could be somewhat good is if you blaze through the game as quickly as possible and killing as few as you can. The story's optional, though, and you can read about it when you kill foes in Rainstorm or Monsoon difficulties, since they drop logs at a slightly rare chance.Almost every level has a artifact hidden in it, but you have to be lucky to roll the version of the level that has it. Every Artifact changes up the rules of the game, and gives interesting changes to it. Like, the lower the health something has (including you) the faster you will run, everything exploding with a shower of Creamator explosions when they die, a random skill of yours locking every minute..there's even one called Command that tosses out most of the RNG of the game and gives you chest drops when you get an item. The chest color is the rarity of the items you recieved, and you can pick whatever item from the item table you please. It's balanced, though, that the window you select items is real time, and you cannot move until you pick an item.When I mentioned ""easy controls"", this game really does have simple controls. four buttons mapped for your movement, and four buttons mapped for your skills. You can even use a controller.This game gets interesting when you bring in your pals for co-op, while making it even more chaotic. The game's completely viable solo, but the difficulty becomes interesting in co-op. Do you let your friend take the item drop, or do you snag it for yourself?There's also a forced item sharing button, which balances out the items for players. Though, me and my friends agree this system is incredibly annoying, so take that with a grain of salt.The music of the game is an interesting contrast from the chaotic blitzplay of  the game. Even the most intense of the soundtrack is actually quite nice music to sleep too.

If you want my personal favorite piece from the game, it has to be Surface Tension. It's also a boss track, usually used for the Wandering Vagrant boss.The bosses in this game will be intimidating and will pose a threat, like any boss will, but as you become stronger, you may be able to start one shotting them..and..as you progress even further, normal foes will be replaced by bosses. Ever faced twelve giant magma worms, three overloading ones, six vagrants, and ten colossi at once?It's one hell of a good time!Despite all my praise for the game, though, I do have a gripe about the game. Though, it doesn't bother me too much.The levels and item count.The levels will soon feel repetitive, since you will learn their layouts pretty quickly...but at least the levels themselves have different setups. Though it doesn't help that the setups only change the minor places.The items aren't in a vast quanity, where you will always find new ones...but, hey. Every item is viable to helping you become stronger. I'd rather have this than several items that are ""considered"" low tier and useless. Overall, this game, albeit not a masterpiece or a gamechanger for everything that comes after it, it's a really fun game that's even one hell of a ride with friends.And you know what? That's all I want to ask every once in a while. For the fun alone, I'd highly reccomend the game. The characters are colorful and vastly different from each other (along with having a lot of them) the items you can pick up are ALL great, none are trick items or downgrades, the game chugs on to become blitzplay after you start slaying... It's worth the price.One more thing to mention. Every item in the game itself has a bit of story on it. Some of the Item logs are even begging for their own stories.I'd play this over Binding Of Isaac anyday.			"

												Beautiful, sophisticated, yet brutal. Yes, like your new girlfriend, Risk of Rain is a ball of wonderment and pain.In this rogue-like platformer, you run around each level trying to find a teleporter. Meanwhile, enemies spawn randomly; killing them gives you gold with which you can open containers with upgrades for your character. Once you find a teleporter, you fight a boss and ultimately move on to the next level.The catch? The longer you play, the tougher the enemies become! So speed is of the essence as well as quick reflexes and mob management.The artstyle for this game is pixel based, and it's wonderful how much character these little sprites have! The tiny animations are smooth, and watching an enemy explode into blocks of meat chunks is satisfying.The music is also fantastic; it's a hauntin track that sounds like a dubstep/trance hybrid one moment and a thumping bass the next.And the gameplay: oh boy, is this game tough! But you come out of it a better man (or woman) with blistered fingers and a beard on her knuckles (that goes for the women too).So this game comes highly recommended! There are a lot of achievements/unlockables including new items and classes, so the replay value is truly up there. Do yourself a favor and pick up Risk of Rain!			"

												Where do you begin with a game like Risk of Rain? It's so new and original, yet so classic and oddly memorable that we can all adapt to it rather quickly while not feeling like we're repeating something playing it. Most ""pixel games"" as they call them I see now are simply normal games... with pixel-y art styles. This is one of those games that actually blends well with the art style, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Let's talk about gameplay for a sec.Gameplay: Risk of Rain will kill on your first run. If this does not happen, you are probably a carrier of Jesus' will and strength on Earth, because it's pretty dang hard to pick up on your first go. But to help, I'll elaborate on just how NOT to die. You are given the Commando to start out with, and classes like the Bandit, Enforcer, and CHEF will be easy to get early on. Every character has 4 skills, kind of like LoL, except you don't have a basic attack outside of them - They're all you got. Most classes tend to have a movement-enhancing skill in their third slot, and a powerful skill in their fourth. The Commando is no exception. He has 4 basic skills which are very easy to learn and starts with above-average high health to help beginners.Unlocking Stuff: Unlocking stuff isn't as easy as you would think. You're probably going to start on Drizzle, the easiest game mode. However, if you're a wimp, the game won't save any of your progress (This includes item logs), and no monster logs will drop either. If you want 100% completion, you're going to have to step it up. Most characters are unlocked by doing special things or filling requirements. No surprise there. The Huntress and Mercenary are pretty hard to get, asking for 15 monster logs and 5 game-wins, respectively. But don't worry - You'll get there if you like the game.Items and YOU: Items are, without a doubt, THE most key tool you need to survive the night. When you start out, you will find items randomly from boss kills, chests, imp vases, shrines, and other places. Chests require money, imp vases require you to hunt down and kill a few frantic imps, shrines are like casinos, and bosses should be obvious - Kill em for good stuff. Most (Keyword - Most) items can stack. A few, like Thallium, can not. This is why the RoR Wiki is your field guide for items here. Items give you various buffs and bonuses, and have the power to make or break you depending on how you use them and your luck with finding items that suit you. Once you start picking up Artifacts, hidden items that you can activate to change gameplay once you die, quit, or win, can alter some things - But I'll let you figure that all out.Difficulty: There's two ways this game changes difficulty - One, by choosing your difficulty on the character-select screen, and two, by slowly raising it during gameplay at a speed dependant on what difficulty you chose. This makes for very adjustable learning curves that will suit you everywhere. Artifacts can also help or hinder you if you're good at using them or not, for example; The Glass artifact cuts your health to 10%, but gives you a HUGE damage boost (Used to be x5 damage but they nerfed it, I have no idea what it is now - Don't worry, it's still fun as heck if you don't get hit!). Remember to start and progress at a rate that you're comfortable with, or else you might not have as much fun.Conclusion: Oh yes, this is a game you need. Don't even ask why, just get it. It's 10 bucks. It's awesome. Once you know how to use and abuse the artifacts and characters, you'll pretty much be playing something like a God Simulator with every run, finding new ways to use your characters, match items, and have fun with MULTIPLAYER - That's right, MULTIPLAYER! Also, achievements in the form of READING AND KNOWLEDGE! Also, THE GAME LAUGHS AT YOU WHEN YOU DIE and gives SNARKY REMARKS! The art-style is AMAZING! The music is AMAZING! The gameplay is BONKERS RADICAMAZING TIMES TEN! Just! Get! This! Game!			"

												After crashing on a planet you're tasked with a simple set of objectives. -Survive -Find the teleporter-Survive some more-Eradicate everythingrepeat.  For most games this could wear thin and become repetitive rather quickly but that simply isn't the case with this game.When you first play, chances are you will die a bunch without really knowing what to do. You'll unlock something else though and it will get easier over time. Think of this as a survival/horde mode roguelike countra-ish shooter platformer that never gets stale.     Each play through will generally net you either a new power up or unique character class to eviscerate and dismember the various lifeforms of each planet and area. It has a Binding of Isaac feel in a sense that things are swapped and randomized with each play through but you'll always fight the same bosses and end boss/stage. Much like Isaac your power ups stack and you can have some really brutal and devastating combinations by the time you get to the end.   The different classes and characters you unlock all have different and interesting criteria to make them available for use and there is something satisfying in seeing that you have reached a new tier of badassery when you are now plowing through enemies with dual pickaxes or laying down your heavy shield and firing cover shots to keep the wave of enemies at bay.the starting class ""Commando"" is more than suited for the task at hand, especially playing at Drizzle difficulty, but it should be known that every character plays completely different from the next and has a dedicated skill set and pool of abilities.   The bosses as well as the native creatures populating the planet are all aggressive and will swarm you the minute you come within proximity of them. This game also gives you a sense of urgency to complete the planet by steadily spiking the difficulty as the little ticker in the corner continues to count. If you can handle it you can play as long as you want, you can even get all the way to end and start back from the first level with all of your power ups in hand. There is a flexible and open level of choice that allows for revisiting the game and trying different things time and time again.  Risk of Rain comes complete with a somewhat minimalist pixel art style and the characters would be moving dots if the view was pulled out any further but it also helps give the monsters a look of towering giants and puts you in David V Goliath scenario for the duration of your journey. All of this is backed by an amazing and atmospheric soundtrack that will constantly have you nodding your head or getting pumped in rhythm of the beat.   You can get as much as you want out of this game but if you put the time and effort into it, you can squeeze an amazing amount of time and play out of your 9.99. Overall I give this game an 8.8/10 and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of roguelikes, team co op, old school side scrolling platformer shooters, and indie games.			"

												Risk of Rain is an action-platformer with roguelike elements, with some interesting mechanics wich I'll try to explain the best I can.Even if you start with only one playable character, there're ten of them total, and each one plays differently, thanks to his own four attacks.As time passes, difficulty will increase and enemies will spawn endlessly until you find the teleport, wich makes you fight for one last endurance round; beaten that, you can advance to the next level. Like other games of this genre, you can find active/passive upgrades (like piercing shots, increased defense, missiles and so on), but you can level-up too by collecting experience. An interesting fact is that powerups do stack, so you can have increased effects by collecting more of the same.Once you've completed enough levels, you can choose between replaying them to gain more loot, or going to the final one; you can easily grind more powerups if you want to, but the game can be beaten in less than a hour in a good run.Bear in mind that this is the kind of game where things get bad pretty fast, and you have to start all over again.Pixelated graphics are really good, but sometimes the action on screen become a little too chaotic. Chaos apart, gameplay is overall pretty much solid and fun.The game's soundtrack is AWESOOOOOME, I love it.Also, this game has coop, playing with other people works well and in my opinion some classes are not meant to be played alone.Reccomended if these features caught your attention, and/or if you have friends to play with.I don't think Risk of Rain is a masterpiece, but it's a really solid game.

												Roguelikes have exploded as a genre lately, largely due to the number of indie productions out there exploring interesting ways to take an absolutely classic title and bolt new mechanics to it. Games like FTL, Rogue Legacy and Paranautical Activity instantly come to mind, taking randomised areas, crazy power-ups and eternal death as a basis and building them into something new and fresh.Risk of Rain takes the idea of an impossible Roguelike to new heights. The hook of this 2D action platformer is rather simple: it literally gets harder with each passing second. Immediately the player needs to make a conscious decision: do you grind out the game in the first few minutes when the enemies are few and far between, farming gold and unlocking passive abilities that will help you when you reach the ten minute mark and all hell breaks loose? Or perhaps you want to rush through as many stages as possible before the difficulty curve rises. Risk of Rain is all about risk and reward, and while it doesn't necessarily break genre conventions, it manages to provide a compelling twist on basic mechanics.Players are given access to a number of characters, each with four unique abilities that will aid them in combat. Each of said abilities has a cool-down timer after use, so learning which character fits your play style, and how they fit in with the rest of your team is imperative for survival. In the beginning you only have access to the assault trooper, but after multiple runs you will slowly unlock a cast of devastating characters that will help you see the game through until the end.Once you select a character it's game on. You are dropped on a hostile world, filled with enemies. Each enemy killed will net you some gold, which can be spent unlocking chests found in the level, or taking a gamble and spending some at a divine statue. Sometimes this will yield you amazing items, other times it will take your money and laugh at your tears as you received nothing at all. Each time you use one of the statues the cost goes up also, which often had me throwing money away at it three times before I realised I was broke.There are tons of items throughout Risk of Rain that will give you the upper edge, most of them offering passive buffs against your foes. There are a select number of consumable items you will find along the way that can be used to get yourself out of a tight jam, and there are also some helpful assault and healing drones that you can spend money repairing so they will follow you around and help against the onslaught of enemies. Just like any Roguelike, learning how to use these items in unison is key to survival, and after a dozen or so runs, you will begin to understand how it all fits together.Each level essentially has the same goal: find and activate the teleporter which will call in a randomised boss fight. The bosses are tough....really bloody tough, and they will definitely give you a run for your money. To make matters worse, the timer is still creeping up towards a harder difficulty, and regular enemies are still spawning into the world, which makes is a cluster of pain and misery. Once the boss has been defeated the enemies stop spawning, you are left to clear the last of them, and then you can teleport to the next level. Before you leave however, you better search for any chests you may have missed, because each time you teleport you will lose your gold.Risk of Rain keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, simply because that ominous timer is always ticking in the upper right corner. Slowly but surely you see the difficulty status rise from easy to no chance in hell and the sweat starts forming on your brow. You want to make sure you survive the game, but you also need to do it as quickly as possible. It's an impossible task, one that is truly captivating and kept us coming back for more and more.While Risk of Rain supports solo gamers, the true core of the game lies with the four-player co-op. When you're tackling the beasts of other worlds with three of your best friends, each playing a different character and you are all working in unison, the game really shines as something special. If you're not likely to play the game with friends, I'd almost recommend skipping it all together; that is how integral the multiplayer truly is.Risk of Rain manages to pull off the pixel look with style and flair. The characters are enjoyable, the enemies are ghastly, and those tunes are fantastic. If you can swing a few dollars, definitely pickup the soundtrack from the website, it's right up there with Fez and Monaco in terms of great indie game albums.Highly Recommended "

												It's hard to say something about Risk of Rain that hasn't already been said in the reviews already, so I guess I'll tell the story about how I came across it:     To start off, I'm a musician. You may be thinking to yourself now: ""Why is this guy telling us this, and, more importantly, why should I care?"" Well, I'll tell you. A few years ago, I went to a music camp for the summer, and one of my favorite things to do was to go out into a nearby field with a small speaker and go stargazing after our performances. We'd find some chill music to pull up and just talk about our lives. One night, this guy suggested we listen to a soundtrack he had, from a game called Risk of Rain. I was intrigued, as I love video game soundtracks, so I told him to plug it in. I was immediately hooked on the music, and I decided to go investigate the game. I played a gameplay trailer, and it looked interesting enough. I was a fan of roguelike games, and the pixelated art style was always something I enjoyed.     A couple weeks later, I went and purchased the game and gave it a go. Being a pretty experienced, I felt ballsy and started on Hard mode... That was a mistake. I was murdered within about 15 minutes. However, after switching down to the normal difficulty, I started playing through, and I loved every second of it. Before I realized it, the difficulty was no longer increasing, and the timer read 150:00. You know you've found a fun game when you can invest two and a half hours into it while having it feel like a matter of minutes.    A couple of days later, I had every class unlocked and just enjoyed myself. I told my friends about the game, got some co-op games going, and just felt happy. The combination of a fun and challenging game is something that I've always enjoyed. The simplicity, and yet precise technicality of the game, was made perfectly. And of course, the music. The soundtrack of the game is just beautiful, and matches the tone and setting of the levels perfectly. If you wanna give it a listen, here's a link:

												ThisgameisAMAZING.The mechanics are well-oiled (especially after the last updates; now, it flows smoothly). The OST is simply beautiful. The graphics create a unique atmosphere: the gameworld is dark-toned but not lugubrious; you feel lonely, but never properly desperate, and the scenarios are always enjoyable (even after countless hours of replay). Also, the storyline of sorts is gradually revealed via item logs and monster logs you acquire after some time playing - the game starts  in media res. You don't need to know what's going on to enjoy it, but it surely adds to the flavor. I particularly like this form of storytelling: a very good game becomes more and more fascinating once you start realizing (well, perhaps not exactly) what's going on after some exploration. It reminds me of Diablo II in this point.Most important, though, is that it is PURE FUN. Very challenging and very rewarding, it leaves me wanting more every time I play. Actually, I sort of developed an emotional attachment to this game; when I started playing it, I was somewhat distant from videogames (after 24 years of being a total videogame nerd), not really willing to play too much. This game (along with Papers, Please and some others) helped me ""feel the magic"" again, sorta like falling in love once more with your boyfriend/girlfriend after a period of strain and doubts.tl;dr: FUN, rewarding, beautiful, challenging, cool, buy the hell out of it			"

												This is be a great game with loads of (sort of unexplored) potential. I mean, the retro graphics are amazing and give the game a nice feeling, the different classes are really fun to play, the soundtrack kicks♥♥♥♥♥ it's 100% worth the 70+ hours I've spent on it.But the only problem is that this doesn't have ""matchmaking"" multiplayer or a in-game server list. You'll have to either use portforwarding or programs such as Hamachi or Evolve.I don't blame the devs for that, though. They are college students, not Bethesda or Ubisoft. They've got actual problems in their lifes to take care of, and this is just their little experiment that turned out right. They still release bugfixes from time to time, though.Anyway, 9.99/10 would slice magma worms with kitchen knives while hiding between a 100-feet-wide electric shield and 2 stacks of alien heads on my face again.EDIT: As of January 2016, the site that had a useful list of servers I posted here doesn't work anymore! You can still try searching for people to play with in places like Steam community forums, Evolve, Reddit or whatever, though.			"

												Risk of Rain is possibly one of my most favourite games ever. I mean it. This is an absolute beast of a game. I am majorly addicted to this. You start off with an basic character with no equipment or upgrades, starting out slowly killing a few bad guys at a time to collect more money, and in turn you open chests with the money you have earn, each chest will have a new piece of equipment which is randomly selected, making each run through completely different to the last. When you reach level 20ish you are completely kitted out in equipment, upgrades and power ups, you can walk through hoards and hoards of bad guys using different techniques. There is nothing wrong with Risk of Rain, at all. To me, this is a perfect game.			"

												How awesome is risk of rain?It's so awesome, it is one of the eight fold paths to gaming enlightenment. Right up there with speed running super Metroid, breaking 150 actions per minute in star craft and getting through all of half life with nothing but a crowbar.  It breaks you first. Makes you accept that there is no hope and forces you to re-assess why it is you need to try again.  You realize you are not playing for the win, you are playing for the playing.

												The longer you stay on this hellhole of a planet, the tougher things will get.But you're stranded. So. Please start moving.The inherit challenge of Risk of Rain is to balance speed with thoroughness. Dwell any particular region longer and you're bound to discover (and be able to afford) an array of random weaponry which stacks together in clever ways, turning your hopeless vagrant into a prayed-for messiah. But there's that catch ... the longer you dwell in one zone, the more infernal the next will be. So as you fight simply to survive, you'll also be gauging time and charting hypothetical routes through the mysterious wasteland ... hoping to come across the right combination of moneys, chests and sacrificial totems in efficient order.Aside from the planet's devious armory, your years on the frontier have supplied you with a certain set of skills. Regardless of your profession, these core skills usually take form in a weak-ish basic attack, a middling form of crowd control, some type of evasion, and a signature ability (think of this as the one that won you all that money on The Universe's Got Talent: Killing Edition). Each time you use a skill - beyond the basic attack - you'll have to wait a few seconds before you can use it again. As that one random monster crab is quickly joined by every casual acquiantance from his apparently quite-social life, those seconds can seem like an eternity. But you'll need to use those skills with abandon - conservation is for another time and place.Again. Don't stop.As your deaths accumulate, Risk of Rain becomes a game about learning the ins-and-outs of an alien frontier while constantly pushing yourself to discover new corners of its relentless universe. Your only choice of profession at the start is a fine-tuned but vanilla-bean commando. But just as you begin to master your skills, you'll unlock a new, entirely unique character to possibly nudge your game progress further. Trust those who have come before: The new characters will often feel useless on the first playthrough. At some point, you'll wrap your brain around the death-delivering potential of each. And as you pour gallons of acid across shadowy plains or single-shot the entire health bar of one of the game's gargantuan bosses, you will learn to feel invincible ... for a minute or two at least.Each of the planet's progressively elaborate environments includes a familiar basic layout from play to play, but its random generation makes each play just uncomfortable enough to force you to make decisions on the fly. Level talk is boring, but do note: the surprisingly elaborate final stage is reward in itself.Risk of Rain is a game that requires skill and cunning ... but not so much skill and cunning to be abusive. It drops a torrent of challenges on you ... while giving you delightful ways to overcome them. To this survivor: It's earned a place in the Roguelike Temple of Elders.Be sure to visit.Just remember to keep moving.			"

												This late in the game, it may be pointless to review Risk of Rain, but I figured I should since I have a kind of a rekindled love affair with it.  Keep in mind, however, that most of my playtime has been on the Vita/PS4 and I am now faced with the daunting task of unlocking everything on my PC copy.  So take this as you will.Released in 2013 (holy crap, that long ago?), Risk of Rain is an indie action platformer best characterised as rogue-lite and quite frankly, it is a total blast to play.  When I got it, shortly after release, I put a little bit of time into it, but admittedly, I didn't -get- it.  When you first fire up the game, you have only one character available (the Commando) and after a little intro detailing some dude destroying your cargo ship and your drop-pod blasting down to the planet below, you're left to your own devices.  The drop-pod shows only the Commando available to choose with the promise of several others to unlock in the future and the promise is exciting.  But when I originally started playing, I had no idea what to do, what I was doing, or really why I was doing it.It was fun, but it didn't capture my imagination and I didn't give it the time it needed.  The game was out to kill me and it was doing a good job.  I wasn't doing very well at all with the Commando and I was desperately hoping to unlock some other kind option (to this day, I still don't like the Commando).  Like I said, I didn't get the game at all.  It was weird, it was alien, yet it was so beautifully-rendered and fascinating that I at least wanted to give it a go.  I didn't understand what these chests and jars were for, or why so many enemies seemed to have the upper hand on me.  After about an hour (keep in mind, at that time my runs in the game were probably no more than 10-15 minutes at a time), I had unlocked nothing at all, so I moved on, thinking perhaps this was one game that I wasn't going to meet for coffee later.  Yet something about it spoke to me.It wasn't until it appeared on PSN that I thought, huh, you know what, with such short runs, this makes the perfect hand-held game (for the record, it is the perfect hand-held game until you start beasting and having 30-60-minute runs), so I bought it yet again because of that -need- to understand the game and why it had always sat in the back of my head, sort of like how my first experience with Demon's Souls made me put it down, but it always called back to me.  So it was on the subway as I was blasting away at purple lizards and smokey mushrooms that the game finally clicked.  I had that ""a-ha"" moment like when you're struggling with something in class or at work and suddenly it all makes sense.At first, the game is merely about survival.  You will be minding your own business when suddenly mobs just start spawning in front, behind, above, and below you.  They hit, and they hit hard.  Worse yet, there's this difficulty timer on the screen that is slowly creeping up, almost mocking you as you die on ""Very Easy"" (for the record, I like the level named ""I SEE YOU"").  As it goes up, more things spawn; stronger things; scary things.  You die.  You retry.  As you practice - and let's be frank, you need to practice - the game starts unbuttoning its shirt for you, one button at a time, teasing the prize underneath.  You've noticed that the things you're picking up appear at the bottom of the screen in rows, all of them bestowing some kind of ability, some kind of assistance.  You're living a little longer.  You're braving the levels now, with a sense of purpose to get even MORE stuff to carry, each new item making you last that much longer, making you that much stronger.  You've maybe got a healing drone or some turrets following you to make life a little easier.  You've unlocked a piggy bank thing that allows you to buy even more chests to open.  Eventually you are marching across the maps, unburdened by the equivalent of a warehouse strapped to your back, an indestructible god of violent chaos and at your command, you can unleash a missile salvo or fire off the weapon that you stole from the boss whose face you now wear stretched across your head.  You reach the final boss and show him just what you've become and you relish that moment as the credits roll when you realize that it was all about the journey, not the end.But wait... you've hardly unlocked a thing.  You maybe have only one or two new characters now.  You don't have any monster logs.  Your item collection is missing a whole lot of boxes, some of which you can't even fill because you don't have some ability you've never seen before.  What's this row of artifacts that I can't choose?  Ah, that's what that cube of meat does?  I see, I see.  The purpose has now changed - it's all about discovery now.  The game has clearly told you that it has a lot of secrets to uncover and it whispers, ""Come find me."" You stop just surviving and now you're actually -looking- and the game is telling you that it's always been there in front of your face; a jump that's -just- a little too far, or a hole that's never been there before.  You start asking, ""How do I get there?"" and over and over again, you unravel a little more.  So you do it again.  And again.  And again.  And again...			"

												Risk of Rain is a mix of light 2D platforming, exploration, progression and combat. Each standard playthrough consists of up to 6 worlds the player can explore and fight their way around. Each level has one or two possible versions, and each version has one or two variations. You explore a pretty-looking environment to find the teleporter that takes you to the next level. While you roam around, different kinds of enemies spawn around you and try to give you the business. Killing them grants gold and XP, which lets you progress your character. XP levels you up, but the process is automatic so you really don't need to think about it very much. Gold, on the other hand, plays a much more impactful role, as it allows you to purchase items in a few ways. Every single source of items has a random element to it, even the ones that give you choices. Once you find the teleporter, you have to activate it then survive for a period of time while a boss and a ton of smaller mobs try to ruin your day. The boss always drops an item (sometimes an item you can't get anywhere else), though obviously randomized. The second to last teleporter also offers you the chance to warp back to stage one, albeit with all your items with you and the difficulty level maintained. What does that difficulty part mean? While Risk of Rain does have 3 difficulty options before you start a run, they don't act like you'd expect. Instead they affect how quickly difficulty rises within the game, among other things. Each playthrough starts at Very Easy and goes up as you take longer to finish the game. Each new difficulty level increases enemy spawn rate, how often elite versions of enemies spawn instead of regular ones and how often actual early-game bosses spawn instead too. This exists to give a player reason to not just camp one map for an eternity. Sooner or later, depending on their item RNG and skill, they will get overwhelmed by the silly number and strength of the hordes that spawn in to murder them. The last difficulty level is actually called ""HAHAHAHAHA"", which is just the best.Functionally, the game is pretty smooth. The sound design and music are enjoyable, fitting for the alien world atmosphere they set out to create. The art style is simple but vibrant, with a lot of pleasantly contrasting color choices. Flashy combat scenarios occur naturally throughout the course of a run. The controls are very simple and responsive, so it's easy to get into the game mechanically. I don't remember encountering any bugs, at least in singleplayer (more on that later). The player character occupies only a small piece of the screen but is big enough that it's very clear what's happening, at least until you wander into a horde of different enemies and they all start attacking, which can overwhelm you visually. The user interface very clearly displays all the information you need while playing, and I've never had problems with the in-game options.Next, there's a lot of item and character variety to be enjoyed. Item effects range from basic stuff like ""Increases overall movement speed"" to more noticeable boons like ""Enemies you kill turn into ghosts that work for you"" or ""A ridiculously huge laser appears every once in a while and slaughters everything caught in its path"". The harder the game gets, the more chances you get at scoring the really insane items, but it's still fundamentally a luck-based system, which obviously may turn some people away. Character choices actually affect your playstyle, as each fighter has different strengths and weaknesses. Some of them deal with small groups more easily, others move around more efficiently, others can one-shot bosses with a good item set. Every character has 4 abilities, the first of which is their basic attack. Usually a standard shot or punch. The other three tend to be more character-defining. One character can completely block damage from the front at the cost of movement speed, another has 3 extra movement options, some of them spawn allies to help, etc. All of this adds up to a considerable amount of replay value. Another feature that helps is Artifacts, which are treasures found in obscure corners of the maps or awarded after completing sometimes really vague challenges. These artifacts are unlocked as gameplay modifiers after you first find them and can completely alter how a run is played. From making enemies explode on death to letting you actually choose which items you get to spawning only elites, plus they can be combined. The artifacts are activated BEFORE a run starts so you don't mess up your run when you find one, and you're always given a choice of whether or not to use them. So what are the game's problems? The first depends on personal preference, but the game is filled with enough random elements to probably turn away people who hate not being in total control. If you can't stand the idea of even singleplayer games having things you cannot influence (except with that one artifact, which arguably makes the game too easy), Risk of Rain might not be for you. It doesn't help that some characters are much more item-dependent than others, like the Mercenary. Second, last I checked, multiplayer was a bug-infested hellhole of insanity. I played it with a friend, and whenever one of us would die, their UI would disappear forever until the next run. Not enjoyable, and that's just one issue we encountered.The third problem I see is with how fall damage is implemented. Yes, fall damage in a platformer might be counter-intuitive to some, but it has a place in games like this, since they value careful exploration and tactics. Thing is, you don't take enough damage. In my 80 or so hours of playing, I have never encountered a situation where I'm actually afraid a fall might kill me. Couple that with how falling into pits doesn't actually end the run right there and you have an element in the game that seems half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Finally, the game's replay value doesn't stretch out as long as you'd expect when you see how many items and characters it has. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of reasons to keep playing the game after beating it, and I mentioned this above, but it likely won't keep you coming back for as long as something like Binding of Isaac could. This is partly because most items don't immediately completely change the run, since their effects are usually only minor alterations to how you normally fight or move, through procs and mildly increased mobility. Extreme versions of some effects often require multiple acquisitions of the same item, since they stack. Artifacts help out a lot, but even that well dries up eventually and you may be left wanting more content. It would be nice to see more bosses and basic enemies added, or some sort of infinite survival mode with more maps tossed in, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Still, I consider Risk of Rain well worth the asking price. If you can snag it up on sale or as part of a bundle like I did, even better!			"

												Great fun and super addicting. Fast paced platformer and roguelike that makes you fight with increasing difficulty the longer you stand around. As you take longer to finish areas the difficulty increases adding more powerful enemies and upgraded bosses the longer it takes. It has a very similar item system to Binding of Isaac, in which you must unlock items by completeing certain tasks before they are available in the game. While there aren't achievements for ALL of these, the game has a listing in the menu telling you what you must do to unlock them, and the item pages give a short description over the padlock as well to show you what you need to unlock certain items. Starting now with 100 items to unlock and use, I am hoping we get a major update similer to Wrath of the Lamb and I suspect we will!The worlds are randomly generated as well, but I am not sure if this is infinite, or they have a finite nuber of designs at the moment. It is a 2D sidescroller instead of the overhead view of Isaac, but uses a lot of the same concepts. The game also adds a bit of lore to it with unlockable monster profiles that give you a great background on them and some funny dialog. The items also all have their own item cards with interesting infor and funny comments about them. You unlock several (10 total) new playable characters with completely different skills and abilities to play through the game giving it very nice replayability. While in Isaac you start with basic tears and small stat differences, each character in RoR has its own unique weapons and weapon abilities to start with regardless of what items you grab. The items enhance your character in many interesting and unique ways. Graphical style is very simple and may seem offputting at first, but it works fine and the pixel art is perfectly good. Don't disregard the game based on this!The only issue I had early was the default controls, which seemed to be designed for left handed players, but fortunately they ARE able to be rebinded to our preferneces and I did jsut that so I felt more comfortable. This is the next great Indie roguelike that is highly addicting, and totally worth the buy. I highly recommend it to fans of Binding of Isaac!The game has Achievements and trading cards. The Achievements I feel are a bit underwhelming, however and don't give the same sense of completion as the ones for Isaac did. Hopefully they will address this with further updates to offer more ideas and challenges with them. Not that it needs them to be a good game, but it expands the challenge having new ideas and challengs to achieve.			"

												10/10  With lightning fast (and charged) punches I destroy the ranks of innocent creatures trying to defend their home planet while I spew disease and se...m.. fire everywhere. Their blood heals me, their bodies explode in fire, parents along with children cannot escape my wrath.   As I walk through a wall of drones and lizardmen, fires light the sky as several oversized worms made of magma decend upon me. But this time, the sky had a blue haze. The overloading worm has come, and my time is at it's end.  //Pretty awesome game. My fiance has forced me to play this almost every day since this has come out, I managed to detour her for 2 weeks of Don't Starve then back to Risk. You can't beat the hours : price.I still haven't managed to beat the game using Miner, but you will have a point where you delete all your achievements and unlocks just to start barebones again and relive the suffering.

-Quick Review-...aaaaaand today's forecast is; a chance of explosions, with a side dish of pain, a little bit of agony, a whole lot of fun, and a Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is an platform indie game with many rogue-like elements. You unlock new characters and items, to help you through the game. The game is very fun and challenging, but if you want to make it to the end, you need to play smart and use your time wisely. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  There's not much to say about the story in this game, the description text explains that ""You are the sole survivor of a space train wreck"", however that is not the case if you're playing multiplayer; then you can have *four* survivors, but I digress. Game Play: There is a lot to say about the game play. Firstly, the controls are pretty simple, you have several attacks (all of which are different based on the character you're playing), you move to the left, right, and jump.There are numerous unlockables throughout the game, new characters and items. There are actually unlockables that you can only get with certain characters, so that keeps you playing and trying out new things.The game advertises itself as ""full of rogue elements"" and to a degree it's quite right, but there are some consistent factors: the first level is always the same, time continues to tick... the longer you play = the harder the game gets. Achievements: There are 15 achievements for this game. I suspect the reason I haven't written the review for this great game yet, because I... shamefully... haven't been able to unlock the last 3 achievements I need. (at this time: 4/16/15)There are only a few easy achievements that you unlock just by playing it, most achievements you will need to do something very specific. Be it, find a new character to unlock, or use a specific item on another specific item/NPC. Price:  Risk of Rain goes for $9.99, I personally waited for a sale (much to the frustration of my real life friends who wanted to play it with me)... but in the end that's a fair price for this game, based on how much time I've spent playing it. Conclusion: I've mused to myself in the past thinking ""I wonder if these older indie games will age differently then console or ROM games"". It seems like many indie games age well because they have unique-addictive-artistic-theme's to them.I absolutely recommend this game, it isn't one of those ""Rack up to 100 hours"" games for most people, but it is a fun change of pace from the other types of games out there. One final note: this game shines when it comes to multiplayer, playing on your own gets old, playing with friends feels like you're playing a classic arcade game with friends.			"

												Risk Of Rain is called the sidescrolling version of The Binding Of Isaac and it kinda is. But Risk Of Rain gives you multiple characters (all except one need to be unlocked first, however) and many skills to use, and more variety in its levels. And it can become quite challenging real fast. Enemies randomly spawn in the levels and you can use your skillset to take them down, earning you experience and gold. Unlock chests and buy items on your way to keep yourself from dying, because you *will* die. It's just a matter of time really. The items you find are randomly generated and are always useful. They have no negative effects (if they do it just depends on the total number of enemies walking around and the sort of level you are in). So the goal is to find as many as you can. Each level ends with a boss fight (or fights) which you, obviously, have to defeat. Once defeated you have to take out the remaining enemies before you can teleport to the next area. But, once you teleport you 'bank' your money, so you start from scratch again (your items will remain with you, of course). In the beginning you will probably last just several minutes, but once you unlock better items and characters these sessions will increase up to 45-60 minutes I guess. I haven't mentioned it yet, but you probably were already aware of it, and that's the fact that if you die, you have to start completely over. I love it !So, if you're into roguelikes give Risk Of Rain a try. It's definitely worth the risk.[Rating: 82/100]			"

												Can be turned into a hardcore Super Mario Brothers with enough headstompers and jetpacks10/10 - Would Grind more Headstompers.Okay, now seriously. This game is an 2D platformer shoot-'em-up with loads of Roguelike elements, and to tell the truth, it's an addictive hardcore game, and after over 100 hours, I still find myself enjoying this game (boy, what an year)The hours of dying may get you mad sometimes (Damn you Jellyfish!), but that it is purpose. Once you get used to the difficulty, you will find yourself enjoying this game much more, and it doesn't get old. I think it is really worth your time. There is even a online coop mode, where you and your friend go all the way trying to beat the game (even with all the bugs), and with the artifacts, you can turn the game into your own challenge. It is really that good, just like The Binding of Isaac.The game consist of you trying multiple times to reach a teleporter and advance to the next level, collecting items (usually randomly generated, if not for the use of one of the artifacts), which will eventually help you on your quest through out the game. The game also keeps you into it with unlockable characters and items, as well as the randomly generated levels. If lucky enough, you could turn into an rampaging god of death, killing every single enemy that come into your face, which I got to admit, it never gets old. The satisfaction of being so powerful and sort of unkillable just makes it more fun, and with a certain artifact which turns enemies into elite mobs only, it can turn into a very fun and hardcore challenge. I deeply recommend the game, as it's controls are easy; the game itself is easy to play, but hard to beat; A very worth and thought soundtrack; a simplistic but yet enjoyable and nostalgic artwork; High replay value; A good game to play in your free time, or to spend a weekend trying to beat; This is Risk of Rain, and welcome to your possible doom.Just buy it. You will have a good time.			"

												Punishing, but really enjoyable little rougelike with emphasis on fast paced action and easy to learn but difficult to master classes. Each class has it's own set of skills which will significantly change the way you play, but unfortunately only one (out of ten) is available from the start. As with most rougelikes; levels, items and enemies are procedurally generated and permadeath is enabled but game never feels unfair, since every playthrough offers something new. Due to it's difficulty and random nature it will require speed, precision and adaptability. Luckily there are a lot of items spread out around the level that will provide passive and active bonuses like increased rate of fire or various status effects, as well as more interesting ones which I'm not going to spoil since discovering new item and monster log entries will be your main source of accomplishment in early stages of the game. However as you unlock more drops and get familiar with each class, things will get easier. This is the point where time becomes your biggest enemy (well...besides all the other big enemies). Game implements a timer in the upper right corner that will gradually increase difficulty as time passes, forcing you to find a balance between becoming more powerful and just getting to the next level with all your bits intact. It provides a nice compromise, keeping a challenging gameplay, but still providing the feeling of controling an unstopabble killing machine. There are some problems on the technical side, like the occasional but gut-wrenching crash that will erase your progress and leave you sobbing, unresponsive controls in menus (especially if you're using gamepad) and problems with online co-op conectivity and Steam achievements. I would also be amiss not to mention brilliant sountrack and appealing pixel art.All in all, in a sea of rougelikes this one manages to stand on it's own, providing responsive shooting mechanics, hordes of different enemies and items and a great balance between frustrating and adrenaline-pumping gameplay. A great value  for money.			"

												Risk of Rain might appeal to gamers who thrill over the challenge set forth by games like Demon’s Souls or FTL: Faster Than Light, but the uninitiated will find Risk of Rain hard to approach.Risk of Rain is a survival shooter featuring interesting mechanisms, where you will have to make quick decisions.The game is a lot of fun. Though it is held back by its technical faults , it has the right stuff to elicit the ""just one more run"" response that roguelike games are known for. With a little more polish, it could be truly great.Incredible work went into the design of almost every element of Risk of Rain, shame that the gameplay couldn't have been more inspired. [In the interest of accommodating it all, the awful maximum resolution and the tiny sprites are just about excused.			"

												Don't let the old-school ultra-simple graphics deceive you, the gameplay is very modern and so are the mechanics (even if you can only shoot left and right and not up, etc). The game takes place on different planets, you are simply trying to get home. You must fight your way through thousands of alien/monster creatures. But how? There are a multitude of power-ups that you pick up and stack along your journey. You do feel more powerful and powerful in time but that is the downfall, as soon as you become comfortable, you will make a grave mistake and the game will eat you alive.I haven't played co-op yet, playing single player is lonely until you get a companion drone which helps heal you or shoots enemies with you. The game is hard to put down, it's simple and easy enough to understand but hardcore at the same time. At first I hated how small and far away everything is but I have grown to love everything about the game. Strange, creepy soundtrack fits the sci-fi unknown space theme.Clever. Very clever little indie game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun action platformer with roguelike elemented Game.There are several optainable Items in this Game. If you see a item and if you have enough Money, buy it. You can have hundreds of items at the same time and get op. But only in your selected Difficulty. If you change the difficulty it gets hard. Really hard.It gets worse, when you dont have ""Drop Luck / ITem Luck"" and just get Trash.Its more fun when you play the Game in Multiplayer / Co-op. Game is pretty tough and huge. Bosses can be a challenge. :)You can even can unlock new Characters to play (Sniper for example)Its funny!*RECOMMENDED*			"

												One of the best Indie Games i ever played.Its a rogue-like game with a simple and short Story.You have a Cargo Ship which get shot,crashing on a mysterious Planet with one Survivor,you.At the beginning i didnt understand what to do,i was running and running,killing monsters till i got it.You start with one Character and find various Items with different effects.Theres alot of Items and Characters you have to unlock by doing tasks (killing enemies,collecting specific things or by simply finding them).The Levels are changing thanks to the rogue-like elements and so is the Experience.The longer you play a map,the more items you collect and the longer is the Run.Sometimes a run can go up to 2 hours or longer,it depends on you.You can set the difficulty by adding Relics which affects you,the maps and the enemy.I can recommend this game for any casual player or bored one.I bought this Game due a Sale,i dont regret it.

												I like this game, a lot. I know it’s not as polished as it could be. I know sometimes it glitches and you fall through the world. I know that having pixel for pixel really messes with camera placement and allows you to see past where the level was really meant to be viewed. I know it’s not perfectly balanced, and has ‘easy win’ strategies. However, I like this game. It’s challenging, it’s fun, it’s addicting. Playing as the different characters increases longevity, challenge artifacts increase longevity, and achievements increase longevity. The soundtrack has a very nice sound to it, it just exudes a kind of charm that I enjoy. Coming back to play a game or two every now and again is fun, I do recommend it if it looks like you'd enjoy it.			"

												Highly addicting platfomer roguelike game ! The attention to smalest pixel details put into this game is awesome. You see from the animation of it especially the characters.*Character OptionsThere are different options of character that you can play and unlock along with your progress in game. Different character has different style of owning the game.*LootingLoot is the main element in this game, as you progress you can unlock even more loot. More and more until you become a demi-god , or not at all and you will die is shame.You die once and you start over from zero, while actualy you only need to finish 6 level ,which you will only be able to get through by dying over and over again until you can beat the game. And you can never have enough of it. Trust me.*AtmosphereThe music is good . It suits well with the game experience and overall character. The atmosphere of foreign planet and the mood of playing space-alien like game.*DificultiesAnother main aspect of this game is also that the dificulties will increase along with the time you play the game from the begining. So if you are not fast enough to gain level or loot, and the dificulties increase , be ready to have a really hard time.*Co-opThe good thing from Co-op is that you can owned the game with your friends. As much friend as you can , but the cons is that you have to share the amount of loot you get and that means you have to share your strength that you usually get when you play SOLO (where you can greedily have your own loot). But anyway playing this game with friends is really addicting.I am really hoping to see another sequel of this game if it were to be made . And i believe everybody will feel the same too.			"

												As one of my favorite games, Risk of Rain is highly recommended.Most modern gamers will be confused by the graphic, but honestly if this game is built 2.5D in Cry Engine your game will crash so bad, my point: the gameplay is the most important part you should be looking at. Risk of Rain can be very addicted, everytime you start from the beginning with default data and you work your way to become a badass and with the new (kind of new) artifacts system, this game generate so much varieties that I can not count. Basically you chose one of the unique characters blaze through every stage and stock items, level up and build up your character and the objective is to beat the final stage. One of the main features is the game's difficulty, it grows as the time pass. A decent gameplay management is required as the game can be tough to beat for a new player. RoR will keep surprising you with new contents (characters, items) that you will unlock, varieties tend to increase as you explore more. Which keep a well loop and create a high 'replayability'. RoR also contains several small secrets waiting for you to discover.I have seen people complaining about the multiplayer experience, which was tough to me as well. Since the developers of RoR are independent developers, a server can be luxury indeed. Simply learn how to port forwarding will be enough to host. No hamachi required, I can prove it myself but who ever is hosting need a decent internet efficiency. Despite lack of official server (some people actually host servers look it up), RoR is a pick up and play, rogue like action game, with very intriguing item and character design, and it is constantly updating. I can't illustrate how frustrated I feel when the game beat me and some ironic words pop out mocking my failure, or how awesome and satisfied it can be, when I beat the game with tons of items I collected. In other word RoR provide really nice difficulty options where things can get nasty require you to pay some attentions in order to beat it, or you can just sit back, relax, enjoy the show.If you are available to play co-op, co-op is not too different from single player, which just add some additional chaos on your screen. The soundtrack in RoR is another feature to enjoy, musics in the background certainly polish the game into a another level it is simply astonishing and perfect. You can find all the little details proving that there are people (devs) who care about their games, and it is tons of fun when you are relaxing and reading some introductions of the item you've been using in the game, as well as the monster logs. Sometimes the game can crash if data overloaded (because it's the nature of the game), or some minority bugs happen to get in your way but overall RoR is a must-have game, and trust me you need to go deeper to witness the sorrow of the rain.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 2016/11/24It has been years when this game released. I really hope for a series or a huge update, from the bottom of my heart I wish these devs don't cool down this game. At last I hope RoR can get a reward.			"

Product received for free
												After getting 100% achievement completion, I still feel like I suck at this game.This game is hard for all the right reasons; you may feel limited at first (given how everything in this game is in-game achievement locked), but the game starts you out with the easiest-to-use character and a basic set of simple items that help ease you into how things work. The game says that it won't save your scores on the easy difficulty, but what it doesn't tell you is that you can still unlock things on the easier difficulty. Use this to your advantage and play on easy until you think you've gotten a feel for how the game handles (as well as unlocking a few things in the process), then put the game back on its regular difficulty setting and proceed to get obliterated in a brutal fashion. For extremely skilled players (or masochists), there's even a hard difficulty setting, as well as collectible 'artifacts' that can be toggled to make the game even harder (or easier in a few cases). This game is completely playable without a guide. However, should one feel inclined to seek advice (which is very likely), there are many helpful guides written by other players that go in detail about combat strategies, how to unlock things, and even just general advice for beginners and veteran players alike.In conclusion, Risk of Rain is a 2D platformer where you're constantly fighting for your life while scavenging the land for items that passively improve your combat abilities in every way, ultimately reaching the end where the final boss is the only thing standing in your way between you and freedom. Good luck.			"

												First you die fighting ocean bugs.Then flying robot bugs.But after 50 hours, your greatest enemies are the bugs in the code.- Bugs/10 -On a more serious note, this game is one of my favorite rogue-lites. A very fun and challenging game, though you *might* have to deal with some annoying bugs, including:1) the occasional crash2) getting stuck in the ground until you mash enough buttons to escape . . .These glitches don't seem to happen to everyone, but be mentally prepared just incase.I think this game is worth $10 but it's often on sale for $2.50, so I highly recommend it if you're into the genre.

												Risk of Rain, a great rogue-like filled with action packed fun that gets harder as time progresses. Each level has different kinds of mob spawns depending on the region/map type. Difficult , but not impossible, to beat solo. Great co-op play. The artifact system brings you back and alters each playthough heavily.Pros:-Runs on potatoes (lower fps on co-op due to explosions/extra rendering)-Great soundtrack-Great controlls-Large character selection and unlocking new characters-Replayability is good, but semi repetative if you're bad at unlocking characters.Cons:-More expensive than your mom-Difficult to stay alive as certain classes (Git Gud)-Co-Op doesn't have servers to connect to, making finding a co-op partner slightly harder.Graphics/Artwork: 9/10Sound/Audio: 9.5/10Controlls/Mechanics: 8/10Replayability: 7.5/10Overall: 9/10 gud game.

												Risk of rain is a simplistic yet intruiging indie game with a lot to it. It's minimalist approach to a rogue-like is unique. Risk of Rain's seemingly simple exterior leaves you with a burning passion to explore every thing this piece has to offer. It's cruel, that's for sure, but this game is extremely fun, especially when you pace yourself and ensure that you're taking your time to get everything right. There's a number of playable characters, each offering their own way of playing this gem. Some of the unlocks, however, aren't the clearest on how it is to be done, leaving you with the shame of having to resort to the internet to find out what's next. Overall, Risk of Rain is an austere piece of somewhat savage software that'll lure you in with it's gorgeous art style and strike you with it's moderately high difficulty curve. For any fans of the rogue-like genre, this is a definate pick-up.			"

												I highly recommend Risk of Rain - very fun roguelike featuring several classes with four abilities each, difficult scaling up based on time played per run ( do I collect loot and make next level harder or rush to keep the last level easier ) , up to four player co op, wonderful art style, and killer sound track. My only note of warning is that it takes a little getting used to on the keyboard vs a game pad.  To expand a bit on the class options, here are three examples:Commando: First class everyone has access to, others are unlocked as you play and progress, find them in levels, or unlock achievements. Basic attack is a ""double tap"" shot with his pistol and other abilities are: piercing knock back burst of bullets, a roll that lets you escape / pass through enemies quicikly, and his ""ultimate "" ( longer cd then rest ) ability is a rapid fire of abilites that stun nearby enemies.Enforcer: Very stocky character. His basic attack is a short range shot gun blast then he also has a shield slam that knocks enemies back, a defensive stance that blocks all damage from a certain direction, and his ultimate type ability is a stun grenade.Bandit: Basic attack is a normal rifle blast. Has a dynamite toss ability that does aoe damage, a smoke bomb that stealths him and stuns when he comes out of stealth, and his ultimate is a big headshot that does oodles of damage and resets his other abilities if it kills an enemy.It's a really fun system to me rather than Rogue Legacy where your abilities are like magic and auto attack. Some of the other classes include a sniper, engineer fellow with turrets and missiles, an acid beast, and more!			"

												I honestly can't say much about this game. It seems to be more of a niche game because if you like it you love it and if you don't you hate it. The game requires you to either be good right off the bat, which I doubt everyone will be able to be, or it requires you to run through the game several times before you can actually play it. The game uses an unlocking system similar to the binding of issac, except there are not as many items in risk of rain which leads to a problem of item balance. Because of the 30-60 Items, I don't honestly remember, the ones near the end add a lot of power to your run, however the ones near the beginning are rather basic, and don't get you very far. you also do not unlock the characters ight away which leaves you to only play as the Mercenary to try and unlock anyting. which in my opinion is the worst to play because you can't move and shoot like some other classes.The game has a frustrating starting system but endgame its very enjoyable to play.Personally if I was back at the start I would download a 100% game file and play it, although you won't unlock anything it would be like playing an arcade game for a higher score, with the sort-of-random worlds it won't get old fast.Music is great (if you can get it to work common bug where the music will not play at first, when fixed it's fixed forever though.)Difficulty scale is great.Etc etc. /RantStory: X/10 (Is there one, I haven't noticed.)Gameplay: 10/10 Presentation: 10/10 Soundtrack: 9/10 (good not great)Replayability: 6/10 (it might happen. one day. offline.)

												I went into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the name, the cover art, and that it was an RPG rougelike. I've now invested over twenty hours into it and after I finish this review I'm probably going to go play more. Risk of Rain is addictive. That's the word I've found myself describing it most as. It hits the perfect sweetspot of challenge, luck, and skill. There's a visceral sense of empowerment- every time you collect a new upgrade, you actively feel stronger. All the visual effects that pop up coupled with seeing your inventory stack along the bottom creates this really unique sense of progression, as eventually- with a bit of luck- you can reach a point where absolutely everything you touch is obliterated in a miasma of fire, metal, and spirituality. The upgrades are all nice and varied, every single one having a unique effect such as adding a new type of damage or a chance to fire an additional projectile or a new way to heal yourself. It's not like other rougelikes such as Binding of Isaac where there are a lot of items that drastically change how you play- all of them just add effects and bonuses, making you into a walking powerhouse that just gets bigger and badder as time goes on. A typical run will be about an hour if you're going for straight completion to several if you're like me and go back to replay the earlier levels and stack as much gear as possible. The game gets crazier and crazier as you level up, and if you make it that far I recommend trying it at least once. I also recommend playing with a controller- the keyboard controls work for the early levels, but once things pick up it's too cumbersome to recommend. The levels do get a bit bland, as the layouts are reused and the environments are pretty but don't make much difference. The soundtrack is solid and atmospheric, and the art direction is absolutely top-notch. The writing is worth note, too- the descriptions of the items and monster logs have a personality I wasn't expecting. I got excited every time I found something new because I couldn't wait to read up on its history. And any game where I can feel a serious, grave attatchment to a protagonist who just weaponized a ukulele can be called a literary success. If you like RPGs, buy Risk of Rain. It's dirt cheap, and has that special feeling of leveling up in spades. All the characters are wildly different and change up the core strategy in really unique ways, and there's tons to discover and unlock. It's some of the most fun I've had with any video game lately and I'm absolutely smitten.			"

												Ever feel like you have time to kill? Got something downloading in the background that's taking longer than it should and you are in need of entertainment? Watched all your favourite channels new vids on youtube? Tired of seeing bottle flip compilations and need something else in your life? Well, my friends, I think you've found a good investment right here.Risk of Rain, a rogue like, combat based platformer which pits your character on a planet as they scrape together junk in attempts to fight for their life. Now, sounds strange from my generalisation, but theres more to it.You don't get to determine what gear is thrown at you, the game picks for you, and you have to deal with it. (without in game modifiers, that is.) Each playthrough on vanilla settings is completely different, as the items you recieve can change how you approach the game. The items provided lean toward either offensive or defensive gameplay, by either granting you increased damage, lifesteal or gold income, or providing damage reduction, ""overshield"" or an aura of barbed wire, because why not. Utility items are also included, which are things like increased movement speed, auto gold generation, and increased amounts of jumps. There are plenty more different stat augments that I will let you discover for yourself.A thing I mentioned earlier, modifiers. These can be found in each of the levels Risk of Rain provides, usually requiring a puzzle to be solved, or a jump course, or maybe even just extreme cheese strats. If vanilla is getting rough, or maybe too predictable, turn some of these on, and you can find yourself mowing down everything in your path while only being allowed to take one hit maximum, or make it so the game hates you entirely. Another thing which I think is particularly interesting, is the difficulty mechanic. Risk of Rain has no set difficulty, but instead, a system based on how long you take in game. The difficulty increases the longer it takes you to find your way around, and the rate at which this increases can be adjusted in the form of three difficulties on the character select screen. No matter which setting you pick, the game will grow more challenging as you take longer to get through.TL;DR A great game to kill time with, and even something to spend a decent amount of time on as you mess around with different playthroughs as you pit your luck against the random drop system. The different characters and game modifiers allow you to see what kind of crazy things you can achieve, ranging from running around at the speed of sound, jumping up to asgard itself, or decimating anything that takes a millisecond to look at you. Extremely worth the money while it's on sale, and even when it isn't, I'd say you can find enjoyment out of it. The soundtrack is also nice. Give it a go, won't you?EDIT: forgot to add that if you want to play multiplayer, you will need LogMeIn Hamachi or a similar program. LogMeIn Hamachi is a free download, but it is true that there is better software out there, so you might want to explore a bit.			"

												This used to be one of my favorite multiplayer games. I've purchased multiple copies for friends, who have in turn purchased copies for other friends. Unfortunately the current version (1.2.4) is near unplayable due to the presence of a zillion bugs that were introduced when the developers updated the engine. The devs have been all but silent since 1.2. The last post on the development blog was over a month and a half ago.Current bugs include (but are certainly not limited to):*If you are playing online mutiplayer and get to the last level, all clients will crash.*All abilities are supposed to do random amounts of damage, and little random ""damage numbers"" pop up over enemies' heads, but as you can see by watching boss's health bars when you attack them, the numbers are lies and you are actually doing the exact same amount of damage with every shot.*Sometimes you will get stuck one pixel below the platform that you are supposed to be standing on, and you'll never be able to move again.If you want to read more horror stories, simply check out the Risk of Rain forums at http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?forums/general-discussion.88/ , where pretty much all the discussion right now is centered on ""Why is this game still being sold while it's so broken?"" and ""Where the hell are the devs?""I'd love to support this game again. It was a lot of fun. But right now it's sort of scammish that it's even being sold.			"

												Risk of Rain is a rogue-like that offers a few interesting twists on the genre, but utlimately this game doesn't give the player a compelling reason to keep going back into the rain-stained void.  I'm going to keep this short and just discuss the two main design errors that kept me from enjoying this game.       The first strike against this game is that it has a very skewed difficulty skewing.  As time progresses in Risk of Rain, the enemies grow in numbers and strength.  The early portion of this timer makes for an exciting experience that forces the player to formulate a careful balance between farming and progressing through the initial levels.  If the scaling maintained this logical, linear progression, Risk of Rain would be brilliant.  The problem is that near the end of the timer enemy statistics are hyper-inflated to the point where the game becomes slow, dull, and almost impossible to survive.  No matter how lucky or unlucky one is in their item drops, eventually they will reach a point where progress is slowed to a crawl due to insanely inflated HP pools and huge damage numbers.  Here's the critical reason why this is so bad: Risk of Rain is a game about kiting.  You must be able to whittle the horde as you kite across sections of each map, and when you can't effectively kill anything after multiple loops, things go badly.  Difficulty can be punishing yet rewarding, or it can be merely punitive.  Risk of Rain's difficulty starts as the former but quickly morphs into the latter.  Either the enemies need to be slowed in their evolution, or the player needs better scaling ratios.     The other problem with the game is that a large portion of the character kits are badly designed for the engine in which they inhabit. Risk of Rain is a game mostly about kiting, but only a few of the characters' kits are actually able to do this with any efficacy.  The varying roster brings a welcome diversity to the game, but any initial excitement about new characters quickly begins to fade once the player begins to realize that only about three characters are actually worth playing when attempting more difficult and longer runs.  The developers seemed to have forgotten that the game requires constant kiting, and as a result you'll find throughout character diversity many kits that inhibit or restrict one's ability to kite, and the damage compensation for the restricted movement isn't nearly enough to make it worth the sacrifice.  The Huntress is an example of a character that is designed with the game's core mechanics in mind.  Her speed, fast cooldowns, and movement are unparalleled, and playing this character augments all of the postive aspects of the game.  Kiting the flood of enemies is a rush and most mistakes can be assigned to player error. The Bandit is an example of a poorly designed character -- weak mobility, long cooldowns, and no true edge in damage.  The Bandit either would need more movement or much higher damage ratios to be a character that is worthwhile.  Perhaps many would argue that they enjoy this hieratic approach to character rosters -- and some might even enjoy the extra challenge of a poorly designed character -- but I would have liked to seen multiple playstyles designed around the mobility required in Risk of Rain.      There's a few other problems with the game, but those are the two main things that kept me from going back to it.  The initial struggle of balancing farming v. progression was addicting and compelling, but this experience was quickly ruined by an atrociously designed end-game.  The thrill of unlocking characters, too, was diminished once one understood that only three have well designed kits. It's an interesting game that will be exciting for a few hours, but if you've played other Rogue-likes, you'll soon see the design errors that hold it back from true greatness.			"

Risk of Rain could have been just another action rogue-like. What truly sets it apart is the inclusion of a time-based difficulty meter, which turns it into a rather intense survival game.The goal of every level is as follows: look for a giant shiny red teleporter, then trigger it and survive waves of enemy spawns for a set amount of time (90 seconds on Normal mode). After the timer runs out, kill any remaining opponents and you can finally teleport to the next level. When you've completed five levels, you're given the option to teleport to the final stage or to revisit the previous ones.This simple concept forces you to constanly find the right balance between rushing and exploring: you want to make the most of every level in terms of upgrades, but hang around for too long and the ever-increasing difficulty meter will make you pay. A typical playthrough can last an hour or more; and if you happen to die, no extra lives or continues: you're starting over.The rogue-like elements are on point, with dozens of interesting items to discover and unlock as well as twelve character classes with very specific gameplay twists. Once unlocked, you can also choose to enable up to ten artifacts which alter the gameplay in a significant way. While not fully randomized, each stage has several different possible layouts which ensures every playthrough feels somewhat different.A huge selling point for me was the option to play the game in local/online coop. Couch coop is great fun and quite playable, only requiring the players to stay relatively close to each other. Online coop gives the players more freedom and, for the most part, works very well; however, certain items (Chargefield) and possibly characters have a tendency to cause game-ending crashes.This brings me to the flaws of Risk of Rain: a somewhat less polished technical side seems to be causing consistent problems for some users. Aside from very minor issues, it has been totally fine on my end (and the same goes for my friends), but I would definitely recommend testing the game as soon as you purchase it, and being ready to request a refund if you can't get it to work. A couple other nitpicks: the interface is rather bland and the platforming - not a huge part of the game, thankfully - can be infuriating. On a more positive note again, the pixel art is quite decent, and the lore that unfolds through the monster and item logs paints a convincing universe. Last but not least, the soundtrack is amazing - whether you end up playing the game or not, you'll definitely want to check it out if you enjoy nice things.tl;dr: a great blend of (hardcore) rogue-like and survival to enjoy on your own or with selected friends. Excellent replay value for the price.			"

												Risk of Rain is a wonderful game about destruction, and annihilating everything in the player's path.Your goal is to simply kill and grind your way to each level's teleporter which will spawn a challenging boss, so you can go onto the next level, rinse and repeat.It's a slow start, but once you reach the third level (which proves to be quite difficult for some, including myself) you become a demi-god. Watch as each bullet releases 15 homing missiles, which set your oponent on fire. As your enemies die they might become a ghost, only to fight by your side, releasing magical orbs that disintegrate the next.Personally it reminded me of the oldschool Ratchet and Clank games, arriving on the planet, Kill everything with big guns. Good times.I giv dis gaem 7/10. A good passtime, and repititive if anything.			"

												Action Platformer + Rogueliike elements = Risk of Rain, ""Time consuming yet rewarding, keyboard/gamepad smashing fun!""Pros:-To start off the classes are all different which makes them unique, picture this ten different classes that each provide a different way to take on your journey through your fight on a mysterious planet. -Now throw in a bunch of items (100+) which mix up/throw off your game? Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Depending on which items you get you could have a easy time playing or a difficult time playing.-A whole new game every time you click that start game button on the menu screen.Cons:-Some of the achievements for both the characters and for steam require some bit of coop (makes it difficult for those who don't have a internet connection)-Coop is a bit weird (requires an outside program to host servers for example: evolve, hamachi)All in all, Risk of Rain is a very time consuming game that rewards the player for their handwork and struggle through the mysterious planet. I must say that for the price it's listed at currently $9.99, it is totally worth it and I would recommend that if you have $10 lying around to pick it up and give it a try!			"

												Awesome with friendsAwesome aloneAwesome on keyboardAwesome with controllerThis game will suck your time out and make your fingers hurt from smashing that attack button because obviously you hit harder when you press harder. And don't question the story this game tells in the background if sanity and peace of mind is what you like. Really, don't go deep into it. You'll never think of those poor Lemurians the same way you did before.			"

												Disclaimer: Not everything in this Review is said on a serious note. Some things are jokes and I hope these are obvious enough.Risk of Rain fails for me as a actual Rougelike. Not that it cannot be classified as one, but the feeling overall just does not fit. If you are here and expect a game that is fast and deadly, dont buy this game. This game relies purely on you, how you react ingame and how fast you can spam the jump button. Risk of Rain, is a platformer based on the roguelike concept. Your main task is to find a teleporter to reach the next world. And this task continues in said world, until you reach the end. In these worlds themself you will have to fight aliens that teleport in, sent in by the villain (or at the very least that is my theory as to how they get there).  These aliens then drop experience and currency. Currency which you can use on the various crates and shrines. Even random cryostasis chambers are there to provide you with items, should you have the currency for it. And if you should find a broken drone, it can be repaired with your currency just as well.But of course that is not all to the game. The crates, shrines and stasischambers contain items that, similar to ""The Binding of Isaac"" give you passiv and active abilities. Some allow you to gain health while damaging your enemies. Others  will make your overall health grow as you kill. Then again another ability grants you a double jump. And here comes the best about this: The abilities can stack when you find the same item you carry with you. A double jump transforms into a triple jump. You gain more health when you damage enemies. You get more max health when you kill. But of course, these are just the buffs. There are items you can use activly in combat. One of my personal favorites is the saw-blade. It does a massive amount of damage and can kill entire lines of enemies in one shot, in the earlier stages of the game.But now the game gets hard. Actually, it is hard from the get go. You look at the little bar on the top right and you see your impending doom slowly but surely rising to the top. Why? Because this game does it differently to others. Of course, you can choose between easy, medium and hard. But these only depict as to how hard the enemies are to kill and how many of them will spawn (and how fast they spawn). And this only gets worse the longer you play. As the longer you play, the difficulty rises. It begins with a stroll in the park and ends up in hell. And there is no way to avoid it, unless you do a speedrun of the game. Which is also not that easy as the teleporter is randomly generated on the pre-set worlds. Knowing how the world looks may help, but not knowing where the teleporter is, does not. And in the end it is a literally a maze where one turn can let you end up in a place that throws you out and you need to continue to search for the right path all over again.And as if it wasnt enough already that the game gets harder by the minute, that the landscape is kind of like a maze and that the teleporter spawns randomly, there are bosses as well. And they are not easy to kill. They can move and attack, just like the regular enemies can. Some are easy to cheesy (or in other words; Some cant get up a ledge and can be killed from above without being able to attack you.) and others will simply fly towards you to get the kill. Others have an AOE to make sure that you are not safe on that elevated platform of yours and others again will be able to teleport towards you to kill you right quick.But if you have done it all, gotten through all the teleporters, you will end up in the main ship. The one you were dropped off of in a capsule. And here is the main villain as well. But how do you reach him? Do the same thing you did before, but this time a bit different. Instead of finding the teleporter, you need to find the keypads infront of the doors. This will then again spawn in a bunch of enemies and at this point in time, surely a few bosses as well. And if you made it through all of it: The grand finale awaits.- Authors Note -Why did I say that this game fails as a Roguelike for me even if it can be classified as one?I experienced Roguelike games, and love them dearly. But one aspect was very important every time. And that little aspect is: You are never safe. But of course this is way to broad so let me explain:In the very flagships of Roguelike, which are ""The Binding of Isaac"": ""Enter the Gungeon"" and ""Nuclear Throne"", you could die as quick as you began to play the game, if you were not carefull enough. Die and lose it all, at any given point in time. The gameplay was quick, had you on your toes at all times possible and killed you as fast as it could. One of the most important things was that it didnt, unless you had found an ability or a health pack, give you any health back. A little detail that makes the games much harder and challenging.But in Risk of Rain this does not stand true. The very first thing that makes a roguelike, a rougelike is that you are never safe unless you cleared out the room or floor. In Risk of Rain however you can activate the teleporter, let the enemies spawn until its done and if you feel overwhelmed you can rope up and take a break and wait until your health returns to charge right back into battle.And that is what bores me about this game. I played all three of the mentioned Roguelikes and I have been frustrated. The more I played them, the more I raged. The more I failed, the more I wanted to wish hell and death on the devs for creating this piece of garbage. But after I calmed down I loved every second of what I experienced it. I guess I am a gaming masochist but still. And that is something, this game does not provide.This game is a stroll in the park no matter how high your difficulty is. You can get out of every situation with literally every character. The first one is actually the easiest. A dodgeroll helps you get out of the situation with immunity frames, you go up the rope and Boom: You are safe. But in a true Roguelike, you are never safe. You are never free from simply dodging damage unless it has to do with you actually dodging the damage. Which is absolutely possible in a 2D topdown roguelike. But not in 2D platformer roguelike. Only if you actually spam jump or dodgeroll, you can get out with no damage at all.So, do I think that Risk of Rain is a good game?- YesDo I think that Risk of Rain is a good Roguelike?- NoShould you buy it?- Yes			"

												Let me just start by saying that this game is AWESOMEAt it's heart, the game is an action platformer with a very old school feel.   There a few new school elements, the most obvious one being the item system.  If you have played Binding of Issac, this will be immediately familiar to you.  You acquire items that passively make your character more powerful throughout the game by using currency and defeating bosses.  This system is incredibly well done:  Almost all the items make an impact, yet there is nothing that feels overtly broken.  Even items that do not have an immediate, obvious application are revealed to be very powerful when paired with certain other item combinations or characters.The genius of the game really reveals itself as you unlock new characters.  There a few that feel like they are there as a novelty, but outside of those one or two, they are very well made with distinctly different feel and strategies.  The characters function similarly to ARTS characters with different base stats and 4 distinct moves all mapped to a different button.  Once again, it was shocking to me how much the game changed when using different characters.  It seems strange to say, but I was not expecting that level of depth. A lot of people will play the game for the carrot-on-a-stick nature of the unlocks, and the siren call of actually trying to beat the game.  Even after these tasks are accomplished, however, the game never really loses its appeal.  Having an amazing run and going through the entire game (which usually takes an hour or so) is just as satisfying the 10th time as it was the first.  When you start off, the notion of getting to the 3rd level can seem daunting, let alone beating the game.  The games learning curve can be somewhat steep, but when you come over the rise of competancy, you will really appreciate how robust the pacing, item system, characters and scaling difficulty of the game is.   Was an absolute joy ride from start to finish. 8.3/10			"

												This one got under my skin, especially once I discovered a character that resonated with my play style.It's a hard game, and you'll spend a lot of time failing. Sometimes due to lack of skill or coordination, and sometimes due to randomness working against you.But when it works, and especially when you find a character that you enjoy playing, man...it'll take you far.

												Forgot to review this game: It's a pretty hard game with various of characters to choose from with their own unique abillities. You get money from killing mobs and with that money you can buy random generated items or open chests for items to get stronger with unique abillities. The game gets harder the longer you're playing it so don't slack off and get going!			"

												Risk of Rain is a frantic, fast-pased platforming/action game with a relatively short story and a HUGE degree of random variance. Playing as one of several characters (all ""crew members"" of a crashed delivery spaceship), you fight your way through mobs of enemies, relying on both skill and powerups scattered throughout stages to survive. These powerups are insanely random, each granting you an often-ridiculous bonus. Some are crazier than others, and many are so powerful or stupid that I can't even begin to describe them here. What's important, in my opinion, is that they're all fun to pick up. ...and you'd better be picking them up frantically, because the game's difficulty scales with time. The longer you take on a stage, the longer you dawdle trying to find treasure chests or shops with powerful items in them, the more powerful enemies will be on this stage and the next. The longer you spend fighting, in other words, the tougher the fighting becomes.A successful game of Risk of Rain usually lasts anywhere from about 40 to 60 minutes. The powerups on any given level vary wildly between playthroughs. The levels themselves can have multiple layouts and multiple styles. All of the characters--even the immediately-unlocked ""Commando""--collectively provide a large number of different ways to make it to the next teleporter or die trying. In the end, the game is a crazy race against time to acquire powerups, kill enemies, and ultimately (hopefully) fight the final boss with a nonsensical menagerie of gear. This is without a doubt one of the most addicting games I've ever played. I highly recommend it.			"

												To call this game ""2D Binding of Isaac"" is to only scratch the surface, to get a vague grasp of what this game has to offer. Yes, it is somewhat like The Binding of Isaac in that there's things trying to kill you and items that make them less able to kill you, but  in my opinion, that's where the similarity ends. There's no unfairness or fake difficulty; much like Dark Souls, every death is your fault. You didn't move fast enough, you didn't time your dash skill, you didn't w/e. Every death in this game is a learning experience as you struggle for life on the hellhole planet you're stranded on. There's always something new in each playthrough, new nuances to learn, item combinations you happen upon, set in a constantly frantic, desperate struggle of you vs. the hordes.By far one of the funnest games I've ever played.

												:DISCLOSURE:  I received a copy for the purpose of review. That in NO way affects the outcome of this review. If a game is crap IMO I will say so. Thank you Steamified.Risk of Rain is an intense rogue like. The game play is fantastic classic 8/16 bit platformer action. You have four abilities to aid you in the journey of survival. Twelve different characters you can play. Three game modes that scale well, the easiest of which does not allow the saving of progress. Combine all this with TONS of items that offer passive and on use advantages. The item combos can get crazy, like in The Binding of Issac. AND if you get more than one of an item it will stack. This game is great if you have only 15min to play or 5 hours to play. Easy to pick up and get the hang of, but difficult to master no doubt. If you are new to rogue like games this is a great intro to the genre. Overall I would rate this game 8/10. It is a must play for any rogue like fan.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2d platform rogue-like shooter with an increasing difficulty level that goes up according to time spent while playing: the longer your session - the harder it gets.Prepare to die. A lot.The game is not as easy as one might expect.Right off the bat you are put in a situation where a space cargo ship, UES Contact Light, in which you happen to be in, crashes on a hostile planet.You have 12 characters, all of which require you to do specific objectives ingame (beat the game on the hardest difficulty level, kill 3 specific bosses, obtain specific item combination.)Each character packs a four pack of abilities (So you will find the one that suits you)At the begining you have your first, already unlocked character - The Commando (My favourite of the whole shebang).A very versatile character that can handle most situations flawlessly.While playing, you collect items, scattered through chests that fell off the ship and shrines, that can require either your health or your money.Every item is a unique game changer. One can place fungus that heals you if you stand still for a few seconds, one amplifies your shots with bonus explosive damage, one can stop time when your health goes to a critical level and one item even gives you a second chance in case you die.The more items you get, the more powerful you become, and if you stack up items ( get more and more of the same one) the effect and amplification level increases (although some items have a limit on how many times the effect will improve).At the end of the game, each character has a different outcome. (They are really spine-chillin if you think of em afterwards) Here's the one of the Commando:""...and so he left, with everything but his humanity.""The game also has multiplayer (online and locally).It can be a pain in the a$$ to get it working (it requires hamachi or tungle to work) but once you do, it is a whole lot more fun to beat the game with friends and die together :)P.SThere are artifacts, hidden throughout some levels, that change the game completely.One can give you the ability to choose a specific item of your choice instead of getting a random one, one will spawn a specific boss every 10 minutes and one will spawn only one random enemy type per stage. Great for making the game more customizable and can help you unlock characters. (But don't overuse them or the game loses the fun behind it) Overall Scores: Gameplay- 10/10Story - 8/10 (requires you to collect monster logs and even then it is mosly lore since characters do not speak here)Replayability - 10/10Multiplayer (once set) - 9/10  Final Verdict:  9/10TLDR:2d rogue like dark souls in space.

Risk of Rain is a strategical Indie arcade-style shooter in which the player endures a constantly increasing difficulty of enemy forces while gaining experience to level-up, purchasing items and upgrades, and searching for a teleporter device that forces the player to survive a boss fight. The game shares an intriguing element with other titles in that the further you go and the more time it takes to get there, the more progressively powerful the endless waves of enemies become.Here are several reasons to give Risk of Rain a run while running for your life in-game:Leveling System - What was originally a foreign element to me now retains some clarity. I will be honest, I did not notice the fact that characters had a level when I began my first trek into the Risk of Rain world, especially since I was so overly focused on surviving the merciless onslaught of consistently spawning hostiles. It was only after my first few playthroughs that I truly noticed the leveling system’s effect on the game’s entirety, as it acts simply as an in-game marker on how well that run’s character was sustaining, and even acted as a gauge for comparison to the play time to see how the player was progressing during that particular playthrough. This is not to say, however, that the leveling system is a useless ploy. When a character levels up, they receive bonuses to health and damage, which is definitely useful throughout the game. What I mean to say is that the leveling system is unique in that it is not something the player has to focus on, though it can sometimes signify that the player has to either spend more time in defeating enemy forces or has time to find the teleporter due to the amount of work they put in.Character Selection - Each of the twelve characters in Risk of Rain has a completely unique playstyle to master. For instance, the Commando is a more tactful starting ally who is equipped with a pistol the deals medium damage and has a long range to which requires no cool-down for its use, a canon-like projectile weapon whose shots connect with multiple enemies within its line of fire, a basic combat roll which negates all damage within its arch, and a submachine gun burst that momentarily fires on both sides of the Commando player within a straight line. The Enforcer, however, is a close-range gunman equipped with a slow-firing short-range shotgun that has a slight knockback effect against enemies, a shield bash that is close-ranged and stuns all hostiles upon impact, a stance change in the form of a one-way shield block which increases fire rate for the given direction and redirects virtually all incoming enemy damage from the Enforcer’s front-however, the Enforcer cannot turn around whilst this mode is toggled-, and an explosive projectile launcher with a longer cool-down rate that has a decent knockback effect combined with explosive damage. There are eleven playable characters to unlock-with the Commando present from the game’s start-, but each requires a considerable amount of time to acquire, and even more time to master.Time-Based Increasing of Difficulty - As previously described, Risk of Rain utilizes a time-based difficulty system as well as the “Easy, Medium, and Hard” modes you would find within other titles. What sets this approach apart from the usual is that it completely and consistently influences the way you play. It is suggested that the player act quickly by locating the teleporter device upon spawning, but this requires said player to evade enemy forces persistently, subsequently causing them to be weaker when the end-stage boss fight does occur; on the other hand, because the enemies become increasingly difficult over time, grinding and exploration is somewhat limited to a shorter duration. This chaotic paradox raises a call to action within the player, in which the fast-paced gameplay is heightened to the condition that critical decisions must be made promptly. This system heavily drives gameplay, and this has been a favorite approach to gaming for me as well as a worthy mental and emotional adversary.Collectible Drops and In-Game Achievements - After countless deaths, the player should feel as though some sort of progression has been made, and the collectables found through each world achieves this satisfaction. A percentage of this progression comprises not only of how far one proceeds through each run but also of which upgrades the participating player unlocks during the playthrough. These, as well as collectible ‘Monster Logs,’ can be viewed in a catalogue from the main menu of the game. The in-game achievements create a sense of progression as well, and even allows the player to unlock additional items such as upgrades and additional characters by completing certain goals.TL:DR - Risk of Rain is one of those games that can be a chaotic mess and still retain its charm, which for some games is inaccessible. It is one of those games that you play as if it were embedded within an arcade cabinet and you have infinite quarters, without fear of failing. It is one of those games you just play: do not degrade yourself for not defeating an end-of-world boss because of a single mistake, do not worry about being a completionist while driving yourself mad just because an item did not drop when you needed it to. Risk of Rain is one of those games that deserves its claim as an Indie Gem, and that one should just play to play. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												Amazing game that proves graphics are not everything.- Excellent reply value.- Superb haunting music.If you think that today's video games have super intriguing stories and all that, let me tell you, you'll never play a game so much fun as this one only to get ONE SENTENCE of "" ending dialog "" , yeah, you only get a short phrase telling you what the hell happens to the particular character in the end. That's all you get, and you'll like it.			"

												I have played this game a lot and I have to say its amazing if this game is on sale buy it if it isn't on sale buy it.This game is fairly easy once you learn the controls and how to prioritize your time because when playing on harder difficulties time management becomes important because as you spend more time in game the difficulty increases and if you spend too much time grabbing items you will eventually die. But once you get to a certain point you can literally stand go pop some popcorn grab a coke (or some Mtn Dew if U MLG) and watch as your enemies fall before you and you start raking in the dough. One thing that I do not like about this game though is the local co-op. While it is fun to play the screen doesn't split so when you try to go away from your partner you can't see yourself. So I would like to see a dynamic split screen  where when go farther away from your partner  the screen splits in half between you and when you get close enough you share the same screen (kinda like the new lego games). This small adittion and being able to see your items while playing co-op would make the game much more fun to playTLDR: This game is awesome buy it			"

												At first, I didn't get it, the game seemed boring, and I couldn't keep up with the increasing difficulty, so I played other stuff. After some time I decided to give it another try, and you know, it turned out pretty good.The gameplay is slow-paced at the beginning and winds up quickly. Your character is clunky and weak, but you won't notice as they become a rocket spitting hybring of a wrecking ball and a shredder. You also won't notice as time passes by, as you're already an hour in game, flying around and greedy for more power-ups. They are fully random, so your progress may be easier or harder from session to session - all depends on your luck. I also have to note the soundtrack. It's really beautiful and charming, one of the best game soundtracks I know, and it fits the game just well. Though I usually play with the music of my own choice, which is mostly assorted metal "

												A lonely atmosphere. A struggle to survive. A breathtaking soundtrack.These are things to expect from Risk of Rain. I personally haven't experienced all there is in the game, but I've put enough time into it to confidently say that this game is something special, something we need to see more of.The story is found throughout the world and through the items you find. Nothing's completely concrete, and the speculation can be fun. At least, I find it fun.As a roguelike, you're punished on death, forced to start anew every time. The different classes and randomized map rotation, as well as some variables per map, allow the game to never quite be the same with each run through.The music, though? Glorious. That's my special word for special things. This game touched all the right notes for the soundtrack and has launched itself into my top favorites. And that's tough.The gameplay itself is hectic and fun as hell. Each class can handle each situation differently, although some can do so better than others. I personally like to use the Sniper. It's all about finding the right class for you.Overall, the game was done very well with just the right amount of everything a game needs. Platformers your thing? Roguelikes your masochistic desire?

												You want a hard as balls platformer with genuinely fun gameplay, as well as Binding of Issac style pickups and unlockables?  Buy this game.It has thoroughly beaten me up and taken my lunch money on more than one occasion.  It will punish you, and you will enjoy it. Because you will restart, determined to do better than the previous attempt.  It is extremely addicting, and as such, is fun as hell.Every class has a unique style to them. Each has a TOTALLY different method of traversing maps, taking advantage of terrain features, and destroying enemies in your path. I love it. A LOT of unrecognized love was clearly put into this game, and a lot of love has already been recognized.Get bored of the game for a bit? Burn out?  Read the enemy and item descriptions as you unlock them.Graphics: 2D. 9/10 for the little details, love'm.Sound: 8/10.  Some sounds are piddly, most are pretty great.Music: 10/10.  The music in this game will pull you INTO this game. It's repetitive game music, but it still has made some games intense as all hell.Story: Uh... there is a story... right. 2/10, I forgot about it, but it is relatively unimportant to the gameplay to be honest, which is never something I thought I'd say.Gameplay: 10/10. Your mistakes are your fault.  If you die, it is because you have not yet reached the appropriate level of 'git gud'. Your mistimed jumps, misfired shots, and hestitation can and frequently DO get you killed. This is quite a skillful game, and is a lot of effort to actually stay alive.Learn the characters, find out which one you like, then forget about it because you need to use all the characters to unlock all the things.  I fell in love with this game very quickly, and it is a great way to spend either five minutes, or an hour, depending on how lucky you are that time.Pro Tip:  The Engineer is the best class. ;)			"

												Ever seen a man get chased down by crabs and torn to limb from limb? I have.♥♥♥♥♥♥s horrifiying yo. First thing to go it's the dude's sense of cool, he hits the ground running and starts to panic. When he realizes he isn't fast enough to escape on foot the second thing to go is his sense of gravity. He starts pounding the jump key like it was his lover in the doggy-style postion. When he runs out of room to jump he lets out a primal chimp scream and jumps headlong into a hoard of hungry crabs, guns blazing. Welcome to Risk of Rain, buddy.The objective is simple. Find the teleporter on each level, flip the switch, hold the line until the timer counts to zero, then make like a tree and get the ♥♥♥♥ outta there. But there's a catch! If you decide you want to perform the ol' five knuckle shuffle just cause you've killed every enemy on the level you'd be making a grave mistake. This game gets harder with every minute that passes. Kind of like your uncle Jerry at your middle school play of Annie. If you die, that's it, no second chances. This isn't Super Mario, son. If you aren't on a full adrenaline-pumping-frenzy working your way through levels at redline speed you're next year's history lession. And that's the truth, Mac. Lucky for you that you've got some help. You can find items hidden in chests around the levels that will help you clear the levels. These items aren't used the condoms you find around your local park, no baby these are Evil Dead 2 Ash's chainsaw arm levels of cool. You can also use the online multiplayer if you can figure it out with friends to fight through the hoards of monsters waiting for you. This turns out less like you and your commando squad of badasses tearing through everything like you were Rambo's children and more like that one scene from Aliens. You know the one.You can get eaten as up to 12 different characters! That's a lot of flesh and metal for the monsters of the planet to sample so try to unlock them all!			"

												I had been meaning to write this review for a long time now, but I couldn’t stop playing this game long enough to do it. Roguelikes and roguelike elements have been trending lately, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Risk of Rain houses a great challenge and addictive gameplay. Risk of Rain requires skill, reflexes, and luck to beat. Every character feels very distinct and they are all fun to play. Each character has four skills, three of which have cool downs, which you have to manage in order to survive. Damage comes in percents and the numbers get high.  Along with number crunching, the randomized items are an essential part of the game. These stackable items provide a number of bonuses, passive and active, that make survival possible. It is hard to describe what makes this game so intense and rewarding.  Difficulty increases as time goes on, so it becomes a tradeoff between risk and reward. Fully exploring a level could result in multiple boss spawns and death by elite level creatures, but rushing through the levels could leave you underpowered and lacking items. Your main objective is to find the teleporter in each level, but its location is randomized each time. Your starting point, chest placement, bosses, items, and overall location are all randomized as well. The intensity of the game never lets up because of the increasing difficulty, and it will take the right items and movements to beat the game. However, every playthrough feels like it’s teaching you something different: you will start to learn the layout of levels, the quickest routes, the main teleporter locations, and so on.If learning isn’t reward enough there are also plenty of unlockables. Besides the nine characters that need to be unlocked, there are a ton of items as well. These are all unlocked in a variety of ways that can make for some interesting challenges on top of the base game. Playing by yourself is great, but this is also a great local or online co-op experience, because teamwork is essential. Outside of the base game there are some logs and statistics to look through. While the item log seems to be less serious, the monster log provides some neat insight into the monsters of the game. The statistics page on the other hand, provides interesting insight into yourself and how much of problem this game has made out of your free time.Risk of Rain is hard to put down. The art and music are both really great, and the game feels solid and rewarding. "

												Risk of Rain is an excellent addition to any game library. I would say the diverse gameplay is more than addictive it is interesting and fun it proves that which intuition suggests to us, when gameplay is the focus rather than graphics in the creation of a game that the gameplay will be highly satisfying at every step of the way. If you have 1-3 good friends who you enjoy playing games with, I highly recommend this game for local on online play. "

												Binding of Isaac and Terraria had a baby, Spelunky and Touhou had a baby, and those babies had a baby. This baby, through sheer chromosomal luck, has none of the bad qualities of its parents.That's right. With a Binding of Isaac unlock and generation system, Terraria's combat with a level-up system, Spelunky's sheer difficulty (and to an extent mechanics), and Touhou's blatantly colorful spam, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good 'ol Nintendo hard experience. Easily becoming one of my all-time favorite games as I play it more and more. Oh, and it has multiplayer in the Borderlandsy style of ""HAHA, HAVING A SECOND PERSON ONLY MAKES YOUR SUFFERING WORSE!"" if that's your kind of thing (I'm lonely and have no friends so I don't actually get to experience that.)

												Currently it is the best game I have played yet. I have seen many other games of this genre, yet this trumps them all in my personal opinion. The playability of this game is great: 4 player local, 50+ players online.. if your computer can handle such a large amount of players, but even at that you do not need a strong computer to run this, this can run oh so smoothly even on a weak computer. The game is chaotically fun for the whole group. It wont get boring because of the fact that you can increase the difficulty level as the time increases. If it's too hard though, try to unlock artifacts that may make the game easier or harder, try combinations of artifacts. I have bought about four nine copies of this game for my friends to play with me*, and I highly recommend this game to anyone willing to try it out.*(this does not mean I will buy it for everyone, but if you have it I will happily play it and help you)			"

												Risk of Rain. What a game. At first I was skepticle to try this game out being that I assumed it was just your average MOBA with some sort of twist to it like most games are nowadays. What you get is a lost soul stranded on a mysterious planet fighting for survival against a army of creatures that want nothing but your death. This game is intense, sweaty hands intense. You play as one out of eight character who's only like, 10 pixels tall against giant monsters that absolutely tower you while trying to fight off a horde of smaller monsters as well. You really do feel a sort of pressure on you while you play when you remember that the monsters only get stronger as time goes on, so you're left with the decision to scour the level for items or to just continue on before you become overpowered. This game is hard, it does not forgive and death will force you to start over, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a game for the skillful and the strong, anyone who can't face a good challenge will not survive long in this planet.I love the game. Since the game randomly generates the level to be different every time, you're contantly left guessing where the teleporter is. The wide assortment of items to attain is amazing as they all have different effects that help you in your survival, such as mushrooms that provide speedy healing or a rocket laucher that fires a barrage of missiles at your enemies. There are just so many possibilties that it you're constantly left playing the game over and over again because it's impossible to get the same playthrough twice. That leads me to another thing I love about the game, it's infinately replayable. Since there are so many items and characters you can unlock, it gets to be addicting as more of the game's content becomes avaliable.The Multiplayer mode is a complete blast. You would think that with teamwork, the game should be a breeze, but no. The more people are together at once, the more monsters come to rip you down. It's so much fun to combine you are your friend's unique abilities (assuming they all play different characters) and to coordinate together to survive as effectivly as possible. I always thought it was hilarious how sometimes your friends would get so desperate for items that they dive for every possible chest. Multiplayer adds a new layer of challenge as you now have decide to distrubute the random items evenly, or to have one man become the strongest and carry the rest of the team to survival.Now it's time for the bad.While it's fun and absolutely crazy when you're trying to fight off the hordes of them, after the big masses are dead, you're left with a few stragglers hidden somewhere in some corner of the map which becomes a chore to hunt them all down. One complaint I have with the game is how luck based it is, which I suspect isn't unreasonable considering the nature of the game, it's frustrating to spend your limited resources on a chest only to get some item that wouldn't help at all. There is very little incentive to use the shrines as they have such a high chance for failure, I would only use them if I had excess money on my way to the teleporter. Multiplayer is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to set up. This game uses the system where you have to connect to a friend via IP address. This system is very outdated and has only been nothing but a pain to get working. I cannot open my ports if my life depended on it which leaves me utterly unable to host games, leaving me to depends on my friends to play multiplayer, it becomes quite an inconveience to type in IP addresses for every person. At the very least, there should be an option to copy paste.Aside from those issues, this is an absolutely terrific game that deserves to be played at least once. It offers so much for the moddest price of $10. It's a real bargan to get so much play time from this game. Get it now!			"

												This game is always fun to play no matter what you are doing. Supposed to be studying for a test? Play Risk of Rain. In class? Play Risk of Rain. At a funeral? Play risk of rain.In all seriousness, Risk of Rain or RoR is a 2D side-scrolling rouge-like game where you fight unlimited and countless enemies to uprgrade and customize your character to survive the crazy world. There are multiple different classes of characters with unique abilities that set them apart from eachother. The world is always different through every play through of the game so it never gets old.There are random chests placed throughout the world that you open with money earned from killing enemies that give you upgrades or items that help you survive. The twist is once you die you die forever. You have to see how long you can manage to live and possibly beat the game if you are good enough but the game is VERY challenging.There are also acheivments and leaderboards in game and on steam that help you keep track of how good or terrible you are at the game.The game also offers an online co-op mode that you can play with up to four friends to help against the harsh enemies and worlds you explore.Conclusion: RoR is a rouge like adventure game that never gets old and is very addicting to the point were it can ruin your life.I would buy this game at full price so if it is on sale it is definitely a steal.

												Risk of Rain is an indie platformer with a strong focus on fighting against large mobs of enemies, and some rouge-like elements such as unlockable characters and items. It's unique characteristic is that difficulty isn't tied with level progression, as the game allways becomes harder and harder as the clock ticks away.Art, soundtrack, hard difficulty and different playstyles for different characters are it's strong points. Perhaps you will enjoy being swarmed and being forced into kiting tactics rather than brute force or skill upgrades (there aren't any), perhaps not.Despite not being story-rich, the world is memorable, the soundtrack is one of the better ones (and one of my favourites), and the pace and progression is spot on for my tastes.The game is highly recommended if you're on the fence. If you dislike platrofmers or rage easily, probably avoid. Looking at the game on Twitch and YouTube, it's not easy to see what's so good about it. I had a *very* poor opinion about it, until i was convinced to try it. Immediately, my opinion went from utter dislike to surprised enjoyment.You kinda have to love games where you gotta move fast and react to chaotic swarms of enemies and projectiles rather than stalk things quietly and plan ahead (for most characters anyway, Sniper does it sligthly differently). If you enjoy very difficult, breakneck speed gameplay then this will satisfy you thoroughly. The game is very easy to play and very hard to beat. Beating it feels tremendously satisfying.The style, soundtrack and overall mood is somber rather than guts n' gore or slapstick. Like a weeping willow with a minigun, things get very violent but rather than being a hero or villian you're forced to fight as hard as you can just to survive.The story is largely ambiguous, told in bits and pieces of journal entries or item logs. Whatever the reasons brought you there, it's going to end in a lot of death.Items are numerous, humorous and range between very mildly useful and overpowered. With items and command artifacts it's possible to tweak gameplay difficulty and make the game nigh-on-impossible to beat. If you're into that sort of thing.The main gimmick of increasing difficulty as time goes by is executed very well and it's possible to win either by taking your sweet time and hoping to acquire as many useful doodads as possible or by rushing as fast as possible in order to clear later stages before the difficulty increases. It will make the first few attempts pretty hard but the game stays challenging longer that way. And as i've mentioned before, beating the game is an acomplishment!I've also mentioned the soundtrack being excellent but i'll mention it again!There's some bugs. The game engine was upgraded post release and as a results some old bugs were fixed and some new ones appeared. The level generation can occasionaly bug out and co-op play can suffer from port-forwarding problems or disconnects. Other bugs are pretty rare and minor but they get patched out occasionally.As a single player game Risk of Rain is almost a classic. As for multiplayer, well it's got a few problems and it's difficult to get it working until the bugs get fixed.			"

A platformer with simple mechanics, but hours of fun and a constant sense of urgency, as the longer the game progresses, the harder it gets.It works wonders as a time-waster, as it provides fantastic solo and co-op play. There's a sense of progression, as you constantly unlock new characters, new items, entries, find secrets dancing aliens at the very last level was the coolest one I've found yet!, and loads more.Honestly, if you enjoy platforms with simple but difficult to master gameplay, stop reading this review immediately and purchase this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's top-tier.9/10			"

And multiplayer is cool as well, making it more fun and challenging.To summarize the game, you have different characters to choose from, each one with four different skills; you have collectibles that give you different active and passive attributes and finally you have hundreds of monsters to kill, really hard enemies, and a timer which increases the amount of difficulty the longer you play.

												The risks are high in Risk of Rain, where the risk of danger and the imminent risk of dangerous alien life increases the risk of survival. It's a risky business made riskier when you account for the risk of time, which will gradually increases the risk to die as the game becomes more risky; a risqué move by the developers, but it was a risk worth taking.If you're a risk-taker that can enjoy the riskiness of a good riskily-made risk that is this game, than take a risk and buy this game; you'll run into the risk of having fun.

												A gem that, although not under-rated, is definitely under-recognized. A platformer with simple mechanics, but hours of fun and a constant sense of urgency, as the longer the game progresses, the harder it gets.It works wonders as a time-waster, as it provides fantastic solo and co-op play. There's a sense of progression, as you constantly unlock new characters, new items, entries, find secrets dancing aliens at the very last level was the coolest one I've found yet!, and loads more.Honestly, if you enjoy platforms with simple but difficult to master gameplay, stop reading this review immediately and purchase this♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's top-tier.9/10			"

												A lot of people say co-op is the way to play this game, but I've been having a lot of fun with it solo.  It's very deep and engaging, and once you've put some time into it it'll get its ""one more run"" hooks into you deep.  The problem is it doesn't put its best foot forward and it doesn't really teach you what to look for.  The starting class, the Commando, is straight forward but his dodge ability takes a lot of time to really master.  The second class, the Enforcer, is great for multiplayer but a little too slow and plodding for solo.  I've found that the most interesting classes unlock through random event spawns in the later levels, but they're either out of the way or blend with the rest of the scenery so that you need to be right on top of them to get the button prompt and realize they're actually gameplay elements.  If you want to have fun solo with this game, my recommendation is that you set it to easy, unlock all of the classes, and then play it on normal.			"

												I would recommend this game for the upgrade system alone. There are around a hundred items which are randomized, the interesting part being that they all work with each other and can stack with each other. This means that every playthrough, your style of fighting and main source of damage will change dramatically.One time you'll be rapid-firing a machine gun which has a chance of doing double damage, inflicting bleeding and fires faster the lower health you have - the next you'll be staying at a distance, firing the same machine gun on the same character but with mortars and rockets being launched at the same time, causing enemies to combust and leave pools of fire on the floor.The huge combination of items as well as the unlockables and large variety of characters and playstyles mean that not only is this game fun, but has a hell of a load of replay value. The main downsides for me are the lack in truly randomized levels (the layout itself stays the same, but the loot locations change) and the lag at later levels.A definite recommendation nonetheless, and a great game.

												Should I get this game? How does it play? Does it keep me entertained? How about the music? The effects? Are those good too?Yes, yes they are.I didn't know about Risk of Rain until very recently, and its a damn shame I didn't find it sooner. This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played, and that's no exaggeration. The combat, the items, and the levels all feel just right. I can't describe it in any other way than just ""right"" but you'll see if you decide to spend your money on this masterpiece. The progression system is very nice. You start off with only one class, and that's the Commando. If played right, he is probably the easiest character to beat the game with, and again, that's something you find out very quickly upon playing. Through playing, you can unlock the other nine classes, The Enforcer, The Bandit, The Huntress, HAN-D, The Engineer, The Miner, The Sniper, Acrid, and The Mercenary. Each of these classes has skills completely unique to them and each class also has its own stat progression, such as health, armor, and damage. Some classes are definately more powerful than others, but not so much more powerful as that you feel the need to only play one class. Personally, I think that the two most powerful are The Mercenary, who you get for beating the game five times, and The Huntress, who you get for finding 15 monster logs, which drop at random. The multiplayer is still a work in progress, and is currently extremely difficult to get working properly. I can't wait for the final product to be released and enjoy co-op with ease. Risk of Rain is a very refreshing title that comes at a nifty price tag of $10, although I wouldn't hesistate to pay $30 or more for it. It is utterly flawless down to the very last pixel, and for that, has earned its place among my personal top 10 games list.Final Score- 10/10			"

												Risk of Rain is a level-based, rogue-like platformer that is several large boats full of action-packed fun. You land on an alien planet, perform diplomacy incredibly poorly by shooting everything you see until it explodes into the planet's currency, buy random loot, kill bosses and move on. Each runthrough is nicely randomized based on the loot you pick up and the character you select, and each character is well rounded with a MOBA-style 3 moves and 1 ultimate ability to help you get sh*t done. Platforming handles beautifully, all non-tank characters have movement abilities to make traversing the desolate environments flow nicely and last but not least, playing with friends is fantastic.Yes, It's a good game, 10/10 would reccomend, but it isn't perfect. The main issue I have with risk of rain is the time limit. Let me elaborate by saying that RoR doesnt really have a time limit; it simply gets harder for every 5 minutes of playtime. ""but a game would be boring if it didnt get harder as you progress"" I hear you bleat. Of course difficulty curve is important, but RoR literally gets harder the LONGER you play, rather than the further you get. You are rewarded for finishing the level as fast as you possibly can, which effectively penalizes exploration of the level. The more you d*ck around, the less likely you are to win. I, personally, do not consider this fun. The entire point is to prohibit players from collecting every possible upgrade and stop them from screwing the difficulty curve by farming early levels for gold and experience, but since experience increases exponentially as you progress and you lose all your money when you go up a level, I still fail to see the point of this gameplay tactic. I don't enjoy feeling rushed when I sit down to play a game.The only other major issue with RoR is that some enemies take WAY too much firepower to bring down. This small annoyance is compounded by the fact that you're on a clock. Playing this game, you will come to resent the tanky enemies so much for screwing up your perfect run. They aren't a challenge, they're not HARD to bring down, but you still need to and doing so is a CHORE. Eventually, as you play, you'll unlock a ""relic"" which allows you to start a new run with -90% health and 10x damage. This feels like the way the game was MEANT to be played, and when you get this extra the game becomes so unbelievably more playable you'll wonder aloud why it wasn't available from the FREAKING START!Risk of Rain is one of the better rogue-likes on the steam market, and I highly reccomend that you give it a go. Good luck trying to get multiplayer to work though!			"

												I previously didn't like this game that much, mostly because it ran at a glorious 5fps and it took over an hour to finish a single stage. The recent patch has made the game run at constant 60fps, even on my terrible dualcore/integrated graphics laptop. Completely loving the experience now that I can properly play it. Also, holy crap is it ever difficult now that the game is no longer played in super slow motion.If you're looking for a game to put pressure on you, challenge you, but do it in a controlled and fair way, that you can replay endlessly, Risk of Rain is a sure thing. Especially if you also dig games like The Binding of Isaac and are looking for something more heavy on the action.			"

												This was a game I thought for sure I wouldn't be caught up in.I received this as a gift from a friend and upon playing it - it reminded me of Liero from back in the day due to the game mechanics and pixelation sort of graphics. But I got caught in a concept which the game follows. I was beaking my buddy the whole time about power ups and how they were nice in this game but it was lacking physical power-Ups like double jump's. Low and behold two minutes later I get two double jump power ups and my guy is literally jumping across the map. At that point I was in.The game play itself is good. The concept is you get one life, you run through the levels killing enemies first and fore most to get money to therefore in turn open these chests or ""luck"" statues for power Ups or items. As you kill you gain experience to level up. Power ups range from being able to double jump, to jumping further, to shooting faster, to shooting through everyone every fourth shot, cool-down time faster, every time you shoot maybe something explodes... literally I don't have enough space in this review to write every single power up out. The player starts with a ""commando"" character unit first and as you progress throughout the game or the more you play, the more character units you unlock. Every character has their set abilities (four of them) that cannot change but every character has different abilities. Items also have a cool down period just like the weapon abilities characters have, and the nice thing about items is that they are REUSABLE! What makes the game even better is that there is local multiplayer enabled (fakin' rights bud) and online multiplayer (ohhhhh faaakk yeah bud). So I definitely have to give it up to the guy who made this game because he tried thinking of it all. Oh yeah.... and it's controller supported :) (xbox controller as well as Logitech gamepad). Graphics are graphics as you can see in the preview of the game. To me they look like old Liero touch up's which is perfectly fine but my friend put it better : ""This game reminds me of playing the original nintendo"". After he said that - that's pretty much what I see now. The impact effects, the multitude of varying enemies with each their own power or attack and health, the backgrounds, the different levels all are nice and easy on the eyes, maybe even appealing to some. So I've talked quite a bit about this game, and mostly positive as it rightly is. Does it lack anything? Maybe for some. After unlocking a handful of characters I have to ask myself after being able to play for an hour every time I start a new game, what am I playing for? My stats aren't getting saved (I'm not sure if it's supposed to be saved every time you die or every time you simply start up the game) which sort of is irritating considering people like to see their stats. The game pretense is nice, it's all good but there is just that something more missing. Being able to build buildings in game? Maybe perhaps an RPG element where you can choose certain abilities? I think if this game had steam work shop or maybe some free add-ons to add to the game it would be perfect.I really want to give it my standard rating of 8 which I consider a rating of a good game, however I will have to give it a RATING 7.1/10.Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-I feel the rating is fair because once you play this enough, you'll start wondering where is the motivation to play again. Unless of course a friend comes over or wants to play.Any chance of Risk of Rain 2?			"

												Risk of Rain is a somewhat Roguelike platformer. The game consists of five stages. Each stage is selected at random from a choice of ten to fifteen maps per stage, with the maps being variants on two or three actual landscapes. For example, for the first level, you will find yourself either in the Ancient Forest or in the Dried Lake, and each one of those has several variants.Throughout the game, enemies spawn and attack you, the type of which are determined by the map you're on, and the number of which are determined by how far the game timer has progressed. It starts at Very Easy, Easy, Medium, and Hard, and eventually progresses to I SEE YOU, I'M COMING FOR YOU, and HAHAHA.At around HAHAHA, you might start having two or three boss monsters spawning with the normal enemies at random.As if this isn't bad enough, you're pretty fragile and horribly, horribly outmatched by the unending waves of enemies you face. Your weapons are laughably weak in comparison to your foes' attacks, and the fact that there are Elites and Phantasms which ramp the power up to even more ludicrous heights only makes the game more inherently unfair.You kill enemies to collect currency and experience. Experience gains you levels, with the usual ""make everything better"" that comes with levelling. Coins can be used to unlock treasure chests or sacrificed at shrines.The items you gather will make your life a little easier. Not much. Sometimes, negligibly so. But enough negligible boosts can really stack up after a while.This game follows the Goldeneye model of achievements. Each achievement you earn comes with an in-game unlock - some will unlock items that will be able to drop from thereon out, some will unlock new characters, like the specialized and challenging Sniper, or the adorably toxic Acrid.All in all, I have ground my face against this game for hours and hours, have only won a handful of times, and have loved nearly every minute. This is not for the Facebook Games generation, this is for the motherfudgers who thought Contra was a good time, even if they never could get anywhere without the Konami Code.			"

												Really fun to learn with a friend, dying horribly over and over until you finally crack the game and begin to slowly climb towards that magical moment when you reach god tier and DESTROY everything on the screen. Extra characters can be unlocked during play, although the starting character is one of my favourites. Theres tons of items which may be confusing at first, but you eventually figure out which ones are useful.Some may find the gameplay repetitive, and it kind of loses its replay value once youve exhausted all possible item builds - also known to be a little buggy at times. Still a lot of fun especially coop, and an awesome soundtrack!			"

												Risk of Rain is damn hard, you will die a lot in it, and these deaths will be unfair. It will require every ounce of attention, time management skills, and luck. The difficulty ramps up over 40 minutes, and after that the game is laughing in your face, throwing everything it has at you like Freddy Krueger doing his one joke stand-up comedy routine, and his one joke is having you drown in a vat of snakes and bugs.But the reason for my recommendation is at the point of the game where you're so buffed that no monster, big or small, can touch you. The part where kills gain you extra maximum hit points, and you're taking out four of these ♥♥♥♥ers every few seconds or so. The part where you have so many drones you're raining bullets into faces and watching them all go down, firing frantically while the horde is held back by your absolute, undeniable firepower, being showered in gold, health, and experience, knowing that you cannot be stopped and that their absolute best is going to have a hell of time killing you.And then you get ganked by some horrible little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you didn't see in time to deal with.If you're not that much into Roguelike-type stuff, maybe skip this and come back to it later on. If you're looking for a co-op game, it requires port forwarding and is not as much fun as doing it alone. Other than that, it's glorious and frustrating and compelling.			"

												Risk of Rain? Pfft, more like Risk of PAIN. Because, you know, you'll die a lot in the game.Actually, it's not as much of a risk as it is a certainty. Hold on, let me try again.*ahem*Risk of Rain? Pfft, more like Certainty of Pain. Wait, no, that's crap. Hm, synonyms of certainty...inevitability...destiny? Destiny of Pain? That sure sounds dark, though. Although I guess it fits with the game...where was I going with this again?Dammit, okay, so Risk of Rain is about an interplanetary cargo ship that gets attacked by aliens over a deserted planet. The ship crashes, and you, playing as one of about a dozen different classes, have to, with the help of the cargo you find scattered across the planet, defend yourself against the native creatures and find your way back to the ship. It's a 2D jumpey-shootey platformer that is kind of sort of roguelike-ish; the areas you go to are more or less random, with the locations of the teleporters and items - and the items themselves - being fully randomized, but each area has only a couple of variations. This is not a bad thing - once you play through an area enough times, it's easy to figure out the general layout, meaning that it's potentially easier to find the teleporter to the next area. This saves time, and in Destiny of Pa Risk of Rain, time is not on your side.The longer you spend in the game, the harder the game gets. More enemies spawn more rapidly, the enemies become stronger and tougher, and at higher difficulties, boss enemies can spawn in the middle of a level, instead of only at the end. This not only keeps the game's difficulty up, but it also forces you as a player to keep moving forward. Do you farm enemies and search for items, or head straight for the teleporter to prevent the difficulty from rising any higher than it needs to?The game also features both local and online co-op, which is great, but sadly both methods have their own problems. Getting online co-op to work requires more than passing knowledge of computers, and local has every player sharing one screen, which makes exploration difficult. When it works, though, it can be a blast - exploration and monster-killing become much easier with multiple people, and working in a team allows the more specialized classes, such as Sniper and Enforcer, to shine.Risk of Rain has good controls (the game is perfectly playable with either a keyboard or a gamepad), plenty of things to unlock and discover, and a punishing difficulty level that keeps it from getting boring but is never discouraging. Even though you start with one basic (albeit well-rounded) class, the Commando, getting the other classes offers a nice challenge on top of the gameplay itself, and each class plays very differently from the rest. The game is a ton of fun and you should buy it.			"

												Let's start out by saying that this was my first ever Roguelike. I had never played a Roguelike, but really wanted to get into the genre, and found this gem. The game altogether is amazingly fun. Starting out with a small arsenal of toons, you can choose and develop your playstyle very early on. Over time, new characters can be unlocked and used, in turn releasing new items to be unlocked through use of said characters. A unique achievement system leads to an innovative way of implementing completion to the game, as when an achievement is completed, a new item is unlocked to be discovered in game. The randomized item discovery and unique unlock system make for an overall great and lengthy experience, and I would highly reccomend this game to any and all who enjoy a fun, quality game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun rogue-like game where you gain experience and gold from killing the endless waves of monsters on every level until the boss is found and destroyed. You will find items that have unique powers which will make you more powerful with each one you find, however time is against you; as time goes on so does the difficulty of the monsters. That is the risk on every level while trying to explore every corner to make sure you get all the items, however the monster density increases and so does their strength. There are a ton of items to find and numerous of different characters you can unlock which each having their own playstyle and ability. The game also has multiplayer (use Hamachi) which adds to the chaotic fun. The graphics and the music in this game are really good as well; if you want to try a rogue-like game this is one of the better ones to start off with.			"

												Fun Action-Platformer with some mild rogue like elements. There is a random selection of Arenas, but the overall maps are consistent. Enemy, Item and Teleporter spawns are randomized and depend in part on your unlocks and playtime as the game difficulty increases over time for each run.Controls are tight and work best on gamepad. Difficulty goes from challenging to really, really hard. A run might be short-lived in the beginning but will probably not be much longer than an hour, at that point you either reached the final stage or the game difficultly will have outpaced your character's ability. On that note the final boss is aggravatingly annoying and the reason why I will probably not play this game any further.I enjoyed all the classes I unlocked and had a good time in coop. After 5 hours there are still plenty of items and class combinations to explore, along with some good upgrades in difficulty. Overall great game with a poor designed final stage.			"

												Risk of Rain is a roguelike action-platformer...I guess? Really I can't keep up with all these crazy genres/sub-genres anymore. Mainly the game works like this:1. You crash land on a planet filled with hostile alien life-forms.2. You must seek out the teleporter.3. You have to survive for 90-120 seconds while killing these aliens and the stage boss.4. You acquire items that unlock additional abilities.5. You can either escape the planet or continue searching for items to become a God of alien-destruction.6. You never get a normal night's sleep again.7. You You You You You You You You You YouHonestly I'm not sure why I enjoyed this game as much as I did. I'm usually not a fan of roguelikes. While I understand and appreciate the work that goes into designing a game in this style, it just seems like 80% of indie titles are some variance of ""get stronger...but don't die or you'll lose everything!"" Risk of Rain however, it really clicks with me, and I've barely scratched the surface.Let's start with the difficulty. RoR can be a challenging game, especially when played on the harder setting, using particular artifacts, and imposing restraints (not acquiring particular items, tougher class, etc). There's a lot of flexibility that goes into this game. Through experimentation and practice, you eventually hit the ""How could you ever die?"" level, that's a good indicator to change things up for your next play-through. Despite the limited number of stages and aliens, the game maintains its freshness on subsequent play-throughs. This is attributed to good scenario design. Actually I take that back, since scenarios are usually created through a combination of artifacts and randomness. Still, a lot of what makes each stage great is what can happen, and the items you find leading to subtle changes in your overall strategy. Surviving is important, but you also have to kill everything. Sometimes aliens/bosses can be ""herded"" by allowing them to spawn on platforms. Teleporting elites can mess with this strategy however.  It's also possible to get trapped by a swarm of aliens, forcing you to make the most of your limited invincibility moves to get away/chip at the crowd. Then there's the immense satisfaction of when everything comes together. You're shooting enemies with lasers, rockets, bullets, missiles, and a bunch of other random crap all at the same time while viewing a parade of numbers. Taking out 40+ enemies at once with a huge attack is also quite amazing. I especially enjoy playing as the mercenary. He has a couple invincible moves and a spin-slash that works sorta like a jump. Eventually I get the cooldowns so low I can mash the invincible moves every second, and constantly spin-slash through huge enemies while never touching the ground. I could go further, believe me I really want to, but I have to get my life back. Risk of Rain devours my free-time, and I still have several hundred other games to play (plus a job and some other stuff that is probably necessary). This game might click for you as well, which would be both great and terrible.  "

Posted: April 7, 2015
												At first, I was sceptical about this game. Indie 2D platformer with roguelike elements and pixel artsy visuals - how original is that, am I right? Still, I was kind of drawn to it.I got it as a gift from a stranger some time ago, and it was basically just sitting in my library ever since. Recently, I've been looking for something new to play and I've decided to give it a go. I learned very quickly how wrong I was…What is it about?   Storywise, there's not that much to talk about:  Your character somehow survived the explosion of the space cargo ship. You crash landed on an unknown planet, which is bad enough by itself. Unfortunately, the whole place is swarming with all sorts of strange, deadly creatures. As you can probably imagine, none of them is what you'd call ""friendly"". You need to get out of this place…   Leaving the planet is not as easy as one would hope. There are 6 (somewhat) randomly generated levels, each harder than the previous one. To get to the next level, you need to find a teleporter, activate it and then survive another 90 seconds, during which you fight the boss and waves of enemies. Only after killing everything, you can progress to the next level and repeat the same procedure.   Other than your 4 basic combat skills, there are many different passive and active items to be found  These can be bought with the money you've earned by slaughtering monsters native inhabitants. However, it takes a while to get those $$$, which is unlucky, because the game is getting tougher over time. That means you have to decide pretty soon whether to grind for a few minutes and become as OP as you possibly can, or just try to speedrun the whole thing with only a few items. It's your call.What's good...   Even with multiple attacks, controls and the whole combat model is really easy to get into. I've played with a controller most of the time, but it's absolutely fine with keyboard too.  It feels nice and fluid. Chaining attacks is fun, but it also requires a bit of a planning to pull off, so it's not just downright brainless button mashing. Also, difficulty increasing over time is a nice little mechanic and takes the game to a whole new level (heh). Same goes for collecting and stacking different items. All in all, the game actually requires quite a bit of tactical thinking.   Next, I love the amount of content they've put into the game. There are about 100 items total and it takes a while to unlock and find all of them. More than that, you can unlock 11 additional characters. All of them have their unique skill set, allowing for different playstyles, meaning very different experience. Thanks to this, and randomly generated levels, the replayability of this game is insane.Besides, there are diary logs, describing some of the monsters you've encountered, and also ""shipping details"" for all of the items you've found so far. These add more little details to the story and enviroment, making you more invested into the universe you still know nothing about. Moreover, the atmosphere is just wonderful. Pixel art style is spot on and the soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou is just stellar (I'm done with puns now, I promise…).    While it can start to get a little bit ridiculous after 20 minutes or so, I enjoy that. Not being able to see your character through the mix of enemies, health bars, damage values, effects and particles may be stressfull for some…but making it out alive is veeery satisfying, cathartic even. When thing go wrong (and the frequently do), I always feel like I know exactly how I screwed up, despite all of the chaos and randomness. Don't get me wrong, this game is REALLY HARD and will kill you again and again and again… but it still feels more fair than any other rogue-like I've played.On the other hand, beating this game for the first time was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I think I've ever had…What's not so good…   There are only a few little problems, but I feel like I should mention them anyway.First, the Steam overlay doesn't work at all with this game, which surprised me. That means no screenshots on Steam. Obviously, you can still use the OS's built-in print screen function, but it's a shame that you can't share it with you friends that easily and basically support the game more. Not sure what to think about that. Also, full controller support and Big Picture mode support would be swell. That's pretty much it, nothing else to complain about.Conclusion.Risk of Rain is rock hard, yet fair and fun to play. It combines several interesting mechanics in a very cool way, and the amount of content and replayability is amazing. The world of RoR is eerie, strange and beautiful at the same time, thanks to it's visual style and great soundtrack.If you're a fan of rogue-likes, or hard games in general, you should just buy this game right away - it is definitely worth of both your time and your money. If you are short-tempered however, I would advice you to reconsider.			"

												Risk Of Rain is a brilliant platformer/rouge-lite, the main thing with this game that pulls me into this game is how easily I can switch from being under-powered to over-powered and then back again in split seconds. (mostly from getting too cocky when I have certain power-ups. :P) It's genuinely a hard game and I love it for that reason. The music is a selling point as well, sort of a rocky/electronic/ambient thing.The difficulty scales just right for me, it gives me a good 2-5 minutes to do what i need to do in each level, so I can do either a quick pick-up-and-play run or i could do a good 40 min run to (rarely) get to the last level. Plus this game actually makes me want to collect every single power-up and monster log just for the little storys you get alone.The only gripe I have with it is how complicated it is to connect with friends, when I want to connect with a friend I have to use a program called Evolve[evolvehq.com] that gives me and my friends a temp IP address, and even that fails some of the time.All in all, this is a solid game that rates highly on my games list.

												A fast-paced and unforgiving 2D platformer-shooter with 8-bit, pixel graphics.The storyline is rather thin, but solid enough to relay to the player who you are and what you're doing. A stranded pilot on an alien planet and trying to not die, respectively.The gameplay starts off nice and easy, but gradually picks up the pace, ramping up the difficulty exponentially. Apart from 2D platforming and shooting things, this game can very well be categorized as a rogue-like. With permanent death, unforgiving difficulty and a lot of randomized items to aid you in combat, fans of rogue-likes and fast-paced action alike will appreciate Risk of Rain.There are 10 classes to be unlocked, each with 4 distinct and unique abilites. The variety allows for an amazing amount of play styles and strategies. Combined with the at times randomness of items and shrines to waste your money on, players will need to hone their skills and rely on luck as well, if they are to escape this hostile and indomitable planet.

												Risk of Rain is an addicting action-based platformer with a healthy dose of challenge. Solo or Co-op, the game is a blast because the game gets progressively harder as you play it! With the idea of collecting power-ups and perks in a struggle to get more powerful and balance out the constant rise in difficulty, you and your friends will find yourselves getting constantly bombarded with more and more enemies and bosses until you die or beat the final stage.    It has great replayability due to the multiple characters to unlock (each with their own very unique playstyles!) and the ever-growing random buffs and perks you unlock by doing challenges! It also features fluid pixel art and great soundtrack to boot. Gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up, but has a decent amount of depth in terms of timing your skills right.    If you like the sound of any of that, I definitley recommend Risk of Rain :)			"

Posted: February 24, 2015
												Risk of Rain is a 2D platforming shooter that puts you on a hostile planet full of alien creatures. The enemies are randomly added and spawn in. While the game has random levels, after 7+ hours of play, you start to recognize that there are random levels with extra frills on them to make them feel as if they were generated. The object of each level is to make it to the teleporter that is randomly placed somewhere on the map. Once you activate it, you need to survive for 90 seconds. A countdown clock appears and soon after a boss emerges and you get swamped with enemies that spawn into the area. A lot of times they spawn on you. Once the 90 seconds are up, then you need to kill the remaining creatures including the boss before you hop in the teleporter to the next level.Along the way you'll find plenty of items and power ups that do some interesting and fun things. Some give you a chance to make enemies freeze, bleed or slow down. Others help with regenerating your health. Another will a barbed wire shield around you while others turn dead enemies into ghosts that will fight for you. There are dozens of these items. You don't just keep one, they stack, so you can end up with a dozen on you and not just that, but if you get the same one on the same play through they increase the effectiveness. Two feathers means you can now jump twice in the air instead of just once.Its more than just passive items, there are usable items that will do things like shoot a cluster of missiles, replenish your health or unlock all the treasure chests on screen. These items have a very long cool down timer, usually around a 45 - 60 seconds. You can even spend money to repair drones that either shoot bullets, lasers or heal you with a green beam. They're so nice to have, especially two of them.You'll find these items from beating bosses, in treasure chests, stores, imp statues and chance statues. The stores give you a choice of three items. Once you buy one, all three disappear. The treasure chests give you a random item and cost gold to open it. The chance statues and imp statues also cost gold. As you get to higher levels, the amounts increase. The chance statues are just that, a chance to get an item. Sometimes these statues cost you health. The more you try, the higher the price. The imp statues release five imps that simply run away from you and you need to kill them all to get your prize. These are all ways to keep the game interesting.The controls are simple, you can move left and right, climb up and down on ladders and jump. Each character has four abilities. Three of which have cool downs. So you have unlimited ammunition, just a timer before you can use them again. To start, you've got a standard fire button that shoots a short burst each half a second. Its not like a machine gun, but at least you can hold down the trigger. Rapidly pulling the trigger will shoot faster, but only if the gun animation has gone away. So not all characters will shoot faster. Depending on the character you have all sorts of range and damage output.From there, you've got a defensive move. The commando has a combat roll to go through enemies.  The enforcer has a shield that he will drop down making him incredibly slow, but protected  from the front. The Bandit has a smoke bomb that makes him invincible for three seconds. Enemies stop chasing you and so on. There are 9+ other characters, but well after 7+ hours, that's all I was able to unlock. These different characters really feel a lot different from one another.What I really don't like is a few times if I want to quickly turn and fire. I'll turn enough so my character will start moving the other way, but when I fire, he will turn around to shoot, then keep running the way he was directed. It seems to happen pretty consistently, especially as the bandit. Even dropping the guardian's shield he will turn around to drop the shield. It is just odd. It has cost me lives and wasted abilities, not to mention special weapons that I need to wait 45 seconds to reuse.You have a good amount of health and it regenerates very slowly over time. Of course every enemy has a good amount of health too. This makes weapons feel pretty powerless. It takes several shots to take down lesser enemies and with larger enemies that have more health, I found myself sitting there just waiting. Perfectly safe, but waiting far too long for my character to kill them. Luckily there is a leveling up system that will give you more health and damage output, but as the clock ticks away, the enemies get stronger and more powerful. Its just really dull having to kill a clump of five strong enemies all batched together. I could put a rubber band on my 360 controller and walk away for a minute. The game just feels like one big grind. You can always get items that add a chance of homing missiles or a chance of mortars, but even then it doesn't help all that much.The game feels slow getting from point A to point B. I'd dread knowing that I'd have to go back somewhere. The character feels like he moves slow, the weapons feel powerless. Its not quick action like Contra or Mega Man. Its all deliberate to prolong the experience. You have a nice wide view of the area, so you get a better sense of where to go, because your character is so slow that if you zoomed in on the action, it would take that much longer to find where you're going. I'm just happy that the experience and gold that falls from enemies automatically flies to you from wherever it is. Having to pick it up would be painful.Like in the real world, you only have one life. When you die, that's it you need to start over, but hopefully you've made it far enough on your previous play through to unlock new items that you'll find in future play throughs. It always drives you to keep going like oo a new thing. Now all I need to do is play again and hope to randomly find it somewhere.The enemies are pretty brainless, that's what allows them to just let me shoot them. I think because they all have so much health they need to be brainless. There are some enemies smart enough to jump up onto platforms to follow you and chase you around, but they're not smart enough to jump over gaps. Floating jellyfish will seek you out, fly through platforms and dart toward you at some point. The bosses are pretty iffy as well.When you get to the teleporter and enemies start transporting in, I found myself getting randomly overwhelmed, because the foes would spawn in on top of me. So then I'd have to run away and keep moving for the 90 seconds or I'd quickly be dead. You don't get brief invincibility when you get hit. Enemies can keep right in you attacking unless you're fast enough to run away or use one of the defensive tactics like roll, smoke bomb or drop a shield. Even if you get good at running away, at some point, there are enemies that can teleport straight on you. Just poof, they're now in you. Do you shoot left or right? Well you occupy the same space, so your guess is as good as mine.As for the music and graphics, both are great. The music excels at being something spacy and other worldly. The graphics look small and old school. I think these two came together to improve the experience I had and made me want to stay in game, because I know it was a struggle against the grind.If you want to play cooperatively, you'll need to have a friend with you, have a LAN connection or an IP address. There is no play through Steam. I'm not sure if I enjoyed the game. Even playing with a friend, it wasn't that fun. I hate to be the only person that didn't enjoy the game. I don't feel like I had fun playing the game, when this game should be right up my alley. I like random stuff, I like good combat and somewhat random levels, but I just feel like I would have enjoyed it more with a faster pace.			"

												Risk of Rain could stand a little more optimizing, but for a game made in Gamemaker of all things it's surprising how engaging it is. The art style is consistent and manages to look great even when your character could be rendered on a digital watch. Combat is fast, constant, and feels good, character progression is a constant motivation, and the soundtrack is top tier. The multiplayer is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ a total ordeal to set up which I assume is a limitation of the engine, and unfortunately I haven't been able to get it working. Despite that, Risk of Rain is closer to the traditional rogue-like with randomly-arranged stages, distinct character classes and randomized loot from a very large pool of options than most games professing to be ""rogue-likes"" on steam today.

												This game does what it wants to do properly well. It has it's flaws, but all in all, it's well executed and presents challenging gameplay with great difficulty balancing from easy to hard.The game does NOT handle well internet lag. It's supposed to be synchronized between the players, but with pings of around 300 ms, monsters started desyncing and, due to that, completing stages was only doable by the host, as I could not kill 'all enemies on screen'. The content that the game offers is worth it's price, but I would have definitely paid more money if it offered double the content. It's got 100 items and 7 classes so far, which isn't bad, but gets a little repetitive after a few hours. The key to making the game fresh is, instead, placed on the many classes you can unlock and play with. The soundtrack offers great tunes that motivate the players to keep going. It's very cinematic and complements the scenery in a really classy and well done way.Needless to say, this is much better enjoyed with friends, as all class combos offer great variety in strategies. The game's difficulty is much better adjusted for teamed up players, as different classes complement each other against certain monsters.No need to mention that this game is really hard. REALLY hard. Beating this on Hard difficulty is not a feat for the faint of heart.6/10			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Risk of Rain 

			Views: 86		

			Risk of Rain is a hardcore Rouge-like killing fields game available on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

Risk of Rain is a roguelike with some minor platforming elements, andan option for playing in co-op mode.  The game comes with difficulty levels thatoffer a wide variety of challenge in gameplay, as well as artifacts that canunlock more difficulty options.You play as a character stranded on a planet, trying to escape byreaching the teleporter, then stay alive during the 90 seconds it takes toteleport to safety.  The more time you take to survery your area, the harderthe game gets.  Surviving in the game comes down to a combination of luck andusing passive abilities strategically.  That being said, the longer you take,the harder the enemy gets, to the point where the quantity of passive abilitieswill make no difference.This is not a game for those who have never tried roguelikes before;  ratherif you are looking for a challenge, this will entertain you, and even humble youas you go through the game.  This game respects your time, and Ienjoyed playing it.I have no problem recommending it.This is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you towatch if you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Absolutely amazing OST and sound effects!Gameplay is great, especially in two player co-op mode which works flawlessly, but make sure to look out for each other as one might not keep up with other one in later levels if not leveling/powering up alike. One thing to point out however is that game at first feels like it should be played slow and with some tactics in mind, but after a while you realize that it has a totally opposite pace, which isn't bad, just different from what you thought it was at first.What isn't great or at least could be improved on is the overall game and level design which are somehow procedural generated, but fails at some spots completely. From what I have read game was done by one programmer, one designer and one composer so it is absolutely amazing from that perspective, however I wish they had put a much more content and polish into it as game engine and overall feel of the game is superb.Maybe a sequel?Get it if you are looking for some rad co-op shoot-em-up to kill half an hour in the evening!

												This game rules with a cold-iron fist. Do you want to blow up hordes of monsters with an ever-increasing pile of ridiculous abilities that make you into an unbustable death incinerator? Great! You'll do that after you spend lots of time being chumped on the first map by tiny little lizardmens, or popped like a saggy grape between the titanic clapping hands of a robot who is happy and he knows it.""Minimalist"" is a term used to describe some of the art, sure, but in this case it's super evocative. Sound and style combine very well here, and I'm impressed with what cool sci-fi locales they are able to create. Sky Meadow in particular is just wonderful.Play after play, you unlock new items and classes to go all rain a-risking, and you'll do so much unlocking that Jill Valentine will call *you* master. The classes all play differently, I don't know that I can really be the authority on which ones are trash and which ones are god tier, but some of them are certainly easier to own with than others. Ok done talking about the game, gonna go play it some more. "

												250+ Hours into this bad boy.Thrash, bash, smash, hack, and slash through hordes of monsters all the while unlocking artifacts that can drasticly change the game (and usually not to your advantage). This game will keep you moving, testing your reflexes, and you ability to observe the battlefield - soon to be bloodbath. Risk of Rain is punishing; brutal, and at times, just plain cruel. When a game mode is annotated with ""you will die"" - its not a warning, Is a fact. Elite mobs that can electricute, burn, and even explode.I can say I have beaten the game on monsoon difficulty, with every artifact active. And now you know why I have 250 hours logged :-)11/10 would get electro-flame-sploded again.			"

												Insanely addictive platformer with a lot of rogue-like mechanics. Even though the graphics does look bland at the first sight, the game mechanics are flawless. Replayability is extremely high (local and online co-op included): there's a lot of unlockables, such as new boosts, new playable characters (possibly, a lot more than that, but I'm just getting started playing the game). The levels are generated randomly each time you start a new game, which increases replayability furthermore. Absolutely worth it's money. I'd rate this game 9.0 / 10.0.			"

												Risk of Rain's crescendo'd challenges over time provides an interesting dimsension to the Rogue-like game genre. While detailed exploration of maps is possible in Easy mode, progress is not saved unless you are at least at Normal difficulty. The ambient and atmospheric soundtrack provides a perfect complement to the challenging-yet-not-rage-quit-inducing platformer.  A good buy at list; a steal on sale.			"

												Risk of Rain is a platformer/sidescroller/survival game that puts you in control of one of a few survivors of a crashed spaceship. You will have to fight enemies and earn money to purchase upgrades and progress to the upper levels. The game's difficulty scales with the time, adding an incentive for players to use their time efficiently. In each individual ""run"" - or single playthrough - there are six levels, each with harder monsters and more expensive upgrades. Boss monsters appear at the end of a level or sometimes in the middle of a level if the difficulty is high enough. Risk of Rain will require several playthroughs to fully explore what all of the upgrades do and how to play each of the survivors.Read more for an in-depth look at Risk of Rain.This game's story is largely told in the beginning and end cutscenes, as well as in monster logs - information about enemies that randomly drop when you defeat one. Some of the descriptions in the item log also hint to background story events.Risk of Rain [ROR] is a 2D pixelated platformer game. The art is excellent and each of the characters and enemies are unique. Each of the survivors has 4 unique abilities that are fairly balanced. Each one has their own forte and shortcomings, so experiment a little with all of them to figure out which one suits you. You only start with one character unlocked (the Commando), so you'll have to unlock the rest.Items/upgrades are found in chests which unlock for a price. Monsters drop money and experience when killed, and both can also be found in small amounts within canisters. There are four ranks of upgrades - white (common), green (uncommon), red (rare) and orange (use item). The first three ranks are items that are either passive or triggered by events, while the fourth are items activated by the player. All use items and skills (except for the primary basic skill) have cooldowns. There is also an artifact hidden within each level. Artifacts do nothing in the run they are acquired in, but after that playthrough a new artifact's effect can be chosen in the character selection screen. Each one adds a different game element (only elites spawn, 500% damage but 10% health, etc).ROR also has an incredible soundtrack, merging genres from electronic to trance to ambient to rock. Each level has its own exclusive background music, giving it a unique atmosphere. The sound effects are very believable and yet are alien enough to convince you that the planet you are on cannot be Earth.Risk of Rain is an incredible platformer with solid gameplay mechanics, excellent replay value and an addicting arcade-style structure. Online multiplayer is also available. A solid game all-around. Definitely worth purchasing if you enjoy a good thrill.			"

												Brilliantly-made roguelike platformer from the guys behind Starbound. While superficially similar to games like Binding of Isaac or other action roguelikes, there's really nothing that FEELS like Risk of Rain out there.The essentials: you are a survivor from the crash-landing of the UES Contact Light, which was hauling extremely questionable cargo when it was downed over an incredibly hostile alien planet. Play as one of eight different classes, pillage the wreckage that rained down from the sky as the ship crashed, and try your hardest to survive long enough to reach the Contact Light and get off the planet. This is a shallow summary, of course.The basic gameplay is an action platformer reminiscent of Bionic Commando, but there's no grappling hook shenanigans: instead, every class has a completely different style of play, with four abilities. Every class has one basic attack, one crowd control power, one ability that improves mobility, and one very powerful attack that leaves them somewhat vulnerable but is tactically crucial. These range from the basic Commando, who is a classical sidescroller Dude With Gun What Shoots Mans, to stuff like HAN-D, a hulking janitor bot who punches things and launches drones to attack and heal himself, to the Bandit, a space cowboy assassin with a lever-action rifle and dynamite, to even weirder and kookier options. Every class is completely unique compared to every other class, and there's a ton of variety to be found for any kind of playstyle you like. Beyond your class, you've got one slot for an active item and a functionally unlimited number of slots for passive items that improve your abilities or stats in some way. If you've played Binding of Isaac, you basically know how this works. Where a lot of the fun comes in is the sheer variety of items you can find and the way they interact with your character, as well as the intriguing and funny backstories behind each item, displayed in the game's Item Log, which is presented as the shipping manifest of the Contact Light. As you collect items, you'll eventually build a picture of exactly what the Contact Light was up to. The game similarly features monster logs for stuff you kill, which are random pickups.Difficulty in the game is complex; while the game has three difficulty settings(Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon), it isn't immediately obvious what these do. What they primarily affect is the game's scaling difficulty, which is based on your in-game timer. As the difficulty meter ramps up, enemies get progressively tougher, more aggressive, and more numerous; at the max end, it can even spawn bosses as regular enemies.In each level, you're looking for a teleporter which will take you to the next stage; activating it summons a boss, and once you've killed it and all remaining enemies in the stage, you can progress. You can either beeline for the teleporter straight off, or stay around for a while and try to slaughter enemies to earn money and experience with which to buy items and become stronger, but waiting TOO long becomes a risky gamble due to the ever-increasing difficulty. Too fast, and you'll be underpowered; too slow, and your foes will be insurmountable. Skilled play thus becomes a balancing act between progression and increasing your capabilities.The game is simple to pick up and learn, but is staggeringly replayable, and this is helped by the beautiful aesthetic and wonderful music. For ten bucks, you are getting a LOT of game, and it's certainly worth your time to stand out in the rain for a while.			"

												This is one of my favorite games the gameplay is really good and I have fun every run. I remember thinking this game might not be for me when I got it from a bundle on humble bundle. I didn't try it until a year later after I got it and now I kinda regret that. This game is baller and I can recommend it at full price however the multiplayer has a few bug still. So if you want it purely for multiplayer then a sale might be a good idea. A lot of things was fixed in the last update so there's quite a bit less crash in multiplayer but there are still a few crash notably it seems to happen more if you edit your file to host more than 4 players.

												One of the few roguelikes I have legitimately loved. Part of what sells this one for me is that you can unlock alternate characters who play quite differently, as well as artifacts that greatly affect how the game is played. The game becomes surprisingly replayable. Perhaps my favourite mechanic is that each level has a risk/reward of ""Do I stay and get more items and let the difficulty rise or do I rush to the next level"", which greatly adds tension. Fantastic game alone or with friends.			"

Some levels have different types of altars that let you gamble some money of the money you collected or even a percentage of your life for the small chace of getting a powerful item or a very large chance of getting a mostly useless one I'm looking at you, Bustling Fungus.

												This game is a fresh take on the rougelike genre.  This game is great to pick up and play for a while with no real commitment.The more you play this game, the more in game powerups you will unlock, which will give the game more depth.  The game has a random element to powerups, so some runs you will get destroyed, and others you will simply dominate.  There are also a handful of unlockable playable characters, each with their own unique play styles.I love games I can just pick up and play, and this game is great for that.  It gets tough at times, but for the most part you will be destroying wave after wave of enemies, which is very satisfying.  If you are looking for something more than an hour here or there, this might not be your game.  For ten bucks, I say its well worth it.			"

												Against all previous statements and assumed beliefs this game is in fact neither a weather application or a simple game. It is actually a time machine, but due to chucklefish dropping development on all their games half-way through it can only send you forward in time. It acheives this by making you perform simple tasks, killing enemies and making your character survive as long as possible, but in reality you are coordinating the complex controls of this machine, quickling sending you anywhere from thirty minutes to well over an hour in one sit down. I found myself playing right after breakfest only to realize shortly afterwards that it was the next morning. Use this game with caution or else you will find yourself losing all grasp on time.also screw toxic beasts "

Having two or more people obviously means that you have extra firepower, but you have to share money, exp, and items, providing a difficult balancing act.I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of difficult games like They Bleed Pixels or Dark Souls, along with anyone who likes action platformers like Cave Story.

												Risk of Rain is a very challenging pixelated game with RPG elements for a fast paced gameplay for you and your friends featuring a whole lot of unlockables, items and characters. When playing for the first time, even the easiest difficulty feels like a big hit. Great and forwardening soundtrack that always keeps you on your toes. High replayability in combination with great difficulty and items to unlock that won't let your fingers off the game for a good amount of time.Though, after the first finished gameplay you realize it could use a view more levels to lengthen the game. For the current price the game does not really satisfy in regard of content.The game is not optimized well in terms of performance and visualization on the screen. When things are getting too cluttered, a low- to mid-end PC often hangs on a view strings and slows down to a unplayable state. The final level always lagged on my older notebook, regardless of hosted or being the host and the monsters on the screen.A huge let-down is the handling of lag when playing in multiplayer. The game often ended up being unplayble as the player with a high ping did not synchronize with the host, not being able to teleport to the next level.All in all I would recommend Risk of Rain when it is on sale, otherwise it feels like it is missing content and polishing.

												It's hard to judge a platformer with only 10 levels to offer, usually one would say that it is lacking in content. However, when you factor in the 16 possible combinations of the first 4 levels, the myriad of variations each level has, and how item drops are completely random that gives passive buffs to the player, plus the inclusion of 9 unlockable classes and 1 default class.. You have this roguelike platformer where no 2 play throughs are the same.The gameplay is really fantastic, lending itself to real frantic action with tons of tough enemies and impossible bosses. It has a unique mechanic of cranking the difficulty up as time passes, and so it becomes a wild race against time to get as many items as possible in as little time as possible to keep you alive. There are over 100 items to pick up with more than a handful of them being deployable during the game for added effects.It's not just the gameplay that is great, the 2-D spritework and the forlorn-sounding music complete the experience of playing this game. It looks great, it plays great, there is a lot of depth and challenge to be had. I would say that this is one of the best Rogue-likes to come out in 2013. Go pick it up.			"

												this is a great example about how the game mechanics are the most importan thing in games, i really love how adicting hard and awesome is this game, yeah is kind of clunky but if you can take that and the pixel art you will find one of the most awesome, fun, adictive and challenging indie games!

I once played this game for 2:25~ hours straight. Didn't regret 1 second of it (except the time i died and the game ended)This game has tons of fun and replayabilitiy, which is one of the first things i look when i play a game. But that's just me. First of all, the game might seem boring. But if you advance further you realize how many different stuff you can get. You have many items to collect while playing and each one of them gives you an unique ability. Also they are separated in tiers;White, Green, Red and Orange (usables) And around 80% of the items can be stacked, making them stronger and stronger as you collect more of them. But some have stacking caps.The game gets harder and harder as your progress. And if you play long enough, you might encounter the ""overloaded"" bosses. They take some time to defeat. Also most of the regular enemies turn into elite enemies. Them being elite lets them have special powers (depending on the color, if im right) and they have much more damage & health. I don't know if it counts as a spoiler or not so i will just say this: be prepared for the last boss. It's pretty hard to beat.(Updated)I cannot i believe i missed the 2nd best thing i like about this game! The amazing soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou! He did an amazing job on every track and i enjoy them everytime i play the game. I set my music volume to 100% just to listen to them.I highly recommend this game. It is worth every penny. Get it on sale or just buy right now & get a refund if you are not amused one bit. "

												Oh my god this game is amazing for the price you pay... it's so friggin' addicting! You start off all weak and normal, but as you go on you can level up from XP that enemies drop, along with money they drop that you can spend on chests and shrines across the map that give you random items that buff your character. There's a HUGE sense of reward with this game... like every item you get is a small step in the right direction. When you're feeling powerful enough, you can try to find a teleporter located in a random area on the map. When you activate it, a boss will appear and you have to survive for a minimum of 90 seconds. After that, you have to finish off the boss and all the smaller enemies around it. Then you can teleport into the next level/area and repeat the process from there. A+/10, buy this game.			"

												I love this game. Even though, I don't know why the game is named Risk of Rain. Oh well.Like: A 2D Action Platformer with addictive gameplay and alot of items to help you survive. The game gets more difficult over time. With 12 characters to unlock, each with their own abilities, strengths, and boosts.Meh: I didn't exactly like the quality at first, I think that maybe the same quality in the character selection screen could be for gameplay aswell, but it doesn't really matter. The gameplay is what keeps me happy.Dislike: Sometimes when you spawn into the world, you will keep falling down through the ground, and you are gonna need to return to the main menu and start it again.Also when you die in multiplayer, your HUD is just gone when you respawn.8.7/10			"

												RoR is a very agressive, colourful pixel orgy of side-scroll platforming, run and gunning. You crash on a hostile alien planet and need to get away from it or the wildlife will get to you. You survive by mowing everything down, getting expierence, gold and collecting/buying powerups. There are 10 characters you can play as (Although you start with just one, others are unlocked by progression or other objectives) each has their own unique set of 4 skills. E.g. Shooting at mobs from multiple directions, charged shots, leaving behind a trail of bile that hurts mobs but boosts other players or temporarily invisibility.The powerup items you can find are passive or active; some of the more simple passive one's will increase stats like the % damage and health you regenerate and active items can be used during combat. Missle launchers, saw blades, minefields, a jar filled with the vengeful souls of monsters. All very fun to try out. The strength in what keeps making you play this game is that the items are randomly generated and chests or shrines you can find them at are also randomly scattered across the levels you play in. (Of which the order of 4 out of the 6 levels are chosen randomly too) The mobs hit really hard and while in the beginning of the game you need skills to time dodging attacks, luck is a big factor in getting the right items to make you powerful enough to beat the game. As time passes the mobs increase in quantity and power, dealing even more damage. In the heat of battle it is easy to lose sight of your character Playing online co-op has to be done through Hamachi which isn't too much of a hassle and playing with a controller didn't go very smooth for me, it doesn't recognize my 360 controller unless I use a controller emulator. Once you have those things set up it's a blast. You won't need an umbrella!			"

												Risk of Rain will quickly eat up hours of your life, it's one of those games that are fun to go back to when you're a bit bored and not sure what you want to do.I don't think anyone would regret buying Risk of Rain as it's a very accessible game that is easy to pick up and play for awhile, extra fun if playing with friends.Worth mentioning however is that the game is far more enjoyable with a controller and the menus and such are a bit wonky. The game is very poorly optimized and while this will rarely be an issue many people have problem with halved (30 instead of 60) framerate on the last level, which means the game runs at half speed (not just half framerate, one second in the game will last for two second in real life).

But I implore you, please do not quit, all those bad runs are made up when you get some of the few that beat the game. Then it's like all the other failures never existed.

It's truly the best feeling.Don't even get me started on the multiplayer, just goofing off with friends is hours of entertainment. I highly recommend this game. It will beat your♥♥♥♥♥.. but lovingly.

												Risk of Rain is a game in which you truly feel adversity with every step you take. It's an incredibly difficult game, but that tends to come with the rogue-like territory. The characters all feel fun to play as, and it's always incredibly satisfying picking up yet another new upgrade to add onto your already extensive pile of upgrades. This is a game that I've lost so many hours on, and not a single minute feels wasted. It can be very frustrating at times, but it's all worth it when you finally become a virtually invincible godslayer, ripping even the most terrifying monsters to shreds.			"

												A really fun rogue like game that gives you many unique ways to play. Every play through gives you different items so that each time you play it feels a little different. Though as a player you do have some choice when it comes to the items that you can buy to better fit your play style. The game also has many different classes that you need to unlock. Some can be unlocked quite easily while others will take multiple play throughs as well as needing to complete specific challenges. The only negative I feel is that sometimes high HP monsters will spawn in the early stage of the game making the game feel quite tedious until you find some items to increase your DPS.			"

												There is a lot of variety here, great replay value, and it's down right addicting. You start out with little to no knowledge of what you're doing and where you're going but after a few deaths you'll find out how to succeed. Even more hectic with friends when you play on multiplayer. There are many unlockables in terms of classes/characters (my personal favorite being the Huntress) and items to find and use when playing. The music isn't bad either, definitely a distinct score. It gives you that alone feeling, with everything coming to life around you just to eat you alive :)			"

												After 150 hours of playtime and writing the Handbooks to Every Survivalists, I think I've played enough to write a review on this.What I enjoyed from Risk of Rain:-The graphics are really nice, tiny pixels but lots and lots of details!-The soundtrack is divine, really helps for immersion-The ""Time=Difficulty"" feature is great, requiring the player to manage his time correctly or else die-The amount of items is gigantic, making every run unique (Unless you've got Command..)-Talking about Command, the artifacts change the whole game and makes you play very differently-10 different characters that all plays completely differently-The game is hard. At least at first, as I don't feel challenged at all anymore, even in Monsoon (Sadly!)What I didn't like:-The Multiplayer doesn't work very well, extremely prone to crashes mid-game and unable to join back-As much as I love the artifacts, you'll only ever use 3 of them after a while (Glass, Command and Sacrifice mostly.)What I think this game needs:-A randomize button. Press it, and it chooses you a character and artifacts randomly! Since every Artifact and every Character radically change the way you'll play, that'd make Risk of Rain a game where you truly need to adapt to what you have and surely increase the playtime I have on it of another 20 hours minimum.-Less lag on multiplayer. I am unable to do runs of over 40 mins because of crashes on my friends' PCs, and if they fixed just the crashes I would play this forever.-Nerfing Command would be a good idea, because at this point it completely kills the RDM of the game. Maybe make it you can choose but you get a LOT less items on the run, so you get those you want but not as much?It's sad they don't update this game anymore, because it isn't optimized correctly, at least for multiplayer. One of the last updates greatly reduced lag on the Risk of Rain level which I am extremely grateful for, but crashes on Multiplayer kills the online fun..Still, even though I said some bad of this game, it remains an extremely good single player game with tons of replayability (140 of those hours were on solo..) and it is able to make you change your playstyle really often. Get this if you're a fan of any hard game!			"

												Frustrating? Yes, at times, but the rewards of playing are always there.Difficult? Yes, at times, but it becomes a question of, ""what can I do better next time.""Items? Each unique, different item, with their own little charms, backstories and effects, giving a nice depth to the game.Artifacts? Difficult to earn, each one providing a deeper level of play, often a double-edge sword perk, but some are just downright cruel.9 Artifact Run? ""ded"" -Risk of Rain10 Artifact Run? ""rekt"" -Risk of RainPossible to do a run in under 40 minutes? Sure. You'll probably farm some gold on each level, so you can access all the shrines, chests and other available objects, but otherwise, should be beaten in under 90 minutes per average game.The game will taunt you.The game will laugh at your misery.But the game is rewarding, there is a small learning curve, but it's the difficulty curve that is your greatest challenge.Overall 9.5/10; minor bugs and stuff that doesn't really matter, it's a really good game.Soundtrack 9/10; extremely fitting for the game, decent playlist for listening to while not playing the game.*Some users have reported some difficulties with Multiplayer, but isn't that normal with anything online?10/10 would get ""rekt"" again.

												Risk of Rain is an amazing 2-D platforming game. The story is about a guy destroying a ship and killing everyone but the Commando. Your job is to find a teleporter while killing randomly spawned enemies. Btw dont even think of camping cause the more you camp the harder the game is. Difficulity goes from Very Easy to HAHAHAHA trust me you do not wanna be in HAHAHAHA cause that is the hardest video game you will ever experience.As you progress through the game, you get money for chests and items, items to help progress through the game and also they stack so make sure any item you see just GRAB IT cause it is important.The Multiplayer is OMG AMAZING. You can play with up to 10 players. The money and XP is shared so if you kill an enemy, the money and XP scatters to the players.Also the music is just amazing. Thank you Chris Christodoulou for that awesome music. The game may be in around 8-16 bit but the music is just gorgeous.i give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficult and the lag if theres too many players or if theirs too many enemies cause if your in a area with no enemies, your FPS would br around 60 which is good.

												This is absolutely worth the buy, addictive, a real good replay ability and one of the most fun games i have ever played.Of course, its always based on the players taste, i will recommend this game for ALL medium players, new people should wait a bit to play this game, because it is quite hard and you will regret getting it, get a bit more of experience in video games and then you can enjoy I know i may not have played it alot, but i know i will.Multiplayer: a very good multiplayer with easy hosting, no need to open an individual dedicated server and configurate it until it works, either port forward it or play in LAN, host a game and have fun! I have not yet tested playing online but from what i have seen, people with bad internet will not lose game experience, it is still as playable.Combat: I have found myself mashing all the buttons when i first played it, with a German keyboard that changes the Z and Y i almost thought the first skill didnt work until i noticed it, after i found out that there is an first skill i got a lot more strategic, you cannot only stand in one place and PEI PEI PEI, you need take advantage of the enviroment since birds that can fly through walls will eventually come get you.Every character has a different skill list, i found every character that i have unlocked so far very unique. The starting class, the Commando is still my favourite and i love to play as a strategical shooter.Unlockables: This game has an HUGE ammount of different and unique items, 10 classes and it will take a while to 100% this game.Every class has a different way to be unlocked, some may be a challenge and others you will just eventually unlock them.What has surprised me the most about this game is how much items there is, and what every one of them do.I have no idea how many items this game has but everytime i find a new one it doesnt a bit like the others, one of them does something special and unique, you can also hold all of the items you find through the game!There are also ""Use items"" that serve like a 5th skill, you can only hold one and i find it hard to choose which one is coming with me, mostly the ones that the bosses drop because they are the strongest and help alot.How does it play: As the trailer says, the game gets harder as you play, it gets harder with the difficulty you choose and its already hard by default. This game is a real challenge, but the challenge is what makes it fun. While you play the game the game count for how many time you have been playing it, it will be filling a bar at the top right corner of the screen and it can get pretty stressful, you always get scared of exploring the world because you will be losing time and fears that the game is getting harder, its like someone is following you.Apparentally the game has many different levels for the stages, there is a variation of teleporter locations and levels that you will get, the map may never be the same.tl;dr: you a patient and skillful player? get it, you new to video games and not patient? dont get itvery funny thanks guysi will be playing this gamerightnow			"

												After 150 hours of playtime and writing the Handbooks to Every Survivalists, I think I've played enough to write a review on this.What I enjoyed from Risk of Rain:-The graphics are really nice, tiny pixels but lots and lots of details!-The soundtrack is divine, really helps for immersion-The ""Time=Difficulty"" feature is great, requiring the player to manage his time correctly or else die-The amount of items is gigantic, making every run unique (Unless you've got Command..)-Talking about Command, the artifacts change the whole game and makes you play very differently-10 different characters that all plays completely differently-The game is hard. At least at first, as I don't feel challenged at all anymore, even in Monsoon (Sadly!)What I didn't like:-The Multiplayer doesn't work very well, extremely prone to crashes mid-game and unable to join back-As much as I love the artifacts, you'll only ever use 3 of them after a while (Glass, Command and Sacrifice mostly.)What I think this game needs:-A randomize button. Press it, and it chooses you a character and artifacts randomly! Since every Artifact and every Character radically change the way you'll play, that'd make Risk of Rain a game where you truly need to adapt to what you have and surely increase the playtime I have on it of another 20 hours minimum.-Less lag on multiplayer. I am unable to do runs of over 40 mins because of crashes on my friends' PCs, and if they fixed just the crashes I would play this forever.-Nerfing Command would be a good idea, because at this point it completely kills the RDM of the game. Maybe make it you can choose but you get a LOT less items on the run, so you get those you want but not as much?It's sad they don't update this game anymore, because it isn't optimized correctly, at least for multiplayer. One of the last updates greatly reduced lag on the Risk of Rain level which I am extremely grateful for, but crashes on Multiplayer kills the online fun..Still, even though I said some bad of this game, it remains an extremely good single player game with tons of replayability (140 of those hours were on solo..) and it is able to make you change your playstyle really often. Get this if you're a fan of any hard game!			"

												Risk of Rain is a rogue-like game, set in a science-fiction setting. If you die, you'll have to start again, but on your way to the next teleporter you'll collect lots of passive and active items and xp, helping you to survive the enormous numbers of enemies wanting to kill you. Also you should hurry, because the longer you play, the harder the game gets.It is a good game for people who like rogue-like games, e.g.  Binding of Isaac, although I think RoR is better.I got this game as a gift and was surprised how addictive this actually is. There are lots of positive points:+ lots of different items, enemies and bosses+ is extremely addictive+ sweet soundtrack and overall atmosphere+ some cool hidden stuff like artifacts and different characters you'll be able to play.+ good and precise controls+ quite cheap and you'll be able to play local coop or online coopRegarding the graphics, I quite like them, but you should like the pixel graphics style.So this isn't a pro nor a con, because it depends on your taste of graphics.As this game is quite awesome, it isn't perfect- while you can play this with a keyboard, I feel like you should play it with a controller, which makes life way easier for you- when starting the game, it is hard as hell, but you'll get a quite op character from time to time, making the hordes of enemies later in the game rather annoying than challenging- the last boss is a real oldschool son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥ endboss. Although it would have been a strange feel to get an easy endfight after you struggled through the earlier levels, it is almost ridiculous, how difficult and long it takes to beat him.When I reached him, I already played around 55 minutes and it took me 25 minutes to beat that mofo. He is op as hell, but it is absolutely possible to beat him. I did, but found it annoying how long it took.- there are a few minor bugs, but nothing what should stop you from buying and playing this gameOverall, this game is an absolute gem you'll get for a quite cheap price, also during a sale you should probably get a four-pack for all of your friends. Of course there are some minor things I didn't like, but I think they shouldn't stop you form getting this one.Overall I'll give this one85/100			"

												Risk of Rain is a Indie/Platformer with rogue-like elements. In Risk of Rain you fight through hordes of Enemies that spawn on the level your in and they keep spawning more over time as you try to go through the level, collecting items, killing the Enemie waves, and trying to find the teleporter/exit. You get Gold and Exp. through killing the Enemies that you can use to unlock chests or pray to shrines to get access to items that help you through the game. When you get to the teleporter you have to fight through a 90 sec. spawning wave while trying to kill the boss of that level. The game gets harder the longer you play. It starts off very easy and it can go to the hahaha difficulty if you survive a long enough time. The point of Risk of Rain is to survive as long as you can while trying to get a lot of items that can help you throughout the game and to help you kill the final boss....if you can survive that long that is...Mwahahahah.

Risk Of RainThis game is like Mario Bros on serious steroids and an element thrown in.....One Death. This equals up to intense game play with the thought of ""this is it or nothing"" the entire time.The music adds to the strangeness of it all. Very interstellar, on another planet sound and speeking of sound, the sound FX will rock your speakers!!!!Also, plenty of buffs to stack! If there is a limit, I have not encountered it. Which makes ""one death"" not so bad if you have around 15 buffs to help you out. Some of them are almost God mode. So how do the enemy NPC's compete againts this? Their difficulty level increases over time. So at the start, all are on Very Easy mode. Then in around 30 minutes all the NPC's are Very Hard mode. Which makes things severly intense!So is there a down side to ROR??? Well, to some people they cannot stand the retro 80's pixelated graphics. Me on the other hand was raised on this and embrace any video game that takes me back to the good ol' days of video games. JUST BUY IT! "

Who needs sleep when your commando's basic double shot becomes lasers that proc missiles, missiles, mortars that deal over a hundred times your shot's damage, lifesteal per shot, electricity procs, every 4th shot penetrates an enemy...blah blah blah. 11/10 would spam Z again.

												Risk of Rain is an amazing 2-D platforming game. The story is about a guy destroying a ship and killing everyone but the Commando. Your job is to find a teleporter while killing randomly spawned enemies. Btw dont even think of camping cause the more you camp the harder the game is. Difficulity goes from Very Easy to HAHAHAHA trust me you do not wanna be in HAHAHAHA cause that is the hardest video game you will ever experience.As you progress through the game, you get money for chests and items, items to help progress through the game and also they stack so make sure any item you see just GRAB IT cause it is important.The Multiplayer is OMG AMAZING. You can play with up to 10 players. The money and XP is shared so if you kill an enemy, the money and XP scatters to the players.Also the music is just amazing. Thank you Chris Christodoulou for that awesome music. The game may be in around 8-16 bit but the music is just gorgeous.i give this game 9 out of 10 due to the difficult and the lag if theres too many players or if theirs too many enemies cause if your in a area with no enemies, your FPS would br around 60 which is good.

 Description Risk of Rain is an action platformer/adventure game with randomized elements. The game is set in the distant future, where space transportation is common. Space trains carry passengers and goods all across space. A particular space train, however, had some very special cargo. Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor. Review Enjoyable game with high replayability and unfair difficulty.[+] Pros- Fresh gameplay- Randomized encounter- Permadeath- Twelve characters with his/her/its own tactic and playstyle- Three difficulties to playa. Drizzle (Not even casual)b. Rainstorm (Don't be panic, dude)c. Monsoon (Motherfather anchestor of Dark Souls)- Increasing difficulty after the game starts- Online and Local Co-Op- Simple but cool art and music[-] Cons- Bit buggy- Frame dropsFrustating, but really fun.

												Risk of Rain. Not really sure why they named it.

Every time you die you get to restart, but do not fear! while the game can be tough, but the items you get along the way and the characters skills can help you get through the levels.The enemies aren't as diverse as they could be, but it still provides a lot of randomization and that along with different classes and items provides replayability. Three difficulties allows you to play the game your way, slowing the progression of enemies or speeding it up.The games difficulty scales over time, providing an exciting system of difficulty, to the point where bosses will eventually spawn as normal enemies, and normal enemies will be nearly as strong.Risk of Rain provides an endless amount of fun for hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike, along with alot of unlikes it's sure to keep you busy for a while.

												Risk of Rain is a spectacular game that I wish I had known about long ago. It is easily one of my favorite games considering its replay value, difficulty, and the absolute carnage in-game. The gameplay is really fun, especially since you are annihilating hordes of mobs with class specific skills and items found in the zones you explore. Risk of Rain starts out fairly easy, but as the timer increases, so does the difficulty. This means a 90 minute game will have bosses, elite units, and waves of other enemies swarming you as you try to reach the endgame. All of this and it has multiplayer. In my opinion the best parts about Risk of Rain are the numerous items you can find on each level and the high skill cap that may be intimidating to new players at first. But fear not, as this game is really fun once you figure out your playstyle and strategy to advance through the zones and reach the final boss. Risk of Rain is a fresh breath in the world of 2D Coop Tough-as-Nails rogue-like indie action shooter-platformers with a great soundtrack, so buy it.			"

												I had had my eye on this one for a while, and when a friend asked me if I wanted to play I impulse bought it on the spot. It turned out to be not only one of my best sale purchases this holiday season, but one of the better games I have played in a long time.It is essentially a hardcore roguelike styled action platformer, shortform and with huge amounts of replayability due to colectables, quite a wealth of characters with 4 different abilities each and a plethora of items to unlock and pick up.- Story: There is not much of an initial story except for the opening cinematic, but as you unlock more characters and monster logs through the game more of the story is filled in. At no point was there a moment where I had to stop and look at the story so far, as it is an action platformer ultimately rather than some long winded fantasy sci-fi epic, but the way the devs have filled in bits of story via logs and such is quite well done.- Sound: Music wise, the developers have chosen quite apt styles of music for the different stages, while creating an atmosphere that suits the gameplay and themes quite well. The sound effects are something else though; each enemy has an attacking noise, as do the weapons and powerups you accrue, and eventually you get to know the sounds of each. This doesn't sound like much, but in a game such as this these sounds are both well fitting and incredibly useful to keep track of enemies in your vicinity.- Gameplay: I think of this as a side scrolling version of Binding of Isaac meets Super House of Dead Ninjas, with an added layer (or 40) of difficulty.Each playthrough is different and items per each run can make or break it for you, as they can in BoI. However, the mechanics and verticality are far more similar to SHoDN, with things being frantic on the screen most of the time. All of this combined makes the game quite fun to play through, and I highly recommend it.As always, it is perhaps best to watch videos of the game before buying, and it is rather difficult alone. If you have a couple of friends to play with it is an absolute blast, and after you unlock a few things playing solo is also quite doable. As of yet I have not gotten to/beat the final stage/boss, but even after I have I will keep playing to unlock more items that become available. Definitely a recommended purchase.This was my first reviews as well, hope it helps someone out there!			"

												Solid buy, and you can get it for very cheap - although I would recommend paying the full price because its developers definitely deserve that. Good intense action in singleplayer and even better with friends in co-op. I remember having slight issues in multiplayer but it was so fun and addicting nevertheless that it didn't matter.			"

												I've reched the end of the game! WOW finally!...yes, after about 2 days after i bought this game I finally reached the end of the game. This is NOT just another rogue like game like the others. from the character selection screen you choose what kind of game you are willing to have.Want to tank? ok take a tank Want to have a balanced game ok take a balanced character.From that moment you must pplay with a certain playstyle to reach the end of the game.It took me 98 minutes to reach the end of the game. And you are probably thinking , ""Well that is not so long""thats true, but ive been playing the game for 10 hours the past 2 days just to get good enough to get to the end.I give this game a 9/10 because sometimes you fall trough the level, or you cant move etc. those are game breaking bugs.

												This game is awesome. Buy it if you have friends or enjoy rogue-lites.  The reason this game is awesome is because it is perfect for an hour of entertainment if one day you feel bored and don't have the energy to play anything else, but you can also go full achivment hunter and go on the grind to unlock ever single character,steam achivment, and item in this game and spend hours doing that.Now the best reason to get this game if you have friends and they are willing to play a rouglite with you or enjoy getting there♥♥♥♥♥kicked in a game.But be prepared to yell at your friends for sucking or having them yell at you for sucking.Speaking of sucking be prepared to do that, a lot.

												Impossible to unlike it, when you like rogue-like games. Great characters, doesn't end after few plays, secret artifacts (love them), many actually challenging challenges, every new game is better than earlier one, harder with time, really many items.You really need to be stupid to not like this game. It is perfect. And get's more perfect when played with friends.Totally recommended. 10/10.			"

												Really drags you in once you try it. I couldn't help myself and just went on playing with the purpose to reach 100% achievements, however stopped at 97% with few monster logs missing. It has an enormous replay value, which sadly ends once you unlock some artifacts (Kin, Glass, Command, Sacrifice) and items (infusion, chargefield generator). Once you get them, starting on a lemurian map, grabbing early infusion and stacking on barbed wire soon makes you and unstoppable ball of death and after 30 minutes of farming you always beat monsoon regardless of the character choice. That kinda killed the fun for me, as I couldn't just go back to the regular style of playing after trying that. All in all though, the point where you can possibly roll through the maps every time you play start after you've played for some 20 hours or so already (if you are fresh new to the game), probably less if you've played it before or read the wikis a lot.Before that I still had lots of fun, trying to survive, which is not always that simple. If you play it the regular way, your every gameplay will be different, some items will make cleaning the levels a breeze, while other sets will push you to change your strategy in order to prevent your painful death. The graphics might be a little archaic, but I think it synergizes well with the game overall and it actually looks pretty neat. The background music is prefect as for a space survival game, it fits well with the atmosphere of being on another planet, alone. Another great thing about the game are the monster logs, which I found very well written and enjoyable to collect and read.RoR doesn't escape few minor bugs like item containers (the always come in three and you can buy only one item) sometimes spawn all in the same place, so you can't even really see what you might get or some items not working properly sometimes (looking at you Imp Overlord's tentacle), but it's nothing gamebreaking. For me, the most annoying issue was the FPS rate in later stages of the game, I mean, I don't really have a gaming rig (yet), but for a game that doesn't involve any too complex graphics, I think it should run smoother rather than lowering my details to the minimum and the FPS rate dropping to 20-30 (which also affects the clock, so the in-game time is not the same a real life time).Still, for such a low price, this game is well-worth buying. It costs like 3 euro, when there's a discount running, which is a funny price for the fun I've had, especially with the AAA games having 5-10 hours of gameplay with no replay value at the cost of 40 euros. I recommend it to everyone who likes games with roguelike elements and is a completionist freak like me.			"

												This game offers a nice combination of retro platformer and roguelike, with a touch of modern video games (particularly mobas) I rate it 8/10From an artstyle perspective, they nail it perfectly. The pixel art in the game is beautiful, detailed and not just thrown in there to give it the classic indie platformer artstyle, you can see that all the art has had lots of work go into it, rather than a lot of games that go with very simplistic shapes and objects and then pixelate them to cover the gap in the art skills of the team.The soundscape works amazingly with the game, you truly feel like you're exploring a strange planet where little makes sense and even less isn't trying to kill you.Finally, the gameplay. While simple and to some degree repetitive (jump, shoot, kite, repeat) it keeps it fresh with loads of different classes, all with very different playstyles. The platforming is tight, the combat is very fun and highly enjoyable, and the randomised mechanics improve the games longevity significantly. In addition, coop play is extremely fun, and probably the biggest draw of the game.The game does lose points for the random factor though, levels, enemy 'mutators' and the item drops are randomly generated each game, but the bosses are always usually the same and the levels are very samey. This doesn't detract severely, but I feel after 2 or 3 runs, you've seen everything the game has to offer, a lot of games suffer this and it's not always an issue (e.g. Killing Floor) but I feel that the game runs out of surprises fairly quickly.The one exception is the items, the items are the best part of the game by far, nearly all of them are unique and most of them are thoroughly enjoyable. The background lore of each item is interesting (and at times hilarious) and the craziness of certain item combos gets you hooked and wanting more. I think they did an amazing job on the item design and the pacing of how they are deployed to the player (you unlock items through repeated play throughs, granting them as potential drops for next game)Overall, RoR is an excellent game, it has some small flaws, but in general the gameplay is excellent and the art and sound direction are beautiful. I'm hard pressed to find many indie games that compare to it's level of polish. I eagerly await future updates to the game with even more content and features!			"

												I am terrible at this game, and havn't played it nearly enough, but it is a ton of fun and really well made.  It's a rogue-like action platformer.  The game gets more and more difficult the longer you play.  Unlock characters, all with unique abilities and playstyles, as you make your way through the game fighting hordes of enemies, and massive bosses.  Collect a massive amount of items too, all with their own benefits (or disadvantage).  This game can be played single player, as well as with a lot of friends.			"

												Risk of Rain is a truly excellent game with amazing enemy and item variety, well designed and subtley altered levels every game as well as a good selection of characters to pick from. It is a great side scrolling open platformer/shooter/nommer/exploder that keeps you hooked for hours. I will be playing so much more of this game. The soundtrack is sublime, a mix of electronic synths with glockenspiels and metallaphones with time signatures to fry your brains it is worth opening Spotify or Youtube (go to the composer Chris Christodoulou's channel) and listen to the whole thing. Masterpiece.One thing of note is the online functionality at time of writing is a mess, unfortunately there is no LAN and the system for connecting requires one to open up ports in their internet, so it is a fiddly process.

												Ignore what Steam says, I've been playing the game for well over 60 hours.If you want a challenge, Risk of Rain does not disappoint. Although the concept of getting to the teleporter at the end of each level is simple, and there are only 6 levels in any single playthrough, it just doesn't get old. Ever. After dying 2-3 times I looked up at the clock and an hour and a half had passed. The incredibly addicting gameplay and a near endless amount of items give this game a very similar feel to The Binding of Issac.It's hard, but not unfair.Difficult, but rewarding.Sometimes makes you rage and throw your computer, then pick it back up again and give it 'one more go'.There are tons of unlockables and achivements to test your skill. Beating them unlocks more items and characters as to help you make it further in your next run. Like I said, there are only 6 levels in any one playthrough, but the first four can be switched at random, leading to a total of 10 areas and more to explore. Different stages spawn different enemies, and your teleporter, chests, items, and idols won't be in the same place during your next run. Heck, the same bosses won't even show up. I'd been playing the game for 2 days and found a boss I'd never seen before. Beating the game requires both skill and luck to get the right items. And since no two playthroughs will ever be the same, you can't just expect to get the items you've been hoping for, but you make what you get work.If you like tough games, lots of variety, and simple gameplay that just doesn't get old; Buy Risk of Rain.Also, I can honestly say this game has one of the most fun and just downright enjoyable (yet difficult) final bosses I've seen in a game, which has also become a personal favorite of mine.There isn't much that this game does wrong. 9/10			"

												Perhaps one of the best 10$ games out there.I sincerely recommend you to buy this game.Now here's my reasoning on the games contents.Music 10/10Nicely orchestrated music, you can see that Chris Christofensenchris (sorry do not know the last name but it has a lot of Chris in it) actually worked to provide music to fit each level, and often moments too. Very relaxing while you're blasting away on the enemies that come.Story 10/10It provides discoverable items that the specific mobs drop, that give you more intell on them (Including a background story) not to mention that the games main story is simplistic yet fitting perfectly.Gameplay 10/10 Now here's the fun, you collect coins by killing enemies, theres plenty of rewards in the form of chests, statues and more spread over each level, finding the chests, collecting the loot, getting more powerful as your enemies get more powerful each level, and each 5? minutes you spent in game. This balances out perfectly the random odds of the items you gain. You can find ""use"" items that are very powerful, and go on cooldown after each use. Not to mention that all the power-up's (Besides use items) stack, so getting a bonus twice is nothing less than still a great reward (as the bonus will be enhanced.)I've picked up many games for this amount of money, plenty even over. This is just pixelated greatness and 10$ is WAY below the actual worth in fun you'll have if this is your type of game.You can play it Co-op to upto 4 players, there's plenty different characters with unique abilities, secret findables and more to keep you occupied and coming back for more.Definitely near or even on top of my recommendations.Check the videos, see if this game is to your liking. If you like what you see, you're definitely going to LOVE what you get.From the creators of such goodness as Starbound, yet another VERY SUCCESFUL title. A MUST BUY.			"

												If DotA, Rouge Legacy, Terraria and the Binding of Issac all went to a secret lab and mixed their genes together to create some horrific splice clone of themselves, it would probably be hedious and die in mere moments due to the gene pool overload. But if you took conceps from all those games and mashed them together in one small package and threw it in space, you would end up with this absolutly awsome game.Interesting and random levels? Check.Insane and hilarious item combinations? Check.Fun and crazy Caracter classes? Check.Awsome soundtrack, stylish visuals and loads of personality with minimal words? Check.A touch of mystery, even when you arent playing alone? Check.A metric Naval Vessel full of alien enemies to satisfyingly bash, shoot, crush and blow up? Double check.If you are looking for a fun time, both by yourself or with freinds, then buy this game.			"

												+ Good pixel graphics with a great style.+ Probably the best video game soundtrack I've listened to in a while.+ Fun and engaging gameplay.+ Very high replay value.+ A wide variety of items and classes.+ Challenging.+ A great co-op experience...- ...however, lagging can cause game-breaking glitches and sessions with more than 2 or 3 players usually result in a failure due to a lack of items. It's possible, but it requires actual co-operation and luck.- A little too RNG-based. Started out with bad items? Tough luck, you're going to die.- Framerate drops occur late into the game and slow everything down. (although this somewhat helps)Risk of Rain probably is my favorite roguelike game. It takes a little while to get into, but it's very fun once you get the hang of it. It's also one of the few games which I purchased at their full price and I can definitely say it was totally worth it.8.5/10 "

												★★★★★★★★☆☆Really fun rogue-like platformer. It's a difficult game to begin with, but as with games like this, the more you play it the better you become. There's a diverse range of enemies, bosses and unlockable characters to play, but the pick-ups recieved aren't all that different as they mostly modify a property of your health or damage. It's not all that noticable, but certainly is something to consider.The levels aren't randomly generated, but the locations of objects within the level are. At first it seemed like this would get tiresome, but it allows you to become familiar with each map layout, exploting different points with different characters.Pros:  Fun yet difficult, lots of bosses, classes and enemies, randomly generated objects on the map.Cons: Somewhat similar pick-ups when looked at as a whole.8/10.

												What happens when you leave a couple college students alone in their room with Gamemaker studio and a plethora of games from their past to influence them? Risk of Rain happens. A genre bending, wait...make that a blended indie sweetheart who made it through the trenches of the Steam Greenlight program. Cross a roguelike with metroidvania, sprinkle on some 4 player co-op and dangle a tasty bunch of useful collectibles in front and you’re left with one of the best co-op games I’ve played this year.For a game where I’ve died more times than survived, it feels weird recommending Risk of Rain. I usually warn players against overly difficult games unless they know what they are getting into, but I can’t express how important it is to experience Risk of Rain. The variety of items, enemies, and environments gives it almost infinite replay value. Players are free to experiment with team combinations, item loadouts, and classes. The unlockable items and challenges will keep even the most hardcore busy, but it is really all about grabbing a group of space travellers and dying over and over again.			"

												I wanna write a legit review for this game, cause 90% of my reviews are troll ones that somehow get people offended. (via comment war) OTHERWISE let's get into it.This game is difficult. know that and know it well, You're gonna die a lot. So if you get frustrated easily...glhf.Risk of rain is a 2d shooter which has some of my favorite kinds of things, Items with effects that help you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥upyes, that's right. ♥♥♥♥.♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. Not only that the game gets super fun when collecting more and STACKING these items, so let's say you stack x3 with a item that makes you go fast, guess what? you're apparently the ♥♥♥♥ing flash now. (<- good)Like the binding of Isaac it gets difficult the further you go, however in this game, it's way different. There are three main difficulties you can pick, Drizzle, Rainstorm, and Monsoon. (wow rain!) This is the base difficulty, I'd recommend Drizzle if you're new just to get the mechanics of characters down really.But difficulty does not stop there. You're difficulty INCREASES by the amount of time you spend, so don't go pickin flowers son. It can get to the point where the difficulty bar literally laughs at you. ♥♥♥♥in demonic♥♥♥♥♥♥You start with the Commando, first character and a personal favorite of mine. From there you start unlocking more characters, I'm not gonna list them all cause there's guides to  tell you all about the characters and shiz like that.So now comes the question, SHOULD you buy it? Is it worth your money? Yes. If you like challenge, this is one hell of a challenge. or if you like 2d shooters, go for it. oh and multiplayer is wonky at times soo keep that in mind. otherwise tl:dr - fun shooter that is difficult.

												If the phrase ""Binding of Isaac multiplayer platformer"" excites you, buy this game. It's a constant race of terror and explosions, until you master it and stack items to the ceiling and blow huge monsters apart in moments, which is incredibly satisfying. It's an absolute blast with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of replayability.			"

												One of my all-time favourite roguelikes. Characters are actually worth unlocking. Local multipayer is fun, but will be a little hard unless you have a gamepad. No huge problems with the game. I've been playing on and off ever since I got the game, and I never get tired of it. The game should seriously get some more recognition, the art, music, and gameplay are far above average.			"

												 You wouldn't expect much from the game when it's graphical fidelity is so low, but oh boy, if you enjoy the rogue genre, such like FTL, you will not get dissapointed.Fast action paced and a good variance is brought by the unlocks you gather over time as well as the different difficulty's.I can certainly recommend it for anyone, oh and the music is god damn awesome as well.

												Risk of Rain is both unique and the same as any other game with Permadeath. What makes a game different if it's the same game but unique at the same time? Gameplay and the way you change it and interact with it, just a bit. Music, sound and art style counts to.Most games (But not all games) with Permadeath has a recurring Dungeon Crawler theme, go in with nothing, explore, grab the loot and kill enemies to become stronger to reach the goal. Now ""Reach the goal"" can change dramatically how the gameplay difficulty is. Make the goal short makes the gameplay harder and make the goal longer makes the gameplay easier but makes you on edge not to die, like Diablo III or Path of Exile. There is also games with no clear goal(Minecraft and Terraria) that makes the gameplay the same even if permadeath is on, It only makes you on edge when you play.Risk of Rain uses the short goal way(short goal, harder gameplay) but it change the gameplay difficulty to a more timely manner, Time = Difficult. The longer you play the harder the game is. Suddenly the pattern is change, short goal with progressive(time) difficulty. With that pattern and the easy to play controls and the fun easy gameplay becomes much much enjoyable. It's like surfing, riding the difficulty and feel that you can do enything, as long your on the surfing board.I highly recommend you buy it and play it with a friend. It's one of those games that I can play again and again without feeling bored of it's mechanics. A fun unique game.			"

												I had no idea what I was getting into when I first got this game, outside of videos I've sparingly watched. Consider me very pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying not just the story, but the art style, the gameplay, and even the way the updates offered new content - y'know, back when it was constantly updating.It's still buggy, it still needs a bit of optimization, and it would greatly benefit from going on sale and getting updated more often, but even now it's still a great game I can't help but want to see more people play.

												A solid (and nicely priced) game, Risk of Rain is fun and the perfect introduction for newbies into the genre of games with roguelike elements. It's easy to jump into, controls are simple, lots of hidden unlockables for replayability, and the gameplay is straightforward. The straightforward gameplay has its pro's and con's. Personally, I think that it limits the game somewhat, because it does seem more repetitive than say, Binding of Isaac or Spelunky. The randomized levels don't make much of an impact here than it does in Spelunky. And the loose-nature of RPG-styled combat makes battles less intense compared to Binding of Isaac. But the lack of complexity, IMO, is what makes multiplayer possible and enjoyable. Now... if only there was matchmaking for the online.			"

												Woot! Having a ton of fun with this game so far. It's fast, frantic and completely chaotic at times. Since the game's difficulty scales with time spent versus character level, it forces you to keep up your pace or risk falling beneath the power level of the monsters. One of my only complaints for this game is it can become difficult to tell what's happening when particularly large groups of monsters (or groups of particularly large monsters!) and attack animations are going off. Definately the sort of game that you can play in a half-hour stint, or a four hour binge. There is a large variety of meta-game unlockables (including new items to find in-game and new classes) that keeps you wanting one more round. Co-op is tons of fun as well! Local works perfectly, and while I ran into a few (mostly minor graphical) issues with the online co-op it was still incredibly fun and didn't detract much from the experience. Recommend!8.5/10Pros:-Multiple difficulty settings for rookies to vets-Unique unlockable character classes-Crisp, fast-paced action-Play alone! Play split-screen with friends beside you! Play online with friends everywhere!-Cool soundtrack/art style... + explosionsCons-Minor issues with online co-op-Action can become obscured by... the action			"

												This is in no way a bad review, this is only a warning to those buying the game with friends, hoping to play it right after the instalation from the get go. There is set up required on the hosts end and if you're not up to the task don't expect to play with friends.Game is great, love the game. only thing is setting up port forwarding is sometimes not an option and on top of that, the game is more finicky about it even when you've port forwarded correctly and still able to host a Terraria server or a Starbound server. There could have been a better way to do online for the game. At the very least an easier way.			"

												9/10Overview: 2d Rogue-Action/Platformer The Good:+10 characters each with their own unique attack and abilities. +Randomized levels every time you start a new game. +Over 100 items ensuring lots of variety+Plenty of things to unlock. You first start out with only one character: the commando and a handful of items. As you play and complete challenges, you unlock more characters and items making it easier to get to the end of the game. +Every good rogue game I've played has a nice sense of pacing. What seems like an impossible task in the beginning slowly becomes easier once you start understanding the mechanics. Making it to the last boss is a very satisfying feeling. + One of the main premises of the game is that as time goes on, the harder enemies become. This creates somewhat of an interesting balance to the game. Normally you may think that you should just complete each level as fast as possible however this may leave you underpowered in the next level. Take too long in a level and you may find the enemies too hard to defeat. Finding the right balance between killing enemies, collecting as many items in a level and staying above the difficulty curve is part of the strategy. + I love the music. Fantastic soundtrack. The Average:Although there are 10 character to choose from, some of them are not that good compared to others and some were designed with multiplayer in mind. Online multiplayer community is dead ConclusionThis is one of my favorite rogue games on steam. It has an addicting quality to it. Playing each character, getting rare items and having a good run is one of the hallmarks of a great rogue game.			"

												It is not uncommon for human beings to find themselves bored with the monotony of regular life. Day after day we find ourselves experiencing new things, yet we still long for something. We feel as if we need an escape from the world in which we find ourselves. This need has given rise to a plethora of movies, books, and games, among many other things, to distract us from our life. It is with this same feeling that I decided to embark upon such a distraction.Leaping forth to immerse myself in a new world, I was excited at the new possibilities it offered. Although my character's landing had been rough, I was optimistic for the future. What never before seen wonders would I uncover. What beauty that had yet to grace the sight of man would I be blessed to lay my eyes upon? The imagination of man falls short in the face reality and I knew not what I would come across. The wonderous awe I felt as my feet touched the ground of this new world would be torn brutally away. Naïvety soon wears out its welcome, as did I apparently.What followed was a quick and horrifying descent into madness. As I gazed upon the flora of this new world, never having seen comparable beauty in Earth's, I was soon greeted with the fauna. A surprising variety of creatures met me with death in their minds. I fought as hard as I could, killing many, but the longer I lingered, the more arrived and the more dangerous they were. An endless flood of enemies assailed me, precious little time was I safe.Worse still were the monsters who were so much greater than the others. Towering beasts of great strength and tenacity hunted me down. Desperation seeped deep into my bones and I began to savour those rare moments when the creatures of a new area had yet to discover my presence.I would watch as the many different beings who so oft fell dead before me lived. They went about their bussiness, so similar to the animals of Earth. Realization struck me, I was the alien in this world, the terrifying invader. I represented an outside force that, if I was being totally honest, would in all likelyhood destroy this world's life for greed.It allowed me to take a step back and gain a new perspective on my existence. 'My' fight for survival, humanity's fight for survival, comes at a great cost. What right did I have to murder so many, just so I could continue on? In what way can I justify so many lives lost for my own? The same can be said for us as a whole. We slaughter our way through countless animals without a second thought. We do not visit new land, we destory it. We do not give to this world, we take from it. It's an eye-opening experience in which everyone should partake. This game is no mere escape, it is a wake up call. Scared and confused by my new outlook on life, I was in a daze. My only consolation whilst traversing this desolate virtual land... it never rained.			"

												When I first saw this game I didn't know If I was going to like it. . . I'm weary over games with graphics like this and side-scroller shooters. . . now I am Hooked. . . The game is hard. Really hard, yet very simple in design. This is one of those games that it is ok to die for the game is fair and as you play you unlock tools to help you progress.The rewards are high and the replay-ability is quite high.  The game changes up every time you play and you can let the game become harder as you feel fit. The achievements, when gotten feel like you have really earned that achievement. All and all one of the best games I bought thus far.I'm very happy that this game came as a pleasant surprise.I will say a few things on the other side.Sometimes the controls do seem to derp but not often.The game can cause some levels of frustration but I do like that some might not.I do recommend playing with an Xbox controller. . but can be ok with playing with a keyboard.If you get it have fun.It may look like it's a small package but it is huge and the images don't really let you know how fun this game can be. .. it is fine solo and awesome with a group. ..

												Is for games like Risk Of Rain, each i day think Indies are the future! In Risk Of Rain we did crashed on weird strange planet full of monsters anf loot to find and the teleporters you so desperately need to get back to your now scuffed up transport ship to get out of dodge, and in order to do that we need to survive a wave of 3min and kill all the monsters! It features beautiful pixel art and a awesome soundtrack. Besides Single Player, you can enjoy it in local or online co-op mode, witch can be much harder. There are 10 classes to choose from but only 1 is available at start. The other class you will unlock when you complete some task (some can bit a hard), but right from the begging you have the Comando Class, witch is nice class to use, it has a nice set of skill and you can easily complete the game with that.All class are good in their own way, a quick example would be the Enforcer, since it has a shield can take more damaged. But it lacks in one thing, the replay value is good but after a while gets boring because the world are always the same, i would wish if we had more world to explore and kills those monsters.  But with the awesome SP, COOP and the lovely OST this game is must! ~ 9/10			"

												All the other reviews on the store page will tell you its genre and gameplay mechanics, so you already know all about how awesome those are.  Instead, I'll tell you about what will happen after you obtain this game and try it out:First, you'll be a little overwhelmed by the enemies and quickly advancing difficulty.  But, you'll figure out a good strategy or two for taking on some enemies, and feel pretty good about it.  ""Perhaps this wasn't a bad purchase,"" you'll think.Second, you'll begin to realize that several hours have passed and you have started over a few times.  You have two full rows of items at your disposal and you're going back through the first level for the second time.  You'll wonder if perhaps you should go to bed.Third and finally, you'll experience a burning desire to play this game when you have some free time.  You'll listen to the soundtrack regularly because it's so delicious, and you'll see little item or teleporter outlines when you close your eyes at night.  You'll be able to identify and name all the items you see by icon alone, in no time.It's really a wonderful game!  I had no idea, until I got sucked in.			"

I am not critiquing the game, merely reviewing it.-In Risk of Rain you are a traveler on a space courier ship that's attacked by a mysterious... thing. Causing you to fall to the ground of an unfamiliar alien planet, where you fight for your life. Picking up items dropped by the ship and ultimately finding your way back to the fallen ship to fight the menace and leave the planet.When you first go into the game, you walk around the landscape and monsters will start to spawn, though slowly at first. You will then kill them, as they threaten your life, picking up their gold, which you then use to buy items out of the chests that have fallen down with you. When you first start playing, you will only have a small selection of items to find, but as you play more, you will unlock more, and these are persistant across lives. The difficulty increases over time, making monsters tougher and making them spawn more often, until you either die, or finish the game.  So, is it good? Hell yes. It definitely is fun to play. It has a nice growth curve towards the start, both with unlocking items through ""achievements"" -eg, kill 20 golems in one life, or activate the third teleporter without taking damage- and through increases in player skill, both with the game and with it's myriad of classes. Classes that, are unlocked through slightly bigger and harder versions of the achievements for items. -eg, kill 3 bosses or activate 40 drones in total.- It also has nice gameplay, that although slow towards the start of a game, gets progressively harder and faster paced as time goes on.Expect to die in your first few runs.The items are fun to use, with most of them providing unique effects that are not just simple stat bonuses. It's really refreshing. Having good items for your class is another challenge the game throws at you, as they all have different movesets with cooldowns as you use them, and different items will complement different classes much more than others. But of course, this all depends on what strategy you are using.Though there are complaints to be had.Risk of rain has a nasty thing called randomness, this can be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint. Some runs will be really easy, since you got good items from the -mostly- random chests, but others can be sabotaged by bad drops. Although I find that this can be overcome by player skill (and slightly balanced by the stat leveling system the game employs) this is a quirk of the genre that  can be good or bad. It makes the good runs stand out, certainly, but putting it the time to get there, at least initally, can be a slog. (I personally like it... now).The game is also short, but very high quality. Being a completionist, I have put a disproportionate amount of hours in. -More if you count the fact that I did most of the early game offline. It's not a big immersive rpg. It's a short sharp game you will play for, a week maybe, and will have you utterly hooked. it provides a unique blend of elements that makes it stand out and provide an experience like no other. You can keep coming back to it, sure, but it's not going to change much, and you will get bored of it eventually.UPDATE.Recently, however, there was an update the added artifacts that can change the game significantly, this can make the round you are playing unique to you and anyone else playing with you. This adds a new level of replayability to the game, making it last for much longer.I hope I've provided some insight.			"

												When I first saw this game I didn't know If I was going to like it. . . I'm weary over games with graphics like this and side-scroller shooters. . . now I am Hooked. . . The game is hard. Really hard, yet very simple in design. This is one of those games that it is ok to die for the game is fair and as you play you unlock tools to help you progress.The rewards are high and the replay-ability is quite high.  The game changes up every time you play and you can let the game become harder as you feel fit. The achievements, when gotten feel like you have really earned that achievement. All and all one of the best games I bought thus far.I'm very happy that this game came as a pleasant surprise.I will say a few things on the other side.Sometimes the controls do seem to derp but not often.The game can cause some levels of frustration but I do like that some might not.I do recommend playing with an Xbox controller. . but can be ok with playing with a keyboard.If you get it have fun.It may look like it's a small package but it is huge and the images don't really let you know how fun this game can be. .. it is fine solo and awesome with a group. ..

												I'm bad at writing reviews, so I'll just do a Pros and Cons list:Pros:1) Godly Soundtrack2) Easy enough to learn3) Randomized level layout each playthrough4) Tons of items to unlock and collect5) 11 characters to choose fromCons:1) This game is hard2) Game makes you feel like a loser for dying3) You will die a lot4) platforming is a tad unforgiving5) You need to unlock 10 of the charactersPersonal comments:This game is WAY WAY outside of my gaming comfort zone. I got it out of curiosity, and because an old friend recommened it a long time ago. I'm very bad at it right now, but something about the game makes me want to get better at it. So far I'm loving it and am starting to develop strategies.P.S. Jellyfish suckP.S.S. Snake Eyes suck			"

												Similar Games:Super Smash Bros, The Binding of Isaac and to a lesser degree TerrariaThe Good:A fun mix of a roguelike action platformer with boss battles thrown in.The artwork, while sticking to the retro trend, still manages to be impressive.The item variation is well-designed with unique names and artwork for each.The timer element definitely increases the tension as well as the excitement as the game progresses.Similar to The Binding of Isaac, the items you find can make the difference between “a good run” and a fairly quick and brutal death.Levels are quasi-randomized, adding to the unique feel of each run.Multiplayer is a ton of fun (although with a caveat – see The Bad).Higher difficulty levels/later stages get just plain crazy with the amount of carnage on the screen (again, with a caveat – see The Bad).The playable characters vary greatly, with the unlockable ones requiring a fair amount of skill to play.The game allows you to beat the game in a “straight run” or revisit earlier levels to farm items before attempting the last boss.The music fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly, although after a couple playthroughs you’ll be wishing there was more than a handful of tracks.The Bad:The jump timing is a bit off. More than a few times, I’ve missed a simple jump because the game couldn’t process that I was hitting move and spacebar simultaneously.Multiplayer is more fun than single player, however…Multiplayer has a number of bugs: 1) If you die, sometimes you can’t switch between spectating the remaining players 2) The boss timer tends to display different information to each player, e.g. I’ll see the timer has finished while the other player sees 15 seconds, etc 3) A fairly cryptic error message will sometimes appear in the upper left corner of the screen, then disappear.The multiplayer lobby needs a few tweaks, such as leaving the IP visible, letting players re-select characters, showing character names/abilities, etc.Once you reach higher difficulty levels and/or the final stage, the game lags horribly due to the amount of items on-screen at once.A game running on Steam in 2013 requiring a direct IP connection makes no sense.This game does not like alt-tabbing.Sometimes the game just crashes for no apparent reason.The Writing:Most roguelikes skimp on the writing, but Risk of Rain actually has a fair amount of quality writing contained in the item log. Aside from that, the writing is limited to randomized one-liners when multiplayer participants die, half of which sound like they were written by someone either in middle school or from ♥♥♥♥♥.Did I make time to complete it?Definitely – although The Bad may seem to outweigh The Good, this game is still one of my top games of 2013. I’ve played Risk of Rain since the beta, and the full Steam version for over 16 hours.Recommended Purchase Price:This game is *easily* worth $9.99 – I’d pay $20 without hesitation.or200% of current retail value of $9.99Reviewer:Mudlabhttp://www.gamersglance.com "

												Risk of Rain, is one of those games that reminds you why 2D is still relevant. Despite the fact that the sprites are very small (and I mean very, bring your glasses) the games runs amazingly well and is very rewarding. The ability to use different characters and play with friends is also a huge  in its favour. What also makes the game so much fun is the ramdom power you compile along the journey. This creates some really cool and unique situation that rerquire different play stiles each time.I would give this a solid 8/10.Ticklepants			"

												There is a certain appeal to rogue-like games and Risk of Rain is no exception to it. The game offers a replayable challenge through randomization of levels, items and monsters. There are many achievements to complete and things to unlock. Most of all the game is hard and it gets increasingly harder the longer you ""survive"". The game is easy to learn and the learning curve feels absolutely natural. This game is a great experience.			"

												Risk of Rain is an enjoyable Rogue-Like action focused platformer with a great soundtrack. Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game. Risk of Rain is a Rogue-Like platformer that has 10 classes; each of these classes has 4 different skill sets allowing for a very diverse game experience. There are 11 different areas in the game, each with a few different stage layouts. Not every session the player plays will actually consist of all 11 areas. Most sessions, players will only see 5 stages. Each stage is laid out very well that isn't confusing nor unfair for combat. The combat of the game is very strong. It also can remain diverse because of the different classes. Each class possses a different skill set that can be used for different situation. The Commando, being the starting class, is the most all around class in the game. The Sniper, being an unlocked class, is the most situational class in the whole game being that it is a boss killer.Like FTL and Rogue Legacy, the game can get tiring faster than wanted. I played about 3 hours on the day of purchase because of its solid gameplay. As the week continued, the desire to play the game and the amount of time spent started to dwindle. I found that after the intial high of the game, I really didn't have a huge desire to play the game. That doesn't mean that Risk of Rain is a bad game. The multiplayer can easily increase the life of the gameThis brings up another problem with Risk of Rain. The multiplayer is not very simple to set up. You have to go through and get your IP and open ports up on your computer. The hardcore computer gamer should be capable of doing this with no problem, but that doesn't mean that the process is not annoying. Dying in multiplayer can also make it a very boring game if playing with someone who is much better. There is no way to revive your friends; all you can do is beat the level or die. All they can do is watch and hope you die. To conclude the review, Risk of Rain is an enjoyable Rogue-Like action focused platformer with a great soundtrack. Although it has slight problems with game life and multiplayer, I suggest buying this game. Now we shall go onto the specifics of the game.			"

												A very fun randomly generated rogue-like side-scroller. The ten different characters each have a different set of attacks allowing for different play styles, from long range single target damage to melee crowd control. Different items augment your character in a variety of way, from healing with each hit, firing missiles on hitting an enemy or raining meteorites down when you use it. Artifacts also alter the way the game plays once unlocked, allowing for extra challenge. The goal of each level is simple, find the teleporter, activate it, hold out against the spawning enemies and boss/es and get to the next level until the finale. As time goes by the difficulty increases, meaning enemies get tougher and bosses will start spawning randomly, this forces you to balance between collecting items but risk increasing the difficulty or go as fast as you can while losing out on items and not being as powerful. Combat-wise the game is simple but is not easy, careful use and timing of your abilities is key to survivng against the alien hordes.The game has solo play, local co-op or online co-op (The online lacks UPnP and so requires port forwarding). This is a great game, and is better if you can play co-op.			"

Well, once you get good enough, the game is just... Too repititive to enjoy easily.Somehow, I see some people have hundreds of hours in this game, and, well, good for  them. If you can be one of those people to enjoy this game that long, good on you! But, in my opinion, the game is fun for a while, but not too long. I recommend this game, but I highly recommend getting it on sale, as only 40-50 hours from 10 dollars, is, well, decent, but not the best.Overall, I'd give Risk of Rain a... 8/10. Maybe 8.5/10.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2d platform game where you have to survive in a foreign planet with the aid of the item you find scattered across the planet.After you find the teleporter in a stage,there will be a countdown to when the teleporter will be fully activated.Don't worry,you won't be doing nothing during the countdown.Spawn rate of monster will be increased and the boss will spawn as well.After defeating the monster in the stage,you will be teleported to another stage.Before you enter the final stage,you will get to visit previous stages that you complete(loop).Remember time=difficultyPros-Item varies your gameplay-Unique character with Unique skills-Good level of difficulty-interesting stage mechcenics  -Good amount of items-active and passive do their part in ensuring your survivor-multiplayer-Artifacts That greatly affects your gameplayCons-Limited kinds of enemy-Somewhat weak boss design-items are not interesting/unique(items do basic stuff like increase dps/health regen etc)-Final boss is not thrilling instead i find it boring-multiplayer do not work well(connection issue/timeout)You might say that the stage structure generation is not random as a con this is because it is to ensure that the Artifacts are obtainable and accessableOverall,i think this is a great game and you should get it.However boss fights are boring as yo can scum the boss by getting to a place the boss can't access.I Find myself getting into the game and you probably will7.5/10 Great game			"

												Extremely fun game if you can handle the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it dishes out at you. Until learning how to play the game properly, I can remember dying countless times on level 1 thinking to myself ""I need to stay here until I am stronger"" but this is NOT the case. The goal is to move as fast as possible through the levels while at the same time gaining enough money to purchase as many items as you can. The fun of this game is not in compelling storytelling nor in level design or other simular things. The fun comes from replaying the same scenario that murdered you on the previous run... only this time you have a bazooka, 50 drones, gasoline, a ukelele, and a thirst for vengence!			"

												At first glance, you might think paying 10 or even 7 bucks for this is too much. Well, I thought that as well, but I soon realized I would pay double what I had if I knew it was going to be this fun! First of all, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Very exciting, entergetic, atmospheric at times and well..it's just beautiful! It can be a very unforgivng game. The longer you play, the harder it becomes. You can't stay in one area for too long or you will get the shaft of a thousand suns! It challenges you to think fast and survive. I still haven't beat it, but I can't get enough of it!In some ways it reminds me of The Binding of Isaac. The items are interesting and provide strategies. You have a health bar and once you die, you gotta start back from the beginning. BOTH ARE VERY ADDICTIVE!!!I know I'm not the best reviewer yet, but just take my word for it. Buy this game!!!			"

												Risk of Rain is a lot of things.It's primarily a roguelike-ish sidescroller/platformer with addictive fast paced gameplay. It is also fun. It is also incredibly challenging. It is also somewhat new. It also very, very fun.You have to unlock most items and classes. The class you start with is very balanced, and while it might get repetitive to play it time after time until you start unlocking more stuff, it certainly pays off as you'll find an entertaining and diverse cast of playable characters, each with their own distinct playstyles and roles.Multiplayer is downright amazing. It can be bothersome to decide who gets to keep each item sometimes and much like most co-op games, someone who doesn't carry their own weight could easily cause your doom, but regardless, when you get a well coordinated team, or at least one with a minimal amount of synergy, it becomes the sort of experience that many co-op games strive to achieve.If you dig roguelikes, and/or games to play with your friends, you should totally check this out.

The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience. Be prepared to be frustrated, be prepared to die unfairly, be prepared to make the wrong decision and end your run early, but most of all - be prepared to love this game to death.			"

												Risk of Rain is an utter joy to play for fans of roguelikes and tough-as-nails action-platformers. It's also a game that reveals itself to you in layers, forcing you to hone your skills with each attempt to navigate the game's six randomly generated levels.Don't be fooled by the charming lo-fi pixel graphics and soundtrack – you will be steamrolled by the game's punishing difficulty your first time out the gate. A little perseverence pays big dividends as you unlock more sci-fi-flavored characters and gear (and learn how to contend with the always-increasing difficulty timer). The inclusion of local and online multiplayer adds to RoR's replayability, making this a must-buy.			"

												Ah, Risk of Rain. Risk of Rain, Risk of Rain. This game. I don't even know where to start, really. It's an almagam of insanity, part platformer, shooter, bullet hell, whatever-the-hell a rougelike is, and oh so much more. The difficulty curve is absurd, to start. All powerups and upgrades are delivered through pure chance, in such a way that ensures that, while you will always get at least some sort of powerup in every level, the actual item is almost impossible to accurately predict (think Binding of Issac; you can get another friggin' speed boost, you can get an item of little use to your particular class, or you can get something that turns you into what amounts as an invincible hellbeast). However, almost none of them are absolute game winners, and regardless of the Items you get, you'd damn well better know how to use them. The music is absolutely fantastic, the controls are some of the tightest you'd ever encounter, and the varied classes to chose from allow for a massive amount of control over how the hell you're going to survive all those monsters (Hint: You probably won't). It gets harder as time goes on, with the difficulty increasing every 5 minutes. (There's also the base 3 difficulties, easy, medium, and hard. The difficulty still scales with them, but on a different amount for each, so Impossible (about 45 minutes) on easy is still doable, meanwhile Impossible (Still about 45 minutes) on Hard, is, well... Just that.) The catch is that the luck factor requires time to be spent on levels in the first place, so it's a dangerous decision to make. Time Vs. Chance of getting an item. However, despite all these things stacked up against the player, it's quite rare to feel that a death wasn't your fault (Chain of awful item drops aside). I never felt that the game was too hard, rather I felt that I died due to a lack of skill. All in all it's a wonderful game that you should probably buy, because it has multiplayer as well! The downside of the multiplayer is that it doesn't seem to balance with the amount of players, so you can reasonably overwhelm the enemies with your force of multiclass destruction with minimal loss of life (Someone will probably die, however...)

There are dozens of different monsters and even more items that make every game a unique experience. Single player is good but coop mode with friends is best. Ridiculous pixelated fun.

It has an almost perfect balance of skill requirement, a good difficulty curve, and the reward of unlockable content and the feeling of accomplishment when you succeed, with a dash of luck required to spice things up.The artstyle is interesting and each creature and item has it's own entry in a log accessed from the main menu, so if you're not playing the game you can look at some interesting background for it as well as some cool artwork of the enemies/bossies, provided you've picked up their log in-game.There's also enough unlockables to make you want to continue playing, if the gameplay wasn't enough for you, and a number of unique(ish) classes to change your game each time.  Throw in a few buddies and you've got a great co-op adventure.Finally, the music sets the tone perfectly - I'd buy the soundtrack if it becomes available (it may already be, I should go check...)

												I very much enjoyed Risk of Rain. When I first got the game, with only the Commando as a playable character, I found it harder to enjoy. The difficulty curve from the start put me off, and I didn't know (and still don't) how to play the Commando well, so I put it aside. After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding. I feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.Each character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.The levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.All in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different. Definitely recommended.			"

It's a blast with friends if you can manage to get the online feature working (still a bit buggy at the time of writing).9/10: get this game!			"

												Oooh, boy. This game. It's... Definitely something.Here's my analogy of the game: You start off sucking at the game, and love it.You get decent, lose sometimes, win sometimes, and it's fun.Then... Well, once you get good enough, the game is just... Too repititive to enjoy easily.Somehow, I see some people have hundreds of hours in this game, and, well, good for  them. If you can be one of those people to enjoy this game that long, good on you! But, in my opinion, the game is fun for a while, but not too long. I recommend this game, but I highly recommend getting it on sale, as only 40-50 hours from 10 dollars, is, well, decent, but not the best.Overall, I'd give Risk of Rain a... 8/10. Maybe 8.5/10.			"

												Play this game. Seriously. Gorgeous pixel art, awesome soundtrack, very satisfying SFXs. At 10$ it is so worth it. It IS a roguelike, so you will be more at ease if you're familiar with The Binding of Isaac and even more so with Rogue Legacy, but with three difficulty settings it will suit you whatever your skill with these games. Is it hard? Incredibly. Is it fair? Absolutely. Is it rewarding? Immensely. Is it fun? You bet your♥♥♥♥♥it is.All of this already makes it a must-play, but the fact that it has 4 player coop, local or online, is so awesome. If you have 3 friends to play this with, get ready to spend hours screaming at the top of your lungs while you and your friends barely survive a never-ending onslaught of increasingly tough enemies. I know I will.			"

												Risk of Rain is quite the entertaining platformer rogue-like. What I particulary enjoyed, was;-The characters. Even though I cannot play some of them, such as Sniper or Engineer, they were quite fun to unlock.-The simple objectives. Although the game is so simple, of which all you need to do is find the teleporter and eradicate any remaining enemies, you know how to play Commando, itemwise and abilitywise.-The replayability. No matter how many different characters you have unlocked, or how many times you've beaten the game, you always can play it much more than you thought. It isn't something where you have to mod it to be able to play it again (Yes, I'm talking about you, Minecraft.), instead, it teaches you more about the characters you play, and what items are best for  them.-The soundtrack. This, made me so immersed into the game, from what I had seen in TotalBiscuit's review of RoR, really stood out. I turn my volume to 0%, and my Music to 100% in the game options. I just fight on, using every artifact or a few, listening to the soundtrack.-The final fight. This can get annoying if you don't set up a strategy, much like the game Spiral Knights, when you are fighting the Royal Jelly on the 5-2 mission 'The Soverign Slime', you will get destroyed. I set up a tactic, as I had read about Providence after getting destroyed on my fight with him.Overall, everything is well-made.			"

												Well, this review is a bit late, but I'm going to type it up anyway. Risk of Rain is a rogue-like platformer/shooter/arcade-like game. There's no single genre to describe it (in my personal opinion). I shall now continue to focus on different parts of the game.STORYDon't buy this game for the story. The story is almost nonexistant, but still does feel like it has a weight to it at the end of the game. Regardless, you don't want to focus on the story for buying this game.GAMEPLAYThis is where the game shines. You get to choose from several characters (unlocked over time) to defeat aliens and collect loot. Once you feel as if you have collected enough loot and gained enough levels, you can attempt to go on to the next level. I say ""attempt"" because to get to the next level, you have to fight off a seemingly never-ending horde for 90 seconds until you can leave. Also, this game has a very special mechanic. This game focusses highly on TIME. If you take too long to get to the next level, you might become overwhelmed with higher level enemies. As time passes, the difficulty is upped. This allows for tension and the feel of having to make decisions (do I stay to get all the loot, or should I get out of here and risk dying?).REPLAYABILITYFor someone like me, who plays games a lot and wants a lot of unlockables and such to keep him busy, this game does not disappoint. It definitely isn't easy to get everything either. There are 4 sections of unlockables: Characters, Items, Logs, Artifacts. All characters have a different playstyle and you can always find one that suits you. Although, the characters aren't very well balanced. Certain items are allowed into the pool to be drawn when you open a chest once you complete specific achievements. This makes you want to go back and see if you can get that item that you feel could get you to the end. Logs are little tidbits of info about monsters you've killed through your journeys. It's similar to how Nintendo's ""Pikmin"" addresses it. It's very similar. However, there isn't a definite chance that a monster will unlock the log. You may have to kill it a lot (it's a random drop). Finally, artifacts aren't something I can talk a whole lot about as I haven't unlocked any, but as I hear it, they change the game dramatically.NOSTALGIA?The feel this game has...is undescribable to be honest with you. It makes me feel like I'm playing an old game (arcade, NES, Genesis, and the like). It is incredibly difficult and not very forgiving. I can't exactly talk about this category a whole lot, but this game (for some odd reason) makes me think of arcades. Not sure if that's a selling point, however.FLAWSYou didn't think I was going to address any flaws? Think not! This game has them! As I stated before, character balancing is just one flaw (not a very major one, however). A majority of this game runs on 2 things. Skill and luck. And a majority of the time, it's rare to get a run past level 3 with a fresh installation (no Steam Cloud. Another flaw). Oh, and there's no saving mid-game.FINAL NOTESOverall, this is a fantastic game, but if you can't deal with the flaws involved the paragraph above, I would stay away from it. But if you can, you are in for one of the best feeling games I've ever played. When you finally complete this, you are going to be overjoyed.9.5/10			"

												A wonderful rouge-like game where you land on a planet and fight for surivival to the final level or go into an endless like mode where you repeat all the previous levels at harder difficulty. You complete achievements, unlock new characters, and recieve many randomized items from various chests and item-givers. It can be a little buggy at times, more noticable in multiplayer, although its not usually anything game breaking and you can still have a great time.7/10 for fun-factor but isn't currently updated often at all to fix annoying bugs.

												Wow, this is quite the little gem. A very, VERY hard little gem, though!Imagine Contra combined with Binding of Isaac and some Rogue Legacy and you'll have a basic gist of what this game is about.You start the game with just 1 class but as you do special events and just plain find the new classes hidden in the levels you'll unlock more. Each class has 4 unique abilites with different lengths on their cooldowns though most classes have 1 spammable ""basic"" attack with no cooldown.  Examples of some abilites are the Commando's Suppression Fire that has a 5 sec cooldown but blasts for huge dmg and stuns enemies and then there is the Engineer's Thermal Harpoons that fires 4 heating-seeking missiles for great damage! The classes really are cleverly designed and balanced and they offer a sometimes totally different play style.And then we have the loot.Oh yes, like Binding of Isaac there are many unlocks you can have fun getting plus just tons of items from the get-go. Items are crazy such as a shoulder mounted missile launcher, a cursed mask that turns killed enemies into ghosts that help you, at least 6 different kinds of drones that follow you and auto-attack enemies, magic mushrooms that sprout up and heal you super fast if you stand still for a few seconds, a tesla coil that chain zaps many enemies that get near you... I could go on and on.This game also has multiplayer co-op if thats your thing though you do have to fiddle with port forwarding or Himachi.All in all its a great lil game for only 10 bucks if you love action roguelikes/platformers!

												This is a game you should play. It's an action roguelike, and every playthrough is short, which might turn some people off. However, the mechanics are geared towards this setup. The pacing of the game works nicely, sitting in the nice groove that MOBA style games lie, where games are long enough to be engaging, but short enough to be quickly replayable.Difficulty increases as the time runs up, and metroid-style exploration in the game's levels next to that adds pressure to the time. Should you explore the level with the money you've received by beating the boss and his minions, or hurry to the next level to make sure the game stays at a good difficulty level? Should you stick around and grind, or push for the final boss as fast as you can? These quick decisions make the game engaging, along with the Artifacts system, well-balanced difficulty settings, and co-op play to add to the replay value. The item list is also impressive, with one of the artifacts allowing for the fun of min-maxing your character, and the default setting making most items random, adding to the spontaneity of the game. Items can be unlocked with challenges that test your knowledge of the character's skills, or put you in interesting scenarios. For instance, one of the Commando's (the initial character) challenges involve using his tactical rolls to evade fatal blows, which helps ingrain skill with the character.The only gripe I have with the game is the rate at which new characters are unlocked. Many characters must be unlocked through hidden events on the map, which are difficult to find without guidance. While this approach is fine for Artifacts, which are supposed to be hard to find, some characters are ridiculous, like the Robot Janitor HAND-E's hiding spot-- which is hard to find except by accident.Overall, I would thoroughly reccomend Risk of Rain. Go buy it!			"

No one playthrough is the same and all of them have different experiences to get to the end. It's tough as nails at times but very satisfying to play. With the introduction of the new artifacts it gives an entirely new feel to the game. Different characters have different builds to do better with which is a lot of fun. This game still has many more hours for me and I keep wanting more. I am a little biased though. It is amazing and everyone should give it a try out. Easily worth your $10.			"

												Risk of Rain is an utter joy to play for fans of roguelikes and tough-as-nails action-platformers. It's also a game that reveals itself to you in layers, forcing you to hone your skills with each attempt to navigate the game's six randomly generated levels.Don't be fooled by the charming lo-fi pixel graphics and soundtrack – you will be steamrolled by the game's punishing difficulty your first time out the gate. A little perseverence pays big dividends as you unlock more sci-fi-flavored characters and gear (and learn how to contend with the always-increasing difficulty timer). The inclusion of local and online multiplayer adds to RoR's replayability, making this a must-buy.			"

												Recommended for anyone just getting into the Rouge-Like genre. It's difficult, but not impossible. I would highly reccomend it for any completionist as well. It's a quick game, and you'll soon find yourself at 100%. But then you'll be ready for playing with your friends in co-op.But lemme tell you about the sci-fi theme of this game. If you like sci-fi like how I like sci-fi, you'll LOVE this game. I'm talkin' not-too-far-in-the-future sci-fi where things are UP FOR INTERPRETATION. I don't know how to discribe it, but those Monster Logs are really fun to pick up.			"

												You always feel like it's your fault you died. Half an hour in got 5 drones on my back, buffs for days, and you let your guard down for a second as you get swarmed and just like that you're dead.It's the brutal reality of Ris of Rain. It's all your fault. It's always your fault.  It's kind of like my parents in a way except you actually feel like next time you have a chance of winning.			"

												Considerably a very diverse and fun to play Rouglelike.You can play with your friends, which in my opinion automatically tripples the play value. Additionally you can set specific challanges/modifications to a game session to mix it up. Since the maps are procedurally generated and not always in the same order, this game stays surprisingly fresh. Of course, as with any rouguelike, a session or two per day is what I'd recommend. An average session can easily last up to an hour if you are sucessful.A few negative points:The controls are good, but not the best. Jumping can feel awakrd to some people.Connectivity issues do show up more often then I'd like them to appear, and finding a method to make it work can be a bit of a pain.All in all a good game. The pleasing aesthetic and good soundtrack make me love it.			"

												Great, if you like rogue-likes. It's hectic, but not overwhelming. It's a lot simpler than the trailer looks. It'll take a while to play, even one run takes quite a lot of time, on average I spend around half an hour on only the first level. The ""It gets harder over time"" is genius, as you try to go fast, but at the same time take your time and grind to be ready for the boss at the end of the level. As much as it has the elements of a platformer, It's a minor feature, and it's not a thing you should be really thinking about when you decide to purchase. It's a ""Rogue-like platformer"", but at it's heart it's a Rogue-like. Oh, one last note, the music. Ohhhhhhhh, the music. Wonderful.7/10, Good, but... I dunno, it just, could be better. Maybe I just haven't tried the multiplayer yet. I'll update this if I get the chancne to try that. All in all, buy it if you feel like it's you cup of tea. Otherwise, find something else.			"

												Risk of Rain touches a sort of sweet-spot for me. It's made with beautiful low-res pixel-art, it's a game of survival and exploration in a hostile environment, it's Sci-Fi and it is incredibly well thought out and written, despite having an intro sequence without any dialogue and characters with hardly any background save for their names and appearances.In Risk of Rain you start out with one character, the Commando, surviving a transport ship crash on a hostile world. Your tast is to find a teleporter, activate it and hold out while it charges, before finally moving on to the next area, and then the next, and the next. I'm sure there is an end to it, but Risk of Rain has a very steep difficulty curve, so I've only managed to get to the 4th level so far, running my play time for that session to 40 minutes or so.The faster you get to the exit, the easier the enemies you encounter, but on the other hand slowly exploring the world will yield more experience and better equipment, so there are at least two key play styles you can pick from: hard and fast or slow and steady.Throughout the game you will unlock items, each of which has a special description text written out for it, explaining where it came from and where it was going before it crashed on the planet. Additionally all of the monsters have written descriptions that will help you understand them, the world you are in as well as your own motivations beyond surviving.All in all, Risk of Rain is a well executed and truly addictive experience that provides short adrenaline-filled bursts of gameplay, that I cannot help but heartily recommend.Playtime: 10+ hours (ongoing)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 9Audio: 8Story: 10Gameplay: 9Overall: 9			"

												Risk of Rain is an incredibly fun and addictive game. It's a ridiculously fast paced action platformer where you can face dozens, if not hundreds, of enemies at once. Earn money by killing monsters and use it to open chests and shrines to obtain items to increase your damage and health or give you more abilities and skills. There are dozens of different monsters and even more items that make every game a unique experience. Single player is good but coop mode with friends is best. Ridiculous pixelated fun. Highly recommended!!!			"

												I really wasn't expecting this amount of fun.  It has an almost perfect balance of skill requirement, a good difficulty curve, and the reward of unlockable content and the feeling of accomplishment when you succeed, with a dash of luck required to spice things up.The artstyle is interesting and each creature and item has it's own entry in a log accessed from the main menu, so if you're not playing the game you can look at some interesting background for it as well as some cool artwork of the enemies/bossies, provided you've picked up their log in-game.There's also enough unlockables to make you want to continue playing, if the gameplay wasn't enough for you, and a number of unique(ish) classes to change your game each time.  Throw in a few buddies and you've got a great co-op adventure.Finally, the music sets the tone perfectly - I'd buy the soundtrack if it becomes available (it may already be, I should go check...)

												Fun and addicting game, often found that I lost track of time while playing.  You kind of get that Super Smash Bros feel with the unlockable characters which drives you to play more and each character has their own unique stats and skills to further increase incentive to get them.There's plenty of replayability however I don't feel the game is worth the full price of $10.  There is simply not enough content to market this game at that price since there are only 10 characters and once you have all of them unlocked your only reason to play is to unlock the other power-ups that have a chance of spawning or Monster Logs for some lore on the monsters you're fighting.I recommend this game only if it's on sale.

Posted: January 14, 2014
												I very much enjoyed Risk of Rain. When I first got the game, with only the Commando as a playable character, I found it harder to enjoy. The difficulty curve from the start put me off, and I didn't know (and still don't) how to play the Commando well, so I put it aside. After a while, however, I came back to it, and started to unlock more and more characters, which is when I realised that the sense of satisfaction as you climb through levels and acquire a veritable armory of items is very rewarding. I feel that, skill aside, some characters are simply more effective than others, and that some of the in-game unlockable achievements are unrealistic (Activating the third teleporter without being hurt once just seems unrealistic for a more casual player), but those are the only negatives I can think of. The art style is perhaps left to preference, but I very much enjoy the simplicity and elegance in well-done pixel art, and find it very appealing.Each character feels unique and plays unique, the simplicity of four skills combined with varying attack and movement speed lending to a completely different playstyle for every character, something that I feel is often lost in current games. The items, some more useful than others, all feel like they have distinct bonuses and different, from the Guardian Hearts to the Jetpacks and the Wicked Rings, and finding a higher-tier item feels rewarding and can immediately change your playstyle.The levels are, perhaps, not that high in variety, but due to the adaptation in playstyle from each character and the multitude of items, they always feel like they play different. However, once all the characters have been unlocked, and all (or most of) the items, repitition kicks in: but this could be said for any game, so I won't count this as a negative.All in all, a very enjoyable time waster, allowing for both quick games and intense playthroughs, the mechanics are rewarding, and utilising only four skills per character, they all feel and play wildly different. Definitely recommended.			"

The <time=difficulty> mechanic is unique and keeps the game exciting because it causes farming to become progressively more dangerous.Ten characters, four unique skills each, three difficulty levels and over a hundred items. It's a blast with friends if you can manage to get the online feature working (still a bit buggy at the time of writing).9/10: get this game!			"

												Risk of Rain is a lot of things.It's primarily a roguelike-ish sidescroller/platformer with addictive fast paced gameplay. It is also fun. It is also incredibly challenging. It is also somewhat new. It also very, very fun.You have to unlock most items and classes. The class you start with is very balanced, and while it might get repetitive to play it time after time until you start unlocking more stuff, it certainly pays off as you'll find an entertaining and diverse cast of playable characters, each with their own distinct playstyles and roles.Multiplayer is downright amazing. It can be bothersome to decide who gets to keep each item sometimes and much like most co-op games, someone who doesn't carry their own weight could easily cause your doom, but regardless, when you get a well coordinated team, or at least one with a minimal amount of synergy, it becomes the sort of experience that many co-op games strive to achieve.If you dig roguelikes, and/or games to play with your friends, you should totally check this out.

												This is the hardest-hitting, most action-packed roguelite in my library. The art and soundtrack are incredible, and the ten unlockable characters provide tons of replayability. The <time=difficulty> mechanic is unique and keeps the game exciting because it causes farming to become progressively more dangerous.Ten characters, four unique skills each, three difficulty levels and over a hundred items. It's a blast with friends if you can manage to get the online feature working (still a bit buggy at the time of writing).9/10: get this game!			"

												A wonderful rouge-like game where you land on a planet and fight for surivival to the final level or go into an endless like mode where you repeat all the previous levels at harder difficulty. You complete achievements, unlock new characters, and recieve many randomized items from various chests and item-givers. It can be a little buggy at times, more noticable in multiplayer, although its not usually anything game breaking and you can still have a great time.7/10 for fun-factor but isn't currently updated often at all to fix annoying bugs.

												(TL;DR: What are you doing reading this, buy it now gogogogogogo)Risky Rain is a game where you play as a guy called Commander Risky. The plot is you and some other people are space mailmen, trying to deliver♥♥♥♥♥♥when your ship starts exploding and crash lands on a planet, and then you have to get back to it before the space monsters surely eat your flesh. The game has three main difficulties, ranging from cup of water to Atlantic Ocean, and has a difficulty timer in game that starts at 2ez, and then just laughs at you for the highest one for some reason.There are 9 other persons who you can play as if you do some stuff, with my favorite being Handy, the robot janitor (I like him because he has a hammer). There's also these weird black rocks that make the game play all weirdly, so use them at your own risk (HEHEH, GEDDIT!?).the gameplay consists of running around trying to not get killed. When you kill the monsters, they drop money and glowy balls, which make your life numbers bigger. To survive however, you need to use the money to lockpick boxes and buy stuff from vending machines. you can play this by yourself, or with other people sitting next you (player cap 4) or with people from the internets (up to 10 with settings adjustments! WOW!).all in all, I give this hard fun game 2 potatoes out of 3 apples.Edit: Scorpion from Mortal Kombat and the Swedish Chef are now charaters due to an update. +1/2 Potato for this.			"

												It's still a tiny bit buggy, but for being developed by one person in their spare time, this game is phenomenal. It's easily worth twice what it's listed for. The music is great, the graphics are sharp and interesting, the gameplay is clean and tight, and it's deeper than the ocean. The game could survive on the strength of the first playable character, but each newly unlocked character adds a whole new dimension to the excellent co-op experience. Be prepared to be frustrated, be prepared to die unfairly, be prepared to make the wrong decision and end your run early, but most of all - be prepared to love this game to death.			"

												Great, if you like rogue-likes. It's hectic, but not overwhelming. It's a lot simpler than the trailer looks. It'll take a while to play, even one run takes quite a lot of time, on average I spend around half an hour on only the first level. The ""It gets harder over time"" is genius, as you try to go fast, but at the same time take your time and grind to be ready for the boss at the end of the level. As much as it has the elements of a platformer, It's a minor feature, and it's not a thing you should be really thinking about when you decide to purchase. It's a ""Rogue-like platformer"", but at it's heart it's a Rogue-like. Oh, one last note, the music. Ohhhhhhhh, the music. Wonderful.7/10, Good, but... I dunno, it just, could be better. Maybe I just haven't tried the multiplayer yet. I'll update this if I get the chancne to try that. All in all, buy it if you feel like it's you cup of tea. Otherwise, find something else.			"

Artifacts can be found that change the gameplay adding even more fun and challenge.  There is also a deep story hidden behind all of the combat which can found by reading the item and monster logs as well as the description under the name of each boss.  Singleplayer does a good job making you feel alone while the multiplayer can get you and your friends into hilarious situations.  Would highly recommend, but I prefer using my X-Box controller over the keyboard for this game.			"

												Extremely fun game if you can handle the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it dishes out at you. Until learning how to play the game properly, I can remember dying countless times on level 1 thinking to myself ""I need to stay here until I am stronger"" but this is NOT the case. The goal is to move as fast as possible through the levels while at the same time gaining enough money to purchase as many items as you can. The fun of this game is not in compelling storytelling nor in level design or other simular things. The fun comes from replaying the same scenario that murdered you on the previous run... only this time you have a bazooka, 50 drones, gasoline, a ukelele, and a thirst for vengence!			"

Posted: December 12, 2013
												Harkening back to the day of the 8 and 16-bit platformer, Risk of Rain is deliberately inscrutable roguelike that relishes in its masochistic difficulty curve. Skipping any kind of pretence of a tutorial or any of the modern hand-holding gamers have come to expect, your little spaceman is dropped into a random, semi-procedurally generated map with little more than the vague instructions to ""Find the Teleporter"" to go on. Vicious monsters begin to spawn almost immediately and it doesn't take long to realize how hopelessly outmatched your little guy is, and it only gets worse from there.The central conceit of Risk of Rain, and what makes it stand out from the pack of other recently released roguelikes, is the timer. A large clock in the top right of the screen mercilessly ticks upwards with every second. The longer you take, the more frequently the monsters spawn, and the stronger they grow. Every five minutes, a bell marks the passing into a higher level of difficulty, starting at ""Very Easy"" and eventually tipping into the realm of ""impossible"" and ""HAHAHAHAHA."" If you haven't been efficient at collecting upgrades and items, you may soon find yourself surrounded on all sides by monsters you don't have a prayer of defeating. The mission quickly turns from ""how far can I get?"" to ""how long can I survive!?""There is an incredible sense of urgency packed into every second of RoR because of that timer. Every choice and action becomes crucial. What way to you explore after spawning? Should you stay in this area and try to clear out enough monsters to earn enough gold to open another chest, or just book it while you can? While you only take miniscule fall damage, you'll be cursing yourself each time a missed jump forces you to reclimb a ladder, burning precious seconds.As you might be familiar from games like The Binding of Isaac, RoR features a plethora of items to be found. Most of these apply some kind of passive bonus to the character like a better chance for critical hits, a bonus to regenerating health, or a small demon in a jar that might cause enemies to explode when you kill them, you know, standard stuff. Others occupy the fifth slot in your inventory to be activated at will, usually with a tremendous cool down period before you can use it again. These are your typical screen-clearing bombs and the like, as well as more esoteric (and deceptively powerful) options like a Repair Kit that will instantly fix up any drones on the screen.And much like Isaac, part of the fun of the game is watching the strange transformation these items will wreak upon your tiny spaceman. You start as a small blip of pixels, a little speck that seems hopelessly outmatched by the towering wildlife and monstrous aliens. But all of that can change with a few lucky item drops. Wreathed in barbed wire, encircled by a fleet of drones, randomly spewing missiles, summoning poltergeists, and leaving a trail of fire at your boots, you may not even recognize your little explorer by the time you reach the final stage.There are additional character classes to unlock. While you start with only the standard Commando in his adorable bubble-dome, it doesn't take long to expand the selection.Each character naturally promotes a unique style of play with their skills. The Mercenary and Miner feature agile fast moving attacks that double as dodging manoeuvres, encouraging you to keep it hopping. The mechanical HAN-D robot on the other hand has a suite of moves designed to keep him in the thick of battle. An Overclock boost increases his speed and power and can be extended by pounding multiple enemies. His brawling prowess is complemented by an array of seeker drones that can autonomously fly off and leech back health from the enemy while he fights, and so on. Learning how to best utilize each character's tools and abilities is essential if you hope to weather the storm.Multiplayer gives the individual characters a little more room to breathe and express themselves. Some of the more idiosyncratic classes that I thought were a bit lacklustre in single player came into their own with a team. I was worried that adding more players to the recipe would spoil the difficulty of the game. This is definitely not the case. While the extra firepower and the ability to split up and search for the exit certainly makes the early stages easier, having to share the loot and gold among 2-4 people means none of you will become the fearsome blackhole of alien destruction you might be used when hogging every trinket for yourself. By the final stages you'll need to work together as best you can to manage the laughably unfair hordes of nearly invulnerable monsters.While playing with random strangers results in the typical mad scramble of greed you might be used to in something like Borderlands – where every player jumps on every item they can in a micro-demonstration of the Tragedy of the Commons – playing with a coordinated group raises the game to the next level. When you can actually coordinate who gets what items based on what they need or what would be most useful for a particular cast member, you can cultivate a truly spectacular team. Multiplayer goes from being a fun diversion, to feeling like it's the way the game is MEANT to be played.Which is why it's such a shame that it is absolutely broken.Connecting to an online game in Risk of Rain gave me some wonderful flashbacks of the late-90's. Eschewing any kind of server browser or quick-game connection UI, Risk of Rain expects you to manually input the IP and port number of your host. I haven't texted somebody an IP address in nearly a decade, and while the nostalgia trip was nice, it is a decidedly horrible way to run a multiplayer game.It is an unbelievable shame that RoR's multiplayer is hamstrung in such a fundamental way. When I was able to find a match and everything worked, it was some of the best co-op I've played this year. It taps directly into the same impulses that made games like L4D and Gears of Wars Horde mode abiding favourites with my friends for years. Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to convince many people that putting up with all the frustration of getting a match together is worth it for RoR. I know Hopoo Games is a small group, but this was a real missed opportunity that could have taken their game from a being a fun little title to something great.Risk of Rain is a sad game. It deals in desperation, in hopelessness. Rendered in a gorgeous faux-retro pixel-art style, everything in RoR dwarfs the player. The music, brilliantly composed by Chris Christodoulou, is tense, haunting, and worth the price of admission on its own.  While RoR is intentionally light on story, the background of the game is slowly filled in through the shipping details of the items you scavenge throughout the game and a journal detailing the monsters and wildlife you encounter. Many of these little descriptions were surprisingly wistful or tragic, and by the time you've collected the last monster log, you'll probably start to feel like maybe you were the jerk in this situation.That feeling helps carry the game. Risk of Rain isn't as smooth as something like Isaac or Spelunky. There's more technical jank, items spawning in unreachable areas, containers floating off the ground, and the gameplay isn't as balanced or fair. Where part of the skill of Isaac or Spelunky is being able to roll with the punches and succeed despite bad luck, there were definitely times in RoR where I felt failure was out of my control. But flaws notwithstanding, I kept comming back. That sad wistful tone and the wonderfully balanced characters just dug into the right spot of my brain.Risk of Rain might not be the most polished roguelike to hit the market in the last few years, but it has a charm all to its own, and I think that is a fact to celebrate.

												I would recommend to anyone whos likes a challenge and good things. Insanely fun and addicting. The soundtrack of this game is submersive and ominous, but the game gets really intense listening to your own music. Sound effects are retro but not annoying, you can almost feel the explosions hitting your enemies and the sounds of bullets hitting their flesh.I have never enjoyed the idea of perma-death but this game has opened up that genre to me, it does a great job of making you feel like ever playable charcter is different, and the speed at which the difficulty, as well as your own strength, on each playthrough provides for excellent fast-action that is really addicting. And on top of everything its online an local multiplayer!The atmosphere and small shreds of story we get from this game are excellent builing blocks for a game that question the human vs. nature relationship, this is built from assumptions incredibly sparce dialogue, and the tormented thoughts of a lone survivor adrift a hostile planet. While these intriguing elements of story and atmosphere are present, they are not so ""in-your-face,"" rather, appearing in monster and item descriptions, these small attention to detail is immersive, interesting and not at all distracting of the core game. A perfect balance of incredibly strong replay value, and a good incentive to keep playing to unlock this worlds story, which we end up caring a lot about.The graffics are very charming and pleasing to the eye. No matter what of the 10 characters you play, your are always a small  pile of about 30 pixels. Not to say that they were lazy at all, no. Rather, the simplicty and smallness of your charcter is great to look at and really makes your feel small in a world of things trying to kill you. The monsters are the same way, though they are larger than you(some very much so), they feel like true inhabitants of the world youve landed in. Bosses feel and look powerful and their deaths are satisfying. Graphically the world around you looks amazing, like the remnants of an ancient alien civilization. They really put you in concern with your characters need to survive.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. The reason not a perfect score is the only could use some tweaking. The difficulty, graphics, upgrades, items, collectables and secrets keep me coming back for more everytime I sit down to my computer. Never, have I put so many hours so quickly into a game that was inly $10. It was worth every cent twofold			"

												Risk of Rain, is one of those games that reminds you why 2D is still relevant. Despite the fact that the sprites are very small (and I mean very, bring your glasses) the games runs amazingly well and is very rewarding. The ability to use different characters and play with friends is also a huge  in its favour. What also makes the game so much fun is the ramdom power you compile along the journey. This creates some really cool and unique situation that rerquire different play stiles each time.I would give this a solid 8/10.Ticklepants			"

												Oooh, boy. This game. It's... Definitely something.Here's my analogy of the game: You start off sucking at the game, and love it.You get decent, lose sometimes, win sometimes, and it's fun.Then... Well, once you get good enough, the game is just... Too repititive to enjoy easily.Somehow, I see some people have hundreds of hours in this game, and, well, good for  them. If you can be one of those people to enjoy this game that long, good on you! But, in my opinion, the game is fun for a while, but not too long. I recommend this game, but I highly recommend getting it on sale, as only 40-50 hours from 10 dollars, is, well, decent, but not the best.Overall, I'd give Risk of Rain a... 8/10. Maybe 8.5/10.			"

												Extremely fun game if you can handle the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it dishes out at you. Until learning how to play the game properly, I can remember dying countless times on level 1 thinking to myself ""I need to stay here until I am stronger"" but this is NOT the case. The goal is to move as fast as possible through the levels while at the same time gaining enough money to purchase as many items as you can. The fun of this game is not in compelling storytelling nor in level design or other simular things. The fun comes from replaying the same scenario that murdered you on the previous run... only this time you have a bazooka, 50 drones, gasoline, a ukelele, and a thirst for vengence!			"

												Wonderful action game. Numerous items and weapons. Good pixel art. Extremely difficult.Also include a hidden level which reference to the MMORPG Maple Story.The only thing that I think the game can be improved is the online co-op mode. It is not convenient to use IP address to connect with friends and this also limits some aspects of the game.Anyway, ROR is actually awesome, thank you for your efforts!			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2d platform game where you have to survive in a foreign planet with the aid of the item you find scattered across the planet.After you find the teleporter in a stage,there will be a countdown to when the teleporter will be fully activated.Don't worry,you won't be doing nothing during the countdown.Spawn rate of monster will be increased and the boss will spawn as well.After defeating the monster in the stage,you will be teleported to another stage.Before you enter the final stage,you will get to visit previous stages that you complete(loop).Remember time=difficultyPros-Item varies your gameplay-Unique character with Unique skills-Good level of difficulty-interesting stage mechcenics  -Good amount of items-active and passive do their part in ensuring your survivor-multiplayer-Artifacts That greatly affects your gameplayCons-Limited kinds of enemy-Somewhat weak boss design-items are not interesting/unique(items do basic stuff like increase dps/health regen etc)-Final boss is not thrilling instead i find it boring-multiplayer do not work well(connection issue/timeout)You might say that the stage structure generation is not random as a con this is because it is to ensure that the Artifacts are obtainable and accessableOverall,i think this is a great game and you should get it.However boss fights are boring as yo can scum the boss by getting to a place the boss can't access.I Find myself getting into the game and you probably will7.5/10 Great game			"

Its fast paced, skill based Megaman (jump and shoot man) style action, with a touch of random items and stages. There are so many upgrades, some with two D's, for a double dose of upgrayedd. You are going to have a better time than two pints of beer, which is how much this game costs. GET IT!			"

												Never thought I'd have so much fun with this game!How many times did I die at the beginning, its hilarious.Pro's:- Multiple classes- Many unlockables- Difficulty increases with time past ingame.- Permadeath- Fun at either playing solo or with randoms.- Lots of replayabilityCons:- Takes a while to unlock all classes.- Needs to portfoward to host games.The only downside of this game is that it doesn't have a good multiplayer lobby. You need to portforward to host a game. But if you can get it to work it'll be a diamond of a game!			"

												Easily one of the most entertaining games I have played. I'm not much for the Roguelike/Roguelite series and games which are similar, however I easily spent Eight hours playing with friends, repeatedly trying over and over. I took a break around 12AM EST and found myself playing it again around 2AM until around 6AM. This is a very easy game to lose track of time in, however the difficulty continually spikes whilst playing, which.. Is actually quite fun to work around.From my gameplay experience with this game, it has promoted teamwork with item combinations between my friends and I, and I have just enjoyed every moment of it.Pros: - Easy to understand item system.- A multitude of classes and characters to choose from, to figure out your own personal playstyle.- Easy to set-up online multiplayer (Currently only usable in a Beta release).- One of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in gaming. After Eight hours, I still want to hear more.- Up to Six player Cooperative.- Continually scaling difficulty, which promotes teamwork and makes player develop new strategies.- Item Collection, and Monster Journals. Each menu option tells you more about the items you use, and the monsters you fight.- Intuitive Combat System unlike other Roguelike/Roguelite games.- Combat Focused instead of Platforming Focused unlike most other Roguelikes/RoguelitesCons:- Port Forwarding is required for this game, and some ISP's may block the native Port this game uses. (Try using 7777).- Game Crashes are somewhat present, and if such happens whilst gaming, your data is lost.- Lag prevalent regardless of Ping of players joining a server.Regardless of the Cons, I definitely would recommend this game for you. I can easily see myself playing this game for upwards of Fifty hours. The game is even on sale currently (4/5/2015) for 2.49.			"

												Ive actually played this game for a decent ammount of hours to the point i can say that it is actually an amazing game. Personally my love for gaming was slowly dying, as all gamess seemed to be clones of another and there wasnt really anything new and orignal out there. Untill i came across this game in a humble bundle sometime earlier in the year at first i didnt feel like giving it a go as the way it looks simple but im so glad i did!  Risk of Rain a brillinat rouge-like Side Scrolling Platformer.  it can be as indepth as you want it to. fo example it can be a neverending loop, where you figure out that youve done a 7 hour sitting after dying. But you can also beat the game in an hour if you wanted to. The items are crazy, the game it's self is beautiful i love the art style of everything and the music is truly captivating. I find myself getting lost in the game with the music playing. With trhe ability to play with up to 7 players online and coop it really is a great game to bash with mates, Also the actual story behind the game is like i said orignal and you will find yourself re-playing to complete challenges unlocking artifacts, characters, little hidden levels and easter eggs that devs put in for a laugh. it really is one of my faveorate game i could talk about it for hours but i wont... i do STRONGLY recommend this game even if you die within the first 5 mins you'll find yourself going back for more as i do. :)			"

												This game is something that needs to be out on the market right now. It is another very challanging game where yes you will die a lot of times, but you will always just come back for more because the combat in the game is just so damn satisfying. You always restart the game because you have that mentality in your head of ""If I can just do this a bit faster before the game gets harder and have the right items, then I can actually do it!"", and long behold you die again and rinse and repeat. And while you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by this game you will enjoy satisfying, action packed combat along with an amazing soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou to go along with the game.

But it's an addictive kind of difficulty, the kind where you immediately fire the game up again after your death, just to see if you can get farther.Unlockable characters and items definitely help keep things interesting, as does online multiplayer.  If you know how to port forward, multiplayer with even just one other person is a blast.The fact I can't stop playing it after having bought it says a lot about how fun it is.			"

												So I looked back at my review and thought, ""Damn I can't review things.""  So i'm back trying to give a better review, anyway the game is much like one of my favorite games of all time:  FTL:  Faster Than Light.  It's a game with pain, suffering, and death with it's permadeath and brutal Difficulty.  But if thats not a turn off for you then you should have a great time, with it's beautiful soundtrack, action platforming,  ten distinct characters each with unique abilitys, and awesome randomized items and some what levels your in for a hell of a good time.  Oh and damn good co-op also.			"

												This game is something that needs to be out on the market right now. It is another very challanging game where yes you will die a lot of times, but you will always just come back for more because the combat in the game is just so damn satisfying. You always restart the game because you have that mentality in your head of ""If I can just do this a bit faster before the game gets harder and have the right items, then I can actually do it!"", and long behold you die again and rinse and repeat. And while you get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by this game you will enjoy satisfying, action packed combat along with an amazing soundtrack composed by Chris Christodoulou to go along with the game. And to top off all of this greatness you can even bring along some friends and get all of your asses kicked at the same time and have a great time.			"

												RoR is a platform-based rougelite where you are marooned on a hostile alien world. Collecting items to mutate your body and enhance your abilities are key to surviving the never-ending horde of incoming alien hostiles. Time is of the essence, as the horde becomes more and more aggressive as time passes.Immediately the context is given for the game: you are alone, your goal is to survive. Depending on how you play you can be aggressive or passive in how to address the game's starting stages, but more often than not you will have to resort to running away and picking off targets before you acquire the experience and upgrades you need. Before too long you'll be strong enough to decimate colossal threats with ease -- at the aptly-named difficulty ""HAHAHAHAHAHA.""Now to me, this was where there was a divergence. The startup always felt sluggish to me; kiting enemies for 20-ish minutes before becoming powerful enough to take them head on didn't feel like it was worth my time invested into it. Some may find this fun, I didn't personally. Once I'd get over that hump, the game's pacing and goal changed from survival into a killing spree. This is something that the game is self-aware of with the higher difficulty levels being ""I SEE YOU"", ""I'M COMING FOR YOU"", and ""HAHAHAHAHAHA"" as well as the endings for each character making mention on how they have lost their humanity/sanity during their spree.Overall it's a challenging game to get into due to its slow and downright-disadvantaged start. However that nuance is exactly what was intended to give the player that feeling of being overwhelmed, and it exaggerates just how powerful you become when you reach lategame when you contrast it to how weak you started out.

												Risk of rain is a fiendishly difficult 2d shooter with roguelike inspirations. The game starts out fairly simple, you're on an alien planet, and need to find a teleporter. The first stage of the game is not too rough, however, as time progresses, regardless of your progress, enemies begin to ramp up in number and strength. This creates a dilemna, do you throughly search a level for items and monsters to kill for experience? Or do you rush the teleporter, fight the boss, and move on quickly? It's these decisions along with many fun characters to experiment playing with that make Risk of Rain shine. If you're a fan of 2D shooters, or roguelikes and don't mind dying many times over in many situations, definitely make time for this game.			"

There are tons and tons of different item, some utterly useless , some completely overpowered. A nice variety of mobs and bosses.BUT THAT MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING SOUNDTRACK THOUGHSO GOOOOOD The multiplayer is a bit buggy, but its easly fixed with hamachi and such. Super hard to beat alone, still hard to beat in co-op.You earn different classes as you progress and find things, all of them viable in their own way.TL;DRIf you want a hard rewarding pixelated fast paced permadeath space survival platforming simulator with awesome soundtrack, you should buy this game			"

Hectic to a point that some lower-end computers will get some lag issues (but in my experience, if you farmed a bit, you should have at least a bit of lag by the end level). It does have a bit of issues with multiplayer too. The replay value of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I've replayed the game countless times and it's still very fun to play, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The amount of different scenarios that arise are almost endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-like games or a game that really grabs your attention. :) :)			"

												Risk of rain is fantastic! The game has a very simple yet detailed pixel art style, and interesting monster, weapon, and character designs, each masterfully animated.The music seems to be inspired by retro game beats, yet feels fresh, and oscillates from being adreniline pumping, to calm and relaxing, it's a good, fun, varied sountrack. The simple yet deep gameplay, offers various characters to unlock, each offering very unique movesets that all have been perfectly balanced, so one should be able to find one character that fits their playstyle. While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult. Additionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.The gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.A lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore. Along with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.Multiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...Risk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!Score: 4.5/5 -0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.Sincerely,- Celx RequinWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.comTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinemaSteam Game Page:

												Ok, so this is going to be a verly decent length review of Risk of Rain, I have about 60 hours in it. and I have beat the game countless times. So, lets begin. As a I will be writing ""RoR"" as a  anagram for Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is a sidescrolling 2-D platformer with co-op the sub genre of rogue likes, This means that every playthrough while can seem similer they will be 90% of the time different, also rogue likes are know for their brutal difficuitly RoR is no exeption to this rule though this game has a unquie mechanic there is a timer in the top  right coner as the timer goes up the game gets harder tougher enemies spawn this creates a great risk and reward feeling ""Do I stay to get better items/level up or do I leave now with weaker enemies for the next level"". With a amazing soundtrack that I can only describe as electronic orchestra and a 8-bit grapics style  that is pretty to look at. Like I said before the game by all means is a platformer though it as a emphasis on combat. The game has eleven playable characters most of which you unlock by a varity of ways, each character has a unique playstyle from the others.  as a example the acrid is a creature that uses acid to attack by either leaving it on the ground or shooting it at enemies  to do a damage over time effects.  Like mention before the game is quite hard on the default difficulty, while fighting your way on a  planet you crash landed on you find items and and dodging and kill the inhabitants of said planet. While you're in any said level you collect gold to buy items at shops that give you effects like for example, the Guardian's Heart it gives a shield that recharges after not taking damage over a period of time, the ukulele which gives a chance to do Area of effect electric damage on your hits. As you move along the 2d map either if its climbing upwards or to just going left to right you need to find the teleporter to move onto the next level, once the teleporter is activated a boss spawns with a timer, the timer counts down till you can teleport to the next level though you can only teleport once the boss is dead, once dead it drops a item, Once time timer hits zero and teleport but it also stops enemies from spawning on that level so you can quickly go buy something and head back if you choose no worrys about dying. The game has 6 levels of said 6 level  there are 11 map themes though the maps are partly randomly generated. Once you beat the fifth level you get a choose, go to the final level or go back to the starting level (though harder bosses and enemies spawn now to keep it intersting) and keep grinding items.  The game has amazing replayability with over 100 items! and being quite challenging this combinded with having co-op as a option in the game just results in a blast! Plus the game is quite cheap with it being eleven dollers flat. It also does a great job of saying ""Game maker's engine can make good stuff as well guys!""I love this game, and enjoyed the time spent with it so much.  The game as amazing soundtrack solid gameplay that is satisflying/fun and a ton of replayabiltiy solo or multiplayer you're sure to have a blast. The game earns at least a 9/10.  (Would link steam page but we're here so...) To buy the sound track go here: https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain (favorite track: Coalescence) Thanks for reading! Hope you could find it useful if you would like to send me any critism by all means post it on my steam profile/here thanks!

												Definately my favorite rogue lite to date... At first you will die a lot, but after some time you'll get the hang of it, unlock further items and characters to play with. Characters are quite varied with many different special attacks and powers, some will definately fit your type of playstyle. This is were the game gets fun. You shoot / hack / crush / fry your way through endless counts of enemies, collecting items, growing stronger and stronger, which is even more enjoyable, when playing with some friends... Great concept, art style and especially outstanding soundtrack... I find myself listening to it every once in a while.Highly recommended! Great game for a ""quick"" run now and then, whereby ""quick"" can last you up to an hour.			"

												Extreme bang for your buck here. Basically a roguelike platformer/action game with fiendish difficulty. You can unlock a bunch of different classes that fit your playstyle. While you play you can find tons of passive abilities that make you stronger but don't waste too much time looking for them! The longer you stay in a level the higher the difficulty gets. You have to decide whether you stay fighting a never ending wave of monsters just to get stronger, or defeat the boss as early as you can to get to the next level. There is permadeath but surprisingly enough it never gets frustrating, it is always just the right amount of challenging. You learn more about the game as you play and get better and farther every time. Not to mention the beautiful art and atmosphere. Seriously one of the funnest games I've ever played. Oh yeah and it has freaking co-op for christ's sake. The only problem I have is that sometimes way too many monsters spawn on a small platform and it makes it near impossible to manuever normally while trying to kill them. Buy it, you will not regret it.			"

												Literally no rain in the whole game.But it is so fun playing this game.Just gaining items, playing as your favorite character, and fighting tons of enemies is super satisfying.To top it off, Risk of Rain has 3 difficulty settings, 10 unique characters, and plenty of artifacts to spice up the gameplay.This game is NOT for people who give up too easily. You WILL die.Once you beat monsoon 3 times or so, you get a feeling that you're good at the game.Then you play again with the honor artifact and you die.Overall, I think Risk of Rain deserves more attention (It's not like theres 13,000+ reviews already) and is one of the greatest rouge-likes every created.

It does have a bit of issues with multiplayer too. The replay value of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I've replayed the game countless times and it's still very fun to play, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The amount of different scenarios that arise are almost endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-like games or a game that really grabs your attention. :) :)			"

												Risk of rain is fantastic! The game has a very simple yet detailed pixel art style, and interesting monster, weapon, and character designs, each masterfully animated.The music seems to be inspired by retro game beats, yet feels fresh, and oscillates from being adreniline pumping, to calm and relaxing, it's a good, fun, varied sountrack. The simple yet deep gameplay, offers various characters to unlock, each offering very unique movesets that all have been perfectly balanced, so one should be able to find one character that fits their playstyle. While the game is hard, it never feels so due to monsters having an unfair advantage, however several artifacts can also be unlocked to alter gameplay so it either ends up easier, or more difficult. Additionally three difficulty levels can be selected, so you can cater the challenge to your own tastes.The gist of the game is to fight off a neverending wave of enemies, that become progressively more difficult the longer the game is in play, over the course of 6 levels. Each level is completed by first finding a teleporter, then fighting off against a boss, and surviving a time limit wherein serveral enemies will spawn to attack the player, after successfully doing so the player will be transported to the next level.A lot of work went into the design of the game, from the easy to navigate menu's, to the environments available, and amount of enemies you can come across, to the games ostensibly simple story that reveals more depth as you dig into the lore. Along with the many secrets, hidden areas, and unlockables to discover.Multiplayer is a blast, but unfortunately very difficult to set up with others...Risk of rain is fun on all levels, and an excellent addition to the indie genre, that should keep one entertained for hours!Score: 4.5/5 -0.5 due to the difficulty in setting up a multiplayer game.Sincerely,- Celx RequinWebsite: www.cancer-cinema.comTwitter: www.twitter.com/cancercinemaSteam Game Page:

												TL;DR:Had a bad first impression, while i looked up on the graphics. Then i saw it was on discount (2.34eur.) and decided to give it a try. I will never regret this. One of the best games i ever played. The only thing that is lacking is that it needs at least 1-2 levels, and maybe a new difficulty level.Screw the achievements, no one cares about em'.9.8/10, recommended to everyone, especially if you have friend(s) to play with, then it's even more awesome.Have fun.

												Its been a while since I have made a recommendation, and for good reason.  I only make recommendations when I whole heartedly believe the game is not good, but truely spectacular in my mind.  This game encapsulates the rougelike genre and seemlessly moulds it together with a platformer.  It adds its own spice by introducing more powerups to find in your runs as you achieve different feats.  And if you are careful enough, you might spot some of the secrets that hide some of the characters and items.  Its only downfall is the lack of variety in the level set up as it is not truely random.  But the first 25 hours of this game, I have had the time of my life, and I look forward to playing more of it.  Hopefully they expand this game further to have more levels and more level variation and it will be perfect.			"

												Imagine Binding of Isaac as a platformer. That really is what this is.Risk of Rain is a platform game with semi-randomly generated levels, tons of unlockables and a HUGE challenge. You will have to think fast and learn to adapt to the huge onslaught of enemies and deadly bosses that will hunt you through the various environments. The game is fantastic all the way through - I have sunk more than 100 hours into it and I still love it dearly. Worth every penny.			"

But it's a bit pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get it working because you will have to forward a port on your router to host a server.

												I'm normally not a fan of these sorts of games as your runs can depend entirely on how lucky you are with drops. Risk of Rain solves this problem by allowing you to pick what loot you get out of each chest. This really turned this game from another rouge-like into a game where you can plan your builds and where strategy matters.Combine that with an excellent astethic, a beautiful soundtrack and online/local co-op and I cannot recommend this game enough, even if you normally aren't a fan of rouge-like action platformers.

												A really good time!  I've obviously put quite a few hours into this game, although the lack of a save+quit feature means that I spent only 50 hours actually playing the game, and the other 40 hours were spent in the pause menu, so I didn't lose progress when I had to stop mid-game.Lots of interesting enemies, abilities, and items.  The difficulty curve is quite steep at first, but once you've died a dozen times or so, you'll have unlocked a few more characters, and some useful items.  The 'story', as told via the Monster Logs you collect from enemies, is straightforward and simplistic, but the world-building/detail about the monsters and their lives is nice.  The item log is also pretty fun, since all the items are cargo, scattered when your ship crashes, and come with little descriptions detailing their sender, recipient, and generally a 'letter' accompanying them.Very much worth the $10, and it seems to go on sale fairly regularly if that's still too much.  Good for filling a spare 20-60 minutes, very replayable.  One issue with the multiplayer is (allegedly, I haven't tried it much/only played local) fairly poorly implemented when it comes to game creation.  No server lists, so you either need to have friends who own it, or organise a game in the steam forum.  The actual multiplayer gameplay is very fun, since you can get some good synergy between characters that you just can't have playing solo.			"

												SKIP TO THE BOTTOM FOR PROS AND CONS (*TL;DR)This game is one I picked up off my first ever paycheck (for writing) for me and 3 friends. I really only played it with 2 of them, as usually one of their games would crash about halfway through. We had a blast with it anyways. I have 43 hours logged, and about 35 of those are co-op. I've found this game to be a overlooked indie gem, and I like it a lot more than some more mainstream titles.GAMEPLAY:This is where the game really shines, and if you intend on buying this game, this will be the reason why. At the start of the game, you can only choose one class. Once you've chosen your class, you're thrown into a 2D platforming playing field. From there, you have to run, jump, climb, and shoot your way through a foreign planets inhabitants til you find a portal to the next level. Upon reaching the portal, you activate it, and have to fight a boss. This proscess goes on for as long as you want, but you can't fight the final boss til 'Level' 5. However, through gameplay, you can unlock more and more classes. I never felt like one class was more OP than another though, every class is only as OP as your skill level with said class is. This makes it easy to get into a rut with just one class, and play nothing but that class. I personally made it a point to beat the game as a different class almost every playthrough. Playing as multiple classes is incentivized by the fact that every class has a different ending (Resulting in a very minor dialogue change at the end). Multiple playthroughs are incentivized mainly by unlockables, but this falls short when you realize that all you're unlocking is things to help you with more playthroughs. It's kinda like Ouroborous, with the ""Logs"" being the only collectible that's really worth playing multiple times for.I, however, was determined to squeeze every last drop of fun I could from this game. So I probably beat the damn thing about 10 times (Not exagerating). It's a short game, about an hour and a half to beat on a short run, but it never took more than three hours to beat if we were having good luck. Multiple playthroughs are kept fresh by Artifacts, and  random generation, more on Artifacts later. The random generation doesn't mean that the levels are 100% random. There are about 2 - 4 different area variations per level, (Not counting the last stage) this means predesigned levels. But all the spawn loacations are randomly generated, forcing you to search every inch of the map sometimes. You learn the map layouts very quick this way. But one thing that helps out, are the Artifacts. Sometimes the map layout you get will have a puzzle in it, weather it's an agillity puzzle that requires quick movement, or just figuring out where a special hole is, they all lead to one place: Artifacts. Artifacts are certainly an intresting way to keep the game fresh, with each one augmenting the game in some way. They also all balance out. For example, one of the artifacts I used the most gave you +500% damage output, but you start the game at 10% of what your base health would otherwise be. Since I was pretty skilled, I basically just got a 500% damage amplifier. However, some of these relics do nothing for you til the end, which was pretty dissapointing. Such as making enemies explode on death, but the explosion only damages you. On top of that, the sheer ammount of explosions sometimes would cause my friends games to crash, and I think I had a few crashes because of it as well. The game is prone to fits of crashes every now and then, and it sucks. Especially in co-op where you come to rely on items your friends have that boost you. Another thing: In co-op, there's no way to rejoin a game you have left. There is no drop in/drop  out system, making for a pretty annoying experience when things crash. On top of that, if you die in co-op, there's no way to revive you until the next level. Since you lose all your gold (Which does convert to XP at the end of the level, so thankfully you level up with everyone else) at the end of the level, you wind up helpless for the onslaught that is to come. You're basically baggage if you die one time! There should have been a way to revive friends by spending your money, or to come back from the dead by forfeiting something. It's a tad bit punishing, and while this is a rougelike, this feature just doesn't translate well to co-op.STORY:This is where Logs come in. Occasionally, when you kill a monster, you will get it's Log. A Log is basically a short journal entry written by your character about the creature, accompanied by some nice artwork. The story is nice, I guess. I can't really say too much, because I wasn't compelled enough to go out and farm for all the logs. I've read about half of them, and they were okay I guess. They aren't really a masterpiece but at the same time, it's not♥♥♥♥♥♥ Story isn't the focous here though, so I'm not upset about this in the slightest.GRAPHICS:I personally loved the graphics. It's exactly what it needs to be, and nothing more. Simplistic yet intricate pixel art that perfectly captures the feel the developers were going for. The graphics do exactly what they set out to do, and I like what they set out to do, so therefore I like the graphics of this game.SOUND:As with most roguelike soundtracks, it tends to get repettitive. The songs are very nice, and do fit the mood of this game, they just aren't my cup of tea I guess. After a playthrough or  two, I turned them off and listened to other soundtracks in the background. I turned them back on towards the end though, because I really couldn't find a soundtrack better suited for this game.PROS:-Good solid and enjoyable gameplay-The game stays fresh for quite awhile-The graphics are really nice-Enough collectible to keep the game running on fumes for awhileCONS:-After a few playthroughs, you're artificially padding your experience-The collectibles aren't worth much if you've already beat the game (Besides logs)-Frequent crashing in co-op-Co-op is just very buggy, but still playable-The game gets slightly mundane after awhile (Although that didn't stop me from playing 43 hours)NOTES:-I found a lot of enjoyment in this game, and had a good time with my friends-Story takes a back seat to gameplay[B+] - Worth the buy, I'd say a got a little more than my $9.99 USD for this, and it's well worth that pricetag. You get what you pay for, and a little tiny bit more.			"

												Ok, so this is going to be a verly decent length review of Risk of Rain, I have about 60 hours in it. and I have beat the game countless times. So, lets begin. As a I will be writing ""RoR"" as a  anagram for Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is a sidescrolling 2-D platformer with co-op the sub genre of rogue likes, This means that every playthrough while can seem similer they will be 90% of the time different, also rogue likes are know for their brutal difficuitly RoR is no exeption to this rule though this game has a unquie mechanic there is a timer in the top  right coner as the timer goes up the game gets harder tougher enemies spawn this creates a great risk and reward feeling ""Do I stay to get better items/level up or do I leave now with weaker enemies for the next level"". With a amazing soundtrack that I can only describe as electronic orchestra and a 8-bit grapics style  that is pretty to look at. Like I said before the game by all means is a platformer though it as a emphasis on combat. The game has eleven playable characters most of which you unlock by a varity of ways, each character has a unique playstyle from the others.  as a example the acrid is a creature that uses acid to attack by either leaving it on the ground or shooting it at enemies  to do a damage over time effects.  Like mention before the game is quite hard on the default difficulty, while fighting your way on a  planet you crash landed on you find items and and dodging and kill the inhabitants of said planet. While you're in any said level you collect gold to buy items at shops that give you effects like for example, the Guardian's Heart it gives a shield that recharges after not taking damage over a period of time, the ukulele which gives a chance to do Area of effect electric damage on your hits. As you move along the 2d map either if its climbing upwards or to just going left to right you need to find the teleporter to move onto the next level, once the teleporter is activated a boss spawns with a timer, the timer counts down till you can teleport to the next level though you can only teleport once the boss is dead, once dead it drops a item, Once time timer hits zero and teleport but it also stops enemies from spawning on that level so you can quickly go buy something and head back if you choose no worrys about dying. The game has 6 levels of said 6 level  there are 11 map themes though the maps are partly randomly generated. Once you beat the fifth level you get a choose, go to the final level or go back to the starting level (though harder bosses and enemies spawn now to keep it intersting) and keep grinding items.  The game has amazing replayability with over 100 items! and being quite challenging this combinded with having co-op as a option in the game just results in a blast! Plus the game is quite cheap with it being eleven dollers flat. It also does a great job of saying ""Game maker's engine can make good stuff as well guys!""I love this game, and enjoyed the time spent with it so much.  The game as amazing soundtrack solid gameplay that is satisflying/fun and a ton of replayabiltiy solo or multiplayer you're sure to have a blast. The game earns at least a 9/10.  (Would link steam page but we're here so...) To buy the sound track go here: https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain (favorite track: Coalescence) Thanks for reading! Hope you could find it useful if you would like to send me any critism by all means post it on my steam profile/here thanks!

At the start of the game, you can only choose one class. Once you've chosen your class, you're thrown into a 2D platforming playing field. From there, you have to run, jump, climb, and shoot your way through a foreign planets inhabitants til you find a portal to the next level. Upon reaching the portal, you activate it, and have to fight a boss. This proscess goes on for as long as you want, but you can't fight the final boss til 'Level' 5. However, through gameplay, you can unlock more and more classes. I never felt like one class was more OP than another though, every class is only as OP as your skill level with said class is. This makes it easy to get into a rut with just one class, and play nothing but that class. I personally made it a point to beat the game as a different class almost every playthrough. Playing as multiple classes is incentivized by the fact that every class has a different ending (Resulting in a very minor dialogue change at the end). Multiple playthroughs are incentivized mainly by unlockables, but this falls short when you realize that all you're unlocking is things to help you with more playthroughs. It's kinda like Ouroborous, with the ""Logs"" being the only collectible that's really worth playing multiple times for.I, however, was determined to squeeze every last drop of fun I could from this game. So I probably beat the damn thing about 10 times (Not exagerating). It's a short game, about an hour and a half to beat on a short run, but it never took more than three hours to beat if we were having good luck. Multiple playthroughs are kept fresh by Artifacts, and  random generation, more on Artifacts later. The random generation doesn't mean that the levels are 100% random. There are about 2 - 4 different area variations per level, (Not counting the last stage) this means predesigned levels. But all the spawn loacations are randomly generated, forcing you to search every inch of the map sometimes. You learn the map layouts very quick this way. But one thing that helps out, are the Artifacts. Sometimes the map layout you get will have a puzzle in it, weather it's an agillity puzzle that requires quick movement, or just figuring out where a special hole is, they all lead to one place: Artifacts. Artifacts are certainly an intresting way to keep the game fresh, with each one augmenting the game in some way. They also all balance out. For example, one of the artifacts I used the most gave you +500% damage output, but you start the game at 10% of what your base health would otherwise be. Since I was pretty skilled, I basically just got a 500% damage amplifier. However, some of these relics do nothing for you til the end, which was pretty dissapointing. Such as making enemies explode on death, but the explosion only damages you. On top of that, the sheer ammount of explosions sometimes would cause my friends games to crash, and I think I had a few crashes because of it as well. The game is prone to fits of crashes every now and then, and it sucks. Especially in co-op where you come to rely on items your friends have that boost you. Another thing: In co-op, there's no way to rejoin a game you have left. There is no drop in/drop  out system, making for a pretty annoying experience when things crash. On top of that, if you die in co-op, there's no way to revive you until the next level. Since you lose all your gold (Which does convert to XP at the end of the level, so thankfully you level up with everyone else) at the end of the level, you wind up helpless for the onslaught that is to come. You're basically baggage if you die one time! There should have been a way to revive friends by spending your money, or to come back from the dead by forfeiting something. It's a tad bit punishing, and while this is a rougelike, this feature just doesn't translate well to co-op.STORY:This is where Logs come in. Occasionally, when you kill a monster, you will get it's Log. A Log is basically a short journal entry written by your character about the creature, accompanied by some nice artwork. The story is nice, I guess. I can't really say too much, because I wasn't compelled enough to go out and farm for all the logs. I've read about half of them, and they were okay I guess. They aren't really a masterpiece but at the same time, it's not♥♥♥♥♥♥ Story isn't the focous here though, so I'm not upset about this in the slightest.GRAPHICS:I personally loved the graphics. It's exactly what it needs to be, and nothing more. Simplistic yet intricate pixel art that perfectly captures the feel the developers were going for. The graphics do exactly what they set out to do, and I like what they set out to do, so therefore I like the graphics of this game.SOUND:As with most roguelike soundtracks, it tends to get repettitive. The songs are very nice, and do fit the mood of this game, they just aren't my cup of tea I guess. After a playthrough or  two, I turned them off and listened to other soundtracks in the background. I turned them back on towards the end though, because I really couldn't find a soundtrack better suited for this game.PROS:-Good solid and enjoyable gameplay-The game stays fresh for quite awhile-The graphics are really nice-Enough collectible to keep the game running on fumes for awhileCONS:-After a few playthroughs, you're artificially padding your experience-The collectibles aren't worth much if you've already beat the game (Besides logs)-Frequent crashing in co-op-Co-op is just very buggy, but still playable-The game gets slightly mundane after awhile (Although that didn't stop me from playing 43 hours)NOTES:-I found a lot of enjoyment in this game, and had a good time with my friends-Story takes a back seat to gameplay[B+] - Worth the buy, I'd say a got a little more than my $9.99 USD for this, and it's well worth that pricetag. You get what you pay for, and a little tiny bit more.			"

												TL;DR:Had a bad first impression, while i looked up on the graphics. Then i saw it was on discount (2.34eur.) and decided to give it a try. I will never regret this. One of the best games i ever played. The only thing that is lacking is that it needs at least 1-2 levels, and maybe a new difficulty level.Screw the achievements, no one cares about em'.9.8/10, recommended to everyone, especially if you have friend(s) to play with, then it's even more awesome.Have fun.

												Ok, so this is going to be a verly decent length review of Risk of Rain, I have about 60 hours in it. and I have beat the game countless times. So, lets begin. As a I will be writing ""RoR"" as a  anagram for Risk of Rain.Risk of Rain is a sidescrolling 2-D platformer with co-op the sub genre of rogue likes, This means that every playthrough while can seem similer they will be 90% of the time different, also rogue likes are know for their brutal difficuitly RoR is no exeption to this rule though this game has a unquie mechanic there is a timer in the top  right coner as the timer goes up the game gets harder tougher enemies spawn this creates a great risk and reward feeling ""Do I stay to get better items/level up or do I leave now with weaker enemies for the next level"". With a amazing soundtrack that I can only describe as electronic orchestra and a 8-bit grapics style  that is pretty to look at. Like I said before the game by all means is a platformer though it as a emphasis on combat. The game has eleven playable characters most of which you unlock by a varity of ways, each character has a unique playstyle from the others.  as a example the acrid is a creature that uses acid to attack by either leaving it on the ground or shooting it at enemies  to do a damage over time effects.  Like mention before the game is quite hard on the default difficulty, while fighting your way on a  planet you crash landed on you find items and and dodging and kill the inhabitants of said planet. While you're in any said level you collect gold to buy items at shops that give you effects like for example, the Guardian's Heart it gives a shield that recharges after not taking damage over a period of time, the ukulele which gives a chance to do Area of effect electric damage on your hits. As you move along the 2d map either if its climbing upwards or to just going left to right you need to find the teleporter to move onto the next level, once the teleporter is activated a boss spawns with a timer, the timer counts down till you can teleport to the next level though you can only teleport once the boss is dead, once dead it drops a item, Once time timer hits zero and teleport but it also stops enemies from spawning on that level so you can quickly go buy something and head back if you choose no worrys about dying. The game has 6 levels of said 6 level  there are 11 map themes though the maps are partly randomly generated. Once you beat the fifth level you get a choose, go to the final level or go back to the starting level (though harder bosses and enemies spawn now to keep it intersting) and keep grinding items.  The game has amazing replayability with over 100 items! and being quite challenging this combinded with having co-op as a option in the game just results in a blast! Plus the game is quite cheap with it being eleven dollers flat. It also does a great job of saying ""Game maker's engine can make good stuff as well guys!""I love this game, and enjoyed the time spent with it so much.  The game as amazing soundtrack solid gameplay that is satisflying/fun and a ton of replayabiltiy solo or multiplayer you're sure to have a blast. The game earns at least a 9/10.  (Would link steam page but we're here so...) To buy the sound track go here: https://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain (favorite track: Coalescence) Thanks for reading! Hope you could find it useful if you would like to send me any critism by all means post it on my steam profile/here thanks!

												Risk of rain is a side-scrolling shooter with perma death and items you can buy from currency you gain from killing monsters. The longer you play the harder the game gets. It's simple, but rewarding. You start off with one character to choose from and start unlocking others with each having their own unique skills. As you play through the game you unlock new items.Risk of Rain is pure genuine fun without all the excess bloat that games seem to forget these days. Especially triple A games that seem to pad out too much story and excess content that drain the enjoyment that could be had. Risk of Rain is different and it emphasizes gameplay amongst all else. I can't recommend this game enough. It is an amazing roguelike-like and its one that i'll continually comeback to.			"

												Literally no rain in the whole game.But it is so fun playing this game.Just gaining items, playing as your favorite character, and fighting tons of enemies is super satisfying.To top it off, Risk of Rain has 3 difficulty settings, 10 unique characters, and plenty of artifacts to spice up the gameplay.This game is NOT for people who give up too easily. You WILL die.Once you beat monsoon 3 times or so, you get a feeling that you're good at the game.Then you play again with the honor artifact and you die.Overall, I think Risk of Rain deserves more attention (It's not like theres 13,000+ reviews already) and is one of the greatest rouge-likes every created.

												Risk or Rain is an absolutely amazing game to purchase. It's very addictive and interactive. Absolutely worth the $10.00 I paid. It does get a bit hectic though. Hectic to a point that some lower-end computers will get some lag issues (but in my experience, if you farmed a bit, you should have at least a bit of lag by the end level). It does have a bit of issues with multiplayer too. The replay value of this game is absolutely phenomenal. I've replayed the game countless times and it's still very fun to play, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The amount of different scenarios that arise are almost endless. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-like games or a game that really grabs your attention. :) :)			"

												Risk of Rain doesn't go easy on new players, and its emphasis on luck-based variables brings up some minor problems. But for what it's worth, Risk of Rain is good fun and will satisfy most rogue-like/platformer fans looking for a challenge.Pros:* Risk of Rain, in spite of it flooding with RNG variables, is largely skill-based. It's up to the player to make proper use of his abilities, avoid damage, scavenge the map and make effective use of his time. While the player can collect many randomly generated items, some of whose effects also randomly proc, there's usually so much going on by the middle of the playthrough that it all averages out. There's a little luck involved in the harder difficulties, but in the end you can depend on yourself to overcome the odds.* Risk of Rain has ten classes, all with diverse abilities and playstyles. The huntress is a master of ranged harassment, while HAN-D is a health-regenerating tank that loves to be in the fray; many classes have ways of avoiding damage while some rely on brute force or territory dominance to survive. There are slight balance issues between different characters, but they're minor enough to not be a big issue, and the game is also balanced semi-regularly, helping to place weaker classes like the enforcer and sniper nearer to the top.* Game supports up to ten players, but is also plenty of fun in single player.* Gorgeous aesthetics and a solid soundtrack. The game explores its lore quite a bit through beast and item logs, although the vast majority of the playable characters unfortunately remain voiceless.Cons:* Some of the map generations aren't great. Item chests and obstacles are generally well-distributed, but the portal (your goal) and spawn point positions don't always favor you. One randomly occuring boss can give melee characters hell, while another for the same level is a joke for most characters.* You only get one character starting out, and pretty much all of the characters will require at least a few playthroughs for you to manage to unlock them. I would recommend starting the game on easy and looking at the Risk of Rain wiki so you have an easier time finding the characters you want.* Controller support is bare-bones. Doesn't completely support remapping, also doesn't work at all for some of the menus. Works fine in-game at least, I prefer them to keyboard controls.* Online support isn't great. Server setup is sometimes confusing, larger online games may suffer from quirky issues, some which unfortunately affect the playability of the game. Your mileage may vary.* Last level lags on some computers. Still playable.			"

												This is the best game ever! It's so satisfying to kill monsters as they continually increase in difficulty and the power-ups are so much fun to use. I can't wait to unlock new characters and play some more multiplayer because I honestly cannot wait to play some more Risk of Rain. Pros: - Amazing pixel art visuals- The soundtrack is both epic and retro- One of the main features is perma-death and difficulty, and it gets harder the longer you survive- Gamepad support right out of the box- Randomized environments and monster spawns make for a different experience every timeCons: - It's sometimes hard to see yourself in the middle of the action after stacking so many buffs on your character- There seems to be a bug where any Steam pop-up is increased in size ten fold when playing full-screen- It can be a little confusing to set-up a server for friends to play in, but local multiplayer is a breeze - Platforming can be a little wonky with a keyboard, though the controls themselves are very simple and easy to understand			"

												Risk of Rain is one of those games where you can tell the love and passion of the developers have absolutely crammed their heart and soul into. Slick, smooth, hard, fun, deep, imaginative, beautiful and tight. It's one of the best games I've played and my only regret is I didn't play it sooner, longer.			"

												I absolutely love this game! It has such an odd an yet amazing feel to it! Athough using it on the Keyboard is quite the task! I'd recommend a Gaming Controller.      It is Seven Trillion Times more addicting with friends to help you along the way to beating the final boss. There is no feeling better than charging into a crowd of enemies with vibrant and helpful perks clot half of your screen!    Please buy this game! Tis worth every penny!			"

												One of the single best purchases I made in 2013, Risk of Rain is atmospheric, difficult, but not unfair, and takes what I feel are the most fun elements of a roguelike (randomized item drops and permadeath) and combines it with a challenging platformer designed to get harder the longer you last. Stellar. The soundtrack is absolutely perfect, as well - it gives each level that much more depth along with a sense of loneliness. HIGHLY recommended if you don't mind dying a few dozen times.			"

												This is by far one of my most favorite games of the year. It's like an old school shoot-em up, like Contra, pushed to 11. There are currently 10 classes in the game, each with a different skillset, so you should find one you are comfortable with. The classes range from a sniper who can one-shot bosses under the right circumstances, a riot officer who can plant his shield on the ground to absorb all damage from the front but renders him immobile and an engineer who can plant turrets and mines. You unlock each class by doing various objectives like beating the game or doing a mini event. Each class has four different abilities. You start out with the Commando who is very very good and is one of the best in my opinion (but I like the Huntress more). His primary damaging ability (spammable) is dual shot which fires two shots for damage,  a railgun like ability that fires a straight shot piercing all enemies, a dodge roll that gives you invulnerability frames, and an ability that can fire in both directions for quite a bit of damage. The overall combat in the game is very satisfying and if you die you know it was your fault and not the games. The game also has native 360 pad support, which is what I use to play, not so sure on the ds3 pad support though.There is a selection of active items you can pick up that can do some pretty cool things like summon some backup drones or summon a shadow clone to mimic your abilities. There are also many passive items you can get that give you various bonuses like enemies drop meat cubes on death that heal you when you pick them up, every 4th basic attack will pierce and summon bolts after you kill an enemy that will seek out others and damage them.The difficulty in the game can range from easy to holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this is the worst thing in the world, it really all depends on the items you get in the game. You can get some insane items on the first stage that can carry you through the rest of the game, like Infusion which grants maximum health on each kill or 56 Leaf Clover which makes farming much easier as it makes elite mobs, ones that have a white border around their health bar, have a chance to drop items. The level variety is really nice as they include a snowy levels, lava levels, underwater levels (no drowning involved!), and a space ship. There is also a hidden level in the game, can you find it without looking it up? The levels in the game are procedurally generated meaning that there will never be a chest inside a wall or the teleporter to exit each stage isn't inaccessible.The soundtrack in the game is just amazing, that's all I can say. Go listen to it for yourself! My favorite track is

One minute you're slowly toiling away through a few enemies and the next you're doing as you please with hordes all around you. A must buy for anyone into the 2D 16-bit aesthetic and progression that isn't impeded by permanent death.			"

												A must have for anyone who is inclined to bro-op. The Good:The music is fantastic, each level has it's own and it fits wonderfully.Sound effects give you a feeling of immersion. Monsters make noise, your gun sounds badass, and the ding-dong-dong signifying things are about to get a lot harder is ominious as hell.The characters give anyone with any playstyle their chance to shine in a group.The item descriptions gave me a chucke the first time around, and even more so once I read about them in the item log.The Bad:Well, the ""random levels"" really gives you only a few variations of the same levels. The randomization is limited to where the items are, the teleporter is located, and whether or not certain artifacts are accessible.Multiplayer. IP connections? I'm disappointed, Chucklefish, but at the same time, i've come to expect difficult setup just to play a game that's basically designed for multiplayer. A browser wouldn't be -that- hard now, would it?Other Thoughts:I'm capable of powering through any game, and love the way you unlock characters by doing specific actions in-game. The ability to start out with a well-balanced character will definitely help newcomers become familiar with controls and gameplay.I lovingly bestow upon this title an 8/10. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sheer ridiculous over-powered co-oping in late game.			"

												No doubt - this is one of the BEST games ever made.Great rougelike survival experience combined with hardcore platformer mechanics. The replayability is insene. I literally spent HUNDREDS of hours playing that game, and don't be confused by steam's hours counter - I've been playing RoR since early pre-steam alpha, and from that point the game is only getting better.And the best part: the soundtrack. There are not many games that can make you prove You such an unique experience. Sometimes I can run the game just to listen some of my fav tracks. Never gets boring. Simply amazing.Gameplay is so entertaining that I constantly keep catching my self on ending ""just a 15 minutes run"" after 4 hours of playing... There are unique items to unlock, a whole bunch on characters with unique skillsets,  game tactics, character-related achievements, and over 50 different items that can stack endlessly...tl;dr version:If You never played that game, do it. You won't regret any second spend playing it...			"

												This is an incredibly fun 2d roguelike. Like other roguelikes, it is possible to be killed throughout the game because of a simple slip up, and there is a reliance on getting the proper items in order to succeed in later levels. It's very possible to die on the first level simply because you don't find any useful items.The emphasis on ""permanent death"" for a character may be offputting to some, but beating the entire game takes about an hour, and dying is not a tremendous setback. The fun comes from the gameplay itself, not the progression to the end. The game is definitely worth $10 based on the singleplayer alone, and I've put many more hours into this game than games with a considerably larger price tag, but if that is not enough for you it has up to four player co-op. The multiplayer is fun but expect to die a lot more often. Money and experience is split between players which can make progress difficult, as items are not shared.This game is a great example of the roguelike genre, and great value for an individual or group of friends.

												If you're a fan of fast paced, action packed, RNG goodness then look no farther than Risk of Rain. This game will keep you (and up to 3 of your friends in local and online co-op) entertained for hours on end. The game contanis an interesting difficulty mechanic where as time increases so does the toughness. You are not alone though, you can defeat enemies and find other treasure to gain coinage which in turn will allow you to open locked chests as well as buy items from mini-stores. All of which, will help you in your adventure to beat the final boss. There are unlockable characters and items that you can obtain with each playthrough.So, if you are looking for a game and are unsure of what to get, don't hesitate on this one. Pray to RNGesus.			"

												I haven't played many rogue-lites myself, but I really enjoy this game's approach and its well-defined classes. Each class (10 in total) has 4 unique skills, and they allow for some fairly creative gameplay. The first skill is either a basic ranged or melee attack, although, some classes have an extra snippet tagged on. The second and third skills vary but are usually some combination of attack, mobility, or utility. The forth skill is a class's most powerful and fanciful, with the Sniper and Engineer being the only exceptions.Similar to most rogue-lites, there is no shortage of difficulty or challenge, especially when you're 'doing it wrong'. Obtainment of items is essential, but with chests and icons (for item gambling) scattered randomly throughout maps, you must temper exploration and gold farming with efficiency, lest the game clock itself defeat you. You can also obtain hidden items called Artifacts, each possessing some sweeping gameplay change or addition when toggled. I personally won't play the game without the Glass Artifact because otherwise the items--rather than your personal ability--substantially dictate your performance.Co-op can be a double-edged sword if one of your partners is unfamiliar with the game. They may bring more firepower, but items and gold will have to be shared. Die too much, without optimal farm, and your partner will leave you behind for the rest of the game. This is kind of what I was talking about concerning itemization.			"

												Risk of Rain. A game that prides itself on being insanely difficult. Right off the bat, a red flag. But! RoR is easy to pick up, with a small set of skills that must be executed flawlessly in order to beat the game (unless you are playing Huntress. Huntress OP).The game's selling points are perma-death (new term for ""arcade"") and its rougelike elements. Drops and enemies are randomized, while the ten possible maps are stitched together out of pre-determined chunks. It has a degree of arbitration while retaining familiarity to those who repeatedly play the game. A nice balance.The game is one of the best examples of modern pixel art that I can think of on the top of my head. It's really pretty. The movement is also very polished, with no little kinks as to how you are supposed to execute attacks--the ones you would find in games like CS:GO and Dark Souls.What's better yet is the game has multiplayer! PvE. But, this is where the shortcomings of the game begin. Multiple players are forced to fight over a fixed amount of item drops, which either requires a lot of teamwork, or having one person be the ♥♥♥♥♥ of the team who is insta-gibbed at the beginning of each stage because his teammates stole all the upgrades. While this allows for some strategy, a necessary part of good multiplayer, the scaling is just too unforgiving. Multiplayer makes the hardest difficulty look like child's play. The class balance is also a little wonky. Some classes are very easy to pick up (Huntress, Soldier, HAN-D), while others require ludicrous amounts of skill. Making some classes more difficult while others less so would make the game much better to play.Bottom line: If you are looking for an easy-to-play, hard-to-master game with decent multiplayer capability, get this game.8/10			"

												This game, made by Chucklefish Games (who, you should know, is actually making Starbound), is an addictive ""Action-Platform""(however, little platforming involved) that involves collecting items, gaining levels, and clearing your way to the Teleporter to fight a tough boss.Pros:- Class diversity is pretty nice. At least 10 to play around with.- Game is rock-hard. This is actually good, considering it's actual difficulty. Not intentionally bad coding and programming (AKA: Dark Souls) to make it SEEM difficult. When you die, it's a mistake you've made (like jumping into a pit of mini-bosses or trying to run off a ledge on less than 75 health to your doom). It makes you say ""OK, I messed up. Let's try again and see what I can do different to fix that.""- Not a lot of platforming involved, but enough to give it a little Platformer feel, and that's not bad. It actually kinda helps the game, IMO.- Great item diversity. Lots to unlock, lots to test and play around with.- Cool art design. I just like how it looks. Could have been better, (look up TotalBiscuit WTF Is...Risk of Rain for his opinion on it. he's got more experience than I do) but it's actually kinda neat. I think the enemies just look REALLY nice.- Soundtrack is mind-blowing. All you need to hear is the music in the game. Just turn Sound FX to 0% and Music to 100% (or comfortable listening levels). It WILL make you love this game for one more reason.- Enemy diversity is not the strongest, but it's still pretty good.- The levels are randomly generated every time you play it. This enhances the difficulty, as well as it makes the game a semi-unique experience every playthrough.- This game supports Co-Op, both Local and Online. This is great for playing with friends, even if they aren't nearby. You may need them, because the difficulty while flying solo makes playing Co-Op feel like a cakewalk.Cons:- The game is rock-hard. I felt the need to add this to the Cons list as well, for the reason that it could very easily be a turn-away for some people. I don't blame them. I had the same eyebrow-raised kinda curiosity at it when I saw TotalBiscuit play it. I got it for Christmas, and it was probably one of the most enjoyable games I got.- The art design. It passes a kind of bare minimum. It's kinda nice, but had more potential. Disappointment to some.- The random generation. Some people like running the same course again with a different character to see how strong he is. I can't blame them. While I enjoy the random generation myself, some others will not care for it.- The visuals are taxing to some, even though the game's requirements are NOT high at all. Can't list this as a constant con, but it's definitely one that will affect someone with a poor computer. I run this game at 60 constant (mostly because I use Trillinear V-Sync to prevent screen tearing, a weird issue that follows me for no reason.) and have a decent computer.- The descriptions are not helpful sometimes. Like the Missile Launcher Mk. 1, for example. Description: Hooah. Does that tell you much? NO. This is a little thing that I could nit-pick on, but I won't.Overall, this game is worth your $10. If you're STILL unsure about it, just wait till it goes for at least 50% off. It's worth it. I will  probably make an addiction out of this game, just to listen to the soundtrack more. Just that good.			"

Every life gets you one step closer to beating the game.Unlike other roguelikes this one has actual progress that is not all wiped away on death. Items and characters you unlock will still be unlocked in future playthroughs. There are 12 playable characters, 83 passive items, 27 use items and 10 artifacts of which most are locked in the beginning. Remember to bring a friend with you and you're going to have hours of fun unlocking them. "

												I'm loving this game. Its a 2D side-scrolling platformer that has a few rogue-like features, lots of loot to gather and items to unlock. Its difficult but not terribly frustrating. I find myself losing hours to this game. This is classic. "

												Risk of Rain has earned a special place in my heart. It is one of best games I have played in 2013 and 2014.The game is simple Kill monster ,eared money ,sped money ,beat boss and get the hell outta of there. The difficulty of the game is tied with the time the more time you spend on your playthrough the harder the game gets.Gameplay is simple 2D contra style. Well it depends highly on which class you pick and there are great verities of them. Every class is unique with his on Con and Pros and attacks. Took me 21 hours to finally beat the game but am not done there is lot of classes to unlock. I really want to try every class. Since every class has its own style of attacks and abilities. Art of this game is amazing too pixaled but still beautiful. AND THE MUSIC OMG. A masterpiece it’s really is. It fits the game so well. From the first hour playing this game I instantly went and bought the soundtrack. Risk of Rain is a 9.8/10 for me.Ps.I have not tried to play online Or locally SO I can’t comment on that. "

												This game is actually rather addicitve, it took me while to buy it, because my brother was REALLY trying to convince me to buy it, and when I watched gameplay, I couldn't see the appeal, but I eventually caved in and bought it in the end.And to my surprise I really enjoyed it.The simplicity of the way the game plays, and the simple pixel art works wonders for the game, and the music definitely completes the atmosphere.I do have a couple of things to say though.1: The music isn't 'AS' great as everyone seems to be making it out, yes, it's pretty good, but I have heard much better, it's definietly not soundtrack of the year, but you will enjoy it, I can promise you that.2: The game can start to slow down later on in the game, especially when you get to the last 2-3 difficulties and it decides to spawn about 100 enemies at once which it can't handle, especially considering by that point it's also trying to calculate the damage to all of them, and whether to make the 100 enemies explode, set on fire, give you health, bleed, poison, slow, and a few more things, this can slow the computer down if you don't have a fast enough computer to handle all of that.3: THE MULTIPLAYER SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING.  Basically, you have to either port-forward or use Hamachi, both of which are a real pain in the backside if you don't know what you're doing, luckily I have previous experience with Hamachi from Terraria's bad multiplayer.Let me point out though, that whilst the multiplayer is a real pain to get going, once you de eventually get it going, it's probably one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had in a while, and it's definitely worth iall the blood, sweat and tears it took to get it working.

												Risk of Rain is the purest form of the roguelike basis: Every step you take, every second that passes is against you.Time is gold, and in this game, it means that your enemies will be stronger, faster and deadlier.Start with the simple, but flexible Commando, and mow your way through masses of increasing enemy forces, open chests with items that will give you handy skills, repair drones to help you against the onslaugh and reach the portal, to proceed to the next stage. Unlock new classes, new items, new encyclopedia entries and learn about the true meaning of your cargo, and your mission.In this game, everything is against you, but, you can turn the tides. Learn your class, use your skills to the fullest, and survive.It's kill or be killed. The difference here, is how you play.Survival of the strongest at it's finest.			"

												No doubt - this is one of the BEST games ever made.Great rougelike survival experience combined with hardcore platformer mechanics. The replayability is insene. I literally spent HUNDREDS of hours playing that game, and don't be confused by steam's hours counter - I've been playing RoR since early pre-steam alpha, and from that point the game is only getting better.And the best part: the soundtrack. There are not many games that can make you prove You such an unique experience. Sometimes I can run the game just to listen some of my fav tracks. Never gets boring. Simply amazing.Gameplay is so entertaining that I constantly keep catching my self on ending ""just a 15 minutes run"" after 4 hours of playing... There are unique items to unlock, a whole bunch on characters with unique skillsets,  game tactics, character-related achievements, and over 50 different items that can stack endlessly...tl;dr version:If You never played that game, do it. You won't regret any second spend playing it...			"

												Great little game, fast, can be played in short sessions of no more than 1 hour, amazing replayability due to the random nature of items you get and very hard and rewarding experience, amazing soundtrack (can be seen and bought here: http://chrischristodoulou.bandcamp.com/album/risk-of-rain), the art style doesnt please me that much but its not bad, its competent, character model is a bit small and sometimes trhings can get very confusing when you have 300 monsters on the screen and youre shooting lasers everywhere, but still very funoverall great games for everyone that enjoys a good challenge, the platforming is a bit weak but the focus on combat is great, every class has a kit of 4 skills, a bit like dota champions that makes them pretty unique giving the game even more replayability, also very good coop, fun, but a bit messy, if the internet of the host is not good enough it can get very laggy, and if you dont know or cant open ports on your modem you might not be able to play at all unless you use hamachi or other programTl;Dr: great game, would rate it 8.5/10+great value+great gameplay+great soundtrack+lots of replayability+good selection of classes and items-issues connecting on multiplayer			"

												One of my all time favourite games on Steam. A roguelike, indie, platformer game with online, and local multiplayer plus a great soundtrack. Not a big fan of roguelikes myself, but this game really hit the spot. I loved it. Also the game itself was hard, good to see a game that has a few challenges. Multiplayer is great. I had great fun laughing at my friend who kept hilariously dying. Though I think that the Online Multiplayer may have a few bugs. Better off do local multiplayer then.Great game, really worth a try. 10/10.			"

												MULTIPLAYER IS BRETTY DIFICULT TO ACTUALY PLAY DUE TO PORT-FORWARDING STUFF NOW STOP CRYING IN THE FORUMS JESUS. Best and easiest way to do it is to buy tons of cola and snacks and just have a good old fashioned LAN or 1-Screen round of fun.Crispy clean pixel graphics and fantastic music accompany this fun rogue-like platformer.You play as the worst space-postal-service-worker/space-truck-driver ever and lose your entire shipment of cool artifacts due to faulty bad guy teleporter shenanigans...or atleast thats how I understood the story. I like being the space-mailman.The game is pretty hard at first, but you will really notice that you are becoming more skilled after playing for some rounds. You will unlock cool new items to use in later games as well as neat and unique characters! The items you will find are, of course, all randomly generated. You will have to adapt your playstyle ever so slightly depending on what items you find. That being said, it is possible to play well even if you are not really happy with your item-combos. There is a bit of skill and know-how involved. Randomness and your own input and choices are well balanced.At the last level, you will have the option of traveling to the boss of the game or re-visit previous levels. If you re-visit old levels repeatedly...like...waaaay too much....may god have mercy on anything that stands in your way.... "

												Ah Risk of Rain.   It's a fun rouge-like game that you can put many hours in.At first it can be come pretty gruesome (Espically with the permadeath included), but as you progress you can see a dramtic increase how long you survive and unlock more things that increase gameplay such as charcters, artificats, and items.  In my opinion after a while I feel bored (slow) when going through a playthrough and when on the hardest diffuculty it feels like childplay (Even without playing the ""kiting god""), espically without any artifacts on. (But there's certain things that can ramp up the diffuculty of the game even more, if you know what I mean☻).  There's notable difference in some of the characters kits that I notice while playing ""Risk of Rain"", that are sometimes better than other classes making things ""unbalance"" in certain situations, if you play long enough to see in classes. Despite that all the classes their own charm in their respective kit and the ""unbalance"" in certain situations, such as single player can add a challenge when you come back to risk of rain.  Some problems I have endured during my time in risk of rains are when i'm starting a new playthrough in single player and would fall out a map and would have to restart (dosen't bother me as much), and The multiplayer that sometimes likes to work and not (In my experinces). There's other bugs that never occured to me but to other people... Last level glitch,Crashing,etc that might be fixed as game updated recently (With a beta release even more back). If not people should report them the bugs in the respective areas.But despite all that, be sure to get risk of rain ☻			"

												I very much recommend Risk of Rain.Simply put, there are no, truly new ideas here. Pixel art, an immersive soundtrack, roguelike elements, (such as randomized items enemies and locations) are all elements we have seen before.Risk of Rain ; however, managages to bring all this together in a fun way. The first few games you will get beaten very hard. Theres a lot of fun in refining and slowly improving your approach and strategy to what the game throws at you. I remember feeling the same way about games like The Binding of Issac. Improvement is through iteration, yet somehow it all still feels fresh and exciting. Once you think you've got it - a new character, weapon or item unlocks and give everythign a suddenly fresh new take.Perhaps one of my favorite things is the way items stack. Seeing the same item twice doesn't feel like you'v elost ground. Getting, say many missiles that increace the chance to fire a moarter blast can work toegher to turn your player into a mean machine, blasting rockets, bullets and mayhem everywhere. Theres is a great deal of satisfaction to unleashing a lot of carnage after an especially enemy filled screen or boss fight. The slow and incremental increase of difficulty over time, prevents meaningless grinding. You find the game is now a matter of maximizing upgrading, destruction and treasure hunting vs level progression. Its a good formula- and it scales effectively.I'm especially excited about the possibility of multiplayer, which I've yet to experience.The only downside, if there is one- is that the characters you can play, while interestingly differnt, are also radically unbalanced in effectiveness. Some characters, like the huntress really compliment the nature of fighting enemy swarms, and tower over the other characters in overall effectiveness. the sniper, by contrast, I can only see being used as a fully support character, and is simply too unuseable, and therfore not fun or exciting to play. I consider these criticisms minor. I'd be much more nonplussed by playing carbon-copy characters with different shirt colors. The great variety of playable characters only lends to the games strength.If you see this game on sale- just buy it. Its worth the money.			"

												After a solid 30 hours of gameplay I have to say; I love this game. Risk of Rain is an interesting blend between platforming, action, roguelike and even some hints of (MO)BA. To avoid too much spoilers; it's a 2D game set in space, and you're a survivor trying to get off a planet. Ofcourse this planet can't be friendly, so there will be a large variety of monsters that you will have to kill to finally get off that planet. The planet and it's stages (remember; roguelike) are all randomly generated (and a joy to play!) Trust me; it won't be easy. Even on it's lowest difficulty Risk of Rain is a challenge as long as you play it alone or with someone equally inexperienced. But that's part of the fun. Risk of Rain will laugh at you, mock you (literally) and it will force you to think of a different plan every single playtrough. 30 hours and I completed this game 6 times on normal difficulty, just to give you an idea. Another part I love to address is the co-op element of this game. It's chaos, sometimes a little panick-y, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. The challenges accompanied by playing Risk of Rain make for enough of a challenge for even the most experienced players (up to 4), although divide and conquer seems to make it just a tad easier (just throw up the difficulty!). Lastly, the soundtrack. Risk of rain is an atmospheric game set in a 2D pixel art world, and it's the music that ties the game into an epic whole. If I wouldn't enjoy the gameplay I would still play Risk of Rain for the different soundtracks. They determine the mood of the game, and they do it with precision and style. Summary/TLDR; If you like roguelikes, platformers, chaos, pixel art or just great video game music, Risk of Rain is a must have.			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever had the privilege to play. Sure, it can seem obtusely difficult at times, but when you mess up and die it's never the game's fault. You really feel like it's you that made the mistake. The exoctic alien planet you traverse throughout the game has been beautifully modeled with retro graphics, and the soundtrack is one that I would place very highly on a top 10. I would even go as far as to say It's even better than some other  popular roguelike platformers out there, such as Rogue Legacy and Spelunky. It could be that the gameplay is based more around combat, or that the difficulty increasing over time mechanic is unique to this game. You have to find a balance between slowing down to get money (or muney), tracking down items, and rushing to find the teleporter.  All of these make for an extremely polished and addictive experience, and the game doesn't take much processign power to deliver gameplay constantly at a silky-smooth 60 FPS. With several classes to unlock, artifacts to find, over 100 different items, and unlimited replayability due to random elements, this is probably the best 10 bucks you'll ever spend.			"

												I give this an 8 out of 10. The gameplay is challenging, and it keeps you deciding whether or not to be rushing to the next level in hopes of beating it faster, or exploring for as many items as possible beforehand.The multiplayer can only be played with by friends who share their IP with you. This is one of the two flaws with the game that I have noticed. But other than that, what can go wrong with cooperative play while trying to survive together? Multiplayer takes teamwork. You cannot just hog all the items and expect your partner to survive.The other flaw is how things work with item unlocks. They force you to either get them by going into the game and actually only trying to get said acheivement, or you just play normally and barely get any of them. The less items you have unlocked, the less likely you are to succeed at this game, so start farming those achievements!A strong game overall with few flaws, would definitely reccommend this for anyone who likes a challenge, pick this up if you have the money. You will not regret it.			"

												Ah Risk of Rain.   It's a fun rouge-like game that you can put many hours in.At first it can be come pretty gruesome (Espically with the permadeath included), but as you progress you can see a dramtic increase how long you survive and unlock more things that increase gameplay such as charcters, artificats, and items.  In my opinion after a while I feel bored (slow) when going through a playthrough and when on the hardest diffuculty it feels like childplay (Even without playing the ""kiting god""), espically without any artifacts on. (But there's certain things that can ramp up the diffuculty of the game even more, if you know what I mean☻).  There's notable difference in some of the characters kits that I notice while playing ""Risk of Rain"", that are sometimes better than other classes making things ""unbalance"" in certain situations, if you play long enough to see in classes. Despite that all the classes their own charm in their respective kit and the ""unbalance"" in certain situations, such as single player can add a challenge when you come back to risk of rain.  Some problems I have endured during my time in risk of rains are when i'm starting a new playthrough in single player and would fall out a map and would have to restart (dosen't bother me as much), and The multiplayer that sometimes likes to work and not (In my experinces). There's other bugs that never occured to me but to other people... Last level glitch,Crashing,etc that might be fixed as game updated recently (With a beta release even more back). If not people should report them the bugs in the respective areas.But despite all that, be sure to get risk of rain ☻			"

												i would vote yes and no but that isnt possible, the game is fun, challenging and tests your luck and skill, but its buggy. very buggy. and there arent patches for it either, i play acrid alot since he's my favorite survivor and pretty easy to unlock and whnever i do it cuts off most audio. the fp drops alot if you have certain items and there are alot fo exploits that end up making the game predictable. my main peeve is the sound. i really enjoy the music and being able to hear the enemies attack when they should so i can keep up my tempo but that glitch killed the game for me,			"

												Risk of Rain is a slow boil that truly rewards the patient. Initially, playing the game can seem like an exercise in futility, as your character gets overwhelmed by massive odds. But slowly, as more and more items unlock and pile on, game play sessions tip the scales in the other direction, towards the absurd.Before you know it, you've got forty items, double, triple, and quad-stacked or more, and your damage dealt is measured not in tens but thousands. Lasers and missiles and explosions spew from your body with each attack, and enemies fall when they enter your immediate range. Suddenly, game play sessions that lasted 15 minutes seem paltry in comparison to your multi-hour runs, cycling through stages countless times as you run the hamster wheel of greed and mayhem.Again, Risk of Rain rewards the patient. Slog through your failures, and ultimately you'll come out the other side, 15 hours later, with the most fun platformer in a long time.			"

												+ Great core gameplay + Lots of items and characters + no two playthroughs will be exacly the same - lack of matchmaking - stupidly easy bosses Risk of Rain is a rouge like action ""platformer"" with heavy rpg elements, the game consists of chosing one of over 20 characters and building up a massive amount of items leading to incredibly satisfying gameplay just watching all of your item affects take place and complement your abilities, the game also has a lot to do, such as unlocking new characters, items and achievements. This keeps the game from getting boring. There are some bad things however, such as a lack of matchmaking for co-op and all characters not doing much damage with basic attacks and come bosses being stupidly easy but it won't stop me from reccomending this game			"

Posted: December 26, 2016
General Overview:As people continue to say and will always say after multiple hours of playing a game i must say this Review is overdue. Like damn this game is probably one of the best platformer, rogue-like games ive played in like an eternity sure i havent lived that long like come on thats a fair bit old id say, but this game is honestly amazing. It provides a perfected risk and reward system the reward loot and the possibility to leave the retched planet with your only your wit and assumed skills that you all propose you have to beat this game.Characters:Each character is unique, nad yes they all have different capabilities and weaknesses, have you ever wanted to butter up an enemy and give them a little heat them go for it. Want be the embodiment of a walking disease its all yours buddy because if you decide to get this game then you can do whatever you want in it, give a few enemies a slash, punch, bullet wound until eventual death, well each of these diverse and unique characters can fill your thirst for blood.Relics: These are special items found within in the game, they are of a higher and more mysterious background each one holding ancient power that you find in the world you have been stranded on. effectively they add game changing impacts i wont say anything to spoil i hate doing that but they make you play differently and make you approach the game in a new way with every different relic activated, its just beautiful.Unlocks, Achievements Etc:Everything you do in this game can unlock something say you kill an enemy, ho baby is that a monster log he just dropped yes it is indeed, these monster logs give you more information on the creatures you're fighting and added lore. Did you just manage to do a specific task with a character, well mate heres an unlocked item and a little more progress towards 100% completed game. There is multiple things you can unlock which is dictated by what you do in the game. So if you're a completion-ist then this game is for you.EnemiesI feel this game has a compelling amount of enemies that each do something differently with attacks movement and other minor details. Each enemy provides a different intake on killing and dodging. The enemies also later on during the game start to come in different variations that make them act differently and add an extra spice to them. Lets also talk about Bosses, these things are monsters they all are different and none feel the same as each other different looks and different intakes on battling also come in variations.Items:Items play a huge roll in this game, of course they do items = power, and what power the power to kill enemies easier and  with cool effects too. Each item adds to the player affecting the players visuals and general coolness. The items all have their own attributes that completely enhance one players abilities in the game. With these diverse and high quantity and quality of items you can become something godly, items can make synergies with one another you can make builds for your survivor anything to get you through the harsh worlds you have been escape podded too. cause come on who doesnt want to shoot homing rockets out their butt like they have some form of gastro affecting them.Difficulty:There are 3 different varying difficulties placed in this game and each provides their own purposes starting at the lovely Drizzle. are you a first timer then give this difficulty a try to get your ground even to test out some characters abilities you know a test run difficulty, next we have Rainstorm where i think most people do their starting game play you know this is where players can unlock new items and achievements for their characters whilst providing a moderate difficulty. Lastly of course we have Monsoon. This is where the magic happens mass enemy spawns, more elites more everything this is where the real challenge begins keeping you on your toes so that every move can decide your fate, just what you want on a friday night when ya get out of school and your like i want to play intensely weekend baby.Problecations... its a word:Now as much enthusiasm as i show for this game there is also problecations to the game and yes thats a word mate or gall please forgive me. There are a few bugs that exist in the game that probably will never get fixed but they are minor and completely unnoticeable, some items do feel completely useless which sucks to be honest but they quantity of items make up for it. Another problem is that the game feels somewhat abandoned by the developers i havent seen and update in many months and probably many more to come which affects the content which could be added. If not last its the multiplayer, if you havent port-forwarded your pc to make a custom ip and home port then this game cant really be played unless you're using hamachii or evolve which does it for you which can kinda suck.Final Thoughts:I honestly love this game and its defiantly a blast with friends without a doubt even without friends this game can take up most if not all of your spare time because each run you do in this game feels different, different things can happen in the game different items, bosses, characters, relics anything, theres an endless amount of possibilities that can happen in the game, each run is different and unique and thats why i play this game and love it more, this is why ill continue to play this game for as long as possible. At full price this game is completely worth the money its just so damn amazing, I highly recommend this game. Risk of Rain Review: 1005 Words			"

Genre: Hectic 2-D action platformer with roguelike RPG elementsGame Time: 4~10+ hours""The game is set in the distant future, where space transportation is common. Space trains carry passengers and goods all across space. A particular space train, however, had some very special cargo. Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor."" -From Risk of Rain WikiaAn Interesting NoteInitially the title ""Risk of Rain"" implies different origins. It could imply the pain from its roguelike elements or the loose plot where the cargo, which is potentially dangerous, falling onto the planet like meteor showers. However according to an e-mail response from the developers, ""…it came around as an idiom of chance, because the game was very chance-based… It also coincides with the chests 'raining' from the sky, and our hometown Seattle.""Initial impressionRoguelike games has never been my cup of tea when it comes to entertainment. Sure they're alot cheaper and are easier to purchase, but that's pretty much the only reason why I would risk spending even dollar on. Risk of Rain (as RoR) on the contrary made me thirst for more. I saw myself clicking the ""play"" button repeatedly and despite the length of the game, I had a great time shooting down critters and getting plummeted by Magma Worms.""Visuals!""Assuming you have viewed the trailer, RoR is without doubt, pixel-based. This is the point where a surprising amount of customers have their opinion's divided. I personally agree with what Totalbiscuit said that there could have been more done with the visuals, but since the game can't get more visually neat than now, I see this as an reasonable compromise. We're talking about an Indie game here after all. In summary, the visuals are clean and are easily understandable. The colors don't feel dull especially when each one of the maps are distinct. The effects are flashy, and although you'll get to the point where everything goes fubar, the game is fair from what you expect. Oh, but them infinitely spawning Wandering Vagrants in the last level, they were a massive pain in the butt. Even if you're picky in-terms of graphics, getting frustrated and confused from how you died, or how you're being hurt will be the least of your concerns. Mechanics(Contents)Now in RoR you have plentiful numbers of passive items as well as interesting active items and drones you'll find throughout each randomized level. However what makes RoR so addictive aside from it's procedurally generated worlds, are its twelve characters that create a basis of your gameplay. You begin with the Commando, the standard shoot & dodge character, to the Acrid, a beast equipped with poison potentially lethal to even the hulking bosses of the game. Of course you will quickly create a preference on each character, but you'll be inclined to come back to for a refreshing gameplay, especially for Co-Op. The point that has to emphasized here is that to say the characters in this game define RoR, isn't even the slightest understatement. Experiment, and enjoy the variety. Most of all, have fun taking down hoards of those monsters. Before you get utterly destroyed, though.What the game offers Over a hundred items that are categorized with rarity, aside from a few, there are no two items that have the same effects. Interesting artifacts that mostly make the game hard, but more interesting. For example the Hive Cluster artifact makes the randomized loot, choosable. The Origin artifact on the otherhand, spawns Imps and a Imp boss every 10 minutes. Very limited, but unique maps that provide flavor and decreases boredem to the game. "

												I rally wanted this game for a long time but i told myself 'i won't spend 10 bucks for pixel based game which was probably written  on the knee'...So yesterday i found it in library after friend gifted it to me. Its highly enjoyable and addicting. Despite platformer-like design and pixel graphics it turns out to be one of the greatest rogue-like games i've ever played ( at this moment deffinetly in top10 - somewhere after ADOM, DCSS, Ziggurat and Binding of Isaac and Dungeons of Dredmor) at least thats what can i say after barelly starting it . Im excited and lets hope its not only first impression :)			"

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			"

												Side-scrolling co-op action shooter with Roguelike elements (in the vein of Binding of Isaac). Fun for a singleplayer playthrough, great for repeated co-op playthroughs. The characters are well-designed and unique and you'll collect more loot than even Diablo would throw your way. Worth noting: There is no way to play with random internet strangers.			"

Genre: Hectic 2-D action platformer with roguelike RPG elementsGame Time: 4~10+ hours""The game is set in the distant future, where space transportation is common. Space trains carry passengers and goods all across space. A particular space train, however, had some very special cargo. Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor."" -From Risk of Rain WikiaAn Interesting NoteInitially the title ""Risk of Rain"" implies different origins. It could imply the pain from its roguelike elements or the loose plot where the cargo, which is potentially dangerous, falling onto the planet like meteor showers. However according to an e-mail response from the developers, ""…it came around as an idiom of chance, because the game was very chance-based… It also coincides with the chests 'raining' from the sky, and our hometown Seattle.""Initial impressionRoguelike games has never been my cup of tea when it comes to entertainment. Sure they're alot cheaper and are easier to purchase, but that's pretty much the only reason why I would risk spending even dollar on. Risk of Rain (as RoR) on the contrary made me thirst for more. I saw myself clicking the ""play"" button repeatedly and despite the length of the game, I had a great time shooting down critters and getting plummeted by Magma Worms.""Visuals!""Assuming you have viewed the trailer, RoR is without doubt, pixel-based. This is the point where a surprising amount of customers have their opinion's divided. I personally agree with what Totalbiscuit said that there could have been more done with the visuals, but since the game can't get more visually neat than now, I see this as an reasonable compromise. We're talking about an Indie game here after all. In summary, the visuals are clean and are easily understandable. The colors don't feel dull especially when each one of the maps are distinct. The effects are flashy, and although you'll get to the point where everything goes fubar, the game is fair from what you expect. Oh, but them infinitely spawning Wandering Vagrants in the last level, they were a massive pain in the butt. Even if you're picky in-terms of graphics, getting frustrated and confused from how you died, or how you're being hurt will be the least of your concerns. Mechanics(Contents)Now in RoR you have plentiful numbers of passive items as well as interesting active items and drones you'll find throughout each randomized level. However what makes RoR so addictive aside from it's procedurally generated worlds, are its twelve characters that create a basis of your gameplay. You begin with the Commando, the standard shoot & dodge character, to the Acrid, a beast equipped with poison potentially lethal to even the hulking bosses of the game. Of course you will quickly create a preference on each character, but you'll be inclined to come back to for a refreshing gameplay, especially for Co-Op. The point that has to emphasized here is that to say the characters in this game define RoR, isn't even the slightest understatement. Experiment, and enjoy the variety. Most of all, have fun taking down hoards of those monsters. Before you get utterly destroyed, though.What the game offers Over a hundred items that are categorized with rarity, aside from a few, there are no two items that have the same effects.

												This game turned to be one of my favourite games for this part of my life. It's complex and simple at the same time. Select your hero (You have just one at the beginning, but you unlock more as you play) and release mayhem anywhere you go. The pickup system can look difficult on first sight, but later on you realize how it works and is terribly fun . The game gets harder as you play and the more you survive, the harder the enemies are. It can be really difficult to survive, but that's the objective. And once you kill the final boss, you feel incredibly well.On the counterpart, the frame rate is terrible in some situations that involve too many monsters. But even with that, I completely recommend it.			"

												First i just wanna make clear, that this game has nothing to do with rain.This is, the best Rogue-like game I've ever played, the goal is to get items as fast as possible, hurry to the teleporter if you think you can beat the boss, you've got like 2.5-5 minutes if you dont want to get your♥♥♥♥♥owned in the next level, so you better hurry! It's basically the same in level 2, 3, and 4, but at the end of level 4, when you've beat the boss, it will ask if you want to start over with all your items, or continue to the final level. If you beat the final boss, you beat the game. It's MUCH harder than it sounds like, and Co-op is recommended for survival.Well I've beat the game, nothing to do here...  NO! This game has a great replayability, you can unlock new characters, items, achievements, beat highscores, and enjoy all the randomly chosen maps, each with unique background music. ALSO this game is made by CHUCKLEFISH, they make GREAT bagground music, and great games, AND THEY EVEN MADE STARBOUND! Worth 4 times the money if you ask me.			"

												Activate the teleporter and hop in to proceed to the next level. A timer will be shown once you have activated it and need to survive spawning enemy waves for 90 seconds before the teleporter can be used. Defeat enemies, farm their gold and open chests with it for items. Items will give you perks. The problem I have with this game is the lack of balance. There a 2 scenarios possible. You are lucky and farm good items and become godlike or unlucky with item spawns in that you are unable to proceed further. When you have farmed good items and become godlike (there is no item cap) it involves zero skill and all you do is kiting and let perks do their job of killing mobs. The game throws so many enemies at you later on that it turns into a kite fest and most characters and their abilities become useless. There is no mechanism that prevents you from getting overpowered and still able to tackle enemy mobs without kiting. The game clearly lacks any balancing from mid to late game. You are also unable to play this with two controllers in local coop which doesn't make sense. Great concept and potential but ultimately falls short by design issues.			"

												Risk of Rain pulls on the right strings for those who would love a fast-paced roguelike platformer.The things I love about this game are the procedural generation, the wide variety of items, the nostalgic yet fresh pixel art, an atmospheric soundtrack, and the 10 unique classes. All of that packaged together makes for some FUUUUN TIMES. Risk of Rain manages to feel new and exciting through multiple playthroughs and with each of those playthroughs being fairly short, it doesn't necessitate a person to dedicate a huge chunk of time finishing the game.There are things that warrant polish however. Some of the classes are much better than others, I think a few tweaks in the numbers department would balance the issue. The Multiplayer could use some additions, like being able to kick someone from your server, having a server save list, and being able to see a selected class's abilities during the selection screen are a few I can think of.Overall, Risk of Rain is a nostalgic, quick blast of fun well worth it when... Steam has it on sale. 7.5/10			"

												The game has quite much potential, it's fun to play and its rogue-like elements work. Unfortunately it doesn't give very polished impression... some things in the game are carried out in ways that are sub-par. I initially tried playing the game on Arch Linux, but the x360 controller didn't work with the game (whereas it worked fine for example with Hammerwatch), so I changed to Windows. All games were played online.The biggest problem was that the Last boss teleporter crashed the game every time it was tried, which is game breaking. How can a game have so critical bug? In a roguelike it's utterly ridiculous that the game rewards the player always with error screen instead of last boss after 30 min of gameplay... no report option but just plaintext error. In a game where you start from the beginning after death, this is very frustrating.The game also had problems starting online coop which crashed the game twice. Before that the online game had some connection issues and the other player couldn't connect. Also, for some unexplainable reason, the enemies and other player started warping on one occasion. The ping is shown corner of the screen and it didn't really explain these warping issues. In this occasion the game played surprisingly well but things appeared somewhere where they shouldn't have.I'd really like to give this game a chance. Its gameplay is quite nice and fun but it appears to be broken. There may or may not be a fix for the gamebreaker, but it shouldn't be gamer's job to first keep googling for hours a solutions and after that keep playing half an hour just to see if the first one (or tenth one) solution had actually worked.EDIT: After ten more hours of gameplay and six more random crashes. The game keeps crashing quite often, about one time in a hour and a half. This means that every third run or so crashes. Besides that the coop has that last boss can't be fought because of that teleport bug.Also during these hours of gameplay the biggest problem of the game concept was revealed. The game has quite many items to unlock, but unlocking them doesn't really give awarding feeling. The biggest accomplishment of Binding of Isaac was that gamer experienced the unlockables awarding. In Isaac each unlockable gave a chance to get further in the game and completing the game gave new levels. In Risk of Rain the game can be completed with basic layout, so there isn't really need for cool new items. Also the waves that get more difficult as the time of a run proceeds don't differ from each other enough. I tought that after the waves ""I see you"" and ""I'm coming for you"" something unbeatable would have appeared. Instead just more enemies come and some low level boss enemies that can be easily farmed for powerups. The game doesn't award for speed in runs, instead it encourages the opposite, which really doesn't suit this game.			"

												   Possibly one of my most favorite games. Action packed never having a dull moment. While the game has recently ben given some bad credit due to bugs, I have experienced very little of this. Be warned though, those who purchase the game for multiplayer will require a third party software such as Logemein Hamachi(which personally does not bother me). A friend of mine told me of constant crashing and playthrough loss while in the middle of a match but I have never crashed yet. The Wikipedia page even gives out the source information so you can edit in any lost progress or just cheat for everything. Steam acheivements also seem to only work on Linux OS but cards are still available.10/10 Would framerate lag again.			"

												Survival is the name of the game, and it will take a lot of skill, and lot of luck to win.The levels are random. The items are random. The enemies are (relatively) random. The only thing that doesn't change are the weapons you start with, and the music. At the start of every play, you will explore a unique maps to hunt for monsters and treasure, that will help you level up and become better equipped to fight the bigger and badder foes. But, as time progresses, the difficulty increase, so every second counts, and every decision, and every action dictates your chances for survival. If you think you've reached the end of the level, you better be prepared for the horde you must face in order to survive.			"

												The longer you play this game, the harder it gets. You thought the impossible difficulty would be the hardest? Well get ready to second guess yourself on what the word impossible really means, because boy does it get harder. This game has great replayability due to how many items, characters and artifacts there are to unlock and alter your gameplay. Each character you unlock is new an unique, each time you unlock can beneifit you in several ways.Enemies are also unique in each zone you're in. Pigs, jellyfish, robots, goopy things and more are going to try to kill you. But the game is really good.			"

												If you like rougelikes then you will like Risk of Rain. It has 10 classes to choose from each going for a completely different playing style. It works like this. You wake up from a crashed pod in either The dried lake or The Desolate Forest. You go around killing what spawns and the level is randomized, now sometimes the level looks almost completely the same as another time you played it HOWEVER it will NEVER have the same chests and definitly never have the same items because there are 100+ items. So you find the teleporter and For the next 90 seconds (or 120 on monsoon difficulty) enemys will spawn rapidly and at least 1 boss will spawn. at the end of the 90 seconds you kill everything left on the screen then you can go to the teleporter and you can teleport to the next level. But before we go there I need to tell you about the items and chests system. The items and chests system is easy, you get some money from killing any monster and you get some money if you open up these containers that are just sitting around. You spend money to open chests, for example on the 1st level you pay 25 for a small chest and 50 for a large chest. Im still not sure how it increases from there because on the 2nd level I will have small chests costing 78 one time and the next they cost 53. Every time you open a chest you get 1 random item from a pool of items im not sure how much you start with but when you complete achievements you can unlock more items to get. When you go to the 2nd level it can be either the Damp Caverns or the Sky meadow and you do prettymuch the same thing as the 1st level. find teleporter, survive for 90 seconds, kill all enemys, and go to next level. and level 3 is prettymuch the same and so is level 4 and 5 however the 6th... well ill just let you figure that out.As time goes on the difficulty gets harder at about 5 minutes the difficulty increases from very easy to easy then later to medium then to hard then to impossible then to some funny things ill let you figure out yourselfThe multiplayer works well so long as you know how to port forward if you don't know what that is then go look up ""Risk of Rain how to set up a server"" and you should find something to help you. Overall very good game 8/10 "

The world will summon deadly monsters, but you can kill them to get money to unlock items that will help you survive. As time ticks on, the world will become deadlier, releasing elite enemies and boss monsters to send you to your death.

												Genre/game type - Sci-fi, 2D sidescrolling, action shooter, roguelikeI absolutely recommend this game, especially for the cheap price. Like most roguelikes, the essence of the fun is derived from each playthrough being a unique experience. While the levels are not actually randomized in the normal roguelike fashion, the collectible items are, so during each game you will find yourself sporting a unique arsenal of various weapons, gadgets, passive bonuses, etc.The real fun and the real challenge of this game are one in the same: being overwhelmed by strange alien monsters, and trying to shoot your way out. How well you succeed at this depends largely on what kind of items you were able to find while exploring (and collecting currency from slain enemies, to buy further upgrades). However, therein lies the rub: you want to explore, to gain more weaponry... but as the clock ticks, the difficulty rises, which causes more and more aliens to spawn.So do you explore more to find more life-saving items? Or do you rush to find the teleporter that will beam you to the next level (albeit ill-equipped to face that level, since you rushed to get there)? No matter what, the aliens are numerous, and unforgiving. This game is hard no matter how you choose to play it - but it's that special kind of hard that inspires a type of frustration unique to roguelikes - the kind that feels just as good as it does bad - the kind that makes you groan and scream upon each death, only to immediately restart for another chance at glory.My only qualms: the levels, like I already mentioned, could stand a little more variety/randomness. Also, while the overall pixel-art style of the game looks quite good, some of the items look a little clunky in appearance. Neither of these qualms are by any means a reason not to play the game - just possible suggestions for how to polish future iterations.One last thought: if you love sci-fi roguelikes, but were just too frustrated with FTL, this might be the perfect game for you. Different type of gameplay, but you're still fighting aliens in a space-like setting, and it's not nearly as frustrating as FTL could be.			"

												A fantastic platformer/side-scrolling rogue-like game with plenty of challenges and unlockables to keep you playing again and again. The net play isn't always the greatest for some, and without good communication item sharing can be a hassle (not to mention it can make the game more difficult to spread items out a lot), but it's not bad with a few good friends along. The game itself doesn't have a deep or extensive narrative, and the level variation is slim, but it's an experience you'll want to have over and over (even if it means dying over and over.)			"

												Risk of Rain is best described as a 2D action-roguelike-platformer. At it's core, players must proceed through random levels with different layouts in search of a teleporter. They must do this whilst fending off onslaughts of enemies, collecting items to live slightly longer and all with haste, as the difficulty amplifies depending on how long players have been, well, playing.Having crash-landed on an openly hostile alien planet, your job is to find your ship and get the hell off said planet. The local wildlife are highly unimpressed by your presence, and want to remove your face. And they will do so in droves.As players lurch deeper into the game, more items and characters will become available to them. For instance, take the Enforcer; a lumbering tank on legs carrying a shield and a shotgun. Yes, he's slow, but he certainly makes up for it with power.One of the more satisfying elements of this game is ironically when you meet your maker. Unlike most roguelike games, this game focuses on combat. This means that death is a matter of human error as opposed to shoddy game mechanics, luck and stats to determine a hit or miss. It feels rather satisfying, if you can overcome the game's steep learning curve.In short, Risk of Rain is an insanely difficult yet highly satisfying and overall fun game to play. The game also supports local and online co-op (which is rather rough but fun), so bring some friends along too if you want!			"

												Ok, so. This is a pretty great game. Gameplay is fun and fast paced, and the difficulty really spikes well. I'm quite surprised that it was only made by a couple of college room mates. The problem with it though is that it has quite a few bugs, such as the random crash, and I can't get any sound out of it as of now, but it's still a good game.I'd give it an 8 out of 10, due to the bugs. If the developers can find the time to fix those bugs, this would definitely be a 10/10.			"

												I think this game is a very good game for a lot of reasons. For one, it has a lot of replayibilty, all rouge-like games do. The maps are not ""randomly generated"" as much as other games, they all have static points but some of the map will change up on you. The loot locations will always be diffrent, and somtimes some areas will be open, or closed. There is a lot of unlockibles, and 10 diffrent maps you will see and enjoy. The enimes are pretty diverse, each with a little lore log. The bosses are similar to terraria type bosses, but they change up the game when they start spawning normaly. The whole game is set on a timer and the time you take fills up a difficulty metter. The ""easy,medium, hard"" mode you pick when starting just changes how fast this meter fills up. When the meter fills up, things dont nessicasrly just start doing more damamge making ""artificial difficulty"" but rather they start spawning more stronger enimiers, and more bosses. This game is very easy if you know how to dodge, and how to monover each of the enimies. Honestly, I love playing this game, and it is very addicting. The only part I can complain about is that it does get laggy near the end of the game.If you are on the fence about it, deffiently pick it up on a sale and try it out. I am sure you will enjoy it, and playing with friends jsut adds to the enjoyment.			"

												If you ever want to relive the old NES days where game difficulty added to the fun this is the game to get.  Risk of Rain brings a refreshing and realistic difficulty factor.  The graphics on this game go to show, that not everything needs to be ""pretty"" to be considered a good game as gamers of the new generation would have you believe.  Risk of Rain provides you with multiple characters but only one starting character.  The game can be played single of coop with up to three other people which makes the game easier.  Risk of Rain was truly aimed at a single player experience but you won't last long if you don't have patience as the difficulty of the game increases the longer you play regardless of what initial difficulty you choose.  There are many lootable items that build your power, some may seem worthless while others more apparent in their use.  It is all about the drop and when it drops.  Choosing the wrong item when given a choice can make your life more miserable.  Bosses are challenging at first but become easier as you continue to play and learn the habits of the enemies and bosses.  Overall, this game has great replaybility and ten dollars is a fair price to pay for something that you don't see often anymore.... a well made game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2D platformer and shooter with roguelike elements, such as semi-random levels and perma-death.  You play as one of ten survivers who have crash landed on a hostile planet and must become stronger and collect the items necissary to survive long enough to hopefully leave the planet.This game was almost and instant favorite of mine given its high difficulty, even on the easiest difficulty, and unforgiving nature. The controls are simple: arrow keys move, space jumps, and ZXCV activate each of your four abilities.  The abilities are different for each survivor and along with different health, damage, and level multiplyers, makes each one have its own unique playstyle.  While killing enemies to level up is important, it is not nearly as important as finding and buying the appropriate items to aid you, as many of them can increase your damage, health, healing, or range, far more significantly than your level ever can.The music is well composed and enjoyable to listen to, which is saying something as I've heard every track hundreds of times now.  The artwork and style is all a nostalgiacly creative use of pixles, and the survivors and characters are all very creative and while some are reminecent of other games, they are still unique enough to easily differentiate this game's universe from any other.There is multiplayer co-op, but I have only tried it once.  Getting it connected can be a real pain, but it can make the game significantly easier.As of writing this the game still has some kinks.  It will not run on my computer unless it's through Steam and only if Steam is running as administrator.I recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge as well as an old school experience.			"

												9/10This is a very tough, very fun, rouge-like run and gun game. The permadeath element provides significant challenge and unlocking new characters is much more difficult than you would anticipate. The randomized level designs are great and provide a new experience with each play through. It took me about 7 hours to beat the final boss and another two before I completely lost interest. The game is worth the asking price but those prone to rage fits should definitely steer clear. The odds are very much stacked against you and death is all but a forgone conclusion for each play through. I would definitely recommend. "

												As roguelikes (rogue-lites? roguelike-likes? not sure what term people are using for these type of semi-randomly-generated lootcollecters/platformers these days) go, this one is definitely one of the best, along with Spelunky, Rogue Legacy and The Binding Of Isaac. The game has a steady learning curve - the difficulty curve? Gets ever more insane (even HAHAHAHA ;) ) as time progresses, but hopefully you should have enough items to deal with the hordes of inhospitable beasts that await you as you continue further into the levels and time...

Between fighting to survive as your health gets chunked down by insane boss fights and blasting away enemys like a total badass, this game dosn't have a single dull moment. Honestly this game only has one thing that frustrates me, just slightly, and its that your character is pretty small and sometime gets lost in all the chaos, but its also part of what makes the game challenging.

												RoR is probably the most unforgiving action platformer I've ever played, and I love it. The game consists of you being stranded on different planets while plowing your way through hoardes of never ending aliens and monsters that would like nothing more than to tear you apart while you search for a teleporter to take you to the next level. You net EXP and 'muney' from each kill that you use to purchase items you'll find spawned randomly across the map, each one making you more and more powerful until your bottom screen is cluttered (in a ""I am your dark messiah overlord you can never hope to kill me lul"" kind of way) with them. Unlocking every character and weapon in the game is a hefty chore in itself and even though this game is great, I can't recommend buying it without a buddy system. The co-op is perfect with a friend to back you up, that will split item drops with you (pub games are known for free-for-all item hoarding which leaves everyone else screwed). So if you're into challenging, unforgiving, 'rougelike' killing action, give this a shot.			"

												Probably one of the best indie games i've played ever, extremely addictive, amazingly fun with friends, great soundtrack and a visually appealing pixel art style.I really hope the devs put out an expansion for Risk of Rain, more characters, bosses, levels and items would be the absolute best.The only thing i'd say is bad about this game is that there's no matchmaking system or server browser for those who dont have friends to play it with which is a shame because the co-op is another awesome part of this game that some people will miss out on.

												Really surprised me on how fun and interesting it is. Nice system with the unlockable items and good job on the level incresing over time, making racing against the clock and speed running a sure thing with this game after completeing it the first time. Classes are fun to use, and fun to learn. Overall good game ^.=.^			"

												Pretty addicting game fun with friends, however when hosting there are some networking problems it seems when each others frame rates are different. Door timers run out on one person and they can continue through and you can't for example frustrating at times but stil pretty fun game. I managed to play through twice as it was only a minor issue at times.Could do with a rejoin feature for multiplayer as well since it is horrible if you get farther and invest time and a friend looses connection.I'd say its worth it if you like Hordish type games that can have some pretty freaking awesome moments.

												The developers of Starbound have done it again! TF2 meets Binding of Isaac in this very fun game, I've put some itme into it by myself so far and I've had a great time with the large amount of items and characters. While the game can be frustrating, I'm sure that when I manage to get some people to play with me the game will be a lot more fun. The only problem I have reeeally had so far is in the last level, your framerate drops VERY noticably (probably because of the size of the level, if I hd to guess).4-4.5 out of 5 stars			"

												This game is damn good. It really is beautiful in its simplicity. The rules are simple, yet every new game feels incredibly fresh. When you die - and you will die a lot; I have yet to make it past the second level - you won't ever feel like it was the game's fault, or that you were cheated of your fate. The selection of items is plentiful and well thought-out,  and gaining each new one is rewarding in more than just ""do a different percent of damage than you did before.""Oh, and the soundtrack is downright amazing - something you won't mind listening to on repeat throughout your many playthroughs of this game.

												I don't even know what to say about it. It's a game anyone can jump into, it's hard to jump out of, and it's the kind of game you take a screenshot of with your phone when you finally beat it at two in the morning to show your friend that also plays it. The randomness works well, the characters are all pretty well balanced for different play styles, and there is enough content to keep you interested for awhile. And certainly enough challenge.If you like platformers, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. If you don't like a challenge, don't bother. The game is very hard and takes a while to get into a groove to where you can blow through it.A great example of practice makes perfect.			"

												An addictive game of survival on a deadly world that actively seeks to kill you. The world will summon deadly monsters, but you can kill them to get money to unlock items that will help you survive. As time ticks on, the world will become deadlier, releasing elite enemies and boss monsters to send you to your death. The question becomes, will you spend more time in a stage to collect more items, or rush to the teleporter quickly before the diffuculty becomes too deadly? With 9 characters to unlock and over 100 different items to randomly find; this game promises numerous hours of gameplay.			"

												You climb from the wreckage of the crash and step foot on a new world. Stars glitter in an unnatural sky, and your boots sink into loamy soil that pulses and hums with strange energy. Beneath you, the planet stirs itself awake. Its defenders are ancient and alien and fierce, and you do not belong here.Move now, quickly and with purpose. This solitude is a momentary portrait, a gentle breeze before the first raindrops fall. With every ticking second, your enemy grows stronger and more numerous. Never stop moving. Time is entirely against you.Scavenge what you can and endure it. Weapons and supplies are scattered from the crash, and alien shrines might grant the planet's natural gifts to the clever or lucky.  Run until you can fight, and then fight until you can overcome.  Survival or death are your only options.The night is still beneath a lonely, indigo sky. A storm is coming. You can feel it in the air and taste it on your tongue like copper. You wonder – will it rain?			"

												This game is truly a blast, with friends.I've had so much fun playing this game since I bought it but I don't really enjoy playing it much on my own but that's just me. If you're into Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy but want a bit more Sci-Fi in your suffering then you'll adore Risk of Rain.It's fast paced, it's well designed, it's beautiful and it's unforgiving. You have to work for your win and even when you get your win you might just be ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped back into the retro era for no reason other than the game felt like it.The longer you play the harder it gets, can you get more metal than that?The combat is fluid as it could be, the characters and abilities are varied and enjoyable. Each character brings something totally unique to the game. The only downside is how difficult it is to set up multiplayer which is where the game truly shines. In multi-player with everyone playing a different character this game is a cluster fun.If you can work past that one niggling issue then you've got yourself a seriously brilliant and well worth the price of admission video game.This is a very, very firm recommendation.

												This game is amazing. The soundtrack by Chris Christodoulou is fantastic, one of the best soundtracks in an indie game, it's like a mix between rock and roll and the kind of music that pumps you up for teh adrenaline filled experience you have through the game. The rouge type elements keep you on edge, which is a good thing because you need to manage your time VERY WISELY, because every 5 minutes you spend in the game, the game gets increasingly difficult, so basically, if you aren't extremely skilled at the game, and you've spent 40 minutes in a round, you'll likely be killed in the next minute or so, unless of course you've already activated  the teleporter and defeated the enemies spwaned by it and are simply trying to get the achivement. The classes are also a fantastic aspect of the game, because they all have different styles of play and each class can appeal to a specific gaming style, for example, my favorite class is the Enforcer because he is the most realted to a Tank-type character in the game, but I know that the Sniper and Bandit are also very popular for being sort-of Ranger-type classes, which are usually the most popular in these kind of games because they can deal massive damage as well as being able to dodge attacks with relative ease. The story and collect-a-thon aspect are also very unique and rather fantastic because of the joy of getting/unloking new things as well as getting better at the game at the same time, and the story is simple and sweet, just like how these kinds of games should be, the only downside to having a simple story is not being able to talk about it without giving away spoilers. The non-spolier part of the story is in the intro of the game, you are a mercenary hired by a shipping company to guard the cargo of a shuttle; however, during the flight, a mysterious entity teleports onto the ship and blows a massive hole in the ship, destoying it. In the aftermath of the ship's destruction, you awaken in an escape pod, and have crash landed on a vicious planet where everything wants to kill you, but using your wit, skills, and whatever cargo you find throughout the world, you try to make it off the planet alive. I hope this review can convince anyone who reads it try out the game, take it from the 94% positive rating, this game is worth every last penny you spend on it.			"

												Don't let the initial difficulty turn you off. There's an excellent game to be had here.Much like Binding of Issac, the more you play, the more you unlock, the better items you're likely to get. Plus you get better too.The graphics are goregous and detailed, the scale is mesmerizing, and the music is stellar.I'm a big fan of local coop, and playing together trying to survive the horde is great.Criticisms? The gamepad works, but is a bit clunky in the menus. Also, for coop it would be much easier to start with more than one character. 3 commandos running around all looking exactly a like is a great way for you to get killed.I'm no where close to completion, but this game is already beating out premium titles as my go-to.

												Risk of Rain is genuinely one of my favourite games on Steam. Through the suprising lack of rain there is an masterfully crafted rouge-like that doesn't shy away from mutilating your very soul on multiple occasions. It's frustrating as hell but in genius way, every death making you want to do it all again and prove the mocking death message wrong. There is no sort of proper story like some other rouge-likes, but it doesn't need one when you are gunning the heck down avian bird thingys with the much needed help of an electric ukelele - the story is that you're a rather small pixelated guy person, just go shoot some things without worrying about why you are doing it. As mentioned before this game is frustrating, which goes hand in hand with it's pretty steep learning curve, but every death along this curve seems constructive towards you as a player. Every time a robot guy smacks you in the face you still feel a peculiar sense of accomplishment, and every time you unlock a new character you may even find yourself shedding a tear  - which is something most games can't say they do. If you just want to play the video game equivalent of frolicking in a field then this game might not be for you, but if you are one of the two people in the world looking for a frustrating way to pass the time on a rainy day (hue hue) then maybe consider giving Risk of Rain a go. You never know, you might even enjoy yourself.			"

												Risk of Rain is an extremely tough (and fun mind you) platformer. You start the game with nothing, and by the end, you become a god. I bought this game a couple years ago, and not one day have I regretted it. At first, this game was difficult, but with practice, it becomes significantly easier. I'm not saying it become too easy, its still difficult on later stages. My brother and I used play this together every weekend (Before I showed him Warframe).Pros; Crush your enemies like the god you should be.Every game is differentInfinite hours of gameplayTonnes of unlockablesCharacter VarietyCons;Not updated frequently, it seems abandoned by the creator(s)Rage-inducingOne of the maps were broken. (After a certain point, you would fall through the floor and into the abyss) Even though I have played that exact map hundreds of times. (and I had good items too).This is one of my all-time favorite games. I am a little sad that there are little to no updates. But I still love it and would recommend it to anyone.			"

												This game is great. There's no other way to put it. Everything about this game has charm to it. The characters, the art, the music, and everything else. In fact, the art is quite possibly my favorite part. All of the pixel art is fantastic, and it all has a very distinctive style. Combine all of this great content with fluid and dynamic combat, new things to unlock, bosses to fight, characters and artifacts to find, achievments to obtain, locations to discover, and a sense that there's always something new around the corner, and you have one hell of an indie game. Now, as if ALL OF THAT wasn't enough to make you interested in purchasing this game, then here's a major point: This game has *FULL ONLINE PLAY*. You can play through this game as many times as you'd like with as many friends as you'd like. (I'm not entirely sure how many people can play at once, but I have seen groups of up to 7 people playing together at once. Beatiful chaos). If there's anything to compare this game to, it's Binding of Isaac. With all the items that you unlock through completing specific criteria, along with the rouge-like elements, it does remind me somewhat of Binding of Isaac. That may be another reason I love this game so much.The best way to explain this game in one long run on sentence would have to be...Binding of Isaac along with full online multiplayer, coupled with interesting combat, more characters, new items, lots of achievments, a ton of bosses to fight, artifacts which change gameplay drastically, fantastic music, and fantastic art.This game is a wicked ride, and I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone! In fact, it's June 23rd right now, and this game is 50% off, selling at a dirt cheap $5 until the 30th! I'd pay $15 for this game if I had to, so $5 is practically stealing. If you've been debating whether or not to purchase Risk of Rain, STOP. The only reason I could think of to not purchase this game is the lack of money. I've enjoyed all the time I've put into it thus far, and I'm looking forward to the time I put into it in the future.			"

												Risk of Rain is a shooter's paradise. Mow through tons of enemies, get crazy power-ups, and play as odd-ball characters. Its intense and enjoyable- more so if you have multiple people playing.The music deserves a special note as the progressive chip-tune sound track compliments the game perfectly.Another note is one of the artifacts, an option that impacts how the game is played, called Glass. Glass decreases your health to the point you'll die in one hit but you'll kill most standard mooks with a single shot. I feel like this is how the game should be played- brutal and evasive. It does make some item completely over powered, but if you play enough your character will eventually get that way.The game is short, sweet, and worth that 10 USD price tag.			"

												You may begin this game an understand nothing and that's fine, but as you play it it becomes a beautiful and yet loney world where you are your only friend and EVERYTHING wants your life. The game may look simple overall, and it pretty much is, however you're quickly dragged into a world where the feeling of dispair hits hard only to be even more enhanced by the bomb♥♥♥♥♥music that plays with it. Whether you play this game alone or with friends you'll at least LIKE it. I bought the 4 pack and although I never played with my friends we all still liked it. Don't be discouraged if you're frustrated by the multiplayer function, this game is great just give it a chance.PROS (In my opinion):-Powerups even the playing field against massive bosses-Difficulty increases over time keeping the game fun-Many different heroes for whatever your play style-It's not an expensive title and you WILL play it a lotCONS (In my opinion):-Multiplayer isn't a simple setup (It will take some getting used to)-Chat in game is text based ( better keep those fingers flying)-THERE'S NO SEQUEL!!!

												Risk of Rain is best described as a 2D action-roguelike-platformer. At it's core, players must proceed through random levels with different layouts in search of a teleporter. They must do this whilst fending off onslaughts of enemies, collecting items to live slightly longer and all with haste, as the difficulty amplifies depending on how long players have been, well, playing.Having crash-landed on an openly hostile alien planet, your job is to find your ship and get the hell off said planet. The local wildlife are highly unimpressed by your presence, and want to remove your face. And they will do so in droves.As players lurch deeper into the game, more items and characters will become available to them. For instance, take the Enforcer; a lumbering tank on legs carrying a shield and a shotgun. Yes, he's slow, but he certainly makes up for it with power.One of the more satisfying elements of this game is ironically when you meet your maker. Unlike most roguelike games, this game focuses on combat. This means that death is a matter of human error as opposed to shoddy game mechanics, luck and stats to determine a hit or miss. It feels rather satisfying, if you can overcome the game's steep learning curve.In short, Risk of Rain is an insanely difficult yet highly satisfying and overall fun game to play. The game also supports local and online co-op (which is rather rough but fun), so bring some friends along too if you want!			"

												The summer sale may have already destroyed my wallet, but it's the game I spent the least on that I've gotten the most enjoyment. The game is simply brilliant, from the addicting rogue like gameplay to the excellent electronic soundtrack. If you enjoy challenging gameblay, roguelike RPG's, or sidescrolling games this is simply a must bnuy, and I highly reccomend it to anybody else.Like any roguelike game this game does not hold back on the difficulty, but what's great about this one is that while the game is always challenging it has a perfect learning curve. You brobably wonn't make it 5 minutes your first playthrough, but each subbsequent playthrough you'll be able to see yourself getting better and better, you never feel like you're stuck at a certain point. This is a huge part of what makes the game so addicting, the ability to see yourself improve is satisfying beyond belief.The game becomes increasingly difficult as time goes on as well as advancing through stages, so the player must balance taking time to unlocking new items and rushing through the next level. There are a few options for which  version of a stage you will play, for example the first level may take place in a desert stage, a lake stage, and a few other options, and each time the stage will be slightly different than the last time it was played. This makes it possible for experienced players to become familiar with different stage without making the levels predictable or easy.The game boasts local and online multiplayer, and the co op play is a blast too. The fact that pleyers do not share items is a bit annoying, and since it is not possible to trade items it is hard to make sure your team mates are properly equipped. Also, online multiplayer is a bit unfinished so joining a game can be problematic, but the developers insist this is only a temporary issue and will be fixed, but is still worth mentioning (if this has been adressed at the time of reading, ignore this part).So far, my only other real complaint is the difficulty of unlocking new characters. In fact, that''s why I did not mention them earlier, I have only played with two so far. The challenges required to unlock characters are tedious and/or excessively difficult, to the point that the casual player may only unlock two or three ne characters, and only after a very long time playing.I highly reccomend anybody buy this game, and during a sale there is simply no reason to pick this one up			"

												Risk of Rain is a very imersive game that puts you face first into hell and as time goes on it only gets worse, not only with each portal you pass do enemies get stronger and a wider variety appear but as the timer ticks the difficulty is on the rise as well. So my problems with this game is mainly multiplayer because if your suck about as bad as I do you want a little help, multiplayer although is pretty nice to have its not really a game killer, but i have encountered minor bugs such as when i try to start the game it will stay on the RoR icon instead of heading into the game.

It also makes fun of you. A lot.This game makes me hate jellyfish. Its still hard but for the right reasons this time and isn't the Binding of Issac so there's not nearly the idiotic following.

												EDIT: It looks like some of the display scaling issues were fixed. However I still have massive issues getting the game to run properly, as it looks like it was only designed to work properly on displays with a 16:9 ratio. Unfortunately any other ratio causes severe havok and the game gets really blurry and doesn't look very good. Use of windowed mode is required, but fortunately thanks to the fix at least windowed mode is now playable.As it stands, due to some crippling display scaling bugs I cannot recommend this game. Hopefully the dev's will resolve the issue in the future, but so far it has been over a month without any response whatsoever. (Don't get your hopes up.)			"

												So much fun especially when played as co-op. A friend of mine gifted it to me the other day, thanks to the Summer Sales of 2014, and on our first run together, we really hit it at first.The quick pace that is expected from the player just adds to the fun. The game truly gets harder over time (quite literally so; hardness level increases every 5 minutes). It's truly a great rogue-like indie game where the collection of items and such give the Binding of Isaac feeling and the side-scrolling, character unlocks etc. give an Awesomenauts sort of wibe.Great game, if you see it in sale, don't even think about it.

												The screen-shots and description really don't do this justice. Its a really really fun marriage of classic arcade style gameplay with modern complexity and depth. The difficulty is challenging in a way that feels incredibly fair and never frustrating, and the replay value is practically infinite. No 2 games will ever pan out exactly the same, even on levels you're revisiting or with a character you've already used. Speaking of characters, each one has a distinct and fun playstyle that really encourages you to try new tactics rather than good ol' run/gun. Achievements unlock characters and items too! This is just a really fun game.			"

												This game dumps you into a wasteland with nothing but the skin of your back. You will fight tooth and nail to cling dearly to the false concept you call life. You'll scrounge every last piece of gold, exp, and raw meat you can muster to keep going... just a little farther... maybe just enough to make it to that fabled teleporter. And then just as soon as victory is in your grasp, after overcoming all the seemingly impossible odds, the game will rip out your intestines and hang you with them like a noose. It will then insult you for your incompetence. All while you bang your head to a soundtrack fitting for your own merciless mutiliation.10/10 would die again.			"

Always challenging, worlds have several layouts so the game is not always exactly the same, so there is decent replayability.

												One problem I've had with many roguelites would be the combat. Sometimes they didn't offer the weight and impact that make attacking and killing things feel good.Risk of Rain is one roguelite that gets that right. Attacks and explosions come with appropriate recoil and visceral feedback. The game gets this and many other things right.Each character has four abilities, giving unique flavor and utility to their gameplay. The character diversity gives great incentive for replayability since it'll be necessary to unlock everything. Furthermore, there are TONS of items that all bring creative, diverse effects to your attacks. Some items just buff your stats, but others have more interesting effects such as turning the enemies you kill into temporary ghost allies.The flow of the game works well, too. You need to kill enemies, get money, power up, and find the exit as soon as possible. The longer you take, the higher the difficulty goes. You'll die a lot, but it's part of the fun and you'll be eager to return.If there's one complaint I have with the game, it would be the ambiguity with some of the item descriptions. While you can view more detailed effects through the main menu, some of the flavor text can make understanding your items more difficult than it needs to be.Interesting items, beefy combat effects, and clear risk come together for a great experience. It's definitely one of the best roguelites around.			"

												Definitely a tasty delicacy for any roguelike/openworld/randomly-generated lover fellow.I found many similarities to my favorite Binding of Isaac (and BOI: Rebirth too) but Risk of Rain provides the fun in a more aggressive way, more hardcore, if you say so. Two things I've been remembering all way through my humble time of playing (this will be fixed soon) are Terraria, from which Risk of Rain took some details and mechanics, and Rogue Legacy, which also has this extreme hardcore feeling, but lacks the flexibility.Guys did amazing job getting all the best together and Risk of Rain is a beautiful product, but pretty hardcore-ey - easy mode does not count any progress you made and is simply boring while normal mode goes way up so be prepared to have a tough start. Game is flexible and it requires you to be flexible as well. Do or die.8/10 will play moreBugs make some experience horrible.			"

												A really good coop roguelike. It has good depth to its mechanics. Using artifacts can really unbalance the game. The game can sometimes randomly become impossible to win and get to the point where its impossible for you to lose. Thats a flaw with most roguelikes however which risk of rain might have a tad more than others. It definitely takes skill to win, though I would argue late game less so. Its most definitely worth the purchase for the price. Its one of the better roguelikes with a really cool end boss. The value of a roguelike goes with its replay value. While not as replayable as nuclear throne, you'll keep coming back until you see everything, and there is a lot to see.			"

												Probably the best Rogue-Like Permadeath game I have ever played. The game's simple visuals and gameplay are extremely appealing, and easy to get into. The class and item variety make the game have near endless replay value, as well as providing a new, different experience every time you play. With that being said, this game is not easy. You need to have an excessive amount of items to stand a chance, especially if you plan on beating the game. The last level becomes insane, and the last boss is a challenge in himself.10/10 A near flawless game that captivates time and time again.			"

												At first I thought this game was so-so. There wasn't much unlocked and it seemed impossible to get very fat. But the more you play, the more you unlock and the more expansive it becomes. Once you start unlocking characters and ""relics"" which give you perks (you can see the requirements needed to unlock these in the menu) then the game really opens up.It's got great music, a thought out atmosphere with back story you can read, and the gameplay is super simple and nuanced in the beginning and a crazy madhouse as you start beating levels. By the end of it, it's utter chaos. I recommend as is my conteder for best game I've played in 2015			"

												Very fun! While a lot better with friends, this game isn't bad solo, although it is a bit harder. (I think it is fun, though, to see how quickly things can go downhill when your parner(s) die and leave you to fend for yourself while monsters are continuously spawning around you, and it's even more fun when you come out on top despite the odds.) I like the chance to play different characters, each of whom have unique abilities to help fight against monsters and stay alive. It's also cool how the difficulty goes up the longer you take, so it gives you an incentive to be quick and efficient in each stage.			"

You can unlock new characters by completing Achivements and Challenges! You also get Epic Boss battles by activating a Teleporter in order to fight them.

												I usually don't do reviews at this point, I like to get through at least 50% of the game but heres what I have to say.Pro's- Intense PVE with a character base twitst, each one has his or her own abilities and ranges, the builds are limitless and anyway you can think you can build it, with Artifacts you can change the play style or make it difficult, some even unlock other characters! In the end you'll be happy to play this even if your not into these types of games. Just remember one thing, time is NOT your friends my friend! Con's- If you don't have a controller its going to be difficult, with one you'll really enjoy it more. Also multiplayer is only going to work with tunngle or hamachi.

There are small bugs where the world doesn't spawn properly (you fall through the floor) but it's rare and only seems to happen on the first level, so you can quickly restart. Great for completionists too, as the item logs, monster logs, and the artifacts will take a while to collect them all. This game is still super cheap, so it's well worth getting.			"

												Risk of Rain is, I have to say, my favorite game of all time. There is so much to this game, because it is a very challenging game that takes time to get good at. It is very rewarding once you beat the game for your first time, but once you do, there is PLENTY more to do. Getting all the characters, getting all the artifacts, aheivments, and more and more. It is also very mysterious in a way that you don't really know how many people survived the crash, why the final boss did what he did, etc. It may seem like a simple game from the outside, but when you play more and more you can start to come up with theories about what happened in the story based on monster logs and the description of the items you unlock. It doesn't tell you of a story, nor is there even a story part of the game, but once you look at the whole picture of the game, there is, and that's what makes this cool. Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack, pixel graphics that make it perfect, and more. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes rogue-like games. Risk of Rain is a very wonderful game, that I again have to say is my favorite game of all time.			"

												This game is beyond good.  I watched videos and listened to friends play it on Mumble for months and was never sold on it, but then a friend bought it for me and I can't stop playing it.  I've never played a game that's made me want to continue to top my high score this much.  The gameplay itself doesn't change at all from game to game, but you just keep playing because you want to see what will happen with each combination of items, levels, and enemies.It is good; very good.  You need it.			"

												This is the most hardest, fun, and (somewhat) scariest game I have ever played. It gives you all the power with the items you get. And yet, so little power due to the difficulty getting harder. There are some beasts that will give you the most biggest ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments in all of gaming. One thing I do not like about this game is that it does not have mod support. (new update will hopefully allow mods to be made). Other than the mod thing, great game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a very imersive game that puts you face first into hell and as time goes on it only gets worse, not only with each portal you pass do enemies get stronger and a wider variety appear but as the timer ticks the difficulty is on the rise as well. So my problems with this game is mainly multiplayer because if your suck about as bad as I do you want a little help, multiplayer although is pretty nice to have its not really a game killer, but i have encountered minor bugs such as when i try to start the game it will stay on the RoR icon instead of heading into the game.

												This game is ALMOST perfect. The variety of characters and items makes each playthrough a new experience of its own. I absolutely love the simple controls, even though playing through the game is not. Multiplayer has a few bugs though, leaving a little room for improvement. The only thing I don't like about this game is the crashing. Whenever you get far into the game, you have so many different auras and on-kill effects that fly around the screen. These can cause the game to crash, losing all your progress, records, and even unlockables. Other than that one flaw, the game is definitely worth buying, especially with friends.			"

												A curiously addictive blend of platforming shooter with very high difficulty, 286-retro aesthetic, and some roguelike elements.  Risk of Rain is a little hard to get into at first, owing to the aforementioned high difficulty, but once you get used to the gameplay (and the fact that more often than not you're probably going to die horribly) the game gets really fun.  As you unlock more player classes and more items the enjoyment only goes up.One of my favorite aspects of Risk of Rain, and one thing which I think sets it apart from other roguelike-inspired games, is that there are NO bad items.  There are items which are better than others, as in any game, but nothing you pick up will hurt you ability to survive in any way.  It's only fair given how horribly outmatched you are by the game's enemies.  As the description of one enemy puts it, there is a dark humor in the absolute overkill you face.Though Risk of Rain is quite playable solo, it's even more enjoyable in a multiplayer environment.  The game's multiplayer system is admittedly a bit bare - you have to enter the IP address and port of the computer you want to connect to manually - but once connected it works well.  It's interesting to see how certain classes work together naturally, often in ways you might not expect.  Plus, your survival chances go up dramatically, which is a definite plus.Unfortunately, Risk of Rain is not without its issues.  Currently the game draws the Steam overlay twice, once scaled, once not, so if you run the game at anything but 640x480 you'll get a weird double image effect whenever you take a screenshot or get an in-game message.  Fortunately, the game runs just fine windowed with the overlay off.  Risk of Rain also has native support for most common game controllers, including Xbox 360 controllers, but the controller CANNOT be used to navigate certain menus, critically including the ""select class"" menu you get any time you start a new game.  Though it sounds minor, being forced to switch between mouse and controller rapidly becomes annoying over a long gaming session.Those issues aside, Risk of Rain is an amazing game that you can easily sink hours upon hours into.  Though you will die more often than not, the successful ""overkill"" playthroughs you manage will seem all the more sweeter for it.  If you have any love of platform shooters, you should pick this up.			"

You've got Risk of Rain.This game is simple in it's mechanics, and complex in it's growth. The power-ups make you feel a sense of progress but the bad guys don't ever let you take a back seat and enjoy an ""easy ride"". It is simultaneously enjoyable and frustrating, easy and difficult. This game will no doubt capture at least 50-100 hours of my time. And is easily worth the price tag.			"

												I've never been this addicted to dying in such painfully stupid ways!Each playthrough is unique, depending on how quickly you can find the teleporter to the next level and which items you collect. The items really end up making the characters, along with how many drones you can find and handle along the way. At first I didn't think that the constant dying with nothing to show would keep me playing, but after finally beating the game (albeit on easy mode) after ~50 deaths, I can say that dying in a brutal, random and haphazard way (errant crab missile, ridiculous mob spawning all of a sudden, horde of teleporting imps...) actually makes me want to try again. Also, it never rains. Don't start planting your petunias on this planet.			"

Risk of Rain is an utterly infectious platformer game. Where it lacks in plot, it makes up for with crazy semi-randomized mechanics.You start out with four skills that slowly get augmented as you buy new items. Some will make your attacks faster or more powerful, some will grant new skills like the double jump, some will alter the game's aesthetic. All in all, the items (and tons of unlockables) keep the game fresh when first starting out.The game also boasts being one of the more challenging platformers. While your power level increases exponentially during your playthrough, the enemies become faster and stronger. There are no checkpoints, so if you die--you die permanently. With luck and a little bit of finesse, the game may be beaten, though.It takes a little time to get used to, but this game is really addictive to its core.			"

												Ninety seconds.... I was in ninety seconds before I met my first demise at the hands of seven-foot-tall lemur men in Risk of Rain. Now, one would anticipate that I would shelf this game and curse balefully in the corner of my room about this game's punishment.... But I proceeded to play three more times before killing my first boss and passing the first level, only to get curbstomped by the introduction of energy-giants in the second level, which took ten seconds......Risk of Rain is a roguelike that DOES NOT pull its punches and that's what makes it so wonderful. Character progession is based on gaining exp and item-finding in likeness of Binding of Isaac and the world adapts to your achievements. Over time, a clock counts the amount of time taken in a single run, and when it hits a specific marker, the difficulty amps up, and the fauna around you gets stronger and less tolerant of your existance on the planet. Rage will ensue. Good rage.			"

												Quite possibly the most interesting, intesnse side scroller I will ever play. You get to play and experince a small some of pixel-man become the mightiest force on screen as he becomes uber powerful and god like upon his oncoming, vicious foes. Really, most everything you come across is relentless if you don't act quick and try to keep up and stay ahead of your ever increasing difficulty meter, which is a concept I thoroughly enjoy. Depending on how quick you are, and how lucky you are with the world generation, you decide how difficult you make things for your self. The more people you have playing with you, the better as you and a friend combat the onslaught of pixel-nasties together and take on the mightiest one at the end, or atleast outlast him. Really its a game worth playing, and giving a shot. Several at that. because your promised to not last.			"

Always challenging, worlds have several layouts so the game is not always exactly the same, so there is decent replayability.

												This Game is extreemly fun and extreemly frustrating but that is what makes it feel old school, as you get more buffs it gets harder and harder, by the time i made it to the 2nd lvl and only did that once, the game was at insane lvl of play. You have gotta buy this and play this game. It is so much fun to jump and shoot stuff. Everytimew you die, you start over with only  15.00 but thats ok, kill a few things and buy buffs and addon till you find the teleporter, but be careful like i said the more buffs you get the harder it gets :D			"

												First of all I'm a huge fan, of Rouge-like games.Risk of Rain is one of my most liked Rouge-like games ... BUT!This game should get MORE attention of creators/developers whatever you wanna call them.THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT!So addictive in multiplayer ... so much fun with finding bugs (In last part of the game on the ship, you can actually get EVERYWHERE only with ONE jetpack) and taking some challenges like white items only etc.Me and my friend what showed me this game, had SO MUCH FUN ... BUT ... I would love to see more of content, free or even payable I won't mind.I don't exactly know, if creators are working on some other games or creating new ones... its bit of a shame.For everyone who consider buying this game... DO IT!Shia approved! Gaben loved! Most enjoyable in COOP! GAME!Tell your friend to stop yelling at Russians at CS:GO or trying to break out of Bronze in LoL!And have a great time at this piece of masterpiece! :333			"

												While the lack of cloud saving support (and the lack of a particularly user-friendly or reliable online play option) is disappointing [though this game is more designed towards single-player anyhow], this is actually a really fun game with a very rewarding and tight feel to every element of it, as well as a nice learning curve and plenty of unlockables and things to learn. Very much an action game, part side-scrolling shooter, part side-scrawling beat-em-up (with some classes), part roguelike, but incredibly satisfying and, well, fun. Which is odd to come from me, as more of a turn-based/strategy gamer.			"

												I'm going to go with a Giantbomb-style review and give this 2014's 2013 Game of the Year. There are multiple classes to unlock, many items to equip, intense action, and an increasinly punishing difficultly, but when the RNG rolls in your favor you will be Death personified in no time. When that happens Risk of Rain is sure to offer some of the best moments you can ever hope for from a game.			"

												98 / 10033 / 100I have the played this game for about 30 hours.And I can say that this game rocks but there is just one game breaking bug...Do not get me wrong this game is huge fun, playing until you reach the difficulty ""HAHAHAHAHAHA"" After ""I see you"" and ""I am coming for you"" is just awesome, so many numbers and so much action on the screan is just great, The rougelike elements are awesome too.BUT if you reached stage X with 120 Minutes in game and the game says ""FATAL ERROR"" well this is the moment when you think ""OK this is not that bad I will just restart the game""But you will realize verysoon that EVERY Item, every Log, every Char you have unlocked, JUST FREAKING EVERYTHING is gone.Even if you have unlocked the Achievement in Steam....(The Bug only apears in Multiplayer for me)I will explain why only 33 / 100:Gameplay: 90 / 100 Soundtrack: 100 / 100Unlocks: 100 / 100Achievements: 95 / 100Tasks: 100 / 100Gameplay Elements: 99 / 100No Tutorial: 100 / 100Overall Game: 689 / 700 (98,42 %)So I can say that this is probably the game I had the most fun in this year.But the Bug.....Being forces to play something again and again just to unlock something that you have already unlocked sucks.Or at least being forced to solve this Bug that is in the game since 2013 is just not acceptable! That is the why I have given this game:98% - 65% = 33%Great game but a fun taking and game breaking bug			"

Risk of Rain is not easy (in my opinion), but it is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. Being a roguelike every run is different, different items, different levels of win opportunity, and whether the RNG screws you over or not, you'll have fun playing and probably dying.			"

												A thousand times yes. You are a little pixel person who has to fight increasingly huge mobs as time goes on. You grab power-ups that stack, so after awhile you are emitting all sorts missiles, flames, mines, and health charges, dodging things left and right while enemies explode into showers of coins and experience baubles. The most interesting part is that each character plays very differently, which is then compounded by the items that come up in a given playthrough. What this amounts to is that each time you play, you find yourself adapting to a different and shifting tactical situation as you shoot a bunch of stuff and run around.Also the graphics are nice, the music is great, and the secrets and unlockables are fun. The netcode is pretty wonky, but they are working on it, and most of my currently 18 hours has been happily spent playing alone anyway.			"

In the end you'll be happy to play this even if your not into these types of games. Just remember one thing, time is NOT your friends my friend! Con's- If you don't have a controller its going to be difficult, with one you'll really enjoy it more. Also multiplayer is only going to work with tunngle or hamachi.

												9/10This is a very tough, very fun, rouge-like run and gun game. The permadeath element provides significant challenge and unlocking new characters is much more difficult than you would anticipate. The randomized level designs are great and provide a new experience with each play through. It took me about 7 hours to beat the final boss and another two before I completely lost interest. The game is worth the asking price but those prone to rage fits should definitely steer clear. The odds are very much stacked against you and death is all but a forgone conclusion for each play through. I would definitely recommend. "

												Great visual and sound design make a great backdrop for this fast paced permadeath platformer.It'll constantly punish you, but you'll be relishing the experience rather than resenting it. Great drops that alter the play experience everytime have kept me coming back.You're restriced to one character at the beginning and his skill set is the most generic, but it doesn't take too long to unlock some more characters that add some needed variety.This is still in early access and it shows in some aspects, for examples, multiplayer support is quite poor currently. However it does support local co-op which is great if you've got a controller and someone to play it with. Hopefully this area will be improved upon in the future.Otherwise it's one of the best games I've played this year. Highly recommended.			"

												Risk of Rain is a 2D platformer and shooter with roguelike elements, such as semi-random levels and perma-death.  You play as one of ten survivers who have crash landed on a hostile planet and must become stronger and collect the items necissary to survive long enough to hopefully leave the planet.This game was almost and instant favorite of mine given its high difficulty, even on the easiest difficulty, and unforgiving nature. The controls are simple: arrow keys move, space jumps, and ZXCV activate each of your four abilities.  The abilities are different for each survivor and along with different health, damage, and level multiplyers, makes each one have its own unique playstyle.  While killing enemies to level up is important, it is not nearly as important as finding and buying the appropriate items to aid you, as many of them can increase your damage, health, healing, or range, far more significantly than your level ever can.The music is well composed and enjoyable to listen to, which is saying something as I've heard every track hundreds of times now.  The artwork and style is all a nostalgiacly creative use of pixles, and the survivors and characters are all very creative and while some are reminecent of other games, they are still unique enough to easily differentiate this game's universe from any other.There is multiplayer co-op, but I have only tried it once.  Getting it connected can be a real pain, but it can make the game significantly easier.As of writing this the game still has some kinks.  It will not run on my computer unless it's through Steam and only if Steam is running as administrator.I recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge as well as an old school experience.			"

												Risk of Rain is a pretty interesting little game, it has its bugs and issues here and there but let's be honest after the BF4 silencer, muting the whole server bug, what game doesn't these days. Let's talk about the issue at hand, Risk of Rain; there's a lot of different ways to tackle this monstrosity of a planet.The longer you take the harder the game gets and it takes this part very seriously, if you doddle or farm items for too long it can make things extremely difficult. Time equating to difficulty sure can make things interesting, as a farmer at heart it can sure make it hard to want to actually move on and continue through the stages but things can escalate extremely quickly. Items are similar to Binding of Isaac in how they unlock by completing certain feats/achievements. They also act similarly in function in that you can acquire one active use item and a number of(more than you can believe) passive stat and effect items.The game features several characters(10) to adventure through this wasteland with. You start with the commando which allows you to get quite a lot done for a base character almost to a point where sometimes I think it is better than a good few of the characters which is a bit of a con for me. The rest of the roster unlocks just like the items do, finding certain things in the world or unlocking specific achievements. The pool feels varied and interesting and if you enjoy the gameplay you will probably find yourself wanting to play the others through the game to unlock more items and any characters you need. The art style, music, and sound effects all feel very good to me but they fit my tastes and may not appeal as much to someone else. The game is primarily a singleplayer game but it also features up to 4 player local and online co-op which I have found to be a great time, the only real issue with the online is that you might have to do some network work to be able to host(open ports mainly, or turn off firewall). PROS: Flavour(art direction, music, sounds, etc.) is top notch in my opinion. Great replayability (At 20+ hours myself with about 64.5% game completion).Exciting number filled combat(Can turn off the numbers/combat text ingame if that isn't your thing).4 player co-op is great fun and classes function together in interesting ways.Has gamepad support.CONS:Port forwarding required to host.A tad buggy at times, weird issues and strict&limited graphic options.Can finish a playthrough in about 25 minutes on the easiest setting, if you don't count many many playthroughs to a game's total playtime, Risk of Rain is not for you.Some characters feel too weak or too strong.Keyboard controls can make it into Carpal Tunnel Simulator 2013 after too long of a sitting.All in all I would give Risk of Rain an 8.5/10, a quality game for $10, would like to see it get a few updates but I'm not positive on what the developer plans on doing at this point.

												Pixelated platforming monster-laden roguelike-like goodness.  The key defining features are:1. The pixel aesthetic; it's like Sword and Sworcery, only SMALLER.2. The excellent soundtrack, very much evocative of crash landing on an alien planet.3. The time-based difficulty.  Don't dawdle, or soon the enemies will be too strong for you to handle.4. The diverse classes, each of which specializes in a different playstyle.It's designed to be played again and again and again.  And you'll want to play it again and again, trying to get that one sweet run that gets you all the items you need until you reach that glorious state that the community dubbed ""God Mode.""  I've only gotten there once.  I hunger to get there again.			"

												What is a strategy?By definition, a strategy is a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim. In this case, the overall aim is to get to the end of the game and beat the boss. Yet to have a plan, you need to know what you need to do. In the case of this game, the only things you know are the four skills that come with the character you pick. The game is a constant new experience every time you play it, no matter the difficulty. You could ace an excellent run, and die 12 minutes into your next run. This game focuses not on the story, and not on developing your character, but simply the experience. The item pool is huge- over a 100 items you could get that could come together and assist you in beating the game, or be completely useless. It all depends on your style of play. While the amount different levels you can get aren't too high, your starting location, item chests, shrines, and teleporters are all scattered about randomly each level to get a different experience despite it being a level that has been seen before.Another plus to the game is the multiplayer. It uses direct IP connection (like Terraria) so you can play with up to 10 friends or join a random group online. While a large amount of players can mean more firepower, monsters you fight become stronger and the overall amount of items you get doesn't change much- meaning to play as a team, you can't just pick up every item you get or keep every chest to yourself. You have to question yourself- ""Am I able to play efficiently with the items I have currently?"" ""Does anybody else on the team need items?"" ""Do I really need this item?"" Playing multiplayer focuses a major part on the teamwork aspect in the game.While there are upsides, there are downsides too. The biggest downside you will come to is the issue of lag. The game typically runs at 60 fps for everybody, and half that if you are recording. Once you get to high times and levels, the lag increases. The amount of monsters spawning at every second on and around your screen causes a lot of fps lag, and the graphics (while being pixelated) from attacks and item drops also boosts the lag you can get. In example, after 65 minutes of gameplay and 7 drones collectively firing at a large group of monsters, my game froze and crashed like the Titanic. I was upset because I just unlocked a new class and hadn't beaten the game as the class I was playing as. The lag is different for everybody though- it simply depends on how well your computer can handle it.All in all, I definitely recommend this game. It is well balanced and well thought out, and even finishes with a dramatic/feely quote that is different for each class you beat the game with. I applaud Chucklefish, the makers of this game.			"

You have gotta buy this and play this game. It is so much fun to jump and shoot stuff.

Risk of Rain is not easy (in my opinion), but it is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. Being a roguelike every run is different, different items, different levels of win opportunity, and whether the RNG screws you over or not, you'll have fun playing and probably dying.			"

												Risk of Rain is a platformer alien shooter made by Hoopoo Games. The game isn't updated so often anymore, but it's still worth buying. It has fast paced shooting with a variety of characters, beatifully made pixel graphics and a lot of items. It has simplistic controls that change with every character, having strategy involved and smart thinking during fights.The game consists on a outsider crashing into a planet, where we must use teleporters to get to a new ship that Providence guards. So you must fight through levels, finding teleporters and fighting the boss that guards it. All characters have 4 attacks, having a regular attack with no cooldown, usually a more powerful AoE, a support attack and a powerful attack with a lot of cooldown.The graphics and music aren't the best, but combined they great an amazing atmosphere. Not much more can be said about this game, it's lots of fun and easy to start playing and get into, but require learning what every enemy does, learning all the advantages for each character and learning what each item does. Just all around great game, but with it's flaws, like the few bugfixes it gets.8.5/10 "

Do you like games with simple controls and simple mechanics but lots of challenges and replay potential?RISK OF RAIN MIGHT BE FOR YOU if you said yes to the above.When you first play the game, it might be a little rough, because the enemies rip you apart until you learn their patterns and how to best utilize your hero's skills so you avoid damage, but once you do, the game gets a LOT more interesting. It also doesn't help that the first hero you get is kind of weak, but it's really easy to unlock other ones. So keep playing even if the first looks don't really appeal to you.			"

												I simply haven't been able to put this down since buying it. Solid platforming and charming retro-style graphics make a great presentation for this decidedly unforgigving rogue-like. The fully random level and item generation make for a challenging game that constantly forces you to adapt. Sometimes you find tons of good items and helpers, other times the levels are dry and force you to survive based on your raw combat alone. Unlockable characters keep the game fresh by forcing you to adapt to different playstyles, which simply adds a ton to the replayability when you also consider the three difficulty presets.Having the game increase in difficulty based on a timer makes for one of the most interesting challenge mechanics I've seen in awhile. You are forced to either farm every last item you can find to beef up against monstrously tough enemies, or rush for the teleports and have nothing but your own ability to see you through. Multiplayer adds a whole new layer of complexity and replayability, forcing teammates to best allocate resources.This is an absolute blast, you simply must buy this game.			"

The gameplay is very well paced, starting out very easy and simple allowing you to learn the controls and basic ways to fight monsters.  The entirety of the first level is incredibly good for learning the game, no matter how far the difficulty meter goes.  The second allows you to hone your abilities and the third tests your time management skills (still haven't beat that).  I guess it goes without saying that this game is incredibly replayable and very difficult.

												Ok, I admit, I've been a wuss this entire time and played on easy (you can still unlock artifacts/classes, it just might not show until you restart the game), and I still find this game hard. Not that I care, I'm enjoying it too much.The controls are very simple. Arrow keys to move, Space to jump, and 4 abilities tied to Z, X, C, and V. Additionally, A/Q will interact with various objects, and G will use whatever held item you have equipped. This remains consistent no matter what class you play/items you use.The graphics are... admittedly mediocre, but they work well enough (and are impressive at times, especially near the end). The music is arguably the best part of the game; they fit the worlds well, they're varied enough to not get old, and the battle themes are suitably intense.This game does have balancing issues (notably Chef, Huntress, and arguably Acrid being considerably better, while Sniper lags behind in single player and Enforcer, HAN-D, and Bandito have problems no matter what), but each class (barring possibly HAN-D, as it's somewhat outclassed by Loader) still appeals for varying reasons- go with Engineer for turret/mine strategies and rocket spam, Mercenary for weak-but-fast hits and a pseudo Screw Attack with prior setup (see below), Acrid for poison spam, Huntress for shooting on the run (which is invaluable when you start getting faster enemies later on), Loader for grappling fists and the largest AoE in the game (place conduits diagonally to hit everything within a box), or Sniper for... sniping (and hitting multiple enemies in a line).Past that, there's the items. There are TONS of them, but they can be broken down into various categories (i.e. on-hit effects, on-kill effects, defence effects, out-of-combat effects, character effects, etc.). All of them can be useful at some point or another, but a few of them break the game when combined (i.e. enough Alien Heads and Rusty Jetpacks on Mercenary allows for infinite flight; Skeleton Key is really good early to midgame when you're wanting to save money for shrines and the like and excellent in the last level with all those chests near the end). In addition, there's Artifacts, which can be found in levels (some of them only appear on certain versions of stages) and will change certain aspects of the game when activated (Glass increases damage by x5 but cuts health to 10%, the utterly broken Command changes dropped items to chests that allow you to choose which item you want depending on rarity, and Distortion locks a random skill every so often, for a few examples).The biggest problem I have with this game is the different versions of worlds. Normally I like variety between games, but when I'm depending on getting a certain version of the world to get a specific unlockable, having to replay the game when you get the wrong world gets old fast (Magma Barracks being a major offender, having two variation-specific unlocks and requiring 20-30 minutes to get to).TL;DR couple of minor flaws, but a great game to waste time on and play with friends/alone.

												In my opinion, the best ""rogue-like"" game I have ever played.  Featuring many different characters with unique abilities and play styles, several different levels, and an excellent soundtrack, this game will keep you busy playing and unlocking everything for hours.  Tons of items, some of which are very difficult to unlock, keeps every run different.  Skill is required, but leads to great combat that puts many AAA titles to shame.  Definitely pick this one up for hours of alien slaughtering fun!			"

												Gameplay - 9/10Graphics - 10/10Music - 10/10Sounds - 9/10Options - 6/10Story - 3/10Starting with the lowest score, the story isn't really the point anyway.  But to be fair, it leaves much to be desired, even for a rouge-like game.  But how much story can you really expect from this genre?  I'm patiently waiting to be shown more.There are few games that have EVER been created that have intrigued me as much as this one has.  It has made me WANT to push further into it.  To actually work toward the achievements it has listed.  This alone is enough to put it near the top of my recommended list.It achieves that because it's incredibly fun to play.  Over and over again.  Losing actually feels like something that was by chance, not design.  And winning is so satisfying that it's something you'll want to tell your friends about.  It's that kind of achievement.The music alone is something I'd gladly purchase as DLC, it's that good (seriously, I'd buy this sound track even if it weren't part of a game I've played.)Overall - You should definately purchase this game.  You'll be extremely happy (if not surprised) by what it can offer.[Edit:  After owning the game for a few weeks, I've found a recurring issue with the sound failing on a regular basis.  This is very annoying as I find the game unplayable without it.  I hope this gets fixed soon, but keep that in mind if you're interested in this title.]			"

												I LOVE this game!!! A buttload of content, amazing soundtrack, great and challenging gameplay and a rewarding feeling to boot. It's easy to tell the devs put a lot of love into this game, and it makes it so much better. I'm tired of games that feel unfinished and unloved. this is not one of those games AND IM SO HAPPY! only quarrel is that the multiplayer function is wonky (there's a couple of bugs that show up once in a while too) and I have to resort to Hamachi in order to play with friends, (at least that works). I would like to see maybe some more end-bosses added or maybe some more levels, but that is honestly too much to ask for and would be not profitable for the devs what so ever. (but I can dream!) Buy this game if you like a challenge, scifi themes and badass action! lots of items and map variation to keep you interested. late game consists of collecting monster logs (a little extra narrative for flavour) more characters and beating your own scores! I have to be honest though after a while I stopped playing this game for a bit as I felt like I sucked it dry. I just recently got a new friend interested in the game and that got me back in the sattle! running with a friend makes it a lot more enjoyable!(as with anything) It's a game you will keep coming back to! So buy this sucker! ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ON SALE COME ON!			"

												After dumping a load of hours into this game, I can safely say that this is the best game I've ever played (and I've played some great ones!).What this game has: 1) Classes: You unlock different characters that play very differently from one another. Experiment and find your favourite play style!2) Loot: You unlock items to go into the game's randomizer, so gameplay gets more in depth as you go. Chance (risk!?) is involved, but skills are absolutely required!3) Atmosphere: Featuring some of the best music around, the soundtrack is to die for, rinse and repeat pl0x!4) Replayability: Wanna see how far you can go? The game is punishing, but it's not impossible to reach the 'end-game' where loot is abundant and effects slow down your pc so much that you wanna cry Q_Q10/10, easily ;)			"

												OK LISTEN does the roguelike formula appeal to you? Do you enjoy mastering a game and feeling like an untouchable badass? Do you like games with simple controls and simple mechanics but lots of challenges and replay potential?RISK OF RAIN MIGHT BE FOR YOU if you said yes to the above.When you first play the game, it might be a little rough, because the enemies rip you apart until you learn their patterns and how to best utilize your hero's skills so you avoid damage, but once you do, the game gets a LOT more interesting. It also doesn't help that the first hero you get is kind of weak, but it's really easy to unlock other ones. So keep playing even if the first looks don't really appeal to you.			"

												Procedurally generated side-scrolling action game with online and local multiplayer, Risk of Rain is one of those games that offers hours of replayability, due to the difficulty and many deaths you will experience as you learn the levels and enemies. Three different difficulty levels, many different unlockable characters, each with their own unique playstyle, as well as hundreds of items that will continually improve your character as you play, you can expect to come back to this game multiple times, even after you finally manage to beat it.

												I simply haven't been able to put this down since buying it. Solid platforming and charming retro-style graphics make a great presentation for this decidedly unforgigving rogue-like. The fully random level and item generation make for a challenging game that constantly forces you to adapt. Sometimes you find tons of good items and helpers, other times the levels are dry and force you to survive based on your raw combat alone. Unlockable characters keep the game fresh by forcing you to adapt to different playstyles, which simply adds a ton to the replayability when you also consider the three difficulty presets.Having the game increase in difficulty based on a timer makes for one of the most interesting challenge mechanics I've seen in awhile. You are forced to either farm every last item you can find to beef up against monstrously tough enemies, or rush for the teleports and have nothing but your own ability to see you through. Multiplayer adds a whole new layer of complexity and replayability, forcing teammates to best allocate resources.This is an absolute blast, you simply must buy this game.			"

												Risk of Rain is a platformer alien shooter made by Hoopoo Games. The game isn't updated so often anymore, but it's still worth buying. It has fast paced shooting with a variety of characters, beatifully made pixel graphics and a lot of items. It has simplistic controls that change with every character, having strategy involved and smart thinking during fights.The game consists on a outsider crashing into a planet, where we must use teleporters to get to a new ship that Providence guards. So you must fight through levels, finding teleporters and fighting the boss that guards it. All characters have 4 attacks, having a regular attack with no cooldown, usually a more powerful AoE, a support attack and a powerful attack with a lot of cooldown.The graphics and music aren't the best, but combined they great an amazing atmosphere. Not much more can be said about this game, it's lots of fun and easy to start playing and get into, but require learning what every enemy does, learning all the advantages for each character and learning what each item does. Just all around great game, but with it's flaws, like the few bugfixes it gets.8.5/10 "

												Aahh , Risk of Rain , where do i start ... First of all , this game may seem hard at first , but trust me , more and more you play , you will get the hang of it. This game is basically a run-and-gun with rogue-like elements. With 12 classes , each with 4 unique abilities , you wont get bord so fast. And dont forget the items , which are a lot too. The game may have some bugs , which is not nice , but you can get over them. And i almost forgot , everything is randomly generated , so no 2 runs would be the same.Now , regarding classes , my favorite part of the game. You start at first with only 1 basic class. Yep , only 1 class out of 12. You must do certain things to unlock classes , like killing bosses , reaching a certain level or in some cases even finding the other characters hidden in the game's levels. No 2 classes are the same , each one of them has an unique playstyle and set of abilities . For example , there is the sniper who excels at firing precise shots , being very good for dealing with bosses , but not so good for dealing with hordes of enemies. Or the enforcer , a tank who can stun enemies , or block all frontal damage with his shield.Now the items. Oh boy , there are lots of items . Some give you a shield , some make your attacks explode . There are activable items who can summon ghosts to fight for you , shoot a lot of missles and so on. The enemies in this game are well done , every stage bringing some new type of enemy . And also , you can buy drones to help you out in your journey . These drones fly near you and shoot the bad guys or heal you.And the soundtrack ? Pure genius.TL;DR Get this game if you like rogue like shooters with lots of classes and items , and most of all , good replay value.			"

The different characters are fun to play too! Single-player and Co-op are both a lot of fun. A heads up, you need to know how to port forward to host a co-op game and a pretty decent upload speed for others to not lag. A few bugs here and there in co-op too. When people lag out, you pretty much have to restart the game, which gets annyoing. Other than those small things this is a really great game. I highly suggest this if you are into hard games.

I would like to see maybe some more end-bosses added or maybe some more levels, but that is honestly too much to ask for and would be not profitable for the devs what so ever. (but I can dream!) Buy this game if you like a challenge, scifi themes and badass action! lots of items and map variation to keep you interested. late game consists of collecting monster logs (a little extra narrative for flavour) more characters and beating your own scores! I have to be honest though after a while I stopped playing this game for a bit as I felt like I sucked it dry. I just recently got a new friend interested in the game and that got me back in the sattle! running with a friend makes it a lot more enjoyable!(as with anything) It's a game you will keep coming back to! So buy this sucker! ESPECIALLY IF IT IS ON SALE COME ON!			"

												Where to begin? This game is, frankly, a masterpiece in my eyes. There's a huge variety in items, enemies, and environments, the classes are unique and varied, and the soundtrack...god, the soundtrack is amazing. RoR also has an interesting mechanic wherein difficulty scales with time spent playing, going from ""a couple weak enemies every so often"" to ""OH, DEAR GOD, THERE ARE SO MANY!"" However, it's challenging without being unfair, there were never any points where the game just arbitrarily went ""lol u r ded"", it was always a case of ""Hmm, maybe if I'd done _ differently..."" In short, this game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys roguelike games and is looking for a ""me and my friends versus the world"" experience, and I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Risk of Rain is a great game that seems deceivingly easy at first, but quickly becomes a challenge for most players. The combat feels different amongst each of the different playable characters, which is a good thing. There are unlockables and secrets galore (something that many games today are lacking, sadly), including characters, items, and ""artifacts"". Combining all of these elements makes for a game with hours upon hours of replayability.			"

The huge variety of items, situations, classes (That actually have a difficulty threshold to unlock, imagine that!), oh man, I could go on and on. Superbly difficult at its peak, coddlingly easy at its base. It expects you to grow as your session progresses, which is totally rad. Certain builds will always dominate certain classes, but thats the catch - In a game like this, you will almost never get the perfect build, and certainly never the same build twice.If you like roguelikes, you will love this.If you dont, you might still love it.Damn fine game.

												Awesome graphics, awesome gameplay, awesome music. This game has everything you'd expect from a £7 pound game and much more.Each character drastically changes the way you play, if you try to play the sniper like you do the commando then its game over for you! This coupled with the partially randomly generated stages brings replayability I have never seen from any game before.Every single item is unique and well thought out (And at some points quite funny :D).The only downside I have found is the multiplayer, setting it up is a bit of a hassle unless you have access to you router AND you know how to portfoward with it. Your only other option is to use some VPN software like Hamachi which in mine and my friends' case seems to be incredibly slow.Overall Risk Of Rain is a brilliant game for those who have a low powered PC or those who love brilliant gameplay.

												One of the most addicting games I played lately, it has three usual difficulties but also has variations of the same ones. Last one being ""hahaha"" IF you survive to get to it. Risk of rain can get very competative and very ""just one more run"" play and next thing you know you played it for few hours.Music itself in game is very relaxing and just fits in game great (to bad they didnt released soundtrack edition)Also I like it how you can read ""diary"" of main character for each creature you meet in game (you need to collect creature log to get diary log for same) and his thouts on same ones.I would prefer though that there is more scaling opotions in the game (though I am pretty sure i saw video reviews with scalings options going to more then 2X.Also risk of rain has pretty ""cloaked"" ""should I gear up or should I go to end of level"" choise hidden cause longer you play the game the harder it gets... so good luck!

												Risk of Rain is a very beautiful definition of a rogue-like game that is taken from a unique perspective. The difficulty scaling based on the amount of time put into your current game really encourages you to try to find the teleporter as fast as possible, while trying to gain levels and earn enough money to open chests, item pods, and buy drones to aid you through each level. Some skills with certain characters really complimented each others skills in general, and just their own skills themselves. The only thing I had a problem with myself is being able to obtain new characters. There really is no way of telling how to get the other characters in game (which don't get me wrong, surprises are nice, just a little help would seem to be nice) through the actual game, like others, you have to search online to understand. But overall, I would absolutely recommend this game.			"

												I really hated this game when I started playing it.  It was difficult, I didn't progress very far for at least the first 6-8 hours.  I even put it down for a month or so and didn't play it at all.  Then I unlocked the enforcer, then I unlocked a few items.  Then it progressed one level.  Then the game bacame not only fun, but kind of addicting.  Once I started unlocking stuff, the game took on a whole new dimension.  Now I had to consider item loadouts and there is the really fun part of the game.  Once enough items were unlocked to make a difference in damage, health regen, survivability, the game became really fun,  I can't give it a 10 because I don't believe its perfect and thats mostly due to the beginning toughness.  Otherwise its fun if you stick it out.8/10			"

												Risk of Rain is a fun little platformer game. The large amount of items make for a unique experience every playthrough. The randomized levels leave something to be desired. They don't really quite feel truly random. It all starts feeling the same quite quickly. The game is truly about the item collection. For the ""use"" items I highly recommend Jar of Souls and then try to get as many passive ability items and ""proc"" items as you can and you'll feel nearly invincible. I highly recommend this game.			"

												I possess a sordid love for this game. It is meticulous, harsh and a great bottle of fun for zero reason. The thrill of surviving as the difficulty scales up is enjoyable even as your screen becomes filled with more murderous beasties than is healthy to an atypical one-thing army. Each class drastically different, unlike a fellow game of the genre Binding of Isaac (where enough upgrades basically makes each character mechanically indifferent), and each has a kit focused for different tactics though pick-ups will carry the same bonuses or penalties. Learning how to use new characters in a way that suits you is another part of the fun of this game. I cannot comment on the multiplayer as I have not tested it myself. All in all, I think that it is a peculiar and fascinating game that requires equal parts luck and knowledge of the characters to grasp victory.			"

												YESSSSS.A friend of mine gifted this to me on Steam. Thanks, Dayton Does! This game is freakin awesome. A side scrolling platform filled with monsters awaits you. Many classes to choose from, addicting enough to make you want them, and challenging enough to keep you fumbling around trying to get them. Plenty of powerups to keep it all novel. Go from a broke schmuck with a machine gun to an explosive harbinger of doom, shredding enemies with icicles, spewing missiles, and thqwibs. This game gets progressively harder the longer you play, and everything you can find along the way to help you, you better take. However, I do understand this game has its issues, too, which are worthy of mention. There are some issues with online play which definitely need to be fixed. There are multiple discussion threads about this in the forums at the moment, and I sincerely hope they manage to get it working properly for everyone, because this game doesn't deserve that bad rap. However, I'd like to say that local multiplayer works just fine, and is awesome. So, you know, if you neckbeards have real life friends, invite them over, and go on a grueling march through some interplanetary hell.Would I pay 10 bucks for this game, like they're asking?It's a little much for me. However, if I didn't have a copy and it and it went up on sale, knowing what I do about it, I would snap it up without a second thought at a -%50. As always, check Humble for this little gem.			"

The net play isn't always the greatest for some, and without good communication item sharing can be a hassle (not to mention it can make the game more difficult to spread items out a lot), but it's not bad with a few good friends along.

												Risk of Rain is best described as a 2D action-roguelike-platformer. At it's core, players must proceed through random levels with different layouts in search of a teleporter. They must do this whilst fending off onslaughts of enemies, collecting items to live slightly longer and all with haste, as the difficulty amplifies depending on how long players have been, well, playing.Having crash-landed on an openly hostile alien planet, your job is to find your ship and get the hell off said planet. The local wildlife are highly unimpressed by your presence, and want to remove your face. And they will do so in droves.As players lurch deeper into the game, more items and characters will become available to them. For instance, take the Enforcer; a lumbering tank on legs carrying a shield and a shotgun. Yes, he's slow, but he certainly makes up for it with power.One of the more satisfying elements of this game is ironically when you meet your maker. Unlike most roguelike games, this game focuses on combat. This means that death is a matter of human error as opposed to shoddy game mechanics, luck and stats to determine a hit or miss. It feels rather satisfying, if you can overcome the game's steep learning curve.In short, Risk of Rain is an insanely difficult yet highly satisfying and overall fun game to play. The game also supports local and online co-op (which is rather rough but fun), so bring some friends along too if you want!			"

												If you like rougelikes then you will like Risk of Rain. It has 10 classes to choose from each going for a completely different playing style. It works like this. You wake up from a crashed pod in either The dried lake or The Desolate Forest. You go around killing what spawns and the level is randomized, now sometimes the level looks almost completely the same as another time you played it HOWEVER it will NEVER have the same chests and definitly never have the same items because there are 100+ items. So you find the teleporter and For the next 90 seconds (or 120 on monsoon difficulty) enemys will spawn rapidly and at least 1 boss will spawn. at the end of the 90 seconds you kill everything left on the screen then you can go to the teleporter and you can teleport to the next level. But before we go there I need to tell you about the items and chests system. The items and chests system is easy, you get some money from killing any monster and you get some money if you open up these containers that are just sitting around. You spend money to open chests, for example on the 1st level you pay 25 for a small chest and 50 for a large chest. Im still not sure how it increases from there because on the 2nd level I will have small chests costing 78 one time and the next they cost 53. Every time you open a chest you get 1 random item from a pool of items im not sure how much you start with but when you complete achievements you can unlock more items to get. When you go to the 2nd level it can be either the Damp Caverns or the Sky meadow and you do prettymuch the same thing as the 1st level. find teleporter, survive for 90 seconds, kill all enemys, and go to next level. and level 3 is prettymuch the same and so is level 4 and 5 however the 6th... well ill just let you figure that out.As time goes on the difficulty gets harder at about 5 minutes the difficulty increases from very easy to easy then later to medium then to hard then to impossible then to some funny things ill let you figure out yourselfThe multiplayer works well so long as you know how to port forward if you don't know what that is then go look up ""Risk of Rain how to set up a server"" and you should find something to help you. Overall very good game 8/10 "

												Risk of rain is a really good game if you like rogue-like platformers. It's kinda similar to Binding of Issac in the way that you collect items thru out the game and it is with these items you win. The game have a 16-Bit artstyle wich i think really suits the game good. So if you like the artstyle and like Binding of Isaac you should definantly pick it up.			"

												Hands-down the worst part of this game is the fact that you start with only the Commando class unlocked, who is both boring and just generally bad compared to every other one I've tried. If you're lucky, you'll have a good co-player to help you through the game once, and then you can unlock some guys who don't suck and the game becomes quite a bit more fun. The game's definitely hard, but in general it's a lot of fun. You'll be blasting a hell of a lot of bad guys, and you'll get a wealth of fun item pickups and helper drones to do it with. As usual, I love the tiny pixelly graphics. I kept hearing this game has roguelike leanings, which I guess is true to a point, but if anything I feel like it could have used a little more roguelike influence. Mostly I mean that randomly generated maps would have been nice, instead of the same ones with the interactables moved around. True enough, the game will send you to any of a few different maps in varying order, and no two runs at the game will be the same, but it's still more of an arcade experience than a roguelike one.Uhhh well this 'review' has been a bit directionless, but the point is, there's a bit of an obstacle to engagement when you first start, but it's worth sticking with. Fun stuff.			"

One of the ""chieves"" is to complete the game 5 times!In conclusion this game is a definate must buy! 10/10			"

												The best game I have ever played, this game completed destroyed me at first, its difficulty was astounding, this may sound like a bad thing but it isn't. It provides a massive challenge that you feel compelled to beat, the soundtrack inspires that motivation and pushes you to see what the next stage is like. The timer creates a wonderful set of tactics not seen in many other games. You must beat the timer whilst also avoiding being underpowered for the boss and the next level's other enemies which for new players is near impossible. The game gives you the best feeling when you complete it, I raised my hands and cheered when I beat the final boss. This is a brilliant game and I absolutely recommend it to anyone, well worth the price.			"

Those are cool.I give this game a 9/10Buy it.NOW.			"

												The summer sale may have already destroyed my wallet, but it's the game I spent the least on that I've gotten the most enjoyment. The game is simply brilliant, from the addicting rogue like gameplay to the excellent electronic soundtrack. If you enjoy challenging gameblay, roguelike RPG's, or sidescrolling games this is simply a must bnuy, and I highly reccomend it to anybody else.Like any roguelike game this game does not hold back on the difficulty, but what's great about this one is that while the game is always challenging it has a perfect learning curve. You brobably wonn't make it 5 minutes your first playthrough, but each subbsequent playthrough you'll be able to see yourself getting better and better, you never feel like you're stuck at a certain point. This is a huge part of what makes the game so addicting, the ability to see yourself improve is satisfying beyond belief.The game becomes increasingly difficult as time goes on as well as advancing through stages, so the player must balance taking time to unlocking new items and rushing through the next level. There are a few options for which  version of a stage you will play, for example the first level may take place in a desert stage, a lake stage, and a few other options, and each time the stage will be slightly different than the last time it was played. This makes it possible for experienced players to become familiar with different stage without making the levels predictable or easy.The game boasts local and online multiplayer, and the co op play is a blast too. The fact that pleyers do not share items is a bit annoying, and since it is not possible to trade items it is hard to make sure your team mates are properly equipped. Also, online multiplayer is a bit unfinished so joining a game can be problematic, but the developers insist this is only a temporary issue and will be fixed, but is still worth mentioning (if this has been adressed at the time of reading, ignore this part).So far, my only other real complaint is the difficulty of unlocking new characters. In fact, that''s why I did not mention them earlier, I have only played with two so far. The challenges required to unlock characters are tedious and/or excessively difficult, to the point that the casual player may only unlock two or three ne characters, and only after a very long time playing.I highly reccomend anybody buy this game, and during a sale there is simply no reason to pick this one up			"

												It's hard at first, but then when you get good... you get damn good and it feels good. If you are into skill based gameplay, and can handle the difficulty, you're going to have a good time. Run, jump, and 4 attacks.What, 10 characters to play as? Each with 4 unique abilities, having different roles and playstyles.My favorite playthrough thus far:The merc (unlocked by beating the game five times) is a full melee class. Difficult at first, leveling up gives more health and attack speed. Late game, he's got items for life leech, regen x 6, items to crit every attack while healing himself, increasing attack speed, exploding for spalsh damage, and eliminating cool downs. He attacked probably 3 times a second, and spamming his second ability, he attacked 6 times a second. He was a friggen blender by the end, out healing damage taken.Like this almost:

												From first glance this game doesn't look that great but when you start playing this game it becomes an instant addiction. Being heavily item based this game makes you have to learn what each item does and if you play with the artifact which you are able to select your own items from drops as i do it makes it that much or crazy, getting attacked as you're trying to choose items from a big list. I love this game and would highly recommend 1+			"

												Really beautifully pixeled game with creative monster design. I've only played this in multiplayer so far which in general works fine but has some ""kinks"". For example we need something like Hamachi to connect to each other, it's not working with the steam overlay friends invite, sadly. Also, if you die you can only wait while your friend(s) keeps playing the level, you will only be alive again when the next level starts. And then you will be at a disadvantage because while being dead you did not pick up any new items that would make you strong enough for the next level. Also, sometimes there are so many monsters piling up that you can hardly see your character anymore.The game, even on easy mode, seems really hard at first, but the longer you play the easier it gets. This, I think, is in part because you unlock more and more helpful items that you can get. It is different on every playthrough and I prefer to play it with a controller instead of the keyboard.			"

												One of the best Roguelike + Platformer game I everplay.Multiplayer is using old school TCP/IP. So it's kinda annoying to do port-forward and give out IP address to your friend every play through.Difficulty curve is just about right. Each play through never feel the same unless you start the game with 'Infusion' while 500% Dmg rune is active.10/10			"

												This game's greatness is masked behind its graphics. They're dated and don't do much for anyone who isn't into the super retro style. This is the only complaint I have about this game. Its multiple character system, combined with the hundred or so items and online multiplayer can mix up the gameplay every playthrough. The best part is that none of the characters feel like carbon copies of each other. Gameplay gets absolutely mental very quick, with a time based difficulty system. As more time passes, the more numerous and powerful the enemies become, eventually leading to bosses spawning on a regular basis. There will be plenty of deaths, and sometimes you'll get a game over just because of a bad line up of item drops and enemy spawns. Not for impatient or easily frustrated people.			"

												Well, Risk of Rain is a game which I would highly recommend to gamers varying from casual to hardcore.It is a great game to play, either by your self or with friends, but personally I would say it is more fun with a group of friends!The gameplay is great, there is a variety of map layouts every time giving it a new challenge aspect each time; The replayability is great due to the different map layouts and the variety of characters to choose from.The art-style is simple, 2D and just plain awesome. To sum up this review:Pros:-Good replayability-Fun to play with friends-A good challenge, yet pleasing when you make it far-Wide range of Characters & In-Game items to unlockCons:-Co-Op can be buggy at times-Not everything is explained as clearly as it could be "

												I love this game, right now it's probably my favourite. The game starts off very tough, but as you get into it and get a feel for the characters you start to do much better. There are small bugs where the world doesn't spawn properly (you fall through the floor) but it's rare and only seems to happen on the first level, so you can quickly restart. Great for completionists too, as the item logs, monster logs, and the artifacts will take a while to collect them all. This game is still super cheap, so it's well worth getting.			"

												Risk of Rain is an awesome buy. I didn't know what to expect of it when I first saw it in Steam's Greenlight program, but the more I watched videos of its gameplay, the more I beecame enticed to discover this little gem's secrets. The game never starts out too slow, keeping you constantly on your toes as enemy difficulty scales to being just short of impossible every time you level up. However, don't lag behind in your search for the teleporter each level, because the longer you dilly dally, the greater the risk of maybe not surviving this trip. With absolutely insanely inspired bosses popping up like those mushrooms in your yard, a rediculous amount of passive abilities to aid you in your quest, and some pretty awesome characters to play as, this game is nothing short of unique. However, take caution if you want to get this game so you can your friends can play together online. RoR requires you to have an 'open port', which may come as an easier feat for those computer savvy than those who aren't. Local gaming requires you to have both a keyboard (duh) and a gamepad.  I have yet to open my port for online play,  but that hasn't dissuaded me from playing this game way too much. Buy it.Now.			"

												I think this game is a very good game for a lot of reasons. For one, it has a lot of replayibilty, all rouge-like games do. The maps are not ""randomly generated"" as much as other games, they all have static points but some of the map will change up on you. The loot locations will always be diffrent, and somtimes some areas will be open, or closed. There is a lot of unlockibles, and 10 diffrent maps you will see and enjoy. The enimes are pretty diverse, each with a little lore log. The bosses are similar to terraria type bosses, but they change up the game when they start spawning normaly. The whole game is set on a timer and the time you take fills up a difficulty metter. The ""easy,medium, hard"" mode you pick when starting just changes how fast this meter fills up. When the meter fills up, things dont nessicasrly just start doing more damamge making ""artificial difficulty"" but rather they start spawning more stronger enimiers, and more bosses. This game is very easy if you know how to dodge, and how to monover each of the enimies. Honestly, I love playing this game, and it is very addicting. The only part I can complain about is that it does get laggy near the end of the game.If you are on the fence about it, deffiently pick it up on a sale and try it out. I am sure you will enjoy it, and playing with friends jsut adds to the enjoyment.			"

(I think it is fun, though, to see how quickly things can go downhill when your parner(s) die and leave you to fend for yourself while monsters are continuously spawning around you, and it's even more fun when you come out on top despite the odds.) I like the chance to play different characters, each of whom have unique abilities to help fight against monsters and stay alive. It's also cool how the difficulty goes up the longer you take, so it gives you an incentive to be quick and efficient in each stage.			"

My one big gripe however is sadly Risk of Rain is missing the steam cloud save feature. It was really disappointing to reinstall my system and find that all my time invested was for naught. At this point I've lost my interest as unlocking content a second time is not all that appealing. All in all however Risk of Rain is easily worth the money and is sure to kill more than a few hours of your time. Just be sure to backup your data if you chose to reinstall or the like.			"

												Risk of Rain is a great platforming action game with roguelike elements.Every game starts with a clock adding up the time spent playing and every minute gets harder and harder.You start off with one selectable character, unlocking more as you progress and preform challenges such as beating the first level under 5 minutes.The game really gets intense once you get a handle on the character you'll be playing as, my favorite being the huntress, and the amount of action going on at once is almost staggering. The game has plenty to offer for those who just need a few minutes to play a game, as the longest I've survived is about 70 minutes. Once you die, it starts all over but theres collectables and info to amass. I especailly liked the stats page which tells you how far you are from 100% as well as little tidbits of info such as favorite weapon and time played.Overall, worth the price.			"

												This is a good casual game but also a great cult classic and is definitely worth purchasing.  I grabbed it when it was on sale, but after playing it I believe it's worth the $10.  There is a bit of a learning curve at first which makes the game feel almost impossible on the normal difficulty but if you stick to it, you'll learn your character and begin to defeat bosses and enemies with ease.  There are lots of items and unlockables and the maps are big enough that it doesn't feel too repetitive, both attributing to this games great replay-ability.  Personally I'm a fan of the artwork but it may not be for everybody.  This game also has a great base for future updates, looking forward to them!			"

												Fun game! I've lost hours playing with friends. You'll have to set up the port forwarding for the game in order to play online or lan multiplayer. It's not difficult, just take a deep breath and use google or the provided literature.			"

												Literally one of the best, most intense games I have played with my friends. The game is definately more fun when played with friends although the initial set up to do so is a bit weird. But yes, I recommend buying this game and just play with friends who would also play it. 8.5/10			"
