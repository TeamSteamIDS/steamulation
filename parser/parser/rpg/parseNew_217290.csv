												This is a fun little RPG.  It's hugely replayable, as every town is different and you have to do different things to save each town (most of these are ""Kill X monster"", ""Destroy X Machine"", or ""Collect X Items"", but they're just slightly different enough to stay interesting).  There are some flaws in the game, the graphics are extremely dated and can be glitchy, and townspeople behave like idiots (starving to death when 1 copper piece in debt, charging towards high level invading monsters with poor weaponry and armor, standing motionless while a tornado is heading straight for them, and so on.  Worse is that you suffer a reputation penalty even when they die in stupid ways).  The monster AI seems pretty rudimentary as well, once they're aggro-ed, they run in a straight line after you and attack in predictable ways.  However, even with the flaws, it's still a solidly fun game and you can get engrossed in it pretty easily			"

												I was put off at first by the crude, garish graphics, but if you can get past that, this is an amazingly good casual Diablo-like. Combat has a good amount of depth and even simple melee characters have a good amount of tactics apart from ""click till they drop"". There are a bunch of pregenerated character classes or you can design your own, mixing & matching skill trees. I also really like the dynamic nature of the game world -- the main town can and will be attacked by monsters (it's possible for the town to be defeated entirely) and the randomly generated quests actually effect things beyond ""here is a new boss to kill / item to find"". It's not a game I'm likely to play for hours and hours at a sitting, but in smaller doses it's just thing, I like it better than most Diablo clones.			"

												This is an amazing game. If you loved Diablo or Fate, this is like an upgraded version of those. Not only can you dungeon delve and kill tons of monsters, but the townspeople need your help as well. People can starve to death, fight each other, plot against the town, ect. No one is safe, not even quest givers or vendors. Down in the dungeon, monsters can swarm you from all sides, especially if there is dimensional gateways that constantly spawn monsters. If you are not careful, quests can pile up, monsters start uprisings and try to invade the town, various machines can cause harmful or strange effects, like causing tornados in the town. Loot is completey random, and the various classes are fun to play, especially hybrids. Din's Curse and it's slightly different game, Depths of Peril are must buys.			"

												Just picked up Din's Curse during the sale and figured I would give it a shot.  Played it for a few hours... pretty much addicted to it now.It's basically Diablo or Titan Quest.  If you're already a fan of those type of games, you owe it to yourself to try this one out.  This was absolutely a thrill to play.  Everything seems to work.  The graphics are a bit dated, but by looking at the release date this is about a 6 year old game.  The loot was pretty good here as well, it was always interesting to know what each magic item's attributes were.  It's just the same as the Diablo series, it's always worth identifying your equipment in case you get something special.  It almost felt slightly crazier loot-wise than Diablo, as they would sometimes get items that Blizzard wouldn't dare give you at a low level, like gloves that add +56 damage when your weapon is only like 5-10 damage.  It doesn't even feel imbalanced or anything like that, since the difficulty ramps up quite quickly, it's just a huge bonus when you find something awesome. There's something this game does differently which I had not seen before.  It sort of just throws quests at you like crazy to the point where you are having to find food for everyone in town one at a time.  It felt like Fallout 4 where the whole settlement needed your help, where normally in Diablo you would not have to fend for anyone but yourself, typically.  Also it seems like everyone in the town had a busy-quest for me.  Usually quite simple like killing some foes, activating a button, etc, but the fact that you have seemingly random generation on quests is something that I haven't seen from one of these types of games.  Usually the game comes with a bunch of quests and that's it.  Not so sure about this game.  Seems like they changed enough aspects of the game to make it really unique. I'd love to see if there is a multiplayer community for this game!  I see it is supported, but I haven't tried it out yet.All in all, I'm super impressed.  Go out and buy this game!			"

												Din's Curse is a game about substance over style. There are prettier, smoother, flashier action rpgs out there right now, but what Soldak brings to the table with their take on the genre is a game that can be fine-tuned and customized, providing a randomly generated town and a dungeon to protect it from. Layer on top of that systems of interactive NPCs both friendly and hostile (which works most of the time) and a class system that gives you the freedom to build the kind of character you want to play. These features and more allow Din's Curse to stand on it's own.There is somewhat of a storyline. You (The Player Character) have incurred the wrath of Din, who tasks you with redeeming yourself by becoming a hero. It's mostly an excuse to send you to an infinite number of worlds so that you can delve into their dungeons and kick the crap out of pixies and orcs. Most of the quests in the game are randomly generated ""kill x"" and ""fetch y"" throwaways.The way this is kept from turning the game completely stale is the way that these quests can have a tangible effect on the game world. You aren't just collecting metal shards for no reason - the townsfolk might be making an ice turret to fend off attackers. Leave an enemy leader alive too long and he'll start building an army which will overflow from the dungeon and endanger the townsfolk. It's possible for the town to become dehydrated and famished too as shipments are lost in the dungeon.The combat can feel clunky at times. Though the game isn't terribly old the animations and hit feedback leave something to be desired. The dungeons themselves aren't particularly attention grabbing. They more or less look like a series of corridors filled with monsters to slay. Generic at best, mediocre at worst. The UI itself is the definition of clunky and there are features missing that have existed in most games like it for years.The reason I have to give this game props is that it truly does build on its own unique concepts. I've had lots of fun delving into dungeons and gearing my character, and I love that I can go through and save a town in a matter of hours. It allows me to craft somewhat of a legacy for my character: He isn't just a guy who has done that one heroic thing. He's the savior of multiple universes! This game will be hit or miss for a lot of people. I personally loved it, but that's because I had the patience to look past the clunky presentation to see the underlying systems beneath. It's sophisticated, but not outwardly so. If you're a fan of dungeon crawlers I'd say give it a go. I give Din's Curse an 8/10  "

												I really wanted to like this game. I could look past the low-poly models, the awkward texturing, the clunky animations, the garish particle effects, the simplistic UI, the bland music, and the jarring sound effects... If ONLY the game was fun to play.For the most part, it's like any other Diablo clone you might have played. Sometimes the movements and attack animations feel kind of sluggish, but it's the same kind of point-and-click combat accompanied by a lot of randomly-generated loot, and other random factors.But I consider that one of the biggest flaws in the game: TOO much is left up to random chance. You get a random town with random NPCs, a random dungeon with a random monster pool and a random number of floors (generally from about 5 to about 20) and you're given random quests to kill a specific monster, kill several lesser monsters, recover or destroy a random quest item, or find and/or rescue somebody from a random floor. All of which would be FINE, if the game didn't leave SO MUCH up to chance.For example, if you get a quest to meet an NPC in the dungeon, you have to reach the floor they're on, then HOPE you find them almost immediately, because they can and will be attacked by any monsters that happen to spawn near them. And 9 times out of 10, they'll be killed by the monsters, forcing you to fail the quest. Now, failing one quest like that isn't the end of the world, but it feels like you just aren't given a fair chance, and it's one of many factors reflecting this game's lack of polish.A lot of reviewers praise the fact that you can fail any quest, any NPC can die, and you can even fail to save whatever town you're on from ruin. This isn't a bad idea in theory, but there's no way to gauge how well you're doing or how safe the town is until people start dying off and it's practically too late to help. It's true that failing to kill a ""boss"" enemy before an arbitrary time limit means he'll start raising minions and sending troops and assassins into the town, but there isn't much you can do to expedite that quest. It comes to a point where you're fighting a constant tide of new quests, compounded by attacks on the town, which keep you from reaching deeper floors of the dungeon, since you have to constantly return to the surface. The enemies just teleport directly into the town. It would be nicer if they had to physically travel there, so you could intercept them or cut them off, or SOMEhow take preventative action against them, but all you can do is grind along on each quest as you would normally have done. If one of my quests involved killing a boss monster on floor 15, and I was only on floor 5 or so, I would sometimes just let the monsters destroy the town and move on to a new one, because these randomly generated quests were asking far too much of me. I knew I would not only be constantly traveling back to town to kill invaders, but also that new quests in other deep floors of the dungeon would be constantly arising, just as unreachable as the first, and compounding the attacks on the town. People throw around words like ""consequences"" and ""stakes"" in praise of this game, but failing to save a town has pretty much negligible consequences. You lose some reputation and you move on to a new town. Losing one or two has no major impact on the overall game, so there's not much motivation to protect them when they're so easily disposable.Another problem is that a town becomes ""saved"" after you complete a randomly-selected arbitrary quest, and there's no way of knowing which one it will be. You might kill the boss monster, break his evil altar, destroy an uprising of skeletons, recover an evil artifact, and cure the town's poisoned water supply, but none of those things might ""save"" the town. Instead, the game might decide that the town is ""saved"" when you gather items for the townspeople to construct a lightning totem in the town. There's no way of knowing what your ""main"" quest is, because it looks like any other random task. But all that happens when you ""save"" a town is that you're allowed to move on to a new one. The dungeon is still full of monsters, and all the other pre-existing quests can still be done (in fact, more will continue to spring up as long as you stay in the town) and you need not even reach the final floor of the dungeon. I found it weird when I saved my first town having only been to 10 of the dungeon's 12 floors.So, these might be some pretty frustrating game design choices, but by far the most frustrating thing turned out to be the combat. I played as a summoning character, which I usually find fun in games like these. But the monsters' AI is so dreadful, playing a summoner is practically useless. I had my minions set to ""aggressive"" but they seemed to just do whatever they wanted. Sometimes they would completely ignore enemies, even as I fought them, sometimes they would attack an enemy once and then run away for no reason, and worst of all, they LOVED to stand in narrow hallways, blocking my path when I needed to escape from enemies.But worse than that is the enemies' ability to stun you. Certain enemies with special attacks, or even ordinary enemies getting critical hits, apparently, can stun you, meaning you are 100% immobilized and unable to make any attacks or use any skills for a good three seconds. At higher levels, this is plenty of time for a swarm of monsters to surround you, stunlock you, and slowly whittle away at all of your health as you cannot possibly break through the crowd or drink potions fast enough to keep yourself alive. All you can do is sit there and watch your character slowly die.I'm perfectly fine with a game being difficult, but this game just comes across as sloppy. The difficulty is unfair and unbalanced, as a result of some very clunky combat mechanics and far too much of the quests being left up to random chance. Speaking of which, there is no real narrative or over-arching final objective to ""beat"" the game. Just a big disorganized pile of infinite towns, infinite dungeons, and infinite quests. I was eventually given the ""gain your freedom"" quest, which I took to be something a little different, signaling an ""end"" to the game, even though I was only about level 18. But the objective was just to kill another randomly-generated boss monster. And after I did it, nothing changed. I didn't gain an especially substantial reward, I still had my same pile of quests from the townspeople, and the game invited me to do some more of them... Forever. Even worse, actually, is that I FAILED the ""gain your freedom"" quest on my first attempt, and the town was eventually destroyed. But then I moved on to a new town, and the quest was immediately made available to me again. My failure of this seemingly-important quest had zero impact on my game. I just did it again.If you're looking for a Diablo clone/action RPG/dungeon crawler, you can do a lot better, even just on steam. I'd recommend either of the Torchlight games, Titan Quest, or even Fate (a similarly unpolished-feeling game) before I would recommend this one.			"

												At first glance, this looks like a ""standard"" Diablo-style game, albeit with far more detailed character options and items. The difference between Din's Curse and any other ""Diablo-like"" is the nature of the quests and the dungeon itself. Quests aren't static. Enemies aren't static. NPCs aren't static. Events evolve. Failures happen. Take too long, and the bad guys gain more power and minions. The NPC you are supposed to rescue is slain. The villain in level 7 advances his plot to the next stage. People in town succumb to the a mysterious illness. Each town is a little different, and faces a different crisis. Things happen in real time.And sometimes, things are going so horribly, catastrophically wrong that you end up hiding inside the dungeon waiting for doom to complete its course in the city above, forcing you to teleport to the next city where you can redeem yourself.Particularly with the Demon War expansion, there are always some very interesting options. Like - instead of simply fighting the monsters invading the town on your own and hoping to kill them before they kill too many citizens, you can go around in advance and arm & armor the citizens so they can increase their own surviveability. You can also create a custom class, mixing any two ability groups that fit your ideas.  And of course, there are scads of options to challenge yourself.So while it's got a more low-budget look to the graphics, from a gameplay perspective, this is one of the more deep, rich games of its type, and something you should definitely try if you are a fan of the subgenre. Hardcore RPG fans will find a lot more to sink their teeth into than most garden-variety Diablo-likes.			"

												To me, this is what an ARPG should be. If you like messing around with different character builds, killing stuff, collecting gear with little story or exploration to slow you down, give this a go.PLEASE don't look too much at the screenshots or videos, just download the demo and give it a try. It's only 100MB or so, and it plays way better than it looks.If you like the ARPG genre, I don't think you'll be disappointed.			"

												This is Diablo, only with a fifth of the plot- all action. You are probably going to die. A lot. And so will all the townspeople relying upon you, their hero, for safety. All because, in ""Din's Curse,"" the bosses fight back.Slowly but surely, they gather power and influence, staging ambushes upon the town while you're down in the dungeon or shopping for more armor. You will die a lot, but it's great fun. Highly recommended for any fan of Diablo, Torchlight, or Titan's Quest; try the demo if you're unsure.			"

												A delightful little Diablo clone, nobody will confuse this with Blizzard's most recent titles.  The primitive graphics are more than made-up for by the game's greatest innovation on the genre:  Everything is played on a timer, and if you take too long to complete a particular quest (or if you ignore a quest altogether) the monsters living down in the Dungeon will attack the town!If your town is destroyed, it's game over, so the game becomes a tense balancing act as you try to do what's best for your hero while also trying to keep the town relatively intact.  The townsmen can defend themselves, and you can complete quests along the way to make it easier for them to defend themselves (e.g., ""Find the blue prints for an Arrow Tower on Level 12 of the dungeon"") or to give you access to better equipment (e.g., ""If you can find this rare artifact on Level 3, we can recruit an Armorer to come to this town"").As with all the Diablo games, the dungeon-romp gets a little repetitive after a while.  The different classes help some with this, but not overly much.  If this turned you off in other titles like Torchlight or Diablo, there's little reason to think you'd enjoy it more here.  But if you enjoyed those games, and want something that provides a bit more of a thinking man's challenge, this is a great little game!			"

												I looked into Din's Curse after reading some reviews of it. The novelties it brings - randomized worlds, dynamic events, time-sensitive quests - are all extremely interesting and full of exciting potential. Unfortunately, the game never rises to meet said potential. After playing through two and a half towns I feel as though I've more or less gotten the idea. Go to a town, win and fail some quests, occasionally have to rush back to town to defend an attack... rinse and repeat.If the dynamic events were held together by something even resembling a storyline, or some more interesting characters, this game would probably be nothing short of incredible. But as it stands - it's just another bare-bones Action RPG clickfest with a few interesting features that are borderline gimmicks. If you know you love Action RPGs then by all means, check this one out. It's certainly not bad insofar as the genre goes. But if you were hoping, like me, for a new take on what has long ago become a worn-out genre, then think again:  at best, Din's Curse can be an interesting experiment in which you can invest a couple of hours, but nothing more.

												Diablo and Torchlight may offer more in graphics, this game offer alot more in content. One thing love about this game is that monster actually hate each other(unlike most rpgs where they all gang up on you). The monsters gain xp each time they kill a npc or monster, so  it may be wise decision take them out before they become to powerful. Another cool feature is that objects in the dungeon can be interacted by either the player or monsters; for example levers which activate traps or unlock areas. Monsters may activate a ruin which heals them or gives them buff.  Ocassionally monster uprising may start which can lead to the town being invaded. Towns can be destroyed if the you vital npcs; fortunately the dungeons have teleporters which allows quick trips to the surface. The player also gets a teleport stone which be used in emergency; however you must complete a certain quest to recharge it. Since some players may want to focus just on dungeon crawling an option during character creation allows to disable invasions. The game offers quite options for both character creation and world generation.			"

												Great ARPG, and the class-hybrid system is more interesting than it would first appear, since two skill trees are moe than enough to build a useful and relatively-unique character.The randomized towns are relatively small and unengaging until enemies start pouring up to the surface, at which point they become a burden; a burden to relieve of invasion, and a burden to face the deaths of the townsfolk therein. After a couple towns, one may feel the repetition, but with increasingly frequent invasions, focusing on dungeon clearing and exploration becomes more imperative, similar to Torchlight.Hella' unpolished, but Din's Curse has a rough charm to it; you can tell there were just two dudes working on this game with their hearts in it.But seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that noise when the town is invaded.

												If you enjoy action RPG's primarily for their mechanics, this game is easily one of the best.  Your job is to rescue towns by fulfilling various, randomly-generated quests, most of which have you delving deep into multifloor, randomly-generated dungeons.  While you're doing this, any number of events within the town can occur.  For example, individuals may get in a fight; the town may be attacked by monsters; merchants may arrive with new goods.It's striaghtforward and simple, but the real draw of this game comes from the many ways you can alter the gameplay.  There are several character classes, each with three variants, each with their own small skill trees.  You can also create a class.  As for the worlds themselves, you can determine the level at which enemies spawn, how often events occur, how often other NPC's attempt to solve quests (they can, and sometimes do succeed).  You can pay to take back stat points and skill points, allowing you to dynamically customize and re-customize your character as you're playing.  There is very little you can't directly change.  There is also the option for permadeath, if you want a greater challenge.The DLC is absolutely worth it.  It only adds more content, and does so seamlessly. The only downside is the graphical presentation - this game is passable, but not particularly good looking.  The UI works, but could do with having some elements closer together - on a large monitor, you might find yourself having to shift attention away from your character in order to keep track of their health, which means getting caught by surprise in some of the harder floors.  I'm not particularly bothered by it, as the gameplay is worth the occasional trouble, but if you've a very large monitor you'd probably benefit from scaling it to a different aspect ratio.Overall, I very much enjoy this game.  It's worth the price even without a sale.			"

												I actually can't believe that I haven't reviewed this game yet. As other reviewers have said, it's 'substance over style', here. Ignore the screenshots, if possible - the gameplay is deep. If you've ever wanted a ARPG like Diablo that takes the roguelike aspects to the absolute limit, here you go. The multiplayer is great, and you have a LOT of ways to 'tweak' each town/dungeon combo. Once you 'save' a town by defeating the threat in the dungeon below, or fail to do so, you move onto the next randomly-generated town/dungeon combo, which you're able to tweak to your liking (or challenge) again. You can also customize your character in many ways, including inventive handicaps that force you to play differently. Eventually, you are able to 'ascend' a character, and choose to continue playing as this character, or not.The game's on sale right now, so it's a no-brainer. Just MAKE SURE to get the Demon War DLC as well, as it adds a lot of meaningful complexity to the townspeople and events (not just demons).			"

												Din's Curse is definitely a solid co-op action RPG. I found the graphical style charming, and thought that the randomly-generated levels made for compelling exploration. The game offers dual-classing which is a must for me, always wanting to try a build outside of the beaten path. Where the game misses the mark a little is in the hook. The player is in servitude to the god Din, and must save a number of towns to be released. However, I was ""released"" at a relatively low level, something like level 16. It seems that the level cap is around 100! I also feel that the skill system is a bit strange. I had a ""main"" skill that I intended to do most of my damage with. I really felt no reason to put points in any other skill...and I did relatively fine. I suppose that if you're driven by the challenge, you can replay the game with a number of different modifiers - and perhaps the loot lust will keep you moving. Lastly, there are some issues with the objectives. As mentioned in other reviews, you very often are too late to rescue townspeople in the dungeon, especially if they are many floors below you. Additionally, the town gets attacked quite often, and it is sometimes extremely difficult to find the enemies. The mini-map has a poor resolution that is difficult to decipher. Either way, not a bad co-op play, but much worse than something like Grim Dawn.			"

												Randomized quests, loot, NPC's (including their interaction with the world - some get attacked, some are on different floors, some offer unique quests), and enemies, makes this game a classic Roguelike that all fans of the genre will enjoy.The class customization is insane and lets you make really cool combinations to slay your foes.Multiplayer (co-op) is also really easy to get going and can hop in and out (with saved progress) in minutes.

												i've been playing this game for quite a while and it's a decent time sink; i guess i'll just list the good and the bad down here and maybe throw some thoughts at the end too or something:THE BAD:* performance is pretty horrible when compared to how bad the game looks: I'd imagine running all the game logic at once takes a big toll on both graphical fidelity and framerate.* balance occasionally seems off-tune: some skills are extremely strong while some feel lackluster, and sometimes item requirements are weird, to say the least, for the level you find them at. occasionally you will meet monsters which are very overtuned but that's mostly a consequence of their randomly rolled stats and may not be as bad (you can just, like, walk away or save/exit).*the villagers could probably have easily been somewhat more capable, since at the moment they feel a lot like babies you need to tend to, but whenever one of them defects to the enemy they get like 5x stronger, and it feels kind of unfair.THE MIXED:* combat isn't exactly the strong suit of the game: it's floaty, imprecise, and seems slightly lacking in depth (overall, the mechanics allow for some mastery and animation cancelling which is always a good thing, but the control scheme and the fact that you can move while attacking kind of work against you).THE GOOD:* you can respec at any moment as long as you have the coin for it without cutting into the game's replayability. there's a lot of classes to explore and the ability to create any custom class out of combining two instances of any subclass (repeats allowed) truly helps in this sense as well.* there's a lot of variety in the quests you might encounter and the game truly feels like a living world which you're interacting with, if a bit rough around the edges.* you can easily tackle any kind of content you want and customize your experience and town to a high degree. towns have a few preset town-centers around which they spawn and they usually end up repeating themselves in layout pretty often, but every dungeon is unique, with invisible walls, mysterious levers, hidden stashes of goodies, and overall modifiers which change the way the town and its associated dungeon behave, which makes just about every single town you save unique.* while the game doesn't have all that much tactical depth in its combat, there's a lot of strategic depth; once you get to know how quests pan out, or even based on little footholds and advantages you can obtain in the dungeon.* netcode is good and stable; i didn't get to play often with friends, but when i did, it went along hassle-free with no quests falling into any unfinishable states or anything like that: i once encountered some disconnections but i'm not sure that's necessarily on the game's side. if you're into ARPGs full of procedural content, with high replayability and can stand lack of polish and optimization, this should be right up your alley. if you're not sure i still suggest buying it and testing it. it shouldn't take more than two hours for you to realize that you'd rather refund this purchase if you don't like it.

												Chances are really good that you dismissed this game when you looked at the screenshots. If you didn't, great! I'll make a case for it.This game, to me, has all the pieces of a great roguelike / arpg game.  Instead of repeating the same story over and over, the game will randomly generate a town, dungeon, and quests for you to complete.The really great thing about this game though, is that the world just isn't standing around waiting for you to interact with it. Villigers are starving, alpha monsters are rallying troops to attack the town. The longer you spend doing one quest, another might have been made impossible due to your target getting attacked by another mob. You might find yourself rushing OUT of the dungeon due to a raid. This randomly created world dosn't revolve around you. Once you have sufficiantly set things right in town (or not) you go on to the next. You can set how long this should take on average in the options, It creates a really nice arcade-dungeon crawl feel that never gets old.It's really rough around the edges, the graphics look like my cat's puke stain on the carpet and the combat gameplay while not terrible isn't really worth mentioning. But if you can allow yourself to get drawn in to the core game mechanics you may see the beauty in it. It takes the RNG dungeon aspect of many ARPG's and applies it to the entire world you interact in, and then consolidates it into a very fun and often hectic 30 minute to an hour game.If a more polished, refined game came out using these same mechanics, it would have the potential to be a real classic, especially for fans of the dungeon crawl, arpg or rougelike genres.So download the free demo, give it a whirl, have some fun. Get the game on sale if you can, It can be a bitter but you might develop a taste for it.			"

												Din's Curse is an interesting game with original ideas, but in practice, plays like another mediocre dungeon crawler.This is a very systems-driven game. Rather than have a scripted campaign, each game is entirely procedurally generated, from the layouts of the dungeons to the quests themselves. The quests are refreshingly honest: if an NPC tells you that you need to go carry out a task quickly or the town will be in danger, or the inhabitants will starve (or similar consequences), they aren't joking. You need to go do that thing quickly (rather than mess around with side quests) or that the consequences really will follow!Unfortunately, in execution, your interaction with these systems is extremely limited. Each game follows a similar pattern, with only occasional and slight deviations: you start at the ground floor of a dungeon, work your way down the levels in a more-or-less linear fashion, and complete whichever quests you can. Often your ability to complete a quest on time is a matter of luck, having little to do with any decisions you have available. And the combat system, which is your main way of interacting with the game, is far less interesting than the systems in which it is embedded.As an experiment, I applaud this game and hope that much was learned from it. As a game, it's really hard to recommend.			"

 Strong points of the game:  Complex and neat RPG and hack'n'slash features Game time can vary from as little as 10 minutes to hours, up to the player Random world is super random and dynamic, lots of surprises and cool events Character development is robust yet impossible to mess up Possibility to make interesting character builds by combining multiple classes Things to consider:  Expect low-budget models, textures, animations and effects The game is not necessarily a fast-paced slaughter-fest, combat can feel slow sometimes "

												This is a great aRPG. While the graphics are very dated and user interface is a bit clunky at times, the game's other qualities more than make up for those shortcomings. The dynamic nature of the quests is very engaging. Townspeople may starve or that monsters may attack the town if you don't move quickly enough, and that creates a sense of urgency which adds tension to the game that just isn't present with any other game of this genre that I've ever played.The character creation is very open-ended; the ability to select any two skill trees to create a hybrid class, and the ability to level any skill in those trees without level prerequisite skills, means that there are hundreds if not thousands of viable ways to play the game.This is a unique game and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. Don't let the screenshots turn you off, this game is amazing.			"

												Some would probably think this game is unfair and one reviewer in particular called this game unfair and that it ""left SO MUCH up to chance"". Honestly I don't see the problem with this game. Graphics? Doesn't make a game so don't care. Monster AI? I think every game known to man could use some work on the monster AI and most people would probably judge it based on there opinion of how things should react to the player and let's not forget the glitches that can happen at random. So for this game it's not the greatest I've seen but it is good enough to be enjoyable and not to easy.Diablo Clone? Although I use this method of labeling games that fall under this genre just like Torchlight, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, so on and so forth, I hate it. Honestly it makes it nearly impossible for anyone to make a game of this style to always compare it to a predecessor who was in my opinion nearly flawless. But, I will say Din's Curse was one of the only well made games of this style to be labeled a Diablo clone. (I feel the same about Torchlight II) Too Random? You know what, no it isn't. If any gamer out there who has played Din's Curse and doesn't like the random craziness of it all that's fine, it's your opinion. Don't go calling the game sloppy for the reason that others (like me) love this game. To me it feels complete like it was meant to be ridiculous. I found this game to be quite humourus in that aspect. Seriously the first time I got a quest failed notification because an NPC died in the dungeon I realized wasting time was not good in this game and I had to stay on the ball. It keeps you on your toes. Also, it's quite entertaining to watch villagers mess around and get themselves killed cause there in debt by like a couple copper coins, or charging at high level enemies expecting to do more damage than a bee sting.The gameplay is entertaining and keeps you busy like games are meant to. It's difficult and doesn't hold your hand a like a child unlike most games made these days, especially triple A titles. Hell, when I was 2 (maybe 3) I started playing video games, Diablo II came out when I was what 5 or 6. It's how I became pretty decent at solving puzzles and actually helped me read and write (for the most part) correctly unlike most people from my generation. So these days when they make games easy and predictable it's lame and boring I don't care how much money it's making from ignorant gamers and the layman of gaming a.k.a casual gamers, it's still a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. That's why Din's Curse is outstanding in my book. And you know what, I have a feeling that on that difficulty I only beat it because I was playing with my Cousin and our mutual friend. We loved it and I'm actually thinking of playing it again it's been awhile.So to sum everything up, ignore the graphics play the game with your own music score in the background if you must, and maybe get a friend or two to play with you cause this game is great and don't be a whimp up the difficulty. When you've gained enough reputation to lift the curse it's like a new game+ without having to leave the game and opening the menu to start the new game. So play it beat it, and start again with the same stats, or make a new character. Hope you all enjoy.			"

												If you manage to get past the graphics this game is a pure gem, a Diablo-like where the world actually fights back. Bosses don't stay in their lairs patiently waiting for you to come and kill them, they plot, they hire lieutenants, rise minions, build machines, stir trouble, send spies and assassins to the town, and much more. It's up to you to take the proper decisions to save the town, the more time you take to complete quests the stronger your enemies become.While the first few towns created are a bit dull and give a poor idea of the game, the action picks up quite fast and the game becomes addictive as hell. Give it a try!			"

												Another great Soldak game! This is a direct successor to Depths of Peril (great in its own right), removing the clan warfare aspect, adding multiplayer, great classes and really streamlining the whole experience for the better. It's a hack and slash ARPG, in the Diablo vein, stuck in a crazy randomizing blender. There is no epic overarching storyline, but each randomized town plays differently and has stories of their own, and you can tweak the town options to personalize it to your playstyle. And mod support! There is a TON of replayability, even if the graphics are a little dated looking. The expansion, Demon War, is completely worth it as well. (P.S. I've played this much more than Steam reports, since I played a lot before it came to Steam.)			"

												Din's Curse turns out to be an amazing game, especially with the Demon War expansion, which adds more to the base game!A game with a simple idea (To start in town, haunted by a cave, temple, etc) and limited area (that town, haunted with an underground cave, temple, etc) is taken far with this game! You have been revived by Din (a Diety), who feels as though in your life, you never quite did enough. He explains that to redeem yourself, you must journey with himself to towns, and in these towns you must do your best to solve all that is wrong, and save the small towns from extinsion from the demon threat below.That is the basic idea for the game, but the execution of this game takes the cake, you can select your class, several of which are available. In each class there are 3 perspectives. For example, you can choose the Thief, who has 3 different perspectives, you can level up and persue skills in the Assassin's tree, which allows you to attack with deadly efficiency! Or you can persue the Thief tree, which allows you to sneak, pick locks, and slow the enemy!Also, while on the subject, you are allowed to use a special *Hybrid* class, which allows you to select ANY 2 perspectives of the classes, and combine them. For example you could select a Mage perspective AND a warrior perspective, allowing you to use heavy armor and magic, and essentially any weapon you want. It adds a gread deal to the game, and the variety.Also, the levelling system, I mentions perspectives ( and tree's a couple of times) but the levelling is free-form. So if you have the points, you can select ANY skill in the tree, top or bottom. All you need is the skill points, allowing you to grow and build your character in any way or order you want.I can praise this game in many different areas, but it's really a game to be experienced, not read about.

												I want to like this game. That's probably why I've got so many hours played, despite any session never being longer than 30 mintues or so. The game is dull and frustrating.Din's Curse presents itself as a dynamic, living world that continues to evolve as you do your own thing, regardless of how you play. This sounds fun until you realize that quests can become unfinishable as you're attempting to complete them through no fault of your own. Necessary NPCs in town can be killed while you're in the dungeons below. Monster spawns change as the game progresses (randomly), meaning there aren't always enough monsters to actually complete your objectives. One solution is to just wait and see if something changes after a while, but you don't get many quest slots.The graphics are bad. Really, really bad. That might not be a deal breaker for most people, but it's definitely a mark against it. The music is mediocre, and voice acting is almost completely absent. Dialogue menus and the inventory system are even worse. Combat is a mixed bag. The class system allows you to customize your playstyle to a significant degree, but with so many options you start to realize that there's a lot of overlap. Still, the class system is probably the best reason to pick up this game. It's got a healthy amount of choices and encourages replay. Combat itself isn't so great though. Animations are awkward, weapons lack impact, and many spells trigger cave-ins that can help or hinder. (usually just hinder)Dungeons are a bore, and that's all you get. There are very few changes to the scenery as you explore one dungeon after another, deep below the next randomly selected doomed village. They're randomly generated and all end up looking exactly the same. All in all I really can't recommend the game to anyone. The game feels like something that would have been released in 2002, not 2010, but it doesn't even have that bubbly nostalgia feeling. It mostly just makes me sigh and appreciate how far good games have come.			"

												It's an Ok game, despite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and such, but as a diablo kinda game it's quite ok. I enjoyed it, and always wanted to find out what was on the next level. But now that i haven't played it in a while i'm not tempted to open it again.It's a cheap and fun game if you don't have anything else to play.			"

												This game redefines group-AI-survival-psych-ward-simulator into something completely unique, leaving you with a feeling that you've finally found that missing piece of your childhood buried under your mother's geraniums.  Possibly the most invigorating experience I've had in years.  This work of art leaves you asking key existential questions, like:Did I just lose when my quest NPCs abandoned the town?Is the audio still playing?Are traps really killing everyone in the town?If I can't see my character, am I still stealthed?How are the townsfolk starving?Is there a boss?Have I taken more damage in town than in the dungeon?... and many more!I've sunk more hours than I care to admit into this game, and I can honestly say there is nothing quite like it.  You will be amazed from the moment you launch the game.			"

												The action RPG genre hasn't really changed. Soldak Entertainment makes an effort to make very unique ARPG's with more going on then just the same formula. All of there games are addictive and unique! Highly customizable with mod support and difficulty rulesets which can be toggled at the character selection screen! Multiplayer support, both online and LAN for Din's Curse and Drox Operative!Drox Operative:Din's Curse:Depth of Peril:10/10 A+++Do yourself and Soldak Entertainment a favor and spread the word about these great games and more to come!They have a new game called ""Zombasite"" on the horizon. The hype is real!Zombasite:http://www.soldak.com/Zombasite/Overview.html "

												This game is okay if you're just in the mood for beating up beasties, but I haven't decided if its worth any more of my time than I've already put into it.  There is no tutorial; instead, as you happen on something new in the game, you are given a short description of what you are to do, but so far I've not found anyway to re-read anything forgotten.  This is a turnoff to me.  I'll probably play it when I have nothing better to do, but I don't see myself investing too much time in this one.  I'm glad I got it on sale.			"

												Inferior Diablo 2 clone that fails to live up to the standards set by Blizzard Entertainment's original game.  It's not just the game that copies its inspiration - Soldak Entertainment appear to base their company name on the leading corporation's title. Despite this blatant plagiarism, the game does have some merits although few that allow it to stand on its own. It has a dynamic world generation, and is very much point and click. If you've played Diablo then you will be able to dive straight in to Din's Curse. The one main difference is that you have better game options in DC. You can turn on different modes, such as giving all monsters more aggression, or increasing their numbers, or reducing your own chances of finding rare items. It's all good fun at first although it quickly develops into a grind. The relentless aggression of the mobs mean that the single player mode can quickly become overwhelming. Important NPC's in the town seem to have little regard for themselves, and having no guards to protect themselves, they can easily be killed by intermittent raids. And they will. Regularly. It seems that Steam doesn't host Diablo, and for this reason I recommend buying DC if for no other reason than that you can experience this kind of isometric point-and-click genré. However, I would be hesitant paying full price for something that is a poor imitator.			"

												This game is a scam. DO NOT BUY. I feel abused for buying into this disgusting pile of crap. If you're desperate for an underground, oldskool cult'ish ARPG like I was, then pay close attention...First off, the reviewers here are either mentally disabled or more likely associated with the developers of this crippled mess. I doubt your typical average steam-tard could possibly be *THIS* delusional when reviewing something this bad. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about the game. Format your drive, light PC on fire and throw out window if you ever manage installing software made by soldak gaming. To cut things short, the gameplay is horrid. Combat is the most unsatisfying garbage to have ever existed and the UI is made of PlSS.  Nothing comes together well - placement, composition and symmetry of texts, objects, items, windows, boxes, borders, enemies, EVERYTHING is gross and the animations are more primitive than a 10 year old browser MMO written in Java (*ahem* runescape). The graphics look as if they were made by drug addicted scumbags, nothing is lovable about them. I enjoy oldskool muddy textures and crude or simplistic designs, but these graphics are just cheap. Perhaps the worst insult is the price. For 10$ you could save a dying african child's life, so that even he could grow up and develop something better than this on Ubuntu. I'm never trusting a game that is compatible with linux ever again. Thank you Steam.If you're looking for a great underground hack'nslah/diablo clone/ARPG, try Sacred 1but stay away from 2 and 3.Dungeon Siege 2 is also great.			"

												DO NOT BUY JUST ONE COPY OF THIS GAME.let me make something very clear, this is a co-op only game, now there may be a single player mode, but don't let that fool you, this is a team game, and it is only worth playing with friends. That being said, if you have friends to play with, this game can be a blast, there's a real sense of urgency as you and your freinds race to defeat the monsters base before they destroy your home town, think Diablo, but you don't have infinite time. the most impressive feature of this game though, is the class mixing, and how it seems to stay largely balanced, my personal favorite is the necromancer, but there's a lot to pick from. That being said this game is far from perfect, its greatest flaw is easily its lack of any sense of progression, sure, you may feel accomplished when you beat the boss and have saved the town, but that quickly means nothing as you move to the next one, as if everything before never happened. The game lacks a proper build up, or a ""100 floors mode"" another thing DO NOT BUY THIS GAME THINKING YOU CAN FIND OTHER PEOPLE WHO OWN ITthis game is highly under rated, and you're not gonna find a lot of active games of it... thats just a sad truth, i've heard its sequal zombasite is doing pretty well, but until then your best bet would be to buy about 4 copies when its on sale or get your freinds to buy a copy of it too.The DLC is pretty limited, sure it adds a lot of new enemies, but they all kinda melt into a blur anyways, the new class is neat, but adding just one new class for half the price of the original game really isn't worth it. if you're going to buy the game with the DLC, get zombasite instead of this. it includes the class and an extra one for free.

												(First impressions review after 1 1/2 hours play)So far, so good.Even though I'm not very good at them, I love both ARPG and Roguelike games, so when I stumbled across this game, it was quite a pleasant suprise.There's quite a bit of mechanical depth here, as you are able to combine classes to create an entirely unique hybrid class. Each class has 3 talent trees, and if you chose a hybrid class, you may chose one tree from each class you're combining. I haven't tried this yet, but it's a neat idea that I look forward to trying out soon.My first character is a ranger class, specializing in archery and daggers, with leather armor specialty, etc. Unlike games like Torchlight 2, there isn't as much freedom within a class to use any weapon. In Torchlight, the class more or less defines starting stats and spells, but beyond that they can use any weapon they want. In Din's Curse, it's the more traditional style that says 'Rangers can't use giant axes'. It can be a bit annoying if a really good high DPS ax drops, but the only thing you can do is sell it, but all in all it's fine.The main flaw of this game is visuals. They aren't awful, but they are old fashioned. The game was made in 2010, but even then, the game looks more like a 2005 game. The animations are a little stiff, and sometimes when my character uses a bow, she is facing the wrong direction as she fires, and if I try to attack while walking, the character can sometimes slide while doing a firing animation. This can cause a problem due to the Line of sight mechanic, which prevents you from attacking an enemy your character doesn't 'see'. Occasionally I will try to attack, start sliding away, and the attack cancels in the middle of the animation because my character lost line of sight. These are minor flaws, but since the game is six years old now, I doubt they will be fixed.Everything in this game is randomly generated, not just the dungeons and loot. The basic premise of this game is that you are a person who lived a life of hedonism, when the titular god Din curses you to live your life again as a hero. Therefore, you travel from town to town, doing quests, attempting to save the town from doom. To fulfill this premise, every town is randomly generated. This creates a flaw in that every town looks the same, but functionally, each town is different, as not every town has a armorer, for example. It's a good compromise of mechanics over visuals, that I'm happy with.Dungeons are very straightforward. Procedurally generated based on a themed tileset and themed enemies etc. An interesting difference is that within the dungeons, battles are going on between factions (demons vs werewolves, etc.) which can lead to quests changing or solving themselves dynamically. I have yet to see this in action, but I'll take the developers word on it for now.Also has multiplayer Co-op, but since I don't have any friends (who own this game), I haven't tried it out yetIn conclusion, if you're interested in a new ARPG and don't care about flashy graphics, this is a good one to check out.

												Like Depths of Peril before it, this is easily one of the best games I've ever played.  With the exception of Kivi's Underworld--a good game in its own right but a deviation from their trademark emergent gameplay model--Soldak never disappoints.The sheer amount of things to do in this game is mind-boggling and can literally be overwhelming.  The best part?  Each game plays out completely differently.  Lots of games boast infinite replayability--Din's Curse is the standard by which all others should be measured.If the idea of playing alone induces a yawn, please know that multiplayer is a frenetic, exhilirating blast.  I simply cannot imagine anyone who spent a few minutes with this game not quickly finding themselves in its thrall.  And when you're ready for something familiar but new, Drox Operative, their latest title (currently in beta) s right around the corner.			"

Demon War adds even more new stuff to make it more fun. Procedural dungeons everytime you start a new town, with new NPCs and the ever-present Din, the god who made you immortal and forced you into making the town happy and free of monsters - as if that's easy - NOT!

												ARPGs haven't changed much- it's mostly about killing things flashier for prettier loot. Din's Curse is the exception. Its random quests and villagers give each town you must save more character than all the lame pulp lore Blizzard invested into Diablo 3. It's also more intense because after the first village, you're always pressed for time as the quests you must do pile up & the monsters start to invade the village you were sent to save. People will die if you negligent and starve if you are greedy- neglect them for too long and divine punishment will fall on you. This game of karma inverts the priorities of every other ARPG- and makes for an amazing game as a result. It's also highly customizable, with plenty of ways to ratchet up the difficulty if you want to be hardcore beyond simply making monsters have more health. While the actual fighting is lackluster, its creativity in nearly every other aspect of ARPGs makes it a must play.			"

												Din's Curse is a fun Diablo/rogue-like type game, that holds it's own unique flavor.  You save different random towns by doing randomized quests, from the influx of monsters from a randomized dungeon.  When you save a town, you go on to a new town, which is never the same as the last.  The game isn't as polished  or have the prettiest graphics, but it is addicting and fun and has a certain charm to it. Try out the demo if you like action role-playing.			"

With the exception of Kivi's Underworld--a good game in its own right but a deviation from their trademark emergent gameplay model--Soldak never disappoints.The sheer amount of things to do in this game is mind-boggling and can literally be overwhelming.  The best part?  Each game plays out completely differently.  Lots of games boast infinite replayability--Din's Curse is the standard by which all others should be measured.If the idea of playing alone induces a yawn, please know that multiplayer is a frenetic, exhilirating blast.  I simply cannot imagine anyone who spent a few minutes with this game not quickly finding themselves in its thrall.  And when you're ready for something familiar but new, Drox Operative, their latest title (currently in beta) s right around the corner.			"

												Holy crap is this game underrated as hell. One of the best dungeon crawlers I've ever played and nobody knows about it. This game knows how to do loot, and i love the roguelike elements like traps and potions and tons of handicaps. Full recommendation.			"
