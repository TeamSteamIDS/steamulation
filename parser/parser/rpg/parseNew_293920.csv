												I had trouble with the game back when I first played it and was rudely told by the creator that ""It was playtested and not broken/unbalanced!""So, I found out I could get a Steam key and tried it again.The game is still essentially still broken/unbalanced because the stat system is terrible.There is really no plot to speak of and the only world building you get are little snippets here and there.The stat raising itself is garbage. You have the option to choose random dice to add up to a number without going over OR Auto Job, which just gives you a random outcome. Honestly, you'll just want to pick Auto Job everytime as it'll give you more favorable results.Speaking of! Of you do poor you get nothing, if you do average you get half and if you do Good you get the amount you are supposed to. Perfect I think nets you 1/3 more or something. Considering how bad the dice fail is, Average should net you the full amount with Poor netting you half as you'll be seeing POOR more often than not.STATS! It seems stats go up randomly if you get Average-Perfect and even then it seems that the stat gains are random as well, I've gotten perfects and have had 0 stat gain.ALSO BTW! You can have multiple events that steal your money, lower your health AND lower your stats. Stats you worked hard to raise through the crappy dice system or the meager wages you scraped up. So I'd often find myself taking 6 weeks or more just to recover from everything to Work/Train again.ROMANCE! SO the romance is based on random chance. As other's have said, you'll randomly encounter your love and then have to pick the right choice to make the meter go up. Fail to do so and you didn't pick the right choice.. I hope you can get that character to show up again. So really you'll be switching off the boys and girls in the options to incrase your chance of an encounter, or at least eliminate choices you don't want to appear.In the end, the game where everything is made up and points don't matter. No really the points just seem to be there to get you a second tier job and I don't think there is a third tier despite the graphics looking as if there are more tiers.Comparing this to Princess Maker 2 and Prince Maker Braveness (MSN2), it fails to do stat sim and romance decently.Using PM2 as an example, the marriage options were strewn throughout the game and the points were more or less used to get them. Want to marry the prince, talk to him every January and raise the Decorum, Social and such stats. Want to marry a dragon? Become a warrior and go on an adventure in the dragon ruins, thus all the combat stats go up. The prince is in the no time advancement Social menu, the dragon is on an adventure and there is yet even MORE people you can meet. There were things like talking to the character, going to town, talking to the palace people. Stuff that gave you a goal to focus on.Spirited Heart? There is no point to the stats. At least in Long Live the Queen the stats were useful to try and maybe stay alive (though that game has issues). You could try and focus on combat to war your way through the game or dancing and such to try and swocialite your way through the game. Magical Diary? Mandatory to get through the game (Even though a lot of spells were useless). The three character stats affected if you were going to romance anyone.There seems to be a sequel in the make, hopefully it will be better than this and actually try and emulate the games it seeks to copy from. It just seems here the person didn't 'get' what was fun about those games and thought kludging stats + romances without meshign them with a story in some way was going to work.			"

												Spirited Heart is a difficult game to recommend. Fans of dating and life management sims will no doubt be quickly immersed, but for everyone else, I doubt the game will maintain their interest. Although your character will always be female, you are allowed to choose three different races to choose from: human, elf, and demon. Each race has particular, inherent stats, and through the life choices you navigate, those stats are adjusted to create a custom character. I played through the game once with each race, and while I ended up with a demure elf and human, my demon was delightfully spunky. There is a full roster of individuals your character can date, including male and female options. The potential lovers are fantastically varied and interesting, but sometimes winning the affections of a particular person takes a little trial and error. You start the game as a adult who has just moved into her first apartment, and the game will end when one of a variety of endings is reached. The experience will either end when you reach the age of 30, when you get married, or when you fulfill the goal set by the goddess of your race. At a certain point in your life, the goddess will appear with a specific job goal for you, and if you meet it before the age of 30, she will grant you a wish, and this will trigger the end of the game. Much of the game comes down to spamming jobs. Jobs are completed by random dice rolls, and you must balance your character's work life with an appropriate amount of rest. Jobs earn you money which allow you to train skills, visit exotic locals which also increase skills, and pay taxes. The game indicates that if you have no money when it is time to pay taxes, you go to jail. Sometimes, random events such as bandit attacks will dramatically decrease your available currency, and at other times, you'll have the option to be charitable to a customer at a loss of money but with a reward of stat increases. While many of the stat increases feel arbitrary, they are actually beneficial -- depending on your career goal. If your career goal is outside of one of the stat categories, it is a good idea to ignore those options which pump unnessessary stats and focus on reaching your goal. If you are interested in a potential spouse centralized to one career path, then you will also be spamming that career to win their heart. Once your love interest confesses their attraction to you and you move in with them, you can navigate the game in such a way that you no longer have to visit that career option but still end up marrying them. After the first playthrough or two, you'll have the hang of the game. It is a delightful experience initially, but the fun wears down with necessary stat-pumping and job-spamming. I found myself clicking through all options as quickly as possible to get to the next random encounter, where I would hopefully progress the relationship I had been fostering. There's a lot of charm and terrific artwork to Spirited Heart, but the $20 price point feels unfair. This is a $5 experience and no more, so if you are interested in the romantic notions of a charming young girl, you will be well-advised to wait for a bundle or sale.			"

												This is a slice of life simulation in the vein of Magical Diary or Long Live the Queen; however unilke those games which are actually worth paying for, this one sadly, is not. While the world presented to you in the game is interesting you ultimately learn very little about it; there are three characters you can play as and many choices for each of them, but ultimately your choices are shallow and don't really matter much, as the game doesn't really differ based on what choices you make, and game play stays exactly the same whether you've mastered magic, or become a professional dominatrix. There are ten choices for romantic interests (five male, five female); but good luck getting with the one you want. Your relationship advances through a series of random events with the characters in question and you can go whole playthroughs without ever getting a random event with the lover you want to pursue. And then the romance system is basically bunk anyway. Your relationship is a gauge consisting of five hearts and the better your relationship the more hearts are filled... in theory. I had my romantic ""interest"" proposing to me at two hearts, and the only reason he was even my romantic interest is because he just happened to show up more often than the guy I actually wanted to pursue; and thus our relationship progressed farther... and I got sick of not getting any sort of events with the one I wanted. As I said; the game really isn't all that fulfilling, it's systems are pretty pointless and the only reason to gain stats is to get a better job... and the only reason to get a better job is to make money, and the only reason to make money is because the king takes a percentage of it every three months... and if you can't pay his tax you lose the game... The story does a poor job of driving along the stat grinding (which is fairly random whether your stats will even increase or not); and ultimately the game feels hollow and pointless. Sadly; I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Not worth the 19.99€,Hell, I paid 13.39€ and still isn't worth it by far...The job sistem is boring, and it's mostly what you are going to do, because There is no way you can save money in the game,which then you can only use to either to rest or to train stats, nothing else to buy.almost no story, the quest that the goddess give you are quite easy and silly.Totally not worth it.

												Spirited Hearts is a dispiriting life simulator with very little story. And what an awful world these Spirited Hearts inhabit! You spend most of the time directing which job your Spirited Heart will take each week. Poor work performance means you won't get paid - and work performance is determined by randomly choosing dice. A perfect opportunity for skill-based minigames is squandered. Even adequate performance results in half pay! Furthermore, work makes the Hearts physically ill, so much so that they must take a week's vacation every three weeks. Want to save for a nice vacation? Don't bother. Every quarter of the year, the government takes about 40% of their *savings* not *income*, so there is no incentive to accumulate money. Want to buy some special, magical items for your Spirited Heart to make the work grind less tedious? There are no items to acquire. But what about your race-specific special mission your goddess wants you to perform? Surely that must be amazing! Well, as a human wizard who had maxed out her magic skill, my goddess wanted to me to ... become a gardener. Let the adventure begin! Had I been given the option I would have selected ""Laugh in her face and tell her to buzz off.""Perhaps people who like this type of game will overlook its many, many flaws - everyone else should steer clear. I do not recommend it at any price.			"

												This game had a lot of potential. I loved the idea of choosing a character based on different stats and I have no problem with a stat raising VN. My issue with this game is the character interactions. One of the goals in this game is to find a potential romance. There are a lot of different characters to choose from, male and female, all of which have distinct personalties and spend their time in different areas. You raise your stats and interact with them to gain their affection, eventually leading to engagement and marriage. All of that sounds good, in theory, but the dialogue between the romancable characters is incredibly boring. A VN is just that, a novel. There should be a good amount of character building and interactions that make you feel something for the characters. There was none of that in this game. You barely speak to these characters, therefore making it nearly impossible to care about them at all. Once you're engaged, you speak to them even less (basically not at all). And, once you're married, the game ends. That's it. This game is a pretty bad example of visual novels and I'd highly recommend not wasting your money on it. It's possibly worth it, if it were on sale, but it would have to be a really big sale. All in all, don't waste your money or time. There are a lot of better VN's you can play for that price or even cheaper.			"

												I can't recommend this game. I usually ignore reviews, ignore what people say/think and try the game myself, but this just left me disappointed.You can chose one of three different ""characters"" with different advantages and disadvantages. Outside of that, leveling is by ""Dice rolls"" so it's random and a lot of times poor. It feels as if it's a clicking simulator that offers no depth. I hope things change, the game seemed to have some potential. Even the random ""love"" interests and encounters is boring. Nothing that drives me to keep trying (outside of achievements)			"

												This game has a good idea, but there is one simple game that makes this game unplayable and frustating. The way you do jobs is by rollin dice, which makes leveling up really random and slow. When you combinded that with taxes you have to pay, you will not have alot of money and find yourself grinding out jobs, not having fun.			"

												This game is fun, but pretty shallow.  There is very little story to it- essentially the game is about building your stats through training and working jobs so that you can get other jobs that pay better or raise other stats.  Only recommended if you can get it for under $5 or so.			"

												Another edit: I've been browsing the discussion for this game and the developer and a few others explained the pricing, which I suggest anyone iffy on it checks the explanation out. It makes the $20-$16 price tag a lot more understandable. Though it's always buyer's choice if they want to accept the explanation.Not worth this much money, I'd agree with scarletemerald and say that $5 is a better price for this. So there have been a few issues with text overlapping, and I feel like a system of scheduling a week's worth of activities at a time may have made it flow a little better (such as, choose Sun. and Sat. to rest, and put different jobs in for Monday-Friday). One of the biggest things is that you apparently can not act like a decent person as a demon. There is no warning that you have to sit here and either yell at a girl for getting scared by a bee or criticize (which ends up being yelling) her for getting scared by a bee. I would have really liked at least a warning, you noted demons are usually discriminated against but an addition there that they are usually mean would have cleared it up.Additionally the description for the work minigame was a bit confusing, the way it was written indicated that the totalled number was the number you were trying to match and did not mention the top number.And my last note, you've got token minority going on pretty hard here. It's great to see a game with straight and lesbian options but there's one nonwhite character out of 12. I don't expect a perfect split but it really would have given it a deeper level of diversity if there were maybe a few more.Gotta say though the design for the demon girl is cute as hell.Addition: I just got the Ria, Thofte, and Janimee collectable card things and I have not met these characters. The only ones I have met are Ramas, Yuza, Tmye, and Reid.			"

												I have not put much time as most into this game, however, I have still experienced it...It is not exactly one of Winter Wolves greatest games, if at all good. Spirited Heart Deluxe, lacks in several departments that could have potentially saved the game if it had been given more care. The core examples being both the plot and the characters;The plot is non-existant, you are merely thrown into the world with a very simple goal and whether you want to achieve it is up to you, it even has no real sense of meaning behind what you are actually doing.Even during my short playthrough, I questioned myself asking ""Why did I bother doing that?""It does not even award you for maxing out a stat or anything, you are merely left there, sulking because you have just wasted the past hour grinding a stat for no apparent reason. The Characters;I only activated some conversations with each characters, but even then it became apparent that they were not developed much. The game did not even delve into their characters backstories, or anything of the sort to try and make you connect with them, despite the fact that it could have and it could have been an actual great game. You would have better chances connecting with a brick wall, then with these characters, that don't have that much form of personality to them whatsoever. The game is not even saved by the gameplay;It relies on luck, or you can just save it before each job and cheat to get the perfect roll each time...and you have to KEEP on doing this, forever and ever until you have finally reached that stat number that you wanted...But it does not stop there.It carries on,and on.and on.If you were exposed to it for too long, you would probably go insane. I hope the sequel, if there is even going to be one.Will address these problems and turn Spirit Heart into a great game, that actually has story driven mechanics, great characters and tolerable gameplay.

												The worst example of a hero raising VN that I can think of.Almost every location is associated with a named, romancable character. Simply visiting that location and meeting them by chance will cause cheesy romantic music to start playing, give you two conversational choices to pick, likely improve your relationship score with them, and if you're lucky it might even increase a stat by a few points (of which you need a huge amount for it to even do anything).Every few days you will tell your character to take time for herself, to restore her health and emotional state, so she can continue to work. The money from your work is then used to pay for your time off or lessons which may or may not increase your stats a little faster than working, any you don't spend is removed due to monthly taxes. You will continue to unavoidably be forced into romancing whichever NPC happens to be in the location you need for stat increases. Sometimes these romantic encounters are things such as saying hello to a stranger, or being yelled at by your boss. Yes, the stranger and the boss in these circumstances are the 'romances'.The entire game is a grind like this, and if you wanted to pick a specific romantic partner, you better hope and pray that you knew what stats you had to train beforehand, otherwise you'll have extra hours of grinding just to start on their paths. While you can disable same-sex or opposite-sex romances to taste, this isn't an option given to you unless you go looking for it, and can be confusing when you find an abusive employer yelling at you to romantic music on your first few encounters.This all might be forgiven if you're just thirsty for (presumably non-existent) trashy anime sex and got this game for a dollar, but currently this is selling for £15 at the time of this review. Even if there is a better game under the initial hours of grinding somewhere, that's still hours you're spending in utter boredom.The only saving grace is the trading cards which you can use to regain some of your badly spent money.Only reccommended if you like buyers remorse :P			"

Also, it has 3 classes the demon chick is my favorite.The game play is based all on luck no skills require, meeting new love interest is a challenge, getting them to like you is easy. It's like finding waldo but waiting for him to find you.

There is no reward to a completely random system and that makes the game poorly designed.If you are looking for a game like this one I highly recommend you go looking elsewhere for this is simply put... a disappointment and a waste of money.

												Spirited Heart is a tedious game with a lot of grinding. It's not worth playing even if you pick it up in a bundle like I did. It's definitely not worth the $20 price point. The randomness of the jobs system (roll some die and see how you did!) is frustrating not only because it's so random, but because if you do poorly at a job you don't get paid at all, and if you do an average job you only get half pay. In what universe do people get paid like this? This system would be OK if it was at least embedded in a complex, satisfying story, but none of the romance storylines is well-written or interesting, and the endings aren't particularly satisfying. You'll just be grinding away to get a particular ending, and then be disappointed when it comes.This game is a waste of your time. If you're looking for a Princess Maker 2-style game, I'd suggest picking up Hanako's Cute Knight or Cute Knight Kingdoms.			"

tl;dr Underdeveloped characters, annoying lack of foresight with dialogue options, shallow gameplay when compared to other current and older life sims, Not worth $20 even for diehard fans of the genre.Spirited Heart is basically a Princess Maker type sim game with some benefits over the de-facto version (PM2), but those benefits don't make up for the things it's lacking.There's a lot less variety, which is honestly sort of surprising considering the amount of jobs and the three species you can play as. Jobs seem to lead only into getting skill points used for the goddess quests or to meet and marry characters you're interested in. There are only a handful of random events I've seen playing through the game 3 times and most of them are negative, which isn't bad on its own, but seeing them repeat over and over is frustrating.The romance aspect of the game was part of the appeal for me when I went to buy this, but, well, it's very shallow. A lot of lovers? Awesome. Same sex lovers, and just as many as the guys? Even better. Sadly, the characterization of the npcs you can pursue is... just not there. It's the equivalent of making a character out of cardboard, then taking the cardboard away so all there is is invisible tape. What I saw of the romance options strayed from the typical cliches, which was nice! But you just don't get to spend enough time with them to really get to know them beyond some superficial personality traits. The most connected I got to a character was the elf mage guy, and (spoilers i guess) he goes off and cheats on you in the epilogue. And, well, he was kind of a flirtatious guy, but that wasn't his entire personality and there was absolutely zero interactions with him with other characters that would have tipped me off. I felt like the game was somehow  punishing me for its lazy writing.Speaking of that, some of the dialogue options do the opposite of what you think they'd do. i know this is par for the course with a lot of VN and sim games, just sayin', I never felt like making one totally not my fault at all ♥♥♥♥up in Katawa Shoujo or Hatoful Boyfriend or Magical Diary or anything screwed my chances at a character. I say something that seems like the better option, my character says something else on accident and I have the route locked off to me forever. Lovely. Thankfully I could save anytime, but this kind of one strike and you're out gameplay decisionmaking is ridiculous and has no reason to exist aside from, ahem, laziness.The UI wasn't difficult to use most of the time, but it was unattractive, your mileage may vary.I'd say the best things about Spirited Heart would have to be the same-sex romance and amount of romanceable characters, and the character creation options, and sadly not much else. I had high hopes for this game, as I often hear Winter Wolves tossed around with names such as Hanako Games, Otome-X and sakevisual, whose work I've loved (and iirc Otome-X was part of WW for a while) I'm a life sim, nut, and the kind of person who spends an entire day on Long Live the Queen without realizing it, but sadly, me and Spirited Heart just weren't meant to be. A waste of $20, IMO.Verdict:I'd recommend even the most die-hard of stat raising sim and f/f romance fans stay away from this one unless it goes on sale. It's really not worth the money. I probably won't come back to it unless I'm really at a loss for stuff to play.Highest price I'd buy it for: $5.Try Instead:Long Live the Queen (The Dark Souls of life sims)Princess Maker 2 (The game this is based on, you can get the DOS version online for free)RE:Alistair++ (Free stat raising dating sim with a female protag. Actually any of Sakevisual's free stuff, but I can't vouch for the quality of the others)Magical Diary (Stat raising/school sim game with some puzzles and two F/F romance routes)			"

												This is an intriguing game. While it is brought to Steam by Winter Wolves, there are some indications on-line that it might have been produced by another company. Though, whether simply a previous name, or a company acquired in some way... I am unsure.Thing is, it has some of the hallmarks of a Winter Wolves game, though not as polished. The game has a sort of stat management, and leads to a myriad of endings. There is likely an ending if you don't acquire anything else by the time you reach 30, but otherwise... well, there are a lot of options. Let's start with that you can play as a human, elf, or demon girl of 18. There are a number of romanceable NPCs for you to pursue. Two of each race and gender. For those not willing to do the math, that means 12 options, 6 male, 6 female. You can woo them by first meeting them in a basic job, and then in a separate advanced job (some of the romance options double up in the basic jobs, and each meeting is a random event). After passing three meetings in each stage (successfully) , there are a pair of cutscenes afterwards that, if done correctly, means you become engaged. From there, you have to take time to talk to them, and maybe take them on trips before they propose.There is a special event that happens shortly after you reach 22. The matron goddess of your race decides to visit you and gives you a task to gain a certain title. If you do acquire that title by the time you are 30, you succeed at the ""Goddess Ending"" for your race. Note that you can either find love, or fulfill your deity's request, not both.This game is a bit of a time sink, but it is still fun.Just realized the city you play in is named Aravorn, which apparently might also be the name of a kingdom/continent/world... It is also part of the title of some Winter Wolves products, as in Tales of Aravorn.			"

												Based on the poor reviews, I was expecting Spirited Heart: Deluxe to be utterly unplayable. I was pleasantly surprised to find that, though not without several problems, it's not nearly that bad. While not the best raising sim I've ever played, it's certainly not the worst, and it even does some interesting things with the format. I'd say its biggest flaw is that it's very old, and thus, obviously the work of a young developer. It lacks polish, but it's got some heart.THE GOODI played through a few of the romance paths and for the most part they were really quite sweet, if a little rushed toward the endEach player character has her own personality that alters the available dialogue options and reactions of NPCs; the human is sort of the girl next door, the elf is kind and sensitive, the demoness is snarky and kind of mean. It's a pretty nifty feature, even if the characterizations aren't super original.In a similar vein, you can select your character's background and shape her skills through a short set of questions (think like Fallout: New Vegas' ink blot tests and vigor tester.)Your character's goals are randomized every time you play, which means you get a new experience with every game.You have the option to toggle love interests on or off by gender, so if you want to play your character as a particular sexual orientation, you canWith several marriage and career endings to attain, it's got quite a bit of replayabilityTHE MEDIOCREThe art style is all over the place. Some of it is pretty good, some of it is...not, and the differences are quite jarring. An update to make things more consistent would be lovely.Stats are raised using a mini-game that's basically Black Jack but with dice instead of cards, and a randomized goal number rather than 21. If you're good at balancing odds in your head, this isn't a problem; if you're not, it's going to get old fast. There's an exploit, though, that allows you to fix each poor result: scrolling back with your mouse wheel reverses time in-game, so if you're dedicated, you can get a perfect score each time.Randomized events that are unavoidable can sometimes occur, draining some of your hard earned stat points. Some have dialogue options that may allow for a good result, but many don't and this can be frustrating.The writing isn't fantastic, but it's mostly pretty inoffensive and serves its purpose. The game would definitely benefit from a rewrite to make some of the dialogue feel more natural/less stilted.THE BAD:A couple of the relationships available have unhealthy undertones that bother me a bit. Your character can get slapped around by one of the potential love interests when she's upset with you, and that...does not make me want to romance her, to be quite honest. Another love interest may sexually harass you, depending on your dialogue choices, and still another may threaten your life and hold you at knife point, which is also annoying.There are two difficulty modes, normal and easy, but these labels are not accurate. Easy is fairly challenging, normal is extremely difficult.Stat points that you earn through jobs or classes are determined randomly. You may get +3, +1, +5 or +0, depending on your luck. The same is true of your character's salary, though that depends on how your dice mini-game goes.The price is too high. $19.99 for Spirited Heart, as-is, is far too steep. HOWEVER, if it got a rewrite and better art, I'd say that was fair.All that said: I grabbed this game on sale for half price, and I don't regret that, though I can see why somebody else might feel differently. If you're unsure, there's a demo floating around, so give that a look before buying it. It's an okay game, with good bones, that just doesn't quite live up to its potential. I look forward to seeing how its sequel will improve on the less-than-stellar bits.7/10			"

												Recommended, but with strong reservations. I wish there was a choice between ""yes"" and ""no"".  I've played through twice, once as a download, once through Steam.Pros:* It's a Princess Maker-alike raising sim, and there aren't enough of them.* Art is nice and clean, in an anime influenced Western style.* Lots of stats to raise* As many same-sex romantic endings as opposite sex* I enjoy the intital stats-setting quizCons:* The work dice game is frankly horrible,* It doesn't provide the challenge of a good raising sim. Romantic endings are incredibly easy to achieve, and so are Goddess endings, even if you've spent the game up to that point chasing completely different stats* The Goddess eandings bear no relationship to what you've done in the game. My character was a builder, a smith, a dancer and a priestess, with teh title of Merchat--what in all that suggests that her true wish was to be a nature goddess?* Not enough achievements and, as far as I can see, endings.* Why does my noble born elf use such sloppy grammar? Why does she say she's just moved into town when she's lived there three years?So, if you like riainsg sims, this is an attractive looking one and has the built in compulsiveness. I just wish there was more challenge, and more sense of controlling the PC's destiny. And oh, I loathe that dice game.			"

												First off, I know  it says I haven't played a lot on this game, but I have done a lot of offline time too.I like dating Sim games. Just in general. I have a very varying taste of games and this can give me everything I want in a casual gaming setting. It takes time and it has different endings depending on what you level up and go for. This game is one of the better ones I have done and it never gets old.Pros:Various endingsA big variety of charactersBeing able to pick your character and their statsBeing able to do Yuri options tooVery tacticalCons:The graphics kind of suck in my opinionIt is time consumingIf you don't know what you're doing you'll fail so it will take two or three play throughs			"

												This game has lots of endings, which I love in a visual novel. However, it has one major flaw.NOT ENOUGH ACHIEVEMENTS!!!When you come across a game with multiple endings you'd like there to be an achievement for each of them. This not only helps you keep track of which ones you've done, but also encourages you to do them all. However, it only has achievements for the three goddess endings. This was a real let down, for me anyway.And because there are so few achievements, and a lot of it is kind of repetitive, I didn't really have any incentive to go back to it after that last goddess ending.This game was a bit of a disappointment. However, it was packed with humour and some very heart warming moments.So, yeah if you're looking for something not too challenging and has some good points I'd say give it a shot.Just not at full price.

												okay yes i recommend it but only on these conditions for those of u who r new to sim dates get on sale, your bored and dont feel like playing a game that requires wasd and uve run out of good point and clicks,  u have patience, and u have the guide ready.Trust me the game can be fun, but ussually under these cycumstances. I was bored when i got it and it kept me occupied until i found something else to do. So yeah it can be cool, i did like it, and it is better then some sims out there but that was only because i was interested in seeing how each romance was for each kind of female you can be. I am a completionist so i played each route and got each romance for the elf, demon , and human. It was kind of worth it because i liked the story and i could ignore the tedious parts of the game for the story. Yet even then i still got tired of it and moved on, so its up to you if you want to risk it or not. But seriously get it on sale.			"

												I have no idea why I stopped meeting people after she hit 20. May be they have unlock requirements? For the next 8 years I was just hitting ""Repeat job"" button endlessly with a few thief attacks to which I replied by using illusions??I had received a quest from a ""Godess of elves"" at 22 which I proceeded to ignore as she wanted me to train skills that were entirely off from what I trained up until that point.Other than that I have found no way to reach any of the game's romancable characters. I met some at 18-20 but I couldn't reach them even after I tried coming back to those jobs where I met them...So overall I think this game is overpriced. It wants you to play it the way its meant to be played by the developer and not the way you want to play it. Or at least it won't give you any content if you just do what you want.Oh and PS at Magic skill 100 - I maxed out as a wizard and was still getting paid only 20-30 gold a week. Which was disappearing very quickly thanks to 40% TAX! :( I also spent the rest of the money training different skills hoping to unlock more characters, but was unsuccesful in unlocking anyone.			"

												Are you a fan of anime-style life simulation games? Buy Spirited Heart Deluxe ONLY when it's on sale - $20 is at least twice what it's worth. Play Spirited Heart Deluxe ONLY when you have run out of other sims to play - you'll be disappointed if you have high expectations for it. The game mechanics are clunky. The character interactions are interesting, but they come few and far between the many days of skill-grinding. Overall, it's mildly sorta fun, but not really. As soon as I reach the end, I'm uninstalling.If you're not a fan of anime-style life simulation games, don't even bother.			"

												Wow! Just finished my first playthrough, and I must say I am truly taken by this game. The challenge of managing your personal growth alongside your physical health, mental health and finances is not something I have seen in any other game before. Leveling up skills suddenly strikes a much more personal chord when a botched day at work leaves you depressed and exhausted and wishing that you could afford to take a vacation to recuperate. (Almost sounds too real, doesn't it?!)Everything you do has repercussions elsewhere in the game: the stats you gain pursuing one job have applications in other places, and sometimes a skill can turn out to be useful in an unexpected situation. My whole experience with the game felt very smooth and organic, and I could never predict what was going to happen next.Dialogue and narrative in individual events tends to be short and sweet, but long-term character development can happen over the course of multiple events. What's more, the wide breadth of options and possibilites adds a huge amount of replay value.Try this game out: it's definitely worth treating yourself to something new!			"

												First of all I recommend it for BEGINNERS to discover what a dating-simulation game is, technically speaking and to easily satisfied primal love relationships.There are good definitions of the lexicon, various skills as a good basis for a next game. At the start it’s cool, choose your race, social background and whatever it is you fall in the social ladder. You must work on raising stats on abilities to work better and have more income. You have dumb leisures on week-ends and better ones when you can afford it. You can flirt with someone or try to romance until the wedding. Very repetitive game play (boring dice to each task), the endings are composed of a few common sentences like “they came to live together, the woman works with her lover”. I'ts disappointing to see 2-3 screenshots as an ending. Having bought male romances, here I got female for free but I’m not interested in doing them.There’s no music so you feel like just clicking and reading some here and there.The dev did much better games then for sure ;)			"

Product received for free
												While I enjoy the game, the store description is so vague that it doesn't really tell you how little you really interract with your life. Yes, you have a job, but you don't actually play the job, you roll dice to see the outcome of if you did well or not that  day. Yes, you can ""choose"" a partner, but it seems very rare to come across others characters, let alone people you like and want to come across. Yes, there is tons of replayability, but each game will only last you somewhere between 2-3 hours. You also do not customize your character at all, you choose from 3 options. I certainly would not say this game is worth $20, I was lucky to have it gifted to me by a friend. Yes I enjoy the game, but buyer beware, make sure it's what you actually want before you get it.

												I thought I was gonna like this game.... and I guess I kinda do, but still.... TEH GRINDING. WTF. I wish Steam would let me pick a neutral rating b/c I have enjoyed parts of it.... so thumbs up there. But it's also been a pedantic, pain in the ars.e to play too. So thumbs down at the same time. Hence my neutral feels. I will mark it negative for now I guess.... ;___; Sorry WW....I like your other games tho. But yeah... some of the characters are really endearing, but most are just annoying asf. Reid? (Makes me think of bug spray LOL) she was really hawt, yah, but her personally really sucked. Same with the hawt demon tailor chick. She had potential. I guess the dev was goin for dominatrix vibez with her? She was just a c.u.nt. Pardon my French... Yana was the only character I felt for, and even then, it was difficult to progress beyond more than 1 heart for her....mostly due to LACK OF RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. Protip: Easy Mode is still brutal. Cannot fathom playing Normal mode unless there's something I am missing here regarding game mechanics (??)Guy-wise, the only dude who I sorta kinda liked was Frebo, but it was frustrating b/c I wanted to talk to him more and the damn game wouldn't let me. I kept doing the Schoolgirl job route...to try to talk to him.....but I never got random encounters with him, just tons with that annoying demon girl Hade (how in the frack do you pronounce that name anyway? Hay-dee? Hay-day? @_@;;) She was the flattest character ever... at least from my brief interaction. Emphasis on brief. tl;dr Game seems more focused on stat building than relationship building. If you're an accountant, you may get a massive number-boner from this game. Otherwise... meh.PS: I did notice a minor flaw in the programming of this game.... I met the male demon character in the bar when I was working as a waitress, and then I saw him a 2nd time working as a maid, and on my 2nd encounter, the game had no idea I already met him once before, so it was the same kinda introduction-y stuff all over again. Would suggest somehow making it trigger something once you meet a character so you don't re-introduce.... but IDK how hard that is to do, code-wise. Just a suggestion/honest feedback!!PPS: Minor gripe here but wish we could change the MC's hair color/eye color/outfit/etc. My elf girl looked like she was living in the '80s in a bad way for most of this game, LOL. :-P			"
