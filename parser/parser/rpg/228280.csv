												The original Baldur's Gate is one of my favourite games, second only to its successor and is a game any rpg fan must play. Due to its art style for a game that came out in 1998 it still holds up well today. Graphically this game still looks beautiful due to 2d painting-esque backdrops and thirdperson isometric viewpoint.The gameplay also has an incredible amount of depth to it and the combat is very tactical and varied depending on the class you play and the party setup you choose. The game is also from an era when games were unforgiving and actually provided the player with a challenge. The combat is similar to Dragon Age: Origins where it can be free-flowing and action oriented but it is highly recommended that players take it slowly and utilise pausing to setup properly between rounds during combat.The game being built upon the ruleset of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons has a lot of depth to classes and the classes will all playout and feel very different which offers a lot of replayability ontop of just choosing and adhering to different alignments.Also due to the game being built upon AD&D and being set in a D&D realm the game has an incredible amount of history and backstory in there that the world feels real and is incredibly dark and gritty which ties in great with the dark tones of the main story.Without spoiling too much of the story it starts with very humble beginning and quickly thrusts the player into a world descending into turmoil with bandits and bad guys wanting to kill you at every turn you must uncover the sinister plot that is unfolding and discover your own dark heritage in the process.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game although I will warn that there is a lot of reading involved and that the combat is designed to played slowly (unlike diablo and games of its ilk) and very tactically but for those that love a game with a great story this game is undoubtedly one you should play.

												I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...Before IT happened.The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more. Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.--HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS---Implementation of the old character and save game formatting-Option to use the old UI-Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.--Things that COULD help--- Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.			"

												Baldur's Gate - A 16 year old game stands up to the test of time, and it's co-op!So during the steam summer sale, a friend of mine bought me Baldur's Gate 1(Enhanced Edition) so we could play together(the 4 pack was 20 bucks). 6 months later, we had never played together once so I finally decided that I wanted to play, so I played it solo.Now there's a few things you should know about Baldur's Gate. The game was originally released in 1998. I played it while I was in high school my senior year. It introduced a LOT of new people to Dungeons & Dragons. It's a 3rd person isometric RPG in which you control all members of your party. It's paused based(instead of turn based), which means that when combat starts, you pause, issue commands, unpause, wait for something to happen, pause again, issue commands, etc, etc. There are lots of games with that type of system now, but as far as I know, BG was the first.So the way you're -supposed- to play it solo is to create one character and go along recruiting AI NPCs to join your party of up to six. Well you can get around all that by playing in multiplayer mode by yourself. Multiplayer mode lets you create all six party members and tweak them to your desire. You can also export/import different characters at any time. You can easily get away with this from an RP(roleplaying) perspective by saving your game in an inn and swapping party members in and out saying ""Oh I met this guy at this inn"". So to start with, I created my own party of 3: Human Fighter(me), Paladin, and Cleric, then I pick up NPCs along the way. Not completely satisfied with the NPCs in game, I finished the game with 5/6 party members self generated, and only one in-game NPC(Yeslick the Dwarven Fighter/Cleric). If you enjoy character creation and tweaking things and micromanaging party members, gear, stats, and other RPG elements, this game is definately for you.Lets talk about the story. This is where the game really drew a lot of people in. For those of you that have already played, you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone that may play the game in the future(even if it IS 16 years old), but it's a great, great story that lets you choose your own path. Of course my path is that of the good soldier fighting for... well... good. But if you enjoy the darker side of things, it's always allowed, which a lot of games give you trouble doing. You can lie, cheat, steal, and murder and still complete the game.Oftentimes now that I'm in my 3rd decade of life, I've gone back and tried to play games from my childhood that I remember really enjoying, and graphically none of them have stood up to the test of time(X-Com, Doom, etc). Since all of the assets in BG are more or less hand drawn and the enhanced edition lets you play at your native resolution, the game still looks pretty damn good, especially amidst the recent indy dev 8 bit gaming boom. So graphically, it passes the test. The environments are pretty freakin cool too. A whole lot of unique, hand drawn areas that I had forgotten about since I first played a long time ago that made me say ""huh, cool"" when I came across them recently.And now let's talk difficulty. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game hard. It's been so long since I've played a game that didn't just blatantly hold my hand and coddle me the whole way through I'd forgotten what it's like to play a game that punishes you. AD&D 2.0 core rules are a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ and completely unforgiving. There are 5 difficulty levels in the game:-Easy - Everything does half damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Normal - Everything does 75% damage, all hit point gains per level are maximized, and characters can't permanently die.- Core Rules - Everything does 100% damage, hit point gains are randomized(so you can get as little as 1 hp/level on your badass front-line fighter that needs ~10 hp/level), and characters can permanently die.- Hard - Everything does 150% damage- Insane - Everything does 200% damage and you are a satan worshipping masochistI may have added that last little part on the insane bit.So being the badass gaming veteran I am, I of course choose Core Rules. I understand what THAC0 is, I know what the different classes are, I know how to D&D. I'm good.Or so I thought.I'm actually not as good as I had thought. I had to do a LOT of fights multiple times because Jesus Christ, this game can be hard. Mostly with the crowd control abilities the enemies get(note - If you fight against a group that has a mage, KEEP YOUR PARTY SPREAD OUT just like in ArmA). A lot of times I'd get hit with an AoE fear or confuse or stun, etc, etc, etc. It could be infuriating, but I kept re-loading and going at the fights in different manners from different angles, and analyzing my party and their abilities and switching things around until finally, at the end of the game, I had SOME sort of idea of what I was doing... I thought... until the final battle.Let's just say that the final battle in Baldur's Gate had me curled up in a fetal position in the corner of my room praying to Torm asking him what I had done so poorly to have been punished so badly.So somewhere between 20 and 50 attempts later, I managed to defeat the final boss and win the game. I even had to google strategies for the final boss. I actually felt a sense of accomplishment like I haven't felt in a game in a long, long time. The funny part is, 17 year old me beat the game in 1998 without the internet for guidance. I have NO CLUE how I managed that feat.So I immediately went to steam and bought Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition, even though it's not on sale, and started a new game. This time, however, I'm playing on normal mode. It seems to be a much better balance of playability vs difficulty. I've still lost some fights, but I've learned a whole damn lot and built my party around the strengths needed.I have a Cavalier paladin because he: 1. Can't be feared, charmed, mind controller, or poisoned; and 2. He can make the entire party immune to fear pretty much all the time. He's also a badass tank alongside my main character which is a frontline fully maximized fighter with sword and shield. I also have a pure Dwarven Cleric, Fighter/Thief, Fighter/Mage, and Dragon Disciple Sorcerer. I dual classed the Thief and Mage with Fighter bases so they could use longbows for good DPS instead of being relegated to a shortbow and a sling. The nice side to that is that they get fighter HP for their first 7 levels so they're pretty beefy on top of it all.I just pretend(roleplay) that my entire group is a squad of trained military soldiers that have been sent on a mission, so they almost all have that base fighter class from their military training.So I have 2 tanks(FIghter/Cavalier Paladin), a pure healing Cleric, and 3 pure DPS(Thief/Mage/Sorcerer). But don't be fooled, that fighter and paladin can put out some melee hurt too. The cleric is really the only non-dps class. Oh... Make sure you -always- have a thief in your party with the script that makes him passively detect traps. Trust me on this. You don't necessarily need a thief/rogue that can stealth, but you damn sure need one that can detect/disarm traps and pick locks.And on that note, there are pre-set scripts that you can use for each character. There are about 20 for all the different classes in the game to mess around with. I pretty much have my whole group on the standard ""I see an enemy and attack with my equipped weapon"", except for my rogue, who is set to always passively detect traps when not in combat, and my cleric who is set to dynamically run around and heal. I micromanage everything else(mage spells mostly).Read the rest of this review here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Jester814/discussions/0/648817377413793428/ "

												Not much enhanced here - if anything the game is dehanced because of hamfisted changes to the UI which remove a lot of the fantastical charm the original Baldur's Gate had and replace it with an ugly, mostly black one (no more stylized dropcaps at the beginning of item/book/weapon/gem descriptions, tacky black backgrounds behind tooltips (instead of the charming scroll that used to appear), popup speeches during action scenes, and journal entries, ability to scroll off the maps and see blackness which cuts off the on-map scenery, etc etc etc). They have also decided to not include their own version of a detailed, colored map seen here from the TuTu mod

			Baldur's Gate, released in 1998 by Bioware and Interplay. I'm playing this game modded. I'm using the TuTu mod to enable me to play the game with the Baldur's Gate 2 engine.		

 Instead, they used the original bland, tan parchment paper map with the added feature of immersion-breaking font!Feels much more like a fan-mod with mediocre (and sometimes anti-intellectual sjw) writing (or removal of writing *cough* Safana's dialogue has been erased in favor of vacuous, humdrum scribbling *cough*) instead of work on the same level of greatness that was the original Baldur's Gate.I'm still going to play it so I can transfer my character to Siege of Dragonspear and play through the rest of the series, but if this is the team that will be making Baldur's Gate 3 if they get enough funding for it, my expectations will definitely not be high. I wish there was a one thumb up and one thumb down mixed option for steam games. If there was I'd choose that instead of a thumb down. The game is still good, but many of the changes push it away from being great.			"

												I had just gotten back into Baldurs Gate and was loving the experience. I had never beated BG1 upon its release many years ago, and I was enjoying going through the world before BG2. Right as I got into the swing of things they released the update today 3/31/16. The character models look chartoonish, the journal now pops up, items now obscenly flash their stats if you even pick them up in your inventory for a second. It seems dumbed down and thats unfortunate. If there was a option as a previous reviewer mentioned, of reverting back to the old format, I have no doubt I would again enjoy this game and look forward to completing the saga. As it stands now I own't be playing until that's an option. And as I paid for both games, and the product has vastly changed, I feel slightly cheated.			"

												Bought for Siege of Dragonspear. Game is unplayably buggy in Multiplayer. Over an hour to manage to even open a game in way that every player actually has gear instead of an empty inventory. Game crashes every time I save in multiplayer. Switching hosts the game now refuses to unpause for me. So everytime the game is saved or otherwise paused, I can not unpause until another player talks to an NPC which unpauses the game. Restarting the game fixed it. Continued playing only to discover that the key ring is buggy and any keys added to it just disappear....Don´t buy this broken mess if you have any intention of playing with friends. Singleplayer seems to work so far.			"

It will crush the game and you won't load it anymore.What to do if you already bought the game and caused the crash: write to the support and wait... Wait... Wait...			"

												Great game...when it works.  I currently have 24 hours ""played"" and of that 24, approximately 5-7 are actually playing the game with a friend.  It's currently a mess when trying to play co-op, which is the only reason I purchased the enhanced edition.  2+ hours attempting to get ONE GAME working.  This isn't a one off either, each time we try to play it takes 30+ minutes just to get the game functioning for both of us.  Either one of us crash or he's kicked out of the game (""multiplayer session terminated"") for no apparent reason.  We both left the game paused when not playing just to avoid having to go through this again, and guess what happened?  Yup, we left the area and the game tried to autosave...he got kicked right out of the game with the beloved ""multiplayer session terminated"" message.  We tried again, leaving the game open after it worked (our longest play-session so far has been 2 or 3 hours before a problem), and it crashed when auto-saving.  This is over a LAN network as well...If/When these multiplayers problems are fixed, I will definitely change my review to positive.  Until then, I can't recommend this game, especially if you're looking to play with friends.Edit: Been playing some more. Encountered a bug that prevented my co-op partner from moving. Seems to have occurred after I interacted with an npc. His screen goes gray and he can't move until I talk to an npc.  Occurs (e.g. his screen goes gray and he can't move even after unpausing etc.) when transitioning to a new area, pausing for battle, and saving the game.We had to exit out of the Baldur's Gate and start the reconnect game again to fix it.Edit 4/16/16:Game was patched and now connecting and staying connected is no longer a problem.  Looks like they broke something else though.  Can't play co-op AT ALL without the save game being corrupted.  This is with cloud saves off.  I tried hosting and my game now crashes when entering a new area after the update...no matter what save I use.  I tried joining a co-op game with my friend and we were able to play up until beregost, then every time he tried to save the game crashed ME, not the host.  Started a new game.  Played until Beregost.  Game randomly corrupted all the save files (quick saves, manual saves, etc.)... except the save at the very beginning.  I'm done with this broken game.  Wish I could request a refund, but unfortunately I'm stubborn and tried to actually have fun and play the game...of the approximately 40 hours on record now, I believe 15-20 were actually playing the game.  The rest was idle time or trying to fix the myriad of problems.			"

												October 2016 I have worked with Beamdog on several occasions on trying to get this game to work properly and have gotten frustrated and will not be trying anymore on getting it to work. I give up on my beloved game!!! Nothing they had me try worked properly unless I created characters excatly the way they wanted them created. If I created one the way I wanted it I still could not use weopons for a fighter etc. This is very dissappointing. I still have many crashes and still am not able to get out our candle keep.I will be seaking other games to play.May 23 2016 Gave beamdog files to look at and find out what is going wrong with the game still no word on why my game will not work. I was informed they are looking into it. Although they could not recreate the issues I was having so I had to send them my files.New Edit  May 18 2016: just downloaded the update, still broken, still not fixed, do not waste your money on this game, nothing is fixed..... As far as people telling me how to fix my game that do not have info showing they are developer by their Icon Badge or do not have any level of play time for BG EE, I am not sure If I should trust someone like this telling me how to change setting on my computer etc. If others choose to do this that is your choice.New Edit May 2016: BG EE Still Broke!!!! So Disappointed  After Illydth comments I did a unistall of steam and reinstall of steam and a complete reinstall of game and verified the game files and still cannot play the game it still crashes. None of the bugs below are fixed and Fighters still cannot use weopons. What good is a fighter if they cannot use any weopons but a quarterstaff or a club! Also I cannot even make it out of Candle Keep when starting a new game. I have posted screenshots on this in the community hub for all that think this is a bluff.New Edit: I have still not seen any fixes for the problems I am experiencing with Playing my game BG EE since the update. I am so sad. Fighters cannot use any weopons this makes it hard to fight if you cannot have any weopons..........I really Love This Game BG EE, and would play it for hours on a PC. I am in a delema I want to play and cannot enjoy it anymore. Since the update that was installed on April 1, 2016, which I could not stop. Here are just a few of the problems I have noticed.- Game Crashes more times than I can throw a stick at it.- Characters are cartoonish -  Beta version Fighters cannot use any weopons -  I Get achievements for things I have not even done in Lands I have not even been to. And my old Achievements are all gone being replaced by things I have not done.-  Map scroll is all messed up- Multiplayer games on steam cloud network are unable to access for all the hours worked on.- Multiplayer join does not work- Many more issues, too many to remember- It appears that the updates were more for people using handheld devices than real pc gamers like myself according to Beamdog's website.   Quote from their site on update: “Enjoy text and dialogue selection features optimized for smaller screens, as well as numerous other improvements.”I really wish there was an option to roll back my game to the original without this update until they get the bugs worked out so I would have lost all my hard work and over 300 hours of game play.  I understand there is a need to fix the bugs and update at times, but this one caused me more problems than I can count.  I want my Loved Game Back. Please hurry with the fixes so I can get back to playing my game.			"

												This remake/remix is actually worse then original: - Crashed on me more times during single play session than oryginal during whole playthrough.- Interface worse than oryginal- Black pits -new adventure that is not the part of the main game A.K.A ultra easy mode where you can bump a character to level 9-10, equip it with very powerfull items  and then import to main game starting with uber character- Costs twice as much as original saga.+Only upside in my opinion is the possibility to play in high resolution and added graphic zoom in/out functionality.Was expecting stable remake with some graphic enhancement but got unstable game in which I have to quick save every 5 minutes to have any miningfull progress.

												I'll keep this short and sweet.  This is no longer the Baldur's Gate that we remember and love.  If you want to play something that is not the vanilla version of BG1 or BG2, then use some of the many, FREE, STABLE, mods that have been available for years.Sorry to advertise for someone else on here, but go to GOG.com... it's cheaper, and better, and then grab EasyTuTu and something like the Gibberlings3 Tweaks (just don't go too nuts with all the tweak options)The only reason I have this version that I have tried is from a friend losing the original copy of the game after I had loaned it to him, so he paid for this to replace it.

I have been very happy to drop cash on this company and its great reworked versions of these games. But somehow the latest update (the new expansion) has broken multiplayer. I used to play BG: EE multiplayer with a friend, and now neither of us can reliably connect to the other's game. It's unacceptable... Please patch this right away!			"

												Baldur's Gate was the first RPG that could capture the essence of table top roleplaying experience. The Enhanced Edition allowed me to relive the original expirience with enough new material te keep things interesting. It is based on the AD&D rules and thus can be a bit confusing to new platers. Overall very entertaining both for new and experienced players.			"

												Baldur's Gate is truly a masterpiece. Despite it's beauty, tactical depth and great story, the game does not take itself too seriously. This cannot be said of many other leading RPG titles, which I soon begin to find rather corny. If you like RPGs and have not played Baldur's Gate, then this is an absolute must, you do not even need to waste your time reading this review but of course you are welcome to. If you have played the original BG and are curious about Beamdog's boob job, I share with you my opinion.The original game's two main lackings are native widescreen support and Linux support (I use Ubuntu/Mint). Interestingly, the Steam store lists BGEE as a Windows/Mac title, while BG2EE is listed as Windows/Mac/Linux. Both titles run perfectly on Linux since the latest patches.The reason for me to buy Beamdog's re-release was simply curiosity. Where would anyone find the guts to mess with this classic work of art? What would they change about it?First looks and User InterfaceMy first impression of BGEE was honestly not that great. It was still before Linux support was added. The aesthetics just turned me off. The changed logo, the sword with the text ""Enhanced Edition"", the user interface which had it's old-skool goldish buttons replaced with red ""open-missile-silo-doors""-buttons. It all just took away some of the original game's magic. Perhaps mostly nostalgic feelings on my part.Once hours inside the game the UI didn't really bother me anymore. Since recent updates, I was pleasantly surprised by the ""Quick loot""-button that was added to the bottom panel. This made looting a whole lot easier, since it is no longer necessary to check all the corpses individually for good loot, potions, scrolls, etc.More aestheticsNot only the UI has had a makeover. The movies are also replaced. The new ones are not 3d-animated like the old ones. The new movies are built from nice artistic drawings. The drawings look really good and are accompanied by the trusty old sounds of the original game.The character models have also been updated, though they are still not 'HD'. The pre-rendered environments are still the same as in the original BG. These were already stunningly beautiful anyway, no need to make changes there.GameplayThere are some major changes to the gameplay. Characters are now created in the same fashion as in BG2. This means that not only can one choose from various classes, but many classes have kits to choose from, with each its own abilities and restrictions. Also, the Half-Orc is now a playable race as in BG2. Weapon proficiencies are also updated to the BG2 standard, which means that the points are no longer put into groups of weapons (for example there used to be one group of large swords, containing two-handed, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and long swords and another group of blunt weapons, containing staves, maces, clubs and hammers). The new system forces you to choose specific weapons, thus making switching between various weapons in the same group impossible if you have not spent any points on the other weapon. Because of the relatively low level cap in BG1, you will find each character using one or two types of weapons throughout the whole game. This is not a problem, but it is a significant deviation from the original. The weapon styles from BG2 have also been added. This new proficiency system works really well at the higher character levels achieved in BG2, but has minor shortcomings in a game where characters reach level 8-10 and thus do not have too many points to spend.Two-Weapon FightingAs mentioned before, the weapon styles from BG2 have been imported. Two-Weapon Fighting is now also possible, which adds lots of fun to the game. You are now able to shred your opponents in seconds, sacrificing the protection of a shield. While shields in BG are not too powerful and one can easily manage without, dual-wielding is somewhat (if not more) overpowered. My Half-Orc berserker has 3 attacks per round wielding dual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swords. With 19 strenght, 3 points in two-weapon fighting, 3 in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword and berserker rage (granting protection against hold, fear and other hazards, plus combat bonuses) he is an insanely strong melee fighter, one you would never encounter in the original game.Special abilitiesI mentioned the berserker rage, but many of the class kit abilities are very powerful. Some good examples are the priest of Helm's Seeking Sword (3 attacks per round with huge THAC0 bonus) and True Sight. The newly added ""Shadowdancer"" kit with its hide-in-plain-sight ability is also quite powerful, being able to backstab, hide and backstab again. There are many more new abilities that will aid you in your fight against (or for your own) evil.BalanceThe battles in BG1 often used to be insanely difficult, but they were not designed for all these newly added features. This makes the enhanced edition somewhat less challenging than the original, but still very challenging. Only the greatest tactical geniuses would complain that the game has become easy. You should consider putting the difficulty slider one notch to the right compared to what you were used to in the original. Because of all the new additions, you will be well equipped for some tougher beasties.New adventuresFor me, not too interesting. They are not of the same quality as the original storyline. Then again, that quality is extremely rare. If you do not like the new quests then you can always just skip them.ConclusionThe enhanced edition is a welcome re-release of a brilliant game. It offers some great improvements while leaving just minor scars.+Native support for widescreen and higher resolutions+Native support for Mac and Linux (no more messing around with Wine)+Zoom function (though when zoomed in the game looks a bit crude)+Quick loot function eliminates the hassle of searching every corpse individually+New kits and abilities add fun+Bug fixes+Beamdog still provides updates, they have shown their love for this game and do not seem to have done all this for some easy cash (unlike some others).-Aesthetics (mainly logo and user interface) could have been better/more faithful to the original-The balance and difficulty of the game are slightly compromised by addition of the new kits, abilities and two-weapon fighting.

												Multiplayer has been, and continues to become even more broken. With the latest patch my friends can no longer connect to my server despite multiple troubleshooting attempts. This game has always had multiplayer issues and it is not getting any better.With the latest review from Kotaku its clear that this isn't a professional company concerened with taking the old Baldur's Gate and bringing into a new era. Its a cheap port with barely any new enhancements except for Social Justice! (tm)If you want to playt this game to relive Baldur's Gate - Stay AwayIf you want to play this game to relive Baldur's Gate and do it with your online friends - Stay far away.Amber Scott - Writer for Beamdog:“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say like, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.”			"

												One Word.... TERRIBLE.While I have an exstensive experience with Neverwinter Nights, This game is completely confusing. I never even made it all the way through the Tutorial. It started getting confusing when the first npc you talk to kept interupting me while I was trying to do what he said. ""open the map"" he would say, so I did and in the middle of opening the map he would interupt me and keep telling me to open the map, This was constant with every new thing the npc wanted you to do. The next headache is when the the combat trainer wanted you to cast a spell and constantly told me I hadnt cast a spell yet even though I had emptied my spells. It appears he wanted me to cast his spells, now why would I cast someone elses spells? Then the jerk wanted me to rest so I could memorize my new spells... For the life of me I couldnt find the rest button in any of the screens (inventory etc...) he told me the rest button was in... I gave up after that. While I commend the devs for making this game available on Linux, I also curse them for that because if it hadnt been made available for Linux I wouldnt have wasted an hour finding out this game SUCKS....

												Nicely improved version of Baldur's Gate.At first I was sceptic because of existence of free module BGT, but the longer I played, the more I enjoyed it. I shall focus on the differences between this and original version.Pros:+ Improved graphics with the possibility of zoom+ Additional 6 specialized classes+ New NPCs - I really felt that there should be monk and half-orc NPC recruitable. BG:EE adds them both+ A few new quests and locations+ Much clearer character/inventory screen. I found it extremely handy.Cons:- The new content doesn't add much of a gameplay. Two-three hours tops - which is very different from the description of the game.- The Black Pits are completely separate from the main game. Which caused that I didn't even care to play them - if I can't use the new experience earned and items found in the main quest then what's the purpose? Just some random battle simulator in the BG rules. "

												One of the greatest games of all time. The Enhanced Edition is still the same great game but with a few new companions and quality of life improvements, such as loot/item, chest/container, and character name highlighting when pressing tab, as well as a zoom function. The new companions are pretty nice. I played a lot with Dorn Il-Khan, the Half-Orc Blackguard, which is an evil and twisted reflection of the lawful good paladin, and I really like him a lot. He is an interesting character with a cool personality, and has an awesome class kit. He really adds a lot to an Evil party. The improvements and companions are not essential by any means, but they are nice. A lot of people complained about bugs when the EE was first released, but I'm happy to say that with the 1.3 patch, this has been eliminated. I played through the whole game and did not encounter any noticeable bugs. If you have never played Baldur's Gate, this is definitely the definitive version of the game, and the one to get. It's a 150+ hour game, so even at the full price of $20 you get your moneys worth for sure. If you have played Baldur's Gate, buy it on sale and enjoy a great excuse to replay a fantastic game.Update 2015: I have completed my playthrough and review of Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced edition.

												It is very disappointing but I have to give this game a thumbs down for now. Not because it's a bad game within itself, but because at it's current state it is unplayable. The multiplayer aspect of it at least. Singleplayer still has plenty of bugs, but nothing that prohibits you from playing the game.This is a classic. Baldur's Gate set the standard for western RPGs and introduced a lot of people to the world of Forgotten Realms and Dungeons and Dragons. I didn't have the pleasure of playing the game when it was first released but I saw a couple of friends play it and become sort of obsessed with it. They would praise the game, it's characters, it's story, it's dialogue, get sort of frustrated with its mechanics, not because they were inherently bad but because they were angry at a party wipe or character death which would force them to reload a save.They were frustrated but they wanted to play more. They wanted to finish that hard fight, they want to get the best possible outcome, they wanted to do everything.Several years later I decided to get this game for myself. Wanted to try it and see what it really was. Truth be told it hasn't aged well but the new patch 2.0 did slightly improved it (more on the patch later). It's still feels old and outdated, you'll find almost no QoL gameplay mechanics, it will feel very slow paced for someone used to a subgenre of RPG games, but the game has qualities which make it a classic.The story is pretty good (albeit I think BG:II is a lot better but this one is still nice), the characters are rich and interact with the world, you and between themselves, the dialogue is superb, serious when it needs to be, funny when it needs to be and even when it shouldn't. An important part when judging the storyline of the game is not only the story itself but how is represented to the player and how the player chooses to progress through it and BG:EE does that pretty well (again BG:EE II has dramatically improved on said aspect).The combat might feel slow and sluggish at times, since it is technically a turn based RPG without actually waiting for the NPCs to finish their turn. This pseudo-turnbased combat works well at times and feels awkward at others but I believe it's not something to take away from the fun of the experience.Sometime ago, beamdog (developing company) announce an expansion for the game called Siege of Dragonspear, 17 years after the original was released (contender for longest time for expansion release along with AoE2). Naturally we were excited to await a continuation of the story and an extra chapter into this game which would also bridge the gap between BG:EE and BG:EE II.Nonetheless in order to accomodate for the release of the patch, they released a patch 2.0 for the game and the sequel.The patch did a lot of thing which I will not mention here but it significantly altered the game. There was an outcry but many people who considered this a pointless and detrimental patch for the ""old-school"" players.I didn't really mind the ui changes, the game felt more responsive in our multiplayer sessions however it did the one thing that forced to not recommend this game.It broke multiplayer. As in it really made multiplayer unplayable. Constant crashes, save files gone (tooks a while but we fixed that), grey-scale pauses, difficulty settings which are always reduced to the previous tier whenever you start your client, you name it.BG:EE has a lot of bugs. I mean a lot. In multiplayer those bugs are enhanced since they will translate to frustration for multiple people. However me and my friends were so enamored with the rest of the game that we managed to power through the buggy/unresponsive mess that the multiplayer was and we managed to finish the game just in time for the release of the expansion.However at this moment we cannot play the game. It is literally unplayable and you're at the mercy of Tymora if you want to get it working. Most of the times it doesn't. Which is a damn shame. Did nobody playtest this in multiplayer? Did nobody else got the game-breaking bugs which many a people report of forums/reviews/discussions about the game.Most important of all, we were seriously planning to get the Siege of Dragonspear expansion, but we decided not to. Because we want to play the game together as friends but the game won't let us.Until the multiplayer game get fixed, until the bugs are fixed, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game and it's expansion to anyone. Seriously, it's a damn shame cause the game itself is a classic. But if you cannot play it, then it's not really a game now is it.I won't even discuss the ""rage"" about trans clerics who have offended some people. This is irrelevant. The multiplayer is unplayable. Fix it and then we can discuss everything else that might be wrong within the game. For shame beamdog, for shame.			"

												Special thanks to a good friend who proof-read this review; they said they wanted to remain anonymous, but thanks nonetheless.**Steam has finally allowed me to update this review! Now you can read the complete assessment here instead of venturing to the comments.Unlike many of the individuals who have purchased this title, I had not previously been exposed to Baldur’s Gate before this variance made its way onto the Steam store; I can, however, say that I anxiously awaited its rerelease on Steam, and even purchased it at a much higher price-point than I ever had and would with any other title. Baldur’s Gate is a game that deserves its praise as a classic open-world roleplaying adventure game based on the Second Edition (2e) of the Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) tabletop d20 game developed by the late Gary Gygax; Baldur’s Gate, followed by the Neverwinter and Dragon Age series, supports the DnD 2e core roleplaying game mechanics. As an avid player of DnD 3.5 and 3.75e (the Pathfinder system), I had not experienced much prior exposure to 2e other than that which I researched online and from my older Dungeon Mastering books, and, therefore, was able to view Baldur’s Gate as an original concept instead of ‘just another DnD adventure path.'Here are some things that I found particularly enjoyable about Baldur’s Gate:Connectivity to Dungeons & Dragons  - Right down to the equipment, combat tactics, roleplaying capabilities, and intriguing characters, Baldur’s Gate provides the sheer thrill of roleplaying that is offered by the tabletop renditions of the Dungeons & Dragons games. The game utilizes a simultaneous real-time and turn-based approach to combat, which will be described under the Gameplay portion of this review. Included in this title are six playable core races, a multitude of classes that influence each character’s style of play, the ability to multiclass, and the capability to interact with party members, which further enhances (no pun intended) the roleplaying experience. Since it utilizes the same mechanics as those in the tabletop roleplaying system, concepts such as THACO scores, Initiative modifiers, and alignments make an appearance; to those that are not familiar with the concepts, they are very simple to grasp and there are online guides dedicate to both Baldur’s Gate and Dungeons & Dragons that aide newer players in learning the roleplaying system.Gameplay - As stated previously, Baldur’s Gate utilizes a combat system that is both turn-based and real-time in that actions rotate between characters within a confrontation as a sequence depending on each character’s Initiative score; basically, whoever’s quicker will end up going first in the rotation. The game also employs a simulated d20-or 20-sided die-roll to resolve the degree of success pertaining to given actions such as lockpicking and attack actions. Outside of combat, players can speak with other characters, both in and out of their own party, which may alter a given character’s alignment status. Some characters also have the ability to perform certain actions such as picking locks as a Rogue archetype (pressing V while out of combat), or casting passive Charm spells on non-player characters for specific gains. In all, the system is so intricate and open that you can practically do whatever you want, within the game’s limitations, of course. There is also a multiplayer component to Baldur’s Gate in which you can import characters you have created and play with friends throughout the game.Truly Open World - At the beginning of Baldur’s Gate , you are given a background story, a sufficient reason to proceed through the main campaign’s questline, and the chance of receiving your first companion character. That’s it. From there, you are free to explore the massive map however you wish while obtaining side quests, battling formidable foes, and gaining companionship with other notable non-playable characters. There are also game modifications (mods) to expand the map and the game’s story. How much more ‘open’ can you get?The Black Pits - If you are searching for a different pacing outside of the massive world within the main campaign, then the Black Pits game mode is for you. This story is primarily driven by combat, in which your created party of six must fend off waves of enemies who utilize various tactics and themes in order to liberate your team from the Black Pits fighting arena. As straightforward as this may seem, it is extremely fun in a tactical manner, and permits the player to enjoy the core combat mechanics of the game without having to worry about the text and speech components; of course, there are secretes to be found within the Black Pits proving grounds.TL:DR - Like the person I would like to dedicate this review to, this game is an ‘original’ soul with intricate mechanics that will either make or break you. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world, roleplaying, or strategy titles, and would highly urge Baldur’s Gate to those who play tabletop roleplaying games, especially Dungeons & Dragons .

												I've heard great things about this game and when I started playing and saw the gameplay, the ideas behind it and the story I was instantly hooked but... with the recent updates happening to it and the bug ridden mess it is I simply cannot recommend it. No matter how good this game is the developers managed to break something that was pretty much perfect for 2 decades. The problem I had with it is that I simply couldn't progress. It's not allowing me to, getting stuck on doors and the edges of the map. Completely broken, I tried all the fixes listed online, none worked.Clunky UI compared to the original one and they pretty much removed a lot of options like the console the game had. Game is a mess. If you can go find the original version on retail. You'll probably enjoy it more.			"

												Classics are often thought to be timeless for future generations to enjoy, but the same cannot be said for Baldur's Gate—and it's not because CRPGs are uncommon. To go blind into BG in 2016 is practically impossible because how modern expectations are at odds with the brutal accessibility of '90s computer games.Baldur's Gate, simply put, is an sarcophagus; it is a coffin of a bygone time of design philosophies and of late '90s player expectations, immersed in the counter-culture of D&D and of fantasy-fiction that is written in its code like hieroglyphics to modern eyes.  The game's reverence is both a nostalgic call-back as well as an appreciation of BG's systems as a traditional role-playing experience. As someone who has started with modern CRPGs (Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity: Original Sin), it is difficult to recommend this game as others are more forgiving, even with BeamDog's inclusion of Story-Mode. However, if you can adjust your expectations and give the game some time it may prove to be as enriching of an experience for newcomers. We're THAC0, and AC-0 and--What?Perhaps what many might find hard to believe is that Baldur's Gate is not a difficult game; it's a game that lacks the conveyance to understand it. (Although this comparison is often misused, it's like Dark Souls in how you have to know things before you play.) This is because the greatest hurdle of mastering BG is to understand its language, Advanced D&D.  The game literally brings the rule-set of AD&D that only that '80s to '90s tabletop fans would understand. The tutorial goes only so far to explain the UI and controls; it doesn't explain how combat is tallied nor what key factors will improve your odds. (The key three reminders: THAC0, your chance to hit; AC, your chance to deflect/dodge; and you want BOTH to be low or negative values.) Another issue is the dialogue box doesn't list the calculations to show what you're doing wrong nor is there an in-game codex to explain it, so you will need the manual or a Wiki page on hand. All of this is said from someone who has played Pillars of Eternity for 110+ hours on hard mode without a guide. I had to play Baldur's Gate on Novice with Wikis and video tutorials. (Even then, I still often died for all the various status effects.) This highlights that the game's coherency is the issue, not the difficulty, although the game can be feel frustrating because of its systems' unclearness. (Ex. How do you know what is an Evil spell that you can protect against?)BeamDog has somewhat addressed the difficulty with the inclusion of Story-Mode (only v2.2). If you want to play in its original form Novice and Normal is as hard you should play. Story-mode removes the permadeaths and offer a lax experience to enjoy the narrative. Unfortunately, BG lacks a sweet-spot for people who are not familiar with AD&D; you either make the combat too repetitive or too brutal. In several cases, neutering the difficulty will rob you of the enjoyment of BG, especially in the most D&D areas such as Durlag's Tower. The plot, the ""non-linear nature"", and systems revolve around how brutal of a game it can be and how BG can be forgiving in its own ways. I would like to think one day I would tackle the game on its own terms, but the time required to invest into one series feels too much to ask. The BioWare RenaissanceNostalgia is often reserved only for fans, so it must say something when I felt it having never played BG before. The reason for that feeling is because many of Bioware's core ideas are found in BG. (Some for the better—and some habits are hard to break.)The companion system is the first relatable aspect for Dragon Age fans. Although there are twenty-eight companions, they are often caricatures to establish their personality and stick to their tropes. It works because you are meant to exchange companions whenever they die as they're irrelevant to the plot. The result is that it's not their personalities that establish their character but what happens during gameplay that fosters  your attachments. Characters' deaths are quests; interruptions to the storyline that shape how you get through with the lives you can save—or reload from a quicksave.As someone used to modern BioWare titles, it's hard to let companions die for good because I've been accustomed to the characters being part of the experience. It's a change I personally can't agree with, but it isn't a flaw; it's an interesting deviation. Another similar aspect is the cliché storyline coupled with subversions that make for some interesting moments. The story was a D&D taboo for its time because of how the storyline revolves solely one player, not the party, and the formula of ""One person must stand against a great evil"" has ever since been applied to BioWare's games.In terms of its world building, it's great for fans who know the references to D&D. However, it remains interesting for non-fans who are clueless because you cannot ask random NPCs for information about the game's world, factions or beliefs. It forces your attention on the smallest of details and to read the lore. For example, the moral alignment system is only one aspect that handles the complexities of the lore and game mechanics just fine in this adaptation. (For the most part...)The game's biggest issue of its moral alliances is how numerically rigid it is. Towards the final chapter, you cannot kill too many guards before your good party members leave you because your reputation points were lost. The result is playing the final act to the Benly Hill theme. The greater problem is how mechanically restraining it is to develop a party of various alignments when the variety helps to keep the party feeling lively. It's a great idea on paper, and with a Dungeon Master to give it some leeway, but as a videogame it feels too gamey.Unforunately, that issue is not the only story-related problem. What can also be taken from BG is BioWare's problem of having endings made into cliff-hangers or being in media res at the end. BG1 ends after one small hurdle has been accomplished, shortly after a major revelation, before foreshadowing that the experience isn't over. Then it knocks you back to the title-screen with a save file for BG2. The conflicts of the main plot with Amm and Baldur's Gate are not even addressed in an epilogue.It's quite telling how Mass Effect and Dragon Age have carried on this  tradition of having issues to resolve each game's narratives with a fulfilling climax. In BG1, the problem is taken even to a further extreme. Your level cap isn't 1/4th of the level cap of BG2, and chances are if you are not a completionist you will stay at Lv 7/8. The end game will feel as though you are just establishing your character, getting into the world-building conflicts, and then it ends.Whatever Greatnesses Arise are Destined to Beneath the EarthCivilizations are doomed to fade with time, and the same can be said for Baldur's Gate. Its legacy lives on in modern BioWare titles trying to recapture the same feelings, with various levels of success, and other games have adapted its ideas for modern audiences. In some way, however, the classic of Baldur's Gate cannot be repeated in modern times as it's a vestige of games long since forgotten.If anything killed the late '90s CRPG craze it was the games themselves. Their inaccessible barrier for entry, among many other issues, isolated them into obscurity and further made whatever wonders they created lost to modern eyes. If Baldur's Gate isn't for you, then know that it probably wasn't meant for you. Baldur's Gate Reloaded may be more accessible as it uses Neverwinter to recreate the experience as best as it can be done. However faithful it may be it won't recapture all that makes BG what it is.That is the magic of Baldur's Gate.			"

												I had never played it when it came out, I'm sure it was groundbreaking back in the day, but this game is not fun at all. All the rich elements of dungeons and dragons are there, but none of it is at reach because of all those restrictions. all those spells don't matter when  you can only memorize 3 at a time, and all those weapons mean nothing when anything kills in one blow but everyone keeps missing their attacks. I played with the core rules and I regret it, permadeath is stupid, and even a little kobold can kill you in one shot. It takes an eternity to level up and fights have no need of input from the player: you just wait and pray nobody dies. A mage could do spells, so there are decisions to make; but they die too easily, or their spells are used, so they are out of the picture. it doesn't feel rewarding at all. I didn't have fun.It's at this point that I realise that I just don't like D&D, the philosophy behind all the characters is very thin and doesn't fit reality. I hated that two party members left me because they thought I was too evil... after killing a bounty hunter that attacked me first. I hated the bard that made fart jokes; the guy literally says ''PFFFT, hooh, that was a sharp one'' when you click on him. There's also the necromancer that says creppy things, but whines like a baby 50% of the time; what's up with that? It's wierd, juvenile and unappealing to the point of disgust. There is no way, absolutely no way, to think that the characters are interesting or developed. But, I do appreciate the fact that there is close to no hand-holding. I really did. No pointer, no arrow, just you and the world.			"

												I do recommend playing Baldur's Gate! Just not really the Enhanced Edition.Albeit EE doesn't differ from the original much, it does in some significant ways. First of all, it allows running the game in high resolution. You can do it with the old BG too, but that requires a mod, and it's a nice thing to have it without doing anything. EE adds some magical weapons and other items to the game too. Not too many, which is very good, and they are balanced and fit in the game. Moreover, unlike vanilla BG, EE is not limited to Windows only, and can be run on other operating systems. A great thing is also the fact that BG EE has many languages to choose from (albeit no dubbings) so it might be a good way to practice one's language skills. Unfortunately these are the only positive things I can say about EE. When EE was released it was full of bugs, even gamebreaking ones, but they were fixed by now. Most of them at least, because some things remain broken. For example I couldn't join Alora to my team, because her encounter was broken. Moreover, the quality of the writing when it comes to the new dialogues (and NPCs) is low, and it stands out from the rest of the game, definitely not in a positive way. Hence, it's better to play vanilla game without it. Moreover, for replayability there are many interesting modifications for Baldur's Gate, but they do not work with EE.Play Baldur's Gate if you haven't already. To decide whether to choose BG:EE or BG you should consider quite a few things. Why choose BG over BG:EE?- no bugs- quality of the game is the same all-through- modificationsWhy choose BG:EE over BG?- multiple language versions (but no dubbings)- multiple operating systems supported (albeit Wine runs BG just fine)			"

												I love this game...Baldur's Gate is probably my favorite game of all time, and I say this as someone who never played the original when it first came out. In fact, I never experienced BG until around 2012, when the enhanced edition was released. Since that time, all of my MMORPG subscriptions have long since expired and no other RPG has even come close to blowing my mind the way this one has. Now keep in mind that when I first played this game I was used to games like Skyrim and Mass Effect, and here we're talking about a game in which the original was released in 1998. None the less, I really took to this game and it has easily become my most played game on Steam. This is probably the greatest compliment I can give the game: the fact that I have over 350 games on Steam, and yet all they do is sit in my steam library while an enhancement for an old game (that I don't even possess nostalgia for) completely dominates my attention. I'm telling you...it's that good.As for specifics, it's very hard for me to put into words just what it is about this game that is so special. For me, it's so many things, such as the D&D license, setting, and lore. I love the classic AD&D ruleset and the way it was implemented. I enjoy the rich and diverse NPCs, their unique personalities and abilities, and how they mesh together and make every playthrough unique, depending on which ones you choose for your party. I enjoy the fact that your character can be imported to BG2EE (which I also purchased, but from Beamdog) and leveled all the way to 8M XP. It provided something to plan for, and look forward to...and watching your character slowly come together and gain the power you imagined for it is a uniquely satisfying experience. It doesn't come instantly - it takes patience. No instant gratification...there are plenty of RPGs out there that cater to such. But to learn this game, and stick with it, and really involve yourself with it, I promise you, you'll be glad you did. To call it rewarding would be an understatement. I can almost promise you that you'll enjoy it.This is a super, super game. No doubt. For me, it's the computer gaming experience of a lifetime. I simply cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition started off its life under great duress, due to bugs and other technical mishaps.It has now, however, come through these difficulties and is an amazing (and faithful) recreation of an old classic that many consider to be one of the best games ever made.Baldur's Gate is the grandfather of the modern RPG, and is a must-play for someone who hankers to know how Skyrim and Dragon Age came to be in the first place. It is fun to play, but note that there is some micromanagement involved with controlling party members - the built in AI scripts aren't perfect and can be a pain at times.			"

The attemtp at putting in a patch to allow us to revert back to the old layout failed, and the game constantly crashes.  Just terrible.			"

												An AD&D adventure set in the Forgotten Realms. The Grandaddy of all isometric (top down) open world RPGs. The Gold Standard from 1998 by which all others of its type continue to be weighed, measured and found wanting. And while it's nice to see a resurgence of newer titles embracing this classic genre, Baldur's Gate is still yet to be dethroned as far as I'm concerned by anything that has come along since in terms of gameplay, story and immersion. Although the graphics were revolutionary for its time, they're obviously well dated by today's standards. But once you get drawn into its story, colorful NPCs and atmosphere its technical limitations just fade away and it still holds up just fine.Kudos to Beamdog for bringing this classic into the modern era of PC gaming.Play it again.......for the very first time			"

												10/10 would go for the eyes again.For first time players I would caution: this game is an 2nd-edition D&D pencil & paper game made into a computer game. If you are expection lots of cutting edge graphics, sfx, Michael-Bay style action, CoD-style instant-gratification, and easy gameplay with little thought involved, this game is not for you.On the other hand, if you enjoy good narrative, compelling story arcs and excellent gameplay, look no further.I played the original back in 1998 and i'm already a huge fan. If you are too, then you will be pleased to know that Beamdog have left alone eveything that made BG great, while making small subtle improvements to things like the User Interface and the graphics (resolution, zoom feature). Trent said it well himself, to paraphrase ""BG has not aged well, so they've make improvements to make the game to match what we all see through our rose tintend glasses"".Extra content and NPCs are all good too. The NPC's all fit very well with the lore and don't tread on the toes of the existing characters, who all still have their place. The extra areas are very in keeping with the atmosphere and in some cases the humour of the original.			"

												Now this here is some old-school RPG goodness brought back to modern systems in a quick and easy package in the Enhanced Edition. Adding widescreen support, new characters and locations, it still remains the classic adventure as it ever was.If you haven't noticed yet, this game, it's old, don't expect any shiny graphics or groundbreaking gameplay. Give it a chance though, it has tons of content, it retains its charm and the challenge that a lot of mainstream games nowadays simply do not provide. Many characters with their own alignments can be found to form wildly different parties, giving it replayability, and the multitude of sidequests and locations pretty much make it guaranteed that you won't get to see it all in one go. The plot itself is alright, but maybe that's because I played the sequel first so I was already aware of the plot twists. I strongly recommend you start with this game before moving on to BG2, if you've never touched them, you're in for a treat. Especially since you can import your BG1 character into BG2, giving it a sense of continuity. You don't get to experience the sequel differently like the Mass Effect series kind of does if you do import your character, but the stats, name, etc, do carry over.It's amongst my favorites due to the link it shares with BG2. I like BG1, but BG2 just blows it out of the water, making the original a mandatory playthrough. Get it.			"

												Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!! RrraaaAAGHGHH!!!Ever dreamed of taking your typical D&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen?+ Timeless classic of the D&D universe+ Excellent character NPCs of all variety+ Charismatic companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok…+ Game length (both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay)+ Immersive story+ Replayability+ Voice acting+ Late game stays true to the D&D aspect that there isn’t just one way to complete a quest+ Random Easter eggs and parodies+ Every action you make affects the game world,+ Controls were pretty straightforward, felt like a RTS with a pause button+ Can export your character to use in Baldur’s Gate II+ The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community- Since I can't find any cons let me here tell you something about Boo. Boo was the pet and companion of the Rashemi ranger Minsc, having joined him shortly after he sustained an injury to his head.While there was skepticism regarding the claim, Minsc insisted that Boo was, in fact, a miniature giant space hamster who was intelligent and could converse coherently with him. However, as Minsc was quite addled, it was unclear whether or not his claims were true.2d5+1/2d5★★★★★			"

												Edit: Everyone's getting very up in arms about this new 2.0 update that came along with SoD.Yes this update has made things very buggy, not good.But I'll just mention there's an option in the Beta profile settings for the game, that lets youopt back down to version 1.3. And play the game before the update. However it appears to be just as broken - Not everything but, very specific things. Good luck getting past the Gorion part early on.Pros:+ Hard, grueling, Adventerous; true to the D&D format of adventure.+ Expandable and immersive; you morph your being and will+ Atmosphere works well, you'll feel accomplished+ Incredible meta possibilites for those with a sick twisted mind (game's deep)Cons:- Below-average controls and AI issues, it'll be hard to simply open a door- Uninformative at times, you'll get hit by a trap but, it might not make sense how it didOverall: 9.0Baldur's Gate was known to be one of the single best adventure RPG's out there, and is revered by plenty who play it, it is however very daunting and scary for those with little to no experience in anything similar to it. The closest thing you'd probably ever play next to this would be something like NWN or maybe other games using the same engine like Icewind Dale or Planescape. The game is handled through dice rolls, just like D&D so if it seems like you just keep losing fights and chances because of luck, well, that might just be the factor. The controls that weren't improved and the AI-pathing issues etc. don't ultimately kill the game, it handles as well as the first versions did. This is a game for those who want to test their mettle in almost every way, and if you ever do beat the game, you can probably consider yourself to be one of the most baller people out there. Many would say NOT to get this version of the game compared to getting the older ones, but I personally don't see any fault in it. If you were gonna get the game either way, you wouldn't lose anything by getting this.(I had not tried the extra content all the way through yet, so I might continue the review if I ever do, that stuff was extra in this version so I don't fully count it as factoring into the score)			"

The developer, Beamdog, recently created the expansion DLC ""Siege of Dragonspear"", which, among other problems, includes real-world social issues like Gamergate, which obviously make no sense within the context of Faerun, in the dialogue.  Worse, when people try to point out these problems in the forums, Beamdog bans them and/or accuses them of bigotry.  Not only are they abusing the intellectual property of one of the most-loved CRPGs of all time, but they are also engaging in unethical conduct when dealing with dissatisfied customers.  I regret letting them have any of my money, and I would encourage you to avoid making the same mistake.			"

The game will crash randomly, not once, or twice in a blue moon. No, it crashes INCESSANTLY back-to-back-to-back. At this point I can't even play with my friend, as everytime he joins and I try to save the game, it crashes. Not to mention that we are playing on a LAN connection. A LAN. And still the multiplayer is horrifyingly broken.In fact, I can't even play my save game without him, as regardless of whether he is in the game or not, whenever I try to save - it crashes. It also tends to corrupt your saves, if you're trying to play multiplayer, without rhyme or reason. We also had to roll back multiple saves, losing hours of progress, because the game decided it no longer liked X number of saves. We've started up 4 new games, after hours of play, simply because we could not continue on a save game we had invested time in, as it became corrupted or the game decided it was done allowing us to play that save game. So if you're looking to play with someone, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Don't let my hours fool you, I have mutiple copies of the games physical disk.(Some of these referances may be of BG 2  and IWD 1 / 2, but while the details may differ slightly the point is the same.)Baldurs' Gate is everything a game should be. It's hard, but has a scalable difficulty so if things are too hard or too easy you can change that. However XP gained is also lowered with the difficulty so while you can make it easier, it gives you a good reason not to lower it.It's long, but can be SO much longer. By following the main story you can miss a huge portion of the game but it'd still take a lot longer to complete than just about any other game out today. If you decide to do everything then you have got a friend for life, it's very simaliar to The Elder Scrolls / Fallout series in the sense that if you want to max' it out, you REALLY have to put the work into it, but in a FAR more varied way. (Black Isle were involed with the production of Fallout 1 and 2 and to this day Fallout and The Elder Scrolls still share similarities with  The Forgotten Realms, but that's another story......)It has a very good story that unfolds based on your choices. There are so many ways to do everything, if you need a certain item try convincing the owner to part with it. With a high enough charisma you can make him think it's cursed, you could have a thief try to pick pocket him, you could buy it from him, maybe he wants to give it to you because of all the good things you have done, maybe he won't EVER give it to you because of all of the bad things you have done, you could earn it from him or just flat out kill him and take it. The story is the world itself, what is happening in it and what you will chose to do when you are given the chance.It's very well written and acted. The people who came up with the dialog covered everything, you would think trying to talk a guy out of committing sucide would have easy choices and results right? Wrong. Every option you chose could rely on many different factors, some of which can be random. You can never be sure of what will happen as a result of what you do, regardless of your intentions. You'll find yourself saving and loading everytime you are given a choice, simply succeding in a task doesn't mean you couldn't have done better. Voice acting is what they ment it to be, if you are talking to someone who is trying to be serious, you're not laughing at them. (Like you did during the intro' to Resident Evil 1 ""Stop...... Don't open.... That door!"")It treats you like an adult. It won't give you a gray marker that is on-screen 100% of the time telling you were to go, if you don't know, open your journel and find the entry that refers to your current objective (or maybe pay attention next time).It won't let you retry something that you messed up, you messed it up, next time pay attention (or just load.... It's easier).It has a lot of in-game mechanics that you are expected to learn and understand, this isn't CoD you don't just run around untill you see someone and then jam both triggers. 1 Small enemy can be infintly more deadly that 10 large ones, why? Maybe he's attacking a mage in a much lower armor class than a fighter, why isn't the fighter intervening? Maybe he got stunned by the small enemy, maybe the small enemy has a high magic resistance and can't be put down with magic so you need your fighter and you can't heal him because your healer is healing your ranger who is holding another front. It won't hold your hand and tell you you're pretty (even if you are), if you get beat it's your own fault for not prepairing properly.It's class / ability vareity is huge, you could have 4 mages all with different spells, one for summoning, one for buffing, one for AoE and one for direct attacks. 2 Rangers can work differently from each other, one could be a make-shift fighter holding a choke point while another attacks from range or sneaks past. You can change party formations, give individual orders to you party members and pause / unpause at any time (apart from during cut-scenes) so if you find yourself up against some tough enemies (I'm thinking of the Yuan-Ti invasion of Kuldahar in IWD 2) you can pause and look closely at your options.Will you take out the archers raining heavy damage on your mage(s) from range? Will you focus on the infantry crashing into your tank(s)? What about thier mage behind the front lines casting AoE on you? Can you healer(s) keep your tank(s) alive? Should you retreat? You'll spend more time looking at paused battlefields than fighting on them, I know that might not sound like a good thing but when 1 bad guy can kill you and you kill 30+ because you assesed the complex situation properly....... That makes you feel pretty cool..... /Epic Face.As if that weren't enough, they have updated it on Steam! Now with new charecters, including the expansion, a new ""adventure"" presummable meaning a new area that (like all other areas) has many ""inner-areas"". Improved multiplayer support for cross-platform connectivity, over (and I quote) ""400 improvements to the original game"". It now has a tutorial mode, support for high resolution widescreen displays and even new charecter voice options.There is simply too much to say and all of it is good. If you are going to buy it I will say this, graphics don't make a game, gameplay does. If you need good graphics to enjoy a game this is (your loss) not the game for you.			"

												I like this game so much I still have my original CD's, I also have the Infinity Engine collectors edition, with all of the IE games, I bought the enhanced edition via GoG, and then when SoD was released I bought it via Steam as well, with the intent of playing through for the umpteenth time, and then buying and playing SoD.Don't do it.  Don't buy the new 2.0 ""enhanced"" edition.  It is even uglier than the original version, multiple parts of the game that worked fine are now broken, and even worse you can't uninstall the absolutely terrible 2.0 patch and go back to the way it was.  I'm seriously mad, and may be looking for a refund, unless Beamdog comes out and says they are working to allow us to opt to play with the terrible 2.0 update or not.If Beamdog will reverse all the changes they made with 2.0, or at least allow us to back to the previous patch, then EE Baldur's Gate was a very good game, and yes, it was enhanced.  Now it isn't, unless ""enhanced"" suddenly means broken, ugly, and worse than before.			"

When launching the game on a version older than 10.8.2 a prompt will say that Baldur's gate no longer supports versions older than 10.8.2 and will not launch. Now the only way to run Baldur's gate on these previously supported versions of Mac OS is to pirate a vanilla version of the game, or run the windows version in Wine.As of April 8th, 2016 the store page still lists 10.6.8 as the minimum Mac OS requirement.-June 13th, 2016 the store still lists 10.6.8 as the minimum Mac OS requirement.

												“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.”Do not support this company, by Bhaal I sincerely hope they do not get enough cash to make an official sequel to this once incredible franchise, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing it even further than they have already with their pathetic and uninspired writing.""Was actually banned from their forum, permanently, for posting a link to tweet in which one of their devs, also a forum moderator, was basically begging Jezebel and Anita for ""protection"".

												Alongside the original Fallout, Baldur's Gate to me represents the first true modern cRPG, and one of the first RPGs to me that made its blend of storytelling and gameplay seem almost effortless.The game takes place in the Forgotten Realms along the Sword Coast. You're open to make any sort of character you want to go on your adventure. From an honest noble Paladin, to a deceitful Assassin. What is great about this is how it meshes perfectly with the storytelling. Most of Baldur's Gate is spent wandering and doing quests, and there isn't really an overarching ""save the world"" plot to keep you grounded. There's a very colorful cast of characters who can join your party too. From a cleric frozen in stone, to an evil greedy mage, to an overly enthusiastic Ranger who talks to a hamster. More than any other game, Baldur's Gate really captures the feeling of playing D&D near perfectly. I have never played an RPG that captures the essance of being ""sublime"" more than this game.This would be all well and good on it's own, but Baldur's Gate's gameplay was done very well too. Combat is very brutal and punishing, especially at the start of the game. It runs on a very finely adapted variant of the AD&D system, so a lot of very old RPG conventions are present. Stuff like races are restricted to specific classes and mages are restricted to a single spell per day at level 1. What's more is that the classes aren't balanced against each other like in a modern day RPG, so the strategy to the game comes from building a balanced party of adventures. This is all great stuff and it makes the game extremely replayable.Adding to that Baldur's Gate is essentially a trilogy of games. Starting with Baldur's Gate, continuing with Baldur's Gate 2 and ending with it's expansion Throne of Bhaal. All featuring much of the same cast of characters. So you get the most out of the experience by playing through all three. Unfortunately the original has been removed off GOG. I recommend for this version to pick up a mod called BG1 NPC project since it adds things like party banter and romances.			"

												This is review commendary on Dragonspear expansion, made by person with light sensitive eyes.Original baldursgate saga, specificly shadows of amn was and is my all time favorite rpg series.Everything was so well thought out the music, ui, combot, text, everything was so well designed you could play the game hours and hours to an end without any problems at all, it was overally really pleasant journey.So when they made enchanted editions for modern machines I were happy, I could play my favorite game once more without extensive fine tuning I had to do on originals.And it was fun, for while.Then came siege on dragonspear.They changed the well thought ui coloring and theme of old baldursgate to dark obsidian hue "" volcanic"" style, that looks good in paper.But in game it's health hazard.The black ui causes all color contrasts to be so strong, you will literally get sick  and your eyes start hurting if you play the game for longer than few minutes.That's right, they made coloring so horrible, it causes me to get physical pain in my eyes.I want to play the expansion but I can't, it just hurts me.If you want to get bg 1& 2 ee, don't get Siege on Dragonspear.It  makes the game unplayable for people with even slight eye sensitivities.

												This used to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time, but the new developer Beamdog has been a terrible steward of this iconic franchise. Beamdog has made numerous unnecessary updates to the user interface and has introduced so many new bugs that the game is almost unplayable. I bought the Steam copy of this game for a nostalgic RPG we had played almost two decades ago. Instead we have struggled through numerous crashes, terrible input lag, UI bugs, items duplicating and disappearing among other issues. There are more patches coming out, but so far they have done nothing to alleviate the major issues we've encountered. Reviewing the bug report forums it seems most of these bugs are well known and have persisted for a long time.In it's current state the game is no longer worth buying from Steam. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of the game that is prior to version 2.0.			"

												I quite liked the original that came in the bulky 5 CD format. With EE I can play the game the way it was meant to exist if technology was more advanced in 1998 and if the team had a few more hours to polish it.Even though the improvements are small the game feels very different in my experience (for the better). Transparent UI makes it so much less intrusive. The ability to zoom makes it possible for me to run the game in a widescreen resolution without everything being too small. Plus, I quite like to reduce zoom outdoors and increase it in dungeons. I never knew how much I missed this before I had the chance to try it.Because they implemented several convenience changes I am able to play this game without installing any convenience tweaks. For example, the standard 40 ammo stack was a bit of an annoyance for me, so I always installed tweaks just to increase stacking if nothing else. Because EE stacks up to 80 that's enough for me and I can just play the game as it is.My biggest gripe with BG was always that I had to spend what seemed like forever just installing and configuring it (TuTu this, TuTu that, mod, tweak, blah blah). Finally I can just install it, increase FPS in options to 40 (to speed up walking) and PLAY. I'm sure that fundamentalists will argue that EE is the devil because you can get the same or better experience by taking BG1 and run it using BG2's engine with widescreen mods etc. But in my opinion the result is not as polished as EE and there is just SO much painful hassle that way.I approve of this release!P.S. (spoilers below!)I am also very happy that they included new NPC's - even though the original had a lot of them to begin with. I am one of those individuals who think that the 'canon' party sucks (i.e. that they are incredibly annoying). I love Imoen, but I cannot stand Minsc (calling him a degenerate idiot would be a compliment), Jaheira (Look! It's Miss Personality herself!) or Khalid (he's just a dog without testicles that Jaheira keeps on a leash). Dynaheir I could care less about. The problem is that these people come in pairs, so there go 4 of your 5 slots. Having three new characters in EE makes it easier to fill them with people that do not annoy you.			"

												Baldur's Gate is one of the greatest games of all time. Unfortunately, nothing Beamdog included in the Enhanced Edition really added anything meaningful to the game. They made a number of convenience changes, such as raising the ammunition and gem stack limit, but such features and many more were already made available for the original game by the wonderful modding community that came first. Many mods that made wonderful improvements on the game (such as the ability to hide the ridiculous character helmets) are unavailable with this version.The Enhanced Edition seems to improve pathing a bit, but if you play on a higher-than-base framerate like I do, it doesn't matter too much.The writing for the new companions is weak- I didn't spend much time with them because their voices and character portraits didn't match the aesthetic of the original characters closely enough.The new replacement cinematics - which mostly consist of a single image and the original background music - are some of the worst aspects of this version. I understand they were working with a budget, but they really should have included the option to turn them off and have the original experience. Some of them straight-up remove story from the game: the old Nashkel cinematic did an excellent job of tipping you off to what was going on the town, and the new one is just a uninformative still of one of the town's structures.Rather than adding new companions, I would have preferred they added more to the originals: one of the big improvements in BG2 is that the companions are all really fleshed out and have their own personal quests. I would have liked to see Beamdog take more queues from the people who already made a better game out of the original. Beamdog made a decent effort, but if you want to play the best version of Baldur's Gate, this isn't it. The best version of Baldur's Gate is still the original title with a handful of mods. I've looked over the list of fixes, and I'd take all those bugs and inconsistencies back if I could have the original cinematics and UI again. Since I can only rate this game on the basis of the changes the developer made, I can't recommend it.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a RPG that was originally released back in 1998. Since then it has inspired a tidal wave of RPG games and reinkindled a belived to be dead genre. So it was just a matter of time before this classic game got an overhaul which resulted in Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.The game tells a rather intriguing story about two rivaling nations that are on the brink of war. But not all is what it seems to be and the true reasons behind the potential outbreak of war lie hidden in a double and triple layered web of treason and lust for power. In addition to that the player is also concered with his own heritage and what this could have to do with the events that are laid out in the game. Before starting the game, the player has to create his character, which will be of course, the main character of the game. In addition to the main character the player can control a group of up to six characters (including the main character) which can be recruited over the course of the game.  There are quite a lot of companions available to recruit for your party which differ a lot in terms of personality. This is a key factor the game, because it adss a lot of replayablity to it. Also this allows you to play the game in different ways. You can be the shining hero, that is beloved by the inhabitans of the Sword Coast, or you can be the dark villain that only thrives to satiate his own lust for conquest. Due to the alignment system in Dungeons & Dragons (the pen & paper system which Baldur's gate is based upon), you will find good and evil companions which support the correspondet playstyle. So it would be a bad idea to recruid only evil characters and then play the shining hero because there is a possibilty that those companions would leave the party if your reputation which the inhabitants of the Sword Coast gets to good. The same thing goes for recruiting only good aligned characters and accomplishing evil deeds.The gameplay itself is based upon a pausable real time combat system. So your orders to your party members will be executed in real time and you can pause and any time to get a overview of whats going on. Does someone need a heal? Can you stun a certain enemy? Which opponent should you attack next? Should you focus your attacks on one enemey or split up to keep certain enemies occupied? The Combat system evolvers a lot around tactical choices, which makes it fun and challenging. While melee and ranged combat is pretty straight foward and self explanatory, some players might find the spell system weird, because you have no casting resource such as mana or other form of energy. Instead you have a spellbook with a limited number of spells per page that you can write into your spellbook. Now you can choose a few spells that you would like to memorize. Spells get memorized after you rest at an inn or via the rest function in the wilderness. You can only use spells that you have memorized. There are some exceptions to this, for instance the sorcerer class does not need to memorize spells. So the player to equip his mages with a good mixture of utility and damage spells in order to maximize their potential. Beside the main story there are a lot of side quests that reach from the simple ""go there, bring me back this"" to rather complex and story rich side quests. The game does no handholding with quests. You sometimes get a vague direction (or none at all) where to go for a certain quest. But in general you have to explore the areas that you go to. Because often you will stumble upon your quests targets in the wilderness. Talking about side quests Beamdog added 3 new companions to the game and each of them brings a new quest with them.Also you have to read a lot. There is a lot of text in this game. And you have to read carefully, otherwise you might lose your direction. There are nor questmarkers or markings on the map. The developers from Beamdog made a few changes to the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset that the game uses. Also they introcued some class and race options which were only available in the original Baldur's Gate 2. But in general these are good changes because they add some more variety to the game.The not so good changes are some to the UI. I Personally liked the old quest journal a bit more than the new one. And they changed the character sprites a lot. The old ones looked better. Gladfully this can turned off in the options menu.All in all the Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a worthy overhaul, it runs smoothly on new systems and still works fine. Sure it is not a remake. But it brings a classic game to modern era pc gaming and despite the changes that are not liked by everyone, the game itself is still fun and intruiging ans the original from 1998. So I totally reccommend this game for anyone who is interested in old-school party based RPGs. "

												I want more than anything to love this game as I have all the others. However, I cannot excuse the complete laziness of the writing.   For example *spoiler* when you go through the underground passage to the end and find Hephernaan, he retreats from the battle and you find an imprisoned Daeros Dragonspear. After speaking with Daeros you learn of Hephernaan's plan to use your Bhaalspawn blood to open a gate to hell for nepharious purposes all the while manipulating Caelar.   Caelar calls for a parley and demands you surrender yourself and instead of telling your ally's the truth of their ploy, all you can do as options for dialogue is ""duhhhh I have no clue what they could POSSIBLY want with me"". Something along the lines of this anyway.   Absolutely lazy writing and it makes me desire for those writers to be strung up from a tree by their fingers for defiling this games' amazing legacy with their incompetant witlessness.			"

												First things first: take a look at my playtime. Number of times the game crashed in over 188h? ZERO.Baldur's Gate is an old favourite for its great story, engaging mechanics and fun gameplay. The enhanced edition isn't really that different from the original for someone that only played it out of the box, like me. If anything, it's improved, since it now runs smoothly (I remember making coffee while I waited for the city of Bauldur's Gate to load).Don't buy into the haters' speech. If you're new to the game, get it. It's awesome and has so much variety to its locations and monsters, that it feels better than a lot of more recent games (just remember, it's based on AD&D, so the rules are sometimes strange for people raised playing 4th or 5th edition DnD). If, like me, you played it a long time ago and would like to replay it for nostalgia's sake (and also because it's awesome), go right ahead and remember you can mod the hell out of this game if you feel something's missing.

												I was an invincible demi-god, and then I met petrification.  PROS:+Timeless classic of the D&D universe+Excellent character NPCs of all variety+Game length was not too long or too short+Immersive story+Voice acting was pretty good+Late game stays true to the D&D aspect that there isn’t just one way to complete a quest+Random Easter eggs and parodies+Controls were pretty straightforward, felt like a RTS with a pause button+Can export your character to use in Baldur’s Gate IICONS:-AI was incredibly derpy at times; especially pathing and combat-Some available party members would just up and leave despite actively working on their personal quest line. Be wary of who you deck out in good gear.-Some personal quests won’t complete if certain party members die during the last part of their quest line.-Some spells are unclear if they hurt your party or not.  If it doesn’t specify ENEMIES, it more than likely will affect everybody.-Story was a bit slow up front, but stick with it.			"

												Love the original game and the enhanced edition.  This has brought back many memories of my D&D groups and the times we had slinging the dice around. What I have to give a negative review for is the Siege of Dragonspear Expansion. Those of us who love the game were looking forward to more of the same. What we received was hack writing and forced SJW themes that I do not want in my video games. Are there no longer game publishers who offer what their fans want or do they all have to cater to PC thinking? I can understand this company has the rights to produce what they want but shouldn't they at least be honest with the community and tell us they are changing the themes of the game/character backgrounds/etc?I played admittedly very little of the expansion before disappointment set in.....also STEAM will not refund my money even though I played less than 30 minutes of the expansion. They count the time you spend playing the main game the same as time spent playing the expansion. So if you were like me and wanted to start a new party to run though BGEE before the expansion understand you will not be eligible for a refund if you do not like the expansion.  "

												This is my first review so bear with me. It's Baldur's Gate 1 without the annoying UI and with some extra content.  If you like Baldur's Gate and aren't familiar with modding then this game is for you. But if you never played Baldur's Gate then allow me to go over some of the details.Story- It's is rather interesting if you do not mind reading a lot. Altough the start is rather slow, once you get midway into the game it begins to pick up a lot.Gameplay- Difficult, but once you understand the basics then it can be rather fun. However the combat is not for everyone, it's very tactical and can be slow in the start.Charcters- Other than the extra characters added in by Beamdog, the orginal charcters have little personality. The extras have conversations with you and offer extra areas and items. They serve their purpose as party members.Overall, if you are willing to surive the lower levels and keep going forward then this game is for you. If you lack patience and dislike older games then just forget about it. There is a huge learning curve and unless you are willing to learn then I would advise against purchasing this game.I personally love this game and love Baldur's Gate 2 even more. If I had to give the game a numerical value it would be 85/100. Beamdog did a good job with optimization and a lot more accessable to the public than it used to be.			"

												This review will also be discussing Siege of Dragonspear as wellBaldur's Gate is a game that when it came out, was revolutionary for it's time. I actually owned (and still have) the orignal five disk game that came out back in 1998. Put out by Black Isle (under the developmental eye of the three original founders of Bioware), it is a game that takes place set in the Forgotten Realms. In this game, you're basically playing Dungeons and Dragons, but for those of you out there that are familiar with nothing older than 3rd Edition, you may find the mechanics for the classes a bit odd. Baldur's Gate uses the old AD&D 2nd Edition rules set and it is still quick to pick up.Character generation is rather straightforward, allowing you to roll and re-roll your stats as much as you'd like until you're happy with them. Compared to the original, the Enhanced Edition shows you the total point number that your stats total to. This is helpful when trying to shoot for a total number. You are able to store a rolled set that you like, but can only store one set at a time. Regarding character creation, you have a variety of races to pick from, but only humans can be any class. The trade-off to this is that non-human races can go above an 18 during character creation, and in AD&D, that is rather huge, since unlike later versions of D&D, your stats will not improve. Beamdog brought the kits from Shadows of Amn (the sequel) to the base game, allowing you to get a feel for the kit right away. This is something I wish the original game had when it was released. They also added a couple of new ones from 3rd Edition, such as the Shadowdancer for Rogues and the Dwarven Defender for dwarf Fighters. Due to the nature of the game engine, there is an experience cap for classes, which is 169,000 XP (most classes will hit level 8, wizards will hit 9, and rogues will hit 10).The story is rather intriguing, and keeps you wondering what is going on in true, classic D&D style right up until the 5th chapter, when you finally see the whole picture. Then it becomes a “race against the clock” (not literally) to save the day. Unlike it's sequel, Baldur's Gate assumes by default that you are playing the hero, or at least an anti-hero (not a villain). You can be evil, but if you become too evil, you won't be able to ever complete the game, since you won't be allowed to enter cities (the guards will literally come, tell you there's no entry for you, and attack you). There is also two optional missions, thanks to the game's original expansion – Tales of the Sword Coast – Durlag's Tower and Balduran's Isle. It also added a new area called Ulgoth's Beard, a small village with some new items for sale and some missions. These have been included in the base game from Beamdog. Durlag's Tower is a classic dungeon crawl, with deathtraps and monsters, as well as rewards and a climatic battle at the end of the quest line. Balduran's Isle is a tale that has you follow the final voyage of the great hero Balduran (whom the city Baldur's Gate is named after). While the tower is difficult, it is still much more enjoyable than Balduran's Isle is. This was one area I felt that Black Isle fell short on, and quickly jumps up in difficulty.Speaking of difficulty, Beamdog has added an option for “Story Mode”, for those that just want to play through the story. Think of it as “super easy mode”, where you can't die, and nothing harmful can affect you. While I think this is not a bad idea for those that are not fond of the old school AD&D rules, I didn't like using it. I experimented with it a little, and never went back after trying it. The game has been mostly untouched, which is smart by Beamdog – it has just been tweaked, bringing back a lot of things they added in Shadows of Amn. As for the new NPCs that have been added, I have already heard from many how they feel “forced”. But my only argument against this is this – this game is nearly 20 years old. How else are new characters supposed to feel like without feeling like they're mod NPCs? I think they are a nice addition, each with a voice actor that did a great job on them (Rasaad is actually voiced by Mark Meer – Male Shepard from Mass Effect).Siege of Dragonspear was the massively new expansion put out by Beamdog for this game. They managed to bring back just about everyone from the first game that had a character in it, such as Jennifer Hale, Jim Cummings, and Melissa Disney. The expansion is very well done! While at times, it felt a bit rushed in sections (going through a underground cavern to Dragonspear Castle), the expansion is still very well made, and does an excellent job covering the massive gap between Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn. Those that played Shadows of Amn back in the day will easily recognize who the hooded man is. Siege of Dragonspear increases the XP cap, letting you get a little higher (I believe I ended at level 10 or 11 with my mage). This is handy because you're that much higher when porting over your character to Shadows of Amn.While I'm sure there are reasons for all the poor reviews by “the old guard” about Siege of Dragonspear, they do not speak for all of us. I only speak for me, and being part of that “old guard”, I absolutely loved this expansion, and consider it to be part of the entire game experience now. While I was a bit sad at who they brought over from the first game (Safana? Garric? REALLY?) they still managed to bring over a few fan favorites. Hats off to Beamdog for Glint, the gnome cleric/rogue; a very well written character, and a likable personality. He slid right into the slot of both cleric and rogue in my good party, and part of me wishes Beamdog would have added him into the base game. M'Khiin (goblin shaman) is a neat idea and something I actually thought was creative to do for this series. There's also an optional battle pit called the Black Pits (but I have not experimented with that much, so forgive me if I don't feel knowledgeable enough to discuss it in this review). If you are looking for a D&D game that has a great story and good characters, I do recommend checking it out.			"

												As others have posted before me, there have been two major patches to the game recently. The first claims to have over 300 ""improvements"" to the game such as: you now have to confirm you want to travel somewhere instead of just clicking the zone, you have to confirm you want to memorize a spell, rather than just clicking on the spell. The inventory flashes an obnoxious stat change box with EVERYTHING a character can use, even potions.  The graphics got a hit of cartoonishness as they added a way to smooth the outlines (luckily you can turn it off and it looks more like the original format.) There is a ""journal updated"" box that now appears when you do a quest objective. This can be especially annoying when you're turning in a lot of items in. A good example: I just killed the Tanar'ri up near Baldur's Gate itself, I went back down to Nashkell because I had around a dozen winter wolf pelts to turn in to the merchant there; the journal updated for every single turn in.I came back to the game after a while because I had given up on the demon fight originally, but after some time I was ready for it again. Coming back to all this frivilous BS is rather angering. I don't mind bug fixes, as long as they improve the game, but breaking the wheel while its functioning just fine is a waste of the programmers' time and talent. Honestly, until they enable a way to revert back to the original format, I refuse to play this game anymore. Good job Beamdog, you screwed up a perfectly good game, I imagine in the name of hubris.

												I'll be writing this review mainly directed to people who don't really know much about Dungeons & Dragons or old-school cRPG's.One of the first games to have branching story paths that actually worked and meant something. Lots of consequence, lots of choices, lots of endings. The story of the game is very well written and also interesting. If you're willing to read up on the background information a little to get a grasp of what the D&D world is like, particuarly this one, then you'll understand the games story better. Even if you don't read any background information you'll still pick up on it as you play, and you'll still be able to enjoy it.The first few hours of the game are a little slow and sort of random. During these few hours (about 2-3 hours or so), lots of random things will be thrown at you just to let you practice on how the game works. You'll meet random companions, random attacks, and have some pretty pointless but rewarding side quests. Like I said, these are just to warm you up on the rest of the game.One of the main points of the game is maintaining a party. You'll meet many companions along your adventure which you can either allow into your party or not. You must watch each players health, weapons, stats, and so on. It sounds complicated when you first read about it, but it's pretty easy once you get used to it. Your companions will get tired, get wounded or their weapons will break. You have to watch out for all of these things and help them out as much as you can. Fortunately for people who have a hard time making characters, you will only have to make your own character (which is the leader of the party) as all other companions will have their own stats and abilities. With that being said, you must know how to use and level up their stats and abilities.The combat can be a bit tricky at first, especially once your party gets pretty large. You are able to pause the game, point out each individual party member who to attack, then unpause. Having your whole party attack the same enemy at once works on lower level enemies, but as you start to face larger groups of monster and/or more challenging enemies, you have to use strategy to determine how not to get your party instantly killed.The character creation is quite big for this game. You can chose between a few races, pick between many classes which have their own sub-classes (Such has Cleric/Ranger or Cleric/Thief, etc.) and have quite a bit of stats to level up. You won't be leveling up as easily or quickly as many of todays RPGs. I didn't upgrade my main character until about 2 hours into the game while doing a bunch of side-quests and killing lots of enemies. Leveling up is meant to feel rewarding and having an actual impact when adding points to stats and gaining new abilites.The world is nicely drawn in this game too. The graphics on the Enhanced Version doesn't look much better than when I played this game years ago, but at least it's in widescreen.Exploring the world is also a huge point in this game. The world isn't all one seamless level, but instead it's broken up into large sections which usually have other sections within them, such as caves and castles. Most of the places you're allowed to freely enter, but others are restricted.I guess there's also multiplayer, but I guess i'm the only one in my friends list that owns this game haha.Overall, I think this game is very good, and the Enchanced Edition brings some changes that will ease in newcomers to the classing cRPG genre. This is considered by many to be one of the best RPG games to date, as well as the other D&D cRPG's that came out around the same time. I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs and are willing to overcome a slight learning curve if they haven't played a classic cRPG such as this before.			"

Pretty much everything else you'd want in an RPG is thereDefinite reccomend for all RPG fans			"

												I loved the original B♥♥♥♥nd bought BG1:EE to experience the first game, and while it worked about a year ago when I first installed it, now the game no longer functions for me. I imagine that--like other players--the latest update ruined my ability to play the game I paid for. Even after working with tech support, the best I could do was to get the game to turn on, at which point it would be so slow and glitchy I couldn't even move past the first screen. Tech support has been unable to fix this for me yet, and their only advice was to wait for a revised patch. My machine can handle Skyrim, AC4, Far Cry 3 and other big games just fine, but apparently this remake of an ancient RPG kills my computer's ability to handle things.Until they fix the bugs that make BG:EE unplayable, I cannot recommend it.

Perhaps you manage to play for a time but we cannot save, everytime we try the game crashes, and than a day you discover the that save does not work anymore or that in a map you cannot enter some building because the game crashes. Than you load the same save in single palyer mode, that you can do but not the other way around, and discover that in single player it works fine. So if you want to play single try it, but it have bugs anyway. If want it for the multiplayer forget it. This is crap.			"

This is how a company goes bankrupt, as they should. They wanted to cash in on the BG name, preach to the white men who might play it, and cash in on the fleeting SJW crowd. Not a good business model. You just exchanged your main audience for a group that might (MIGHT) buy one of your games. GOOD JOB #DERP			"

												Beamdog managed to completely ruin the best cRPG ever made with their new expansion full of PC and SJ content. Ignoring the D&D ambientation and immersion, they just added a bunch of dialogues and changes to the original characters personalities to force feminism and other such ideologies down the player's throat. Do not support this kind of thing, don't even buy the base game and, if you already did, ask for a refund if you still can.On their words:“If there was something for the original Baldur’s Gate that just doesn’t mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism, [we tried to address that],” said writer Amber Scott. “In the original there’s a lot of jokes at women’s expense. Or if not a lot, there’s a couple, like Safana was just a sex object in BG 1, and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say, ‘No, that’s not really the kind of story we want to make.’ In Siege of Dragonspear, Safana gets her own little storyline, she got a way better personality upgrade. If people don’t like that, then too bad.” (http://kotaku.com/the-struggle-to-bring-back-baldur-s-gate-after-17-years-1768303595)So they think they can just do whatever they want, grotesquely modify characters that had unique personalities and ""If people don't like that, then too bad"". On top of all, it's badly written:http://techraptor.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baldurs-Gate-Dragonspear-Mizhena.jpgAnd you can't even give a negative response like the freedom of the original game would allow. Beamdog, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and its new expansion are the perfect example of why masterpieces are better left crystallized on the past for contemplation only.			"

There's a slim chance it got fixed, but I played it long months after release and it was there. And it was just a taste of many other bugs and glitches, that plague this edition.Beamdog should apologise and switch to something more fitting their abillities, like ""match 3"" apps on mobile devices.

												Crashes on Windows 7. I searched the forums, and tried everything to make it run, unsuccesfully. Lost about 2 hours on it. I liked playing BG when it came out, but they could at least make the Enhanced Edition work on modern OS-es. Steam should also ""retire"" games that do not work any more, or test the compatibility, and remove the OS as being supported. I will try to run this on Linux at some time, but my primary goal was to run it on my travel laptop, but that turned to be a failure.			"

There are any number of ways to play the campaign, solo, or with a party of up to six of probably fifty distinctly different character builds.

												What is baldur's gate? One of the best story driven role playing games i've ever experienced on the pc platform. I own the original 5cd retail version from the original black isle/interplay/bioware with the separate tales of the sword coast expansion cd. One of the most respected forgotten realms games ever made by bioware.So, you want to know why i rate THIS negative?Because these arrogant houlier than thou ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a SJW complex think they are better than the *whole gaming community* just for making an amateurish fanfic ( with lots of bugs/glitches ) that sports a clear b a s t a r d i z a t i o n of beloved characters from the original story just to forcibly shove down their politically correct bs in gamers throats. And also because i can't even play the god damned game now with the broken legacy of bhaal mode difficulty reverting issues.I mean, the damned thing messes up creature stats after reloading different areas.The game has a plethora of new issues after the 2.0 update and Beamdog's choice for the UI design was poor.You want something positive? FIX THE *RELEVANT* GAME ISSUES FASTWhy should i praise you for releasing broken products or breaking your actual working releases  time and again?I may not care about the multiplayer as much as others but that is also not working correctly  as many have already pointed out.

												The developer, Beamdog, unfortunately is a company who's milking legacy titles. They are not able to make their games so they are trying to sell some extra copies of these old gems like Baldur's Gate by adding expansions. Yes, maybe couple of hundred people will buy the game because it's 'bumped' by the recent update, but the forced expansion made the entire legacy player community upset. And Beamdoggie is so much disconnected with reality that they're posting self-celebrating announcements describing how epicly they destroyed the game while the forums are flowing with outrage even though they're trying to lock threads around the clock.We have one of those ""bad developers"" here guys, all the symptoms are there. Lack of communication, greed, heavily moderated forums, forced and sudden updates etc. Stay away from this title until the last expansion is made optional.  Note for Beamdoggie: Go make your own games.			"

												Baldur's Gate is one of the best RPG experiences created to this day. Originally released in 1998, BioWare struck gold with this great D&D-licensed RPG. Now, over a decade later, Overhaul Games/Beamdog have appropriately overhauled the game in this Enhanced Edition, but is it worth getting? Definitely! The massive scale of the game, the sheer amount of quests with excellent dialogue and the huge sense of freedom makes this a fantastic RPG experience to this very day. The Enhanced Edition comes with the original, the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion and offers even more content with the addition of three new companions, each of which offer an excellent experience, in addition to the new ""The Black Pits"" campaign which focused on arena-style combat. The Enhanced Edition additionally contains all the improvements that Baldur's Gate 2 had, meaning you can now play every single race/kit that BG2 contained plus the Enhanced Edition adds a bunch of new options and possibilities. But the game is old and the Enhanced Edition does little to change this fact. Although there have been visual improvements, most notably a better user interface, it still looks like an incredibly old game and as the Enhanced Edition comes with a shocking lack of options this becomes a problem. Furthermore, the game does no effort or attempt to guide you. Especially fans of modern RPGs will run into this quickly, as the game is not even remotely user friendly. You will find no quest waypoints and very little in the way of statistic or spell explanations, meaning you will have to have patience learning and understanding the obviously outdated mechanics. If however you can deal with these issues, then Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is definitely worth getting. If you've played these games to death in the past, and have dabbled in the numerous mods at the time, then this may not be for you though the new content might just offer you enough. It is a much more convenient game with some great additions that makes playing this fantastic classic an amazing experience any RPG fan should play.

Thought that would mean it would be better than the original. Not even close. Looks like crap, plays like crap, that is if you can even play it. Constant crashes, freezes and just a plain buggy mess. What a crime it is what they have done to this great game. Beamdog is it? I would sugest avoiding anything these butchers work on like the plauge.

												This is specificall with regards to the new expansion, Siege of Dragonspear. The new content is extremely buggy, very poorly written, and with an extremely hamfisted and overt political agenda. Characters from the original games have been completely changed, and for the worse.Whatsmore, in their effort to prove how LGBQT friendly they were, they added a token trans character who exists for no other reason than to be trans, giving, basically, the video game making equivalent of ""see, I'm not racist, I know several black people.""In addition, once they had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off an enourmous cross section of their fans, they then took to their forums to beg for positive reviews, which is pretty bad form.Apparently updates to the token character are in the works, as are bug fixes. I will give it another shot at that point, but given how linear the game is, and how poor the rest of the writing also is, I'm not holding out much hope.			"

												Bladur's Gate II was one of the first RPG games I ever played. Introduced to it around 2004, probably no older than 12 or 13, picked up a battered copy along with Throne of Bhall in some bargin bin for old PC games. Remains one of my favourite gaming experinces ever. Until now, I have never actually played the first game in the series. I'm writing this review as someone who never played the non-Enchanced Edition version of this game, I can't say for sure what has been ""enchanced"", nor is it clear to me which quests/areas are from the original base game, and which are from the add-on pack (Tales of Sword Coast). I have now beaten the game from start to finish with my Cavalier in about ~40 hours, completed most of the sidequests. Single player only. Didn't find the Black Pits mode appealing enough to try beyond a few minutes.Longer version: Baldur's Gate is a party-based RPG, you create your own character (race, class, alignment, etc) and recruit up to five other followers. The rules are based off the AD&D 2nd Edition, which compared to later editions used in games like Neverwinter Nights or Icewind Dale II, is quite restrictive (non-human races are much more limited to what classes they can pick, and less freedom in multi or dual classing) and perhaps not as intuitive. Combat is real-time with pause, you can leave your party whacking away at low level mobs to clear them faster, or pause the game to issue orders and manage combat for the harder fights. 13 base classes to pick from, Paladins, Fighters, Mages, Clerics, etc. All but a few will offer you different ""spins"" to try out, these are called ""Class Kits"". For example, Bards have more melee orientated counterparts called Blades and Skalds. Blades sacrifices pickpocketing, lore and songs for greater proficiency in two-weapon fighting styles. Skalds improve their companions ability to hit with their singing, but at the expense of pickpocketing.  The main plot itself is extremely easy to follow: for a RPG there are relatively few characters central to the plot, you are given clear instructions on where to go next, and the storyline generally follows itself quite logically. I have been playing this game inbetween other games, and have taken breaks from playing it. I never felt lost or had to reorientate myself when coming back to the game, unlike most other RPGs. The sidequests, of which there are many, do however require you to pay attention to dialogue, clues, and journal entries. Keeping information on paper, pins on maps or going through your quest log really does help. The lack of handholding is quite refreshing, particularly true with the sidequests in the city of Baldur's Gate itself, many of them requires actually exploring the city and keeping notes on the many taverns and houses with important NPCs. Clues can also be found by talking to NPCs, drinking in pubs, and breaking in on some seemingly unimportant houses. Such as the time I murdered a priestess for an evil sea Goddess, simply because she ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off with her haughty talk, finding that she was carrying the body of a dead child on her. Spent a good hour finding the dead kid's parents. Plenty of quests can be discovered in many ways, unique objects you find in the game you won't realise the importance until much later.Worth noting for new players is that most non-magical metal weapons will break often. This is due to the iron crisis that you have to investigate. It makes sense for melee characters to invest and drop a proficiency point into weapons like clubs or staves, until you finally get your mitts on a decent +1 weapon. Your endgame character level should be around 7 or 8, you will spend an lot of time in the lower character levels. Fighting early on, especially if you choose weapons your character isn't proficiencent in, will involve both you and your enemies just facing off each other and missing nearly every attack. Combat gets more exciting around level 3 onwards, when spellcasters have access to more spells, and your attacks will connect with your enemies more.One thing I absolutely loved about BGII, which is unfortunatly an little lacking here, is the variety of areas you can visit. Many of the areas in this game are variations of outdoor woodlands - some with hills, some with mountains, some with a coast, but most of are generally similar. There are also many taverns, inns and houses which seem the same and most don't serve a purpose in the plot or any sidemissions. But, on the otherhand, they do add a sense of scale and size to the game, an actual sense of adventure. And it does feel good to accidentally stumble onto an intresting sidequest or story: I had my rogue unlock a generic looking house by the docks in the city, only to find it's occupied by a sea-nymph who escaped from the sea, captured by a fisherman who took her to his home, she seduced and murdered her capturers, and attempted to do the same to me. There are many, many characters that can join you in this game. Unlike in more modern RPGs, lots of them will leave the game for good if you reject their offer to join. I will have to say, that compared to BGII, and with Bioware's games since then, this is to me Baldur's Gate biggest weakness lies. With that many companions, it does feel like they're spread very thin. There isn't an lot of intercompany banter, you will hear the same lines over and over, and there is generally very little interaction with them. I had Imoen in my party almost all the way through, I don't recall any more new lines after her consolation for Gorion's death at the start. I don't recall Xzar and Montaron having more to say after you solved the issue of the poor quality iron from the Nashkel mines. I understand the reason for this may be perhaps due how dangerous the world is, a follower can die and you may not be able to resurrect them. That said, I still prefer Baldur's Gate II's approach to NPCs, fewer and more detailed, with interesting and involving personal missions.  On the technical side, in my ~40 hour playthrough from start to end, I've encountered at least two or three crash to desktop bugs. There is one very annoying bug with the map - you can place ""pins"" on the map as notes for areas and NPCs you might need to come back to at an later date. For example, a woman in Nashkel wants you to find out what happened to her miner husband Jospeh. You might want to ""pin"" her house so you know which one it is when you return. Unfortunatly the pin and the name you gave it will sometimes appear in maps other than Nashkel. FPS is limited to 30, I understand that you can increase the limit in the .ini file. I understand some people have encountered bugs that prevented the completion of certain sidequests, I personally have not run into any of these. I played the game with the Core Rules on, aside from two or three unavoidable fights, I never felt particularly challenged by the combat, nor had to reload a fight that went south. That said, there are harder game modes to try, as well as the Solo challenge.  In conclusion: Loved the sense of adventure, the variety of classes/kits on offer, and the game respects your ability to pay attention and not required to be guided throughout the experince. I personally found Baldur's Gate II epic size and variety closer to my liking, but I still appreciated Baldur's Gate's more down to earth approach to high fantasy. I would reccomend this game even for those who have cut their teeth on more modern RPGs (such as Dragon Age, The Witcher or Pillars of Eternity), and won't mind overlooking some dated graphics for a rewarding RPG experince.The Good: simple but effective story, sense of scale and adventure.The Bad: combat, especially early in the game, is a bit dull. Even core-difficulty might be an the easy side for some.The Ugly: aside from the very few instances in my 100 hours playing crashed to desktop, none really.			"

The game is great, it was what it was back in the 1990s and i love that there is a steap learning curve and when you create your character if you dont know what your doing with your stats you can get screwed over or if you do make the game more chaligen on any difficulty.This is a slow game if your going into the exspecting something like skyrim you will be disaponted.It is a party based rpg you can have up too 5 other people with you each with there own class, wepon prefrences and alignmentsSo why am i giveing it a negitive reviwe beamdog. its the technical issues that i can't get by, with there update that came with the release of the sige of dradonspear they have messed with the character modles, they now look like they belong in a bad cellshaded game and with some of the grafic setings turned on they actualy look worse. The new character sheet is a jumbled mess all your information is broken into new tabs some of witch only have two lines of text. plus this update deleveled my characters 2 levels each and dont change the text and font size at least for me doing so caused the game to look like im playing it ten feet away from my computer.

												An RPG classic, updated with lots of ease of use and convenience tweaks, customization options, and improved modding support. (Yeah, I'm not a fan of the new 2.0 character sheet, either, but now the interface is very easily moddable, so you can change it if you want!) Story-wise it's not as developed as BG2; there's a lot of just wandering around having random encounters in the wilderness, and there's not much interaction with your party members. However, I actually prefer low-level 2nd edition D&D combat to high-level ""mage chess,"" and there's an active modding community with plenty of ways to add NPC interaction and other enhancements to your game.The biggest downside is that Steam makes you install updates before playing, which will break any mods you have installed and wreak havoc with your savegames using those mods. You have to backup your old modded game and launch it outside of Steam in order to keep playing. I don't know if this will get fixed in the future, but it's an important consideration if you're thinking about whether to buy BGEE from Steam or GOG.			"

												Incompetent company, releases clearly untested patches. 2.0 ruined the game with new bugs, terrible interface (which didn't need fixing), awful ""new"" graphics etc. My 25 STR mage says hello by the way. Buy the classic version from gog and install patches and mods instead.			"

												If only steam would allow an ""iffy"" review. Because this is a mixed bag. The game used to be perfect. I say *used* to be perfect until the 2.0 update rolled around which dinged it up a bit. The actions of the beamdog team didn't help it either.Okay so here's the good: the graphics have been updated for new machines and three new companions have been added. A mage named Neera who accidentally blows stuff up, a monk named Rassaad, and Dorn Il-khan an orc blackguard (and certified motherf***er) on a mission of revenge. Class kits and high level spells are also in this game adding a ton of flexibility to it.The bad: As of 4/14/2016 there are random CTDs and this one rage inducing bug that literally changes the game's difficulty slider (randomly turning on story mode when you want hard difficulty) a handful of graphical bugs. Edit: They released a patch recently to fix these bugs. To the best of my knowledge, the difficulty sliding bug is no more.Now this part is just me, and also a few others, but I feel this should be brought up: The people that ""enhanced"" this game have no respect what so ever for the original game or it's fanbase (calling the original sexist, calling critics misogynists and transphobes) When they were called out on it, they made a backhanded statement, anyone who called out their bad writing, or the writers themselves for their lack of repsect, were labelled ""Gamergaters"" and just hand waved the complaints.So here's what I think... MAYBE buy this. DON'T buy at full price if you do (wait until it goes to, like, %75 of on a sale or something.) MAYBE pick up the original off amazon just in case they break it more.And whatever you do, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THE DLC! Unless you like broken quests, annoying characters, high-school tier writing, mary sues, and railroading.			"

												I havent bought the DLC and I dont know what the big deal is, but for the main game; I find it annoying. The gameplay is complicated. The characters dont attack monsters unless one does a character pre-set thing in a submenu. They die instantly and the monsters are unclear if they are overpowering or not. I try to play the game and I will probably play it more, but as of the first 6 hours I am stuck and displeased.			"

												Baldur's Gate is the type of game that once you learn all the rules and DnD Dice rolling maddness it will become an obsession. Intill then this game with wip you like catholic nun and it is not forgiving to anybody new DnD rpgs. That said is why this game is worth your time and effort. The joy comes in learning rules(4th edition DnD) and becoming the master of something that seemed impossible when you first started. I reccomend this game to anybody who is new to CRPGS and DnD games and is willing to actaully read guides on the internet and endure many deaths and game restartes intill they get the hang of it( it will grow some hair on your face) also long time DnD fans and those who have read any books that take place in the forgotten realms-(game setting).

												A great game with an amazing story, lore, and diversity. Although the story starts out slow, it greatly picks up the pace later on.  Pretty much any special enchanted item has an interesting back story behind it. The amount of classes, items, and spells in this game is gigantic. Another thing, some of the dialog choices are pretty funny.However, there are problems with this game.1) It's a game that focuses on strategic combat. So some fights can be ridiculously hard. This might even be harder if you're someone who isn't familiar with knights of the old republic style of combat. It can also become tedious and tiresome. 2) Yes, the graphics are dated. If you're the type of person that can't play older style of rpg's, it might be hard to get into. 3) Because they put baldur's gate into the baldur's gate 2 engine, there are some nasty bugs which may have to do with the scripting. Examples being->everlasting battle music, certain quest items becoming unusable, and some bosses just despawning. 4) They didn't fix the pathfinding in this enhanced edition. So you have to baby sit your characters to make sure they go to the right place. 5) Most of the time you have a choice on what happens, but not in some instances. I won't make a spoiler, but some choices severely punish you. As in you're suppose to make a certain choice or you die. If you can get over these flaws, you will find that Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is well worth a playthrough.			"

												I bought this game when it was first enhanced, but haven't reviewed it until the 2.0 release.  The 2.0 release is trouble.  Beamdog has taken upon themselves to modify a classic game to their liking, in a hodgepodge, buggy and non-canonical sort of way, rather than make their own game.If I could go back to the 1.x enhanced edition I would, since it's approach was more conservative, but now, since there is no ""classic mode"" of BG enhanced, there is no way to play simply a modernized version of BG without Beamdog's new take on how the game should be.  Instead, I'll have to install the old version from GOG.Beamdog should really consider offering a vanilla BG enhanced.  I have to rate their additions as not recommended because new fans will think the new chars and new interface they've added is BG and simply not play the original.  The enhanced edition started as a celebration of the classic, and now is a frankenstein based on beamdog's bottom line and inability to make their own retro rpg.			"

												Fantastic classic game.  The only question is whether to get Baldur's Game: Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition or to pick up the originals on GOG.com and use mods to combine them and play them at their best with lots of user created content optionally added as well.  The Enchanced Editions win on ease of use but if you are planning to seriously get into these games then playing the originals modded currently offers the most options.  This may change as people mod the Enhanced Editions more.			"

												I hate writing negative review about anything ,especially when a game is your beloved one.This comment will be an exception.I played this 'enchanted' edition for half an hour and I must say that everything,every detail about this edition seems wrong.I loved the art style of the old game but they killed that ambiance in new edition.I started with Shaman and I think it doesn't fit into the storyline.I will update after I play significantly long but until that day I doubt that this impression will change.We will see.They could have at least learned something from the creators of the Monkey Island (The special edition also has its drawback but the at least  player can switch between editions).I know that they introduced new things into game but they could have managed something better.Anyway, it is better to stick with old edition.

												I would not recommend buying this from Beamdog.  Just buy the original version and mod it, you won't miss much.   This game series has always been a favorite of mine.  I bought the original version when it first came out and have played it many times through-out the years.  Most people would assume that an ""enhanced version"" would be a better version.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  I struggle to see any actual enhancements which make this game worth buying and the numerous bugs overshadow any actual features that were added.The hours I've logged so far to this game have all been multiplayer, so my experience is written from that point of view only.  I remain impressed at how this company took an original game which ran great and introduced numerous frustrating, sometimes game breaking, bugs.  More than once now, I've had to use cheats to fix my game so that its playable again for things like disappearing items and entering required game zones which crash the game every time.  At one point all of my saves would no longer run.  I had to wait for an update which took a month to fix the saves so that I could play again without starting over.  To make it worse, it seems like every update introduces ""exciting"" new bugs.  There really isn't much worthwhile in terms of enhancements. It has been a test of patience to continue playing this game with a friend.  We have quit playing before because the crashes and freezes became too frustrating.  I wonder how much of my logged play time is actually just from restarting the game because of a game crash or bug.  My faith in Beamdog hit a new low when I read about what they did with their DragonSpear expansion.  Hiring a developer who has an admitted agenda of forcing her politically correct views into games is not okay.  She changed established character backgrounds from BG1 in the expansion just to meet her view of how characters in this fantasy world should be.  I won't be buying anything further from a company that is so disrespectful to such a legendary game series.  Here is a list of some of the bugs that I've encountered in multiplayer.- Game freezes for multiplayer friends if the main character dies.  All players must completely exit and restart game to fix.- Can no longer enter the Friendly Arm Inn without crashing- Items have disappeared from inventory more than once- Saved games won't load, forcing you to use an older save- Friends in multiplayer are VERY frequently randomly booted- UI sometimes randomly disappears altogether- Many random crashes to desktop which don't appear to have a repeatable cause			"

												At first, I was happy I could finish this game, after some 13 years of stopping at Nashkel Mines and never going through with it. The graphical update is well-made, and I appreciate Linux-compatibility, even though AI path-finding is still a mess. With all that said, I did not miss much since 1998, I'm afraid. Mechanically, this game didn't age well. Might not have been that good at the time either, but such was the zeitgeist. Design had come a long way since then, and has improved upon much of the formulae of these rpgs. The breaking steel weapons, while integral to the main story, are quite irritating early on, as they represent no challenge besides managing the inventory of several party members. All of whom are limited in carry-capacity by their strength. While it does make sense that your wizard would not be able to carry four sets of metal armour on their back, neither does it for Minsc, nor my Dwarven defender main character. Money is all around the place, and after some time, you only look potions and arrows. Magic items available in shops are not all that good, and I have only spent money on purchasing the party's first +1 weapons, which are magical and do not break. I was sitting on over 50 thousand gold by the end, not even bothering with selling things after some time.Outside of these early purchases, the way of progression is generally looting and pillaging, which made me feel like we were a party of murder-hobos masquerading as heroes (renown maxed with good deeds and not killing town guards). The game world feels static, many models are standing around the town of Baldur's Gate, yet people are pushing their own unconnected agendas with you playing the henchmen or merry matchmaker. Boring. I did go into length to do as many side-quests as possible, but it made little difference. The world did not come more alive for all my troubles. The story was bland if anything, and conversational choices mostly boiled down to 1, being nice, 2, wanting money for being nice and 3, acting rude, stabbing people and generally not being very nice. There was no opportunity in changing the flow of conversations or saving face once you lost it, which is not fun. Many of the characters feel out of place, thrown into the setting as “that dude in front of a house who gives you a quest that takes you to the next location”. Companion characters not connected strictly to the main story come at you seemingly random, many in the middle of the wilderness or a road, and you most probably already have a full party of capable individuals and cannot be bothered to dismiss someone just to check out what this new random bloke could bring to the party. I simply went with an early-game group of lawful neutral and good individuals, as boring that might sound. I did get Khalid killed early on though, as he was not bringing anything to the party, however, Jaheira, our druid would have left if the fighter got dismissed. Game-play wise, AD&D is really bad, and I wish they had gone with a better system. Then again, such was the time. In this game it is perfectly justifiable to make a bard character who then sits out all fights, singing and thus bringing +2 attack value to the rest of the party, because bonuses could mean that much. Then again, I made a steel wall made out of dwarf, a true craftsmanship of his kind I must say, who walked up to people and hit them for damage beyond the baseline health of most spell-casters. Exploding corpses were a triviality during our adventures. That said, fights are challenging and can be frustrating at times due to the nature of saving throws in the d20 system. Memorizing spells was a bother, and I never liked it in D&D and its variants. It's not good design, and I am glad video game creators put these kind of player-limiting stupidity behind us. As for the content added by Beamdog, the creators of this Enhanced Edition, well, I wish they didn't force so much their impossibly irritating, edgy female character, Neera. The encounter triggers a fight whether you like it or not, and ends in an offer to recruit the mage, whether you like it or not. Well, I just slit her throat. Good riddance! Her voice-acting was worse than that of Imoen's, and that is compliment I never thought I would give that character. All in all, Beamdog failed to improve on the mediocre writing already present in the game.As a closing thought, I think I would have enjoyed Baldur's Gate more if the system was based on GURPS.			"

												I'm currently in college and have next to no time on my hands. I played Baldur's Gate during winter break in 2015 with a couple of friends and had a great time, though we never got close to beating the game. I hadn't played it since until today. I saw the huge controversy surrounding the new expansion as well as the overhaul that it brought, which was implemented into even the base game. Furthermore, I saw many of the negative reviews it was getting on Steam. I had to get back into the game. I had to check it out. Oh. My. God. What have they done?

												Baldurs's Gate I is a great game and I've loved it since its first release. I expected this version to be polished and running without any problems (no need to install mods etc.). Yes, it is extremely easy to install and start this version. But it's also extremely annoying to play it because it can freeze (crash) 30times in one hour... And even if it runs, it lags when you move something in the inventory - it's not doing this all the time, sometimes everything is fine, but in like 2/3 of the time each move of an item requires you to wait for 2 seconds.I searched the internet for days, found multiple fixes (turn off antivir, start as admin, use compatibility with XP/Vista/Whatever, run windowed/fullscreen, increase/decrease framerate, countless number of workarounds), some of them seemed to be working, but all the problems were back in few minutes. I even copied the game files to a different folder (simpler path) and played it without Steam, which also didn't help. But I have more hours in the game than Steam shows for me.I was leveling Imoen 10times before I finaly could distribute all thief skill points without the game crashing (freezing, forcing me to restart it). I was trying to get an item identified at a shop 15times before I gave up and dropped the item. I have been trying to sell my loot from the Durlag's Tower at a shop so many times now that I stopped playing the game. I'm not having fun anymore.From the new features I noticed only the quick loot dialog, which is quite fine. And of course the fact the the game looks and works like BGII now, which is really great (no sarcasm).New content is tied to new characters and if you don't want them in your party (I didn't), you get nothing new.As far as the game itself (BG) is concerned, I recommend it absolutely. But this Enhanced Edition is not worth it, you should rather get some other version, especially if you can get it cheaper.			"

												I have this version and another site's version, called the Complete Saga which includes ToTSC. Although I have a lot of hours on this version, I now play the (GOG) version, which used to be cheaper (a different story).I'm writing this for my past self and anyone new (that is aged 12-18) to RPGs looking to get into what are regarded by some CRPG lovers as the best who might click this, see the Enhanced Edition moniker, and believe that this is the definitive version of the game.Unfortunately the base version of this Enhanced Edition has AI as pathetic as the original, low quality, mod-tier NPCs, and a UI vastly different from the original's but without any improvements. (The 431 hours I have were spent avoiding the NPCs after the first playthrough, were modded with at least Sword Coast Stratagems, and were before Dragonspear.)The EE is not a definitive version of Baldur's Gate. In fact, there is no definitive, polished, best version of this game, anywhere. It's something you have to scrap together from separate resources, and even then, you likely won't create the best version of the game. I just spent some hours a few days ago trying to reinstall the game on a different PC before I gave up and started playing Baldur's Gate II. And I'm not an idiot. The installation process for the mods is archaic and so easy to make a mistake. There are even differences between modding BG and BG2 because one of the best mods for BG converts it to BG2's engine, but the BG (tutu) is not exactly the same as BG2.Beamdog set out to enhance the game, but they did not make the game better than what is possible with mods.But regardless of my personal feelings towards Beamdog and their added content, I can't recommend this game even if you were looking to play it as soon as you download it. The Enhanced Edition has had a bad history with bugs. They've added patches designed to quash the bugs of their previous patches which introduced new bugs. Their patches are not stable.Baldur's Gate Original Saga is an old game that works. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is a newer game that often does not work.			"

												Singlehandedly one of the greatest CRPGs ever made. If you have any care for Dungeons and Dragons then you need to play this game. Its based off of D&D 2nd edition rules and very faithfully creates that feeling of playing Pen and Paper Dungeons and Dragons. The story is very well written and the character customization is pretty spot on with what you expect from D&D. I'd love to see more playable races such as Gnolls, Kobolds, Tieflings, and half-dragons (or dragonborn), but that isn't required to make this a good game. The controls may take a little getting used to as the game uses a real time turn based which means pausing the battles will be common and frequent.			"

HOWEVER over half a year and no updates, hotfixes or patches in its current state of mod-breaking bugs  and bugs in general. No ETA on fixes or updates, nothing but ""soon"" for the past half a year. Well its been only 6+ months but hey you know whats on their newsfeed? A NEW secret game that they are developing and need testers for. Sorry Beamdog we are breaking up, my wallet no longer loves you.			"

												Forgive my english - This isn't a review but more of a testimony. 14 hours in.I just started playing the classics for my first time. I played DOS which led to Wasteland which was based on fallout1-2 and I enjoyed  Wasteland. So I tried Fallout 2 and I didn't get it for the first 4 hours(at least) and I quit once and started over. But after the initial fail I  really really enjoyed the game. I can't say I ever played a better one. It's an epic story of honor and revenge. Skyrim, witcher2 , ME12, DAO ... it was as good as any of them. So I couldn't play yet another post apocalypse rpg so i decided to try BG2 which everyone seems to agree is one of the top rpgs of all time. I struggled again at the beginning. 6 hours of not liking the game and I also quit once.  And then I started to get into it. It had better party building than Fallout2 and the world  was starting to get interesting   So I stopped because I knew I needed to play BG in order to fully appreciate BG2 because they reference BG in the dialogue.OK, so now I'm playing BG and again the first 4 hours sucked. I was even bored. Even though I knew the UI and play style already from BG2. Again I quit (went back) once and changed some decisions. I didn't pick up Minsc (yet) because I hated the time limit on the quest. It made me nervous. So, anyway, I finally acclimated to the pace and game style and it is a great game so far. Since it's my first run through it's a challenge. I've already lost 2 men (who I didn't mind losing or else I would have loaded the last save).  The combat is fun. Really though the balance is incredible.  The action happens in well spaced intervals. So far the side quests are fun. I'm in no rush to push the game along.  Level progress is nice and slow. I feel very underdeveloped now and I'm happy to have this gang I've put together. Some of them are selfish. One is evil. All are quirky.  Money is scarce.  And I'm not sure what's going on and why I'm being hunted. We are heading down to Neshkel because that's where the actions at. I was there and a bit further t on my first runthrough but I rage quit. This time it's  nicer.I'm sure this game is going to be great. I guess the point of this ""review"" is that you might need to take some time to get into these older games. Once you acclimate to the graphics and the pace you no longer miss anythig about the new games and you get all this great game programing and story telling by  people who REALLY loved their product . Not the ""this is a game made with love"" BS tag line the reviewers say about EVERY game now. This one was obviously made by people who loved  games and fantasy. The action is fun once you learn the rules.The text , which is a main fake complaint about old school rpgs is fine. ""the wall of text"" stuff is a myth. It's the opposite. The writing reflects the ""efficiency"" of text based adventures from the era. Zork (the first text adventure?) never gives you more than a few lines to read. It's the same with BG. Those writers were more skilled than todays. I loved Skyrim but the writing in BG is superior. Skyrim gets long winded and repetitive.			"

												When this first came out, I embraced the idea - I'm not a hardcore purist (some complain about some ""out-of-place"" changes to the game).Sure, early on there were a number of bugs, not all of them were bad though, some of the bugs could even be funny.After a while they patched it some and it worked better (aww, some nice bugs are gone) :P...But then they patched it some more.Now I really wish I could roll back the game to an earlier version.Why?The later patches introduced a very poorly coded graphical ""update"" which allowed zooming in and out. In theory that's a great feature, and it can even be disabled, however...The way their updated game/shaders handles the texture-scaling IS SO BAD that they made a 16year old game look WORSE than on its release - even if you turn the zooming feature off (because it will still use the new crappy rendering regardless).For your information I used to be a game programmer (then switched over to academic research), which is how I know this could, and should, have been done a hundred times better - they seriously need to fire the guy responsible for the new rendering. It's basically the least effort implementation possible, using the most basic form of blurry texture stretching available instead of using any of the many techniques more suitable for pixel-graphics - of which there exists many to choose from - or even just a better general purpose one!I would be ashamed to put this graphics update on my resumé unless there was some special condition attached to it like ""they only gave me a single evening to complete it"" or ""I didn't get paid"" (but then that just begs to question why I would put it on my resumé at all).Because of my past occupation this is like a sore thumb constantly irritating and distracting me - knowing what an insultingly bad implementation they used. Call it an occupational hazard, but I simply couldn't enjoy the game anymore because of this.Edit: Just tried it out again and it seems they have fired that guy! :D(Or he/she got his/her ♥♥♥♥ together.)Once again I can enjoy / recommend this game. Keep playing! :)			"

												The original Baldur's gate was a fantastic game, it was a genre defining RPG that original version holds up amazingly (if you can get your hands on a CD copy), yet this version seems to have improved on an almost perfect game. The remastered graphics are exceptional and the smoothness in the way this game runs leaves many other Steam games in it's wake. I don't know what more can be said - if you like D&D buy this game, if you like RPG's buy this game, if you like gaming buy this game, basically just buy this game.

												I fell in love with one side character and one side character alone, his name was Minsc. MY other party members were too busy calling me queer, ""why aren't you a queer fellow"" -Imoenor telling me I was going to fail, ""Our quest is vain"" -Xanfor me to care for them.Minsc, however, took the feet out from under my feet and always knew what to say to keep me going in the right direction, ""butt-kicking for goodness!"" -MinscMinsc only wanted one thing in return for his presence. To free his friend from the vile scourge of a gnoll encampment. I was more than willing to assist Minsc to achieve his goal, but I was currently on my way to vanquish the foes that were tormenting the Nanshekel mines, but I assured Minsc I would help after.As soon as I breathed my first breath of air from the godforsaken mines of Nanshekel I gave Minsc one of those sexy side winks, but all he could reply with was, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, watch it! I'm huge!""I could tell Minsc was growing impatient, so I pushed on towards to the gnoll encampment without any delay. We were unfortunately walaid by many the highwayman and foe. I thought Minsc was enjoying the adventure with his enthusiastc war yaps, ""The squeeky wheel gets the kick"", I was wrong, however, so very wrong.I was precisely one load zone away from the gnoll encampment (one ****ing loadzone!), filled with glee to help my friend Minsc, but when we got there I then understood true disapointment. We loaded in and I looked to Minsc hoping to see gaiety and pride. Instead I saw hate and utter disapointment, ""hey  Minsc, heh, so we got to the gnolls like you wanted, heh, ready to save your friend?""Unfortunately there was no love left to be felt by Minsc' eyes. His eyes were black and full of rage like a shark that smells blood.""Heh, hey Minsc, heh, ready to go save your friend?""In one fell swoop Minsc drew his +1 two-handed sword and dropped the negative-nancy wizard, Xan, like a dirty sack of potatoes.""Minsc! What are you doing?!""""You say you help save friend, but You not help at all!!!"" Then Minsc began hacking the not so politically correct and naive rogue, Imoen, but I didn't care. All I cared was that I get through to my one true side character Minsc, so I did the only thing I could do. I Ran.I began running frantically through the gnoll stronghold, praying that Minsc would recognize we were where he wanted to be all along and stop slashing at my dwarf cleric main character, ""Owen"", instead I now had an army of gnolls chasing me and my beloved Minsc who couldn't care two shakes about the gnoll army that he was now seemingly a part of from my perspective.I continued running, pleading through my laptop screen until I hit a dead end and there was no where left for me to run. My escape was blocked by an angry horde of gnolls, and an even angrier Minsc.I tried besting the gnolls in hopes it would in someway calm Minsc down, but when he came within striking distance of me all I could feel was the sharp cold iron impale me just under my ribcage and I collapsed like house of cards in a pool of not only my own blood, by also that of gnoll, looking up at my beloved Minsc, ""I forgive you"" I whispered.""*Squeak* Boo says that he was just doing his job,"" -Minsc.10/10 would fall in love with Minsc, only to be killed by him again.

												I always loved playing this Baldur's Gate. Since the OG in 1998 to the ones on PS2 its been my favorite RPG.  Mainly because it takes place in the D&D world. And I am glad someone is trying to bring the old game back to life.There are a lot of bugs still in this game. Not as much as the OG. As there is a lot of them fixed, and you don't need to download a ton of mods to fix it. I think what ever the last patch added however, messed the save games up. It just deleted them. Then I notice the picture was missing for those save games and you can CLICK on an invisible picture. SOMETIMES it lets you load it, most the time(like 95% of the time) it doesn't. I tried starting a new character. Saved. Went to load it. It was not there.What I think would make this game better, is more items to choose from. Seriously beamdog, pick up a D&D players handbook, and just make more weapons. IE: Rapier, Hand Cross bow, Blow gun(useless, but still) Great Axe, Maul, just more basic stuff. More visual, hell, why not just update the rules a bit more as well, and add in more of the Lore that is in the Sword Coast(seens how they just made another expanison for D&D 5.0 based in the Sword Coast) than just the little bit that you have done and then want to charge $20.00 for.I would still recommend this Game however. But I doubt most people want to pay 20 for a game from 98 with just some paint added to it.			"

												Hi, I'm not much of a reviewer but just tried this for the first time and was a bit disappointed. The graphics and overall performance is very sluggish or how you say it. I would have thought they could have made it smooth, but at least with my system:Intel Core i7 4790K @ 4.00GHz16,0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 799MHz (10-10-10-30)4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 (ASUStek Computer Inc)etc. it isn't.Of course the main point for this great game is not the graphics, but still it makes a difference to me. It looks a bit like Ultima 6 with outlined characters imo but at that time at least it was obvious it was sluggish.... I have to admit I haven't played this but only few minutes, but this is the first impression. The same good game is there of course, but... As I have played it years back ago (the original that is) and I also have Baldur's Gate II via gog.com, I think this ""enhanced"" isn't worth the money. Though they do sell this also on gog.com...I don't recommend this version, but just my opinion so take it as it is.Cheers...			"

												Definitely was way ahead of its time in the RPG game world. I highly recomend if you are big into D&D or fan of old style RPG games. Definitley fixed tons of bugs and stuff that was in the original version, however wouldnt recomend to anyone expecting a graphically ""enhanced"" game as it looks pretty much the same as before, and not a whole lot of options at all still in the graphics settings menu. gui still stretched in wide mode and stuff. But theres 3 new heroes that can join you, there's Neera, a ""wild mage"" with really nice variety of spells, Dorn Il-Khan, a dour warrior, and an initially weak monk Rasaad yn Bashir. a nice addition seeing as theres already over 100 hours of gameplay here.All in all this isn't a remake of the classic Baldur's Gate but rather a more flushed out improvement of the original game.The game has definitley aged well tho. and I recomend picking it up if it goes on sale. great for those late night LAN parties.

												So I wanted to rekindle my youth and bought BG1.I think it's been like 15 years since I last played it and I still remember a lot of the dialogues.

												Baldur's Gate is one of my all time favorite RPGs.  It is a turn based role playing game that emulates 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.  It is based in the Forgotten Realms in the Sword Coast region.  The story line is fun and engaging.  The level up process is interesting and rewarding and the Non Player Characters are fleshed out well. The Enhanced Edition has only made it better.  Besides ironing out some bugs from the original game, they also added some new NPC players complete with side quests.  I also like that they have enabled all of the extra classes from Baldur's Gate II.I have always like BG1 over BG2 because it doesn't feel as ""rail roady"".  You eventually do have to finish the main quest but along the way they give you quite a bit of latitutude to do side quests.In all this is an Amazing game.			"

												Everyone that likes RPGs should play through the Baldur's gate series at some point. It's among my favorite games ever. I think the second game is a lot better, but I still recommend this game. The enhanced edition doesn't add a lot, but I would still recommend it. It's made for modern computers and doesn't require mods to be played. The new companions is a good addition to the game, and I like the new UI. I really really recommend getting some of the best mods like Sword Coast Stratagems, as the game gets more challeninging, but in a better way than just increasing the difficulty (AI improvements).

												As Fallout was to Wasteland, so too was Baldur's Gate to the text based fantasy adventures and RPGs that came before it. An isometric classic, Baldur's Gate paved the way for now-legendary D&D PC Forgotten Realms RPG titles like Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and Neverwinter Nights. With the Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate has now been repackaged to include the expansion, Talers of the Sword Cost, and been reoptimzed with modern resolutions and compatability fixes.Potential customers should know that with Baldur's Gate they are getting an epic classic RPG adventure and the ability to import their playthrough into Baldur's Gate II, also released with an Enhanced Edition. The price you pay for this adventure is an RPG that, like many of its time, does not hold hands. You will be expected to make a charachter and maintain that charachter and a party of adventures through the archaic (even at its time) AD&D 2nd Edition ruleset. Conversation paths and encounters can open up or lock you out of future quests without warning. A single unprepared encounter with a greater basilisk, a web trapped giant spider enclave, or a wizard ambush can decimate even over-leveled parties in seconds. While many classic RPG fans would call Baldur's Gate a ""must play"", I fully acknowledge that the depth, openness, and difficulty of the series can be a major turnoff to modern gamers. To those who take the plunge, feel free to hit me up with advice for charachter creation and remember that the Q key is for quicksaves. Use it often.  "

												I had played this game as a kid and went into it with a huge nostalgia bonus, but I can't in good conscience recommend it anymore. Don't be fooled by the ""Enhanced Edition""moniker, the game is still filled from top to bottom with bugs and frustrations. The storyline is decent (though those of the sidequests and companions aren't) and in the higher levels the tactical, semi-turn-based D&D combat still is a big draw, but it's not nearly enough to make up for all the problems.Balancing for example simply doesn't exist. The early levels are especially horrible since dying or not constantly hinges on a single dice roll (you have less total hp than most enemies can dish out in damage with one hit). The later levels are mostly okay, except for the new content from the expansion, that is simply frustrating and no fun at all. Still, throughout the entire game it all boils down to quicksaving after every fight and then reloading whenever something goes wrong, over and over until the dice fall into the place you need them to. I'm sorry, but don't buy this.			"

												It's very dated and repetitive. Neverwinter Nights provides a much more pleasant experience and superior story, without the illogical difficulty spokes and inability to dissuade attackers with persuasion skills. I recommend it for multiplayer (if it works for you.. there are many disconnects) and people who are die-hard fans of the series. I am currently doing a single playthrough with my best friend, and I'm enjoying bits and pieces of it, but we find ourselves taking breaks often. I am on the fence about this game, so I will put some + and - points.+ Lots of classes to choose from!Like a true d&d game, there are many classes to choose from. Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, Paladin, Thief, Sorcerer, Wizard, Bard-- etc! Each of these classes has kits that modify certain abilities or restrictions, allowing for quite a bit of experimenting.+ Large game with many areas to exploreYou'll end up spending about two hours making your first character if you're googling for help at the same time. I actually enjoy the process of designing a new character so this is fine by me. After all that, you get a bit of story with not too much text, and you're off into the world. There are a lot of things to do, and the game does direct you to certain places, though very few places are restricted.+ They let you be evil or good to peopleI'm not into the whole being a jerk to people thing, but if you like that stuff then you'll at least appreciate all the murderous options given to you. As a bad boy/girl, you'll get into trouble with the nicer people in the world.= Okayish story, not overwhelmingly soI already know the plot, and it's kind of cool. Essentially you can explain the plot in two sentences but the game takes its time to introduce it to you. If you're attentive enough, you'll probably figure it all out before the great reveal.= MultiplayerMultiplayer is fun with a friend if it doesn't disconnect too much. There isn't much else to say about this, though. Some people might prefer to be alone because they'd have full control over all party members.- The way stats work in this version of d&dYou don't get combat benefits from having 10-16 strength, but you do get it from having 17 or 18. Dexterity should always be 18 to get better armor (..which you'll need), constitution is a big deal, intelligence does absolutely nothing unless you're a wizard, wisdom is similar. They also force classes to have stats that they don't exactly benefit from! This version of d&d is just a bit too primitive in certain aspects, and I recommend Neverwinter Nights because all stats do something to benefit your character, and not having max stats is perfectly fine.- Difficulty spikes, often killed instantly by attackersThe amount of times you get talked to by a mage and then get charmed/feared, after which you are killed because you lost control of your character .. is staggering. There aren't many ways to counter this, and I remember one quest that instantly kills your character during dialog with no warning or means to escape it. This means you'll end up saving and loading a lot, and possibly avoiding conversation just so you can get the first attack off on your enemy (ie: you fireball them before they can even see you). Sometimes the game becomes too easy as well.- Not enough customization optionsENHANCED EDITION, it says. So let me play a redhead. It wouldn't have killed the developer to add some extra coloring options in the game, but at least they did improve things graphically a bit!TL:DR: imbalanced difficulty, unfair deaths, save and load constantly, dated mechanics. Neverwinter Nights is better, but if you enjoyed Neverwinter Nights and want some more RP things, this might do if the price is cheap :) Heard that Baldur's Gate 2 is far better than this one, so working your way to it with the first game might not be a bad idea.

												One of my all-time favourite games. Still holds up perfectly today. I enjoy how it's more open and loosely structured than the sequel, which gives the game a real sense of adventure as you don't know what you will stumble across next. Enhanced Edition content is ~okay~, tonally it's different to the OG content so it sticks out a bit, but it's worth a playthrough. The addition of Neera means there is now an excellent good-aligned mage to recruit. QOL improvements make this the definitive version.			"

												You must gather your party before venturing forth.———————————————————————————————————————————It seems that most of reviews have a deep affection for the original game a long time ago so they know about some differences between the original version and this EE and want to talk about it. As for Chinese reviews, there are just a whole lot of people complaining about localization. I am just a fresh newcomer to Baldur’s gate, actually this EE version and I think it couldn’t have changed much from the original one because the game is still sooooo great.I’ve beaten some Bioware games so I know some of the modern Bioware features: gorgeous main quest, lovable companions, tons of lore and some homosexual staff. Side quests, however, are not strong in those Bioware titles I've played such as in Mess Effect and Dragon Age. However, Baldur’s gate gives me a feeling more like it is a pioneer of skyrim for the open world exploration and endless side quests, or, more appropriately, side ""events"". It is the point of exploration in games that you can always encounter some interesting people and fun stories during your whether or not aimless wandering. That is why I like Bethesda games despite some of their poor designs. Many of those events in Baldur's gate does not have complete storylines. Some of them are just small moral choices to enrich lore. It does not mean that the game has weak side quests. On the contrary, some of the actual side quests are surprisingly good and there are not many simple “go to the dungeon and fetch me something” quests like in skyrim.The game feels like skyrim in some way. But judging from some other aspects, I guess it looks pretty Bioware, even though it might not be the modern Bioware I know. Companions, for example, are quite likable. However, companion part is in a quite similar situation like the quest part is in the game. We have a great amount of companions and nearly none of them have much to do about stories. Instead, they are just being different kinds of combatants with interesting characteristics. Companions in other bioware titles, such as dragon age, can be trustworthy friend, lovers that you really are in love with, tutors and students. Companions in Baldur’s gate are not as good as those in Dragon Age franchise in my opinion, but is still far better than some RPGs such as skyrim. Here I’d like to say that although beamdog might have messed something up in the game, they really did a good job writing and designing those new companions. Dorn and Neera are really cute and Rasaad is much more interesting than a common lawful good guy.The main quest in this game is applaudable, mainly owing to the last two chapters in my opinion. But it is not as good as many other RPGs. In Dragon Age Origin, the four branch main quests allow you to explore four kinds of distinguished powers in Thedas and every one of them is a fantastic adventure, letting you learn the lore from a dimensional point of view. In Baldur's gate, however, all of your heroic actions in early chapters is indeed solving local people problems as the hero does in DAO except the dungeons are less exciting. They are just mines filled with annoying traps. Those adventures in Tales of the Sword Coast expansion is much better and more intense in story and dungeons than those in the original game. Durlag’s tower is probably still one of the best designed dungeons in game history. Thanks to D&D rules, combat is fun in this game. I usually don’t care that much about combat components but I went through the manual thoroughly to get familiar with those rules. To me, the most fun part is spells. I’ve never seen so many different kinds of spells in one game. Many of them serves purposes, not just some kind of duplication. There are always different ways to beat enemies if you put your mage and spells in good use.To conclude the review, Baldur’s gate combines some of the good elements in popular modern RPGs from groups like Bethesda and Bioware as well as its own D&D derived story  and strategy-based combat. It might not be an appropriate expression since the game is much older than those modern titles. In that way, some part of the game may seem crude to a modern RPG fan. But that does not prevent the game from remaining a masterpiece even today. The game is still fun in today’s standard but enjoying the game needs some effort. At least remember to go back to the manual when you have questions. If you are interested in western RPGs and looking forward for more, I think Baldur’s Gate Enhanced Edition is a must play.			"

												One of the best RPGs using D&D rules in history. Even nowdays it outshines most of the titles of the same genre, for its memorable characters (Boo is still my hero) and the storyline, which is still one of the best around after 20 years. A masterpiece and personally one of my all time favorites, avoid it only if you hate the genre or games with an isometric worldview.What's good: -Tactical DnD combat, at higher difficulties it becomes prioritary to prepare for the toughest fights, besides choosing your companions wisely.-Charismatic characters to choose from as your companions throughout the game, each one with its own personality and will. A practical example: you're the usual lawful good paladin, saving maidens right and left, feeding ophans and so on? Do not expect that chaotic evil semi-pedophile dwarven mercenary to stay long in your party. -The game is full of side-quests, most of them rewarding and satisfying. -Characters interact with one another (mostly with you of course).-Romance system available for some characters, further developed in the sequel. You want to play something more like Dawson's Gate rather than Baldur's? Here you have it.-Entertaining storyline and decision making power. You can kill almost everyone in this game, but beware to face the consequences (I myself messed the game up once.)-Even without all of the side-quests, this game is pretty long. Without the expansion and all the side quests included in this enhanced edition, it will take you from 20 to 30 hours to beat the game, if you're not rushing it like mad.What's bad/ possibly not enjoyable for others:-If your a fan of 3D graphics this is not the game for you.-A little dated audio packs in some cases, not a big deal considering the epic soundtrack but still...-By contrast with what i wrote before, some may not appreciate the DnD dice based fighting system. If you're a fan of pure action oriented combat games you'll probably be disappointed in this one.-Objectively dumb racial restrictions in some cases. Why in the world can't I be a monk if I'm an half-elf? Or an elven paladin? Nothing fun-breaking yet still unsettling. To conclude, if you're a fan of traditional RPG or an open minded ACTION-RPG lover, this might be the game for you.PS. Nevermind the hours of gameplay Steam shows, I've beaten this game thrice or more in a non-Steam version, besides the countless hours I spent on the original one.			"

												""Enhanced Edition"" - no. They updated the resolution and probably removed the (now useless) performance-vs-quality options as well as a few visuals. Other than that it's just a few tweaks and features, but the whole engine (!) seems to have stayed the same - especially the netcode.How is that a problem? Well, the game crashes frequently, multiplayer is unreliable and lags, and the game freezes on various occasions (saving/connecting/transferring items/etc) that should not let a modern game freeze. Well, I thought that at least, regarding the ""Enhanced Edition"" suffix.I played BG2 in multiplayer before, and the UI is almost exactly like it - a good thing. But to my disappointment, all the bugs haven't been fixed, instead this game actually crashes more often than BG2 original.If it is reduced, you like RPGs, and you plan on playing singleplayer only, get this. Otherwise, better not support this attempt on getting money with a slightly updated old game (their only work was to fix/enhance the game - and they failed the first part).I feel like I should add that you get the ""DLC"" for the game (2 new chars, sound and icon packs) for free on the Steam edition.Seriously, did you even test the multiplayer before shipping?

												The enchanced edition is a new take on a perfect game by some of the original creators. There are still/new bugs, changes, some attempts to make it modern (knowing that some assets are lost and will never be able to be recovered or improved). The game is old, many new players will not like the visuals and rules, and that's alright, there're plenty of games for them out there. The dice rolls and art style are a huge part of the game, the EE kept most of the important features and added their own little things, UI improvements, some NPCs; with interesting enough quests; They fit well in what was already a great game, now with achievements, cloud and overlay.

												Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 are some of my most nostalgic games and among my Top 10 Favorite games of all time, i could play the original version over and over again and never get tired of it, thus i bought the Enhanced Edition of BGEE1 which at first it seemed like a great remake of the original classic.+Character Creation: This is one of my favorite parts of the game, creating your character.In the original Baldurs Gate there already were tons of diffrent ways you could create your characters.The Enchanced Edition however includes the Class Kits from Baldurs Gate 2 and with Multi-Classing and Dual Classing (which if im gonna try to explain the craziness of that this review would be twice as long) it makes for an insane ammount of replay value.Gameplay: I'v heard people say that this game is complicated  . .to which i say . . compared to modern versions like the Dragon Age games it kinda is, it can get really hard at times too but thats part of why i love Baldurs Gate and other D&D Games.Its not the kind of game you can just rush through, you have to have some strategy, pay attention and sorta ""learn"" the game.Music: In general a Good soundtrack, don't have much to say here honestly, there's nothing really specal that sticks out.Characters: Apart from the character creation and having lots of diffrent dialogue options to choose from, there's a total of 29 party members to choose from in the game including 4 new ones added to the Enchanced version which is a nice addition.You don't get to interact with them as much as you do in for example the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series and even though some of the Party members are more useful than others the ammount of people you can choose to have in your party alone makes for lots of replay value.Story: Bioware and Black Isle(Known as Obsidian Entertainment nowdays) have a talent for creating some great and intresting stories in video games and Baldurs Gate is no exception. It's one of the best things about this game in my opinion(dont wanna say much here because i dont wanna spoil anything)Graphics: May not look much compared to Modern games like the Dragon Age Series but(then again it is nearly 20 years old) back then i thought this game looked great dispite the awful resolution in the original version.Thankfully the Enhanced Edition puts the BG2 engine into the game and makes the resolution extremely nice.-The AI in both BG1 and 2 is really derpy at times, there have been plenty of times when i'm in a narrow dungeon and some of my characters go somewhere completely diffrent than what i told them(or even worse goes the wrong way right into a trap or an ambush).But thats a nitpick for me honestly.And then of course the thing everyone talks about the Siege of Dragonspear update, oh boy oh boy.While i don't like the new cartoonish sprites, they look really out of place in the game but i can tolerate that because at least you can disable them.There might be a couple of bugs here and there but i can forgive that.The thing that still really bothers me and made me stay away from this remake for a long time and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much that i even gave this game a ""thumps down"" review is the new UI(mainly the character sheet and the journal, seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ Beamdog!?).The new UI in both BG1 and 2 is Ugly as ♥♥♥♥ and i have no idea why someone would even think of changing it when the old one was just fine.Final Verdict: 10/10Even though i was really salty about the New UI when it was first released, after i sat down and replayed it... again and i realized i was just being unfair with my critisism here, the journal and the character sheet may look horrible compared to the old one this is still an epic game.Even after all these years Baldur's Gate still holds up as one of my Top 10 favorite games of all time, i could play this game forever and never get bored of it dispite the ugly UI.(That being said the new UI is still ugly as ♥♥♥♥ compared to the original one in the Enhanced Edition and Beamdog i would REALLY appricate it if you gave us the option to switch back to the old one!!)This game is basiclly one of the reasons why games like the Dragon Age series exists today and if you like me enjoy any RPG made by Bioware or RPGS in general this is a must buy.

												Baldur's Gate is one of those games that redefined CRPGs. While the original '98 release can be played, the Enchanced Edition adds quite a few needed fixes, additions and a little pick-me-up to function on modern computers and with modern players. Stats, tables and desperately needed explanations on what stat increases what function of your spell or swordslinging with a layout that is much more comfortable to your eyes than the original stone-carved stat screen.Starting out as a snot-nosed adventurer and rising up to be the would-be savior of the Sword Coast, your main character is what you want him to be: From Fighters to clerics, thieves and spellcasters, BG:EE adds all the proficiencies, weapon styles, spells and kits from Baldur's Gate 2 to the original and then some. No more spending that one Cloudkill scroll on a single battle, as it can be written and memorized by a Level 9 Wizard. It also comes with the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, giving you a much more tolerable level cap, if you happen to be a perfectionist when it comes to clearing quest logs.As curious extras, BG:EE adds *gasp* ORIGINAL CONTENT in the form of three New NPCS, new gear and a battle arena mini-campaign. These extras by no means overshadow the original saga one might have come to love, but add a few needed pinches of charm here and there for parties of all alignments. As a bonus, most of these additions continue their tale in BG2:EE, but that's a completely different story. TL;DR, Go for the eyes, Boo, GO FOR THE EYES, RAAAAaaAAaaAarrrRgGgghhhhhhHH!! even after 15 years..			"

But still to me it is the pinnacle of computer RPG and the one to which all the later CRPG's have been compared to and never quite lived up it.

												They enhanced the enhanced edition quite a bit so I decided to update my review. This version of the enhanced edition features an increase in resolution, a nice graphics filter that smooths out the pixelated graphics, a nice new map system, and more. The updated UI and game in general look very clean compared to before. The combat is still the same as always, and the story is still a classic. If you've never played it before and want to experience the story, this is a great way to do so, especially if you're not interested in spending hours installing mods. It's also the only way to play the new expansion, although I haven't played that so I can't really comment on the quality. Either way, if you're a fan of oldschool CRPGs or just RPGs in general, I can't recommend Baldur's Gate enough.			"

												I played the original version of Baldur's Gate when it first came out and I have to say, this version does it a great justice.This version takes what was great about Baldur's Gate II and adds it onto this one. The character options are limitless and you may progress any way you wish. Baldur's Gate offers many hours of customization and replayability through its character creation and story decisions. If you are into strategic fast paced combat, cool characters and a great story, then this game is for you. Whether you're playing to roleplay or power game, pick it up and you wont be disappointed! 10/10(Even Better than 10 years ago!) "

												Caveat up-front: I never played the original version.I'm not terrible far into the game yet, but so far I'm pretty fairly hooked. Though the playstyle is a LITTLE dated, it's not so dated as to prevent me from having fun. As far as D&D games go, the storyline so far is pretty immersive, and much better than NWN 1 (which, honestly, isn't that big of an achievement). That being said, so far BG:EE's biggest feature for me is that it -feels like you're playing a D&D campaign-. The pacing, the general structure of the whole thing, and the sense of freedom give you the feeling that you're as close as you're going to get to playing a tabletop adventure with real people. Having played other D&D games (NWN1, NWN2, DDO), this one so far blows them out of the water in terms of making you feel like you're actually playing D&D. And that's worth something.Looking forward to sinking a couple dozen hours into this game, and it feels like I'm not going to regret it.			"

												Assuming that you're already somewhat familiar with the game, I will say simply that the Enhanced Edition is worth the money. The bugfixes and added content are very welcome, it runs much smoother than the original on newer systems (which is a greater boon than you might think) and the mod community is catching up. That's right - you can still tweak the game to your liking with NPCs, Tweaks, and various other mods. Just google ""BGEE MODS"".Frankly, the ability to mod the game was the real question - and since there are a number of great mods to choose from that work, you're good to go. If you've never played before - what are you waiting for? It's only the prequel to the best PCRPG ever published. And this version is better than ever.			"

												If you are a DnD fan or just love fantasy adventure this is your kind of game. It takes classes and skills from ADnD and plays out just like that kind of game you get quest, epic loot and enjoy a wide cast of characters and places to see. The game pretty much starts out with you being set on a quest with no idea of what to do after the opening quest and setting up of the story line the game sets you in a map lets you meet a well rounded group of people for your party point you in a direction and then lets you go. The story is wonderful and side quest to boot are just enjoyable and finding loot off a monster or bandit is jsut as exciting as the last time. The only downside I can see is the Multiplayer you need to set the characters yourself and have a friend in the game to join, If you do want to do this I suggest you and a friend play together and set a time to play (just like a tabletop DnD game yay!) other wises this may confuses you and seem useless to you.In short a good old fastion RPG set in a DnD style with plenty of replay value with how many classes and moral option you can  be and the cast of characters is big enough you will not hear the same diolog so many times on each play though.

I had read lost of Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms books before playing this game, so I caught most of the references and LOVED seeing characters I had enjoyed reading. Wonderful story...

												If you are a DnD fan or just love fantasy adventure this is your kind of game. It takes classes and skills from ADnD and plays out just like that kind of game you get quest, epic loot and enjoy a wide cast of characters and places to see. The game pretty much starts out with you being set on a quest with no idea of what to do after the opening quest and setting up of the story line the game sets you in a map lets you meet a well rounded group of people for your party point you in a direction and then lets you go. The story is wonderful and side quest to boot are just enjoyable and finding loot off a monster or bandit is jsut as exciting as the last time. The only downside I can see is the Multiplayer you need to set the characters yourself and have a friend in the game to join, If you do want to do this I suggest you and a friend play together and set a time to play (just like a tabletop DnD game yay!) other wises this may confuses you and seem useless to you.In short a good old fastion RPG set in a DnD style with plenty of replay value with how many classes and moral option you can  be and the cast of characters is big enough you will not hear the same diolog so many times on each play though.

												One of my most favorite games of all time, just saying. Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition is probably the quintessential definition of a C-RPG. This game handles like a C-RPG would; you can play the game in real-time(not recommended) or you can pause after each turn, each character takes their turn at the same time, mind you. This game's story is excellent and the writing is top-notch; no complaints. The graphics are nice and are easy on the eyes, nothing that requires a gtx Titian or anything; you could run the game on a toaster. When you start up the game, the game tells you to play the tutorial(I think?). The game itself has a steep learning curve, however if you stick to it and get at least a small grasp of the game; much fun is to be had. I can't really say anything bad about the game. Did I mention the storytelling and dialogue; it's fantastic, the stuff of legends. No compliants at all 95/100.			"

												<UPDATED>  Game is working perfectly.  Only had a couple crashes on this latest MULTIPLAYER (WOOT!) playthrough, and it's been awesome!! DEFINITELY WORTH THE INVESTMENT!The game is still as amazing as it was on original release, and while many of the bugs in the system have been worked out, it's obvious that there still needs to be significant work done to the multiplayer portion of the game. After attempting about 40 different times to connect to both the beamdog servers as well as VPN and standard TCP/IP connection to the game, I have yet to get the multiplayer working. I am really glad that the game was re-released, but it's incredibly frustrating to see that it has not been patched to allow a relatively smooth multiplayer experience. PLEASE FIX THE MULTIPLAYER! THE GAME DESERVES TO BE PLAYED AGAIN!!!!			"

												Ok, for the quick summery, read this part. If you want more in depth, read past this. I've played Baldur's Gate since 2003 or so finished the game twice total. Only five years after it originally released in 1998. This game is basically my childhood. Over all, this game is much like the original with additions of a new class and the half-orc race of Baldur's Gate 2 and now, there's even more customization in the stats. Over all, the story is the same and enhanced on with new characters. If you're into hard-core RPGs that will last you days, buy this game. It's well worth it. But if you want something that has less time investment, don't go for this.Now for in-depthCharacter Customization: Now, this is an old game, this isn't Skyrim. Your character customization won't be ranging from weight to dirt color. The customization is in the stats: Strength, Dexterity, Charisma, Willpower, Intellect, and Constitution as well as what weapon proficiency you have from one handed sword to katanas, from two handed swords to halberds and from bow to sling. Then if you chose a caster class what spells you have from the beginning. You can chose your class from the traditional: Fighter, mage, thief to things like cleric, specialized mage, multi-classing, ranger, ect. Then race (which has different stats for each) from human, dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, halfling, half-orc, ect. The only physical customization of the character is in the portrait, gender, hair color, skin color and clothing major and minor colors. That's it.Gameplay: Now, the gameplay is DnD combined with RTS. You control your party of 6 max, including your character (who, if dies, is game over). You can pause whenever to cast spells, which is turn based. I.E. It could take two turns to cast a Heal Minor Wounds spell or a turn to cast a magic missiles or even five to cast a lightning storm or summoning spell. You can loot items from weapons (which CAN and WILL break by the way. So ALWAYS have a spare!) to armor, to enchanted items which you'll need a mage or the money to identify what they are (don't auto-equip these assuming they're better. They might be cursed items!) If you're a fan of DnD you'll love the gameplay.Story: Without spoilers, the story is amazing and in depth. On disk it spanned over 5 disks and a sixth for the expansion, so the game itself, for the day, was MASSIVE. Games now are 8-12 hrs, possibly a tad more to finish the game, maybe even more than that.. If you want 100% and to actually finish this game successfully, you'll need about a week or two. So prepare for time investment.Graphics: This game was made in 1998, don't expect beautiful sights like in Assassin's Creed or Mass Effect (I know, two different genres entirely, but best comparisons I can thing of). The graphics are decent enough and good for the time it was made, but the story makes up for the graphics. If you want eye candy, this is the WRONG game for you.Size: The game spanned over five, even six disks if you had Tales of Sword Coast. So the game is long. The size of the world is rather decent, numerous side zones, towns and cities from where you start in Candlekeep to Baldur's Gate itself, the world is almost all open to exploration. every building with a door, every mine shaft and tent. As long as the cursor changes to a wheel for travel or a door, you can enter. Might not get a good welcome, but you can enter.Difficulty: The game's difficulty CAN be set, but even on easy it's fairly challenging. Not much more I can say on this factor.Over all, this game is well worth it and a great buy.			"

												With a compelling story, great writing, neat monsters, legitimately interesting characters, and lots of dark corners to explore, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BG:EE) is an alluring RPG. I could easily drop hours into this game just wandering around talking to NPC's, collecting quests, and going off the road in wilderness zones--all of those things are rewarding despite being completely optional. This is a great game. Once your eyes adjust to a 90s spectrum, it's also a great LOOKING game. The new content is also well-integrated, and the new characters provide a nice bonus for veterans of the 90s iteration.Unfortunately, BG:EE is held back by the tabletop rules set it emulates. Slow level advancement and combat being resolved purely by random chance makes the game needlessly frustrating in its early stages. The Nashkell mines are especially painful. One minute you're murking every kobold (reptilian terriers who live underground and get off on ambushing adventurers in their sleep) at-will, and the next thing you know your party is completely wiped out by a lone survivor because no one could roll above a 10 to hit. Stupid THAC0. The slow advancement means you could play the game for several real hours, mowing down waves of enemies, and see no real improvement in your characters' ability to deal with enemies. It can be very tedious. Combine these flaws with an abundance of combat, and the whole thing plays out like a scripted roguelike. Although combat grated on my nerves at times, I don't necessarily have a complaint about the tough difficulty. For example, when my main character was one-hit killed by an arrow trap in the mines, I cringed but remembered all the warnings I got about traps and used the party's thief to meticulously scout them out upon reloading. The game's difficulty improves the experience: figuring out ways to keep your walking targets safe in the face of lots of cheapshotting obstacles adds a dimension of gameplay missing in this post-Diablo RPG climate.I do recommend BG:EE though. Anyone willing to endure the frustrating tedium of the early game combat will find a challenging and rewarding experience within.			"

												The game is great and an improvement on the original, mainly because of the higher resolutions without mods and the additional characters. However part of me thinks that it is a bit overpriced, but thats probably because I have bought this game several different times, once when it first came out on multiple CD, then the rare DVD version, then the BG collection and then this. However I got it on sale so it was a bargain.The game was quite unique for its time, as you could spend hours doing side missions like Elderscrolls games and just progress the main quest whenever you felt like it. You can also do much more than most simple RPGs, like stealing from stores, pick pocketing people, lockpicking and it also has the brilliant Bioware dialog which kinda went downhill after Mass Effect.All in all a brilliant game which is great fun for up to 6 players.

												The original Baldur's Gate is a masterpiece; if you already have it, no need to buy the Enhanced Edition as it honestly doesn't add anything worthwhile, and the stuff it does add (3 NPCs among other things), are nowhere near the level of quality as the original BG in my opinion. Higher resolutions and widescreen are nice, but those could be modded already. A good reason to still buy the Enhanced Edition though, and the reason I bought it, is the ability to play it natively on any platform (in my case Linux). This to me is well worth the full price of the Enhanced Edition.			"

												Forgot how much I loved this game!Now, this is not the type of updated/enhanced version that changes what the game is. Not in the least. It is still very much the same old school Baldur's Gate I first fell in love with. If I were to issue any complaint, it's that the AI is still incredibly dumb and it took only 10 minutes of having NPCs to realize, ""Oh yeah... that. They didn't fix that at all.""But you do notice all the little tweaks they added and despite its age, the gameplay is relatively smooth, once you et the hang of the controls.I remember the first time I played the original, I took a Half-Elven Magic User and let fighter NPCs take point. This time, I decided to be a bit more adventuerous and took a Gnomish Fighter/Illusionist. I was a bit disappointed to learn that it wouldn't be the classic AD&D Illusionist, but a modified Magic User, but in terms of game play for Baldur's Gate, that actually works out quite well.I'm looking forward to a bit of a game break, but my next one will definitely be the enhanced Baldur's Gate 2.

												The enhanced edition has made some slight improvements in mechanics that really helps. They have also put in some stuff from BG2 which is nice. The new art style is horrible though and the new characters are lousy.The character creation is the thing they really improved upon and I love it.

This is a game with low levels. Your mage will be über-helpfull but wont be a source of epic power. You will have to get a team of six characters which by themselves wont do much, but together will rock. The gameplay in this RPG is focused on tactics and balance between the characters in your team. This is no hack&slash no brainer. Not to say that it is major brainer, but still. It is a game with good story, funny side characters and entertaining gameplay.Overall, this is still one of the best RPG ever!PS: It works on LINUX!			"

												I've always loved classical version of Baldur's Gate. Enhanced Edition brings all of the memories back with full support for modern day high resolution screens. Changing the Infinity Engine to newer version makes the game so much better with additonal BG2 items. New characters make player excited, despite the game being 16 years old.It also works on Linux despite not being marked for Linux in SteamPlay.			"

												Hard not to recommend BG and the like... classics. So a Thumbs up. Did the EE team do a great job? Short answer - No. They didn't improve on much... the graphics are not brand new or amazing, just ok. I think character animations are the same, if not then they are just there, nothing impressive. They added back some things that were removed in original patches like the hidden ring at the Friendly Arm Inn, which was a huge boon for mages. The new characters and voice acting are ok, I have not used them all... but the overall impression is it was a quick and dirty job. The new companions  are available but its hard to find a party compilation that works with them all due to original party members having allegiances that means you take two of them or none. Not the EE teams fault but they didn't really think it through it seems. Forces you to miss the new or have a wacky group.Some EE team’s criticism. Pathing is still not great, in tight corridors if you tell your 6 man team to move and the guy at the back hits a wall of bodies, he/she will decide they have to go another way and start off in a different direction. Not often, but if you are going to “enhance” a game old pathing issues should be fixed.VERY Minor spoilers below but helps show what I mean about the new EE stuff just not being thought out. The new wild mage companion takes you to a new area. A goblin will escort you to a cave. By following the goblin and listening to his voice acting, which was kind of cute/fun you miss a side quest for the cave, and I think you’d miss the goblins voice acting if you didn’t skip the side quest and follow him. So after the cave you explore the area, find a side quest and now you must go back. You need to find a thing in the cave, but that thing has garbage loot on top of it (non-magical junk - shortswordx2, leather armor and a helm) so if like me, your inventory is full and weight limit is near capacity; are you going to pick that loot up? Probably not. Unfortunately in order to interact with the item you need, you have to move/loot the garbage. So, I googled it and realized the item had to be there so I looted the garbage and ah ok. The item you need, lets say it is a belt. Was it in the pile of garbage, no... you can only see/""interact"" with the belt after looting the other items it should have been included with. Like C'mon. What a run around for very little gain. You meet a guy that buys wolf pelts. None of the random spawns drop them. I could go on... New material is great… Full price for half thought out & poorly implemented new material… mehTldr;Bottom line is if you have never played BG – do it, right now. Amazing RPG, better if you understand D&D rules, and even this older top down style grows on you quickly. But imho the EE team did very little to earn your money, get it on sale.			"

												Heya it's me, Imoen ! Baldur's Gate : Enhanced Edition - back to the roots, to the game released in 1998 that turned me into a RPG lover. Even then, I enjoyed it so much that it became my favourite game for years, until Dragon Age : Origins came out.This is why I could not have been happier when I heard about the Enhanced Edition project : playing this fatastic game again on recent configurations, with a visual upgrade, lots of optimizations and improvements, and even new content. For not only the Enhanced Edition includes the original campaign and the Sword Coast expansion pack, but it also introduces four new companions with different personalities (which means new quests and areas) and the Black Pits, a new and short gladiator-like adventure.Baldur's Gate is a complex RPG based on Dungeon & Dragons rules, taking place in the Sword Coast with an adjustable difficulty. One of the highlights of the game has always been the story, a thrilling scenario of intrigues and revelations, in a huge universe waiting to be explored. From the opening to the battles, through the stuff, the actions, the stats, the turns and the dice rolls, everything is connected and quite complicated if you're not familiar with that kind of game. A simple foretaste at the beginning, with the character creation ; you'll have so many choices to make : ability scores, race, classes (the Enhanced Edition allows the players to pick the specilizations that only appeared in Baldur's Gate 2 at first), alignment, skills, abilities / spells... And those are just a start. There are so many different classes and ways to deal with everything according to your alignment and actions that the game basically offers itself for a replay.I wouldn't recommend Baldur's Gate for people who play for the graphics because, despite the update, Beamdog maintained the particular and original isometric style, that totally fits the kind of game in my humble opinion. The combat system can be confusing at first as well : it's a modified turn-based system in which everybody has his own initiative round. That makes the battles quite slow with a heavy use of the pause button. But do not think it's easy for all that : on the contrary. You'll need strategy, a good team composition and smart use of potions / spells / items.Nostalgia ! Baldur's Gate : Enhanced Edition brings an amazing classic back to life with brio. Relive this incredible adventure up to date with a beautiful soundtrack and a high resolution support, with charming companions or co-op with your friends.			"

												I own these games with all the dlc on my tablet and now I do on steam. 100% worth purchasing it all twice. Don't listen to the ""gamergate"" kids. There's no ""liberal lgbt agenda"" there's no morals shoved down your throat, theres no changed content. There is only extra, excellent I might add, optional content that has been added. It's the same game I grew up loving but, just, with MORE. How could anyone complain about that? Oh, that's right, a female was involved with writing the new content (that you don't have to play if you don't feel inclined to). Such a travesty...There are complaints about UI problems, bugs, glitches, etc. I have over 100 hours now between tablet play and on PC and have found none of these issues. The UI is updated to be more user friendly between platforms. It's like a sleek version of the original BG2 UI. It's fine. If there are bugs and problems that exist that I haven't found, well, it's a video game. These things happen. All in all, this is an amazing, fantastic purchase (even at full price) and 100% worth your hours of time and money. All I can surmise is that the dozens of bad reviews are from the gamergate hivemind just making things up because they're mad that women exist in the gaming industry. Buy this game. Play this game. Be happy.			"

												I hadn't played this game in a long, long time.   I have played through BG II on an old CD version I had probably 10 times and have not touched this old version since soon after it came out.  It never grabbed me like the second one did.  I saw the enhanced version and decided to give it a shot.  I have really enjoyed it.  I like the improvements they have made to this version - you can play all the specialized classes (kensai, priest of lathander, blackguard... etc) most of which were available in the old BG II.  They increased the resolution, and added in some of the new characters as well.  While I still enjoy BGII more (the story is a bit better), this is still very much worth your 10 bucks if you like the series.  Some have said you can buy the original and get mods that are better, but I dont have the patience for all of that.   This version suited me quite well.  If you have not played these games, they are old school and the enhancements increased the resolution from the old VGA to new widescreen standards, but the game is still pretty much the same as it was.   Great story, strategic gameplay, and its fun!  Give it a shot.  Now if this team would enhance Planescape: Torment I would be a very happy camper!			"

												Quite some progress we've made since the traditional D and D days. But this game has aged VERY well. Flawless in every way. This edition brings with it a myriad of extra content, as well as some fixed bugs and some fimproved textures and character models in certain areas. The perfect addition for any nostalgic 90's gamer, new fan looking for old ventures, or simply one who wishes to get their hands on that add-on conent they never got. This is something I've put many, many hours into since purchasing it --- and plan on more. Even with the business of life, I've succumb to it's seductive ways and attractive gameplay. For only such diction is even slightly worthy of being used to describe how amazing BG: EE is. I most certainly approve of this. Buy it, if you have half a mind.			"

												I've been playing this mostly on iPad along with BG2EE, but it's fun having it on both.  One of the best RPGs ever made along with it's sequel.  A tough, tactical, old school RPG, which makes it beautiful.  It's very tough in the beginning, a skeleton can kill half your party until you level up.  By end game your character is a machine of death.  I Love the story, love the world, modern RPGs are ok, but nothing like the Baldur's Gate series.  Skyrim is boring and lifeless (I know, blasphemy) to me now after playing through the Baldur's Gate series.  Buy it and support these guys! "

												This game is definitely a classic. If you know anything about The Forgotten Realms or Dungeons&Dragons in general, than you definitely need to get this. I am a Dungeon Master myself, and seeing rules and actions of a tabletop role-playing game is definitely exciting. Anyway, here is a full list pros and cons...Pros-Emersion, very emersive world with lots of lore. You don't need any prior D&D experience to really appreciate the vastness of the world. As a Dungeon Master, I have learned a lot about the Forgotten Realm lore from playing Baldur's Gate.Dialogue, although this may seem like a small thing, it is something I thought I would point out. The dialogue is believable when it needs to be, but also very humorous in parts as well. Space Hamster Boo!Combat, the combat is good and well balanced, each class actually serves a unique and power purpose. It is basically taking the combat straight from the tabletop RPG and putting it in the game.Graphics, although the game itself is dated to some degree, graphically it is still good. The enviroment and atmosphere is nearly perfect, areas look believable, feel how they should feel. The characters and monsters fit the overall graphic theme, so overall the graphics just fit perfectly for this kind of game.Cons-Difficulty, this is more or less a problem, it really depends on what your starting class is. Early on you have to be careful as you have limited resources you can use. In later game the difficulty levels out fairly though.Class Balancing, but didn't I say that the combat was balanced? Well, sadly Dungeons&Dragons has had a hard time trying to balance all of the classes to the ""perfectly balanced"" point. This is also true in the pen and paper/tabletop Dungeons&Dragons as well. This isn't really a problem in theory, but it does put more favor on certain class choices. Although early on the classes are all balanced, the late game is where the balancing can vary. Basically, I have noticed that Fighter/Mage duel class is completely overpowered in late game because of high defense plus defensive magic (actually did a solo run with a Fighter/Mage duel class). Anyway, moving on now...Tricky Controls, at first the controls may seem a bit tricky, with little in the way of a tutorial (well, if you don't walk to where the ""tutorial"" is then you don't get anything really). Being able to control your characters is definitely tricky early on, with all of the combat and magic using and so on. You can always pause the combat and give commands, but this feels unnatural and slow.Inefficient Interface, the menu layout is a bit confusing at first, but after a while you get the hang of it. Again, the menu layout and things aren't really explained in a tutorial or anything, so you are left to figure it out. Moving items around and things like that is also somewhat of a problem, having it open one characters inventory and moving it to another characters, so forth and so on...Conclusion-Definitely recommend this game, if you like classic Dungeons&Dragons tabletop gaming or things like it, then this game is a must. The game itself feels like you are playing a session of Dungeons&Dragons with your friends (just without your friends, and on your PC instead of on a table with pens and paper). If you are a Dungeon Master, then this is a must, even if you don't want it. The amount of D&D lore that this game prevides if massive. Anyway, hopefully this review has effected your view as to whether or not to get Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												This game was originally released back in 1892 as ""Galdur's Bate"", a Choose Your Own Adventure book  created by the decendents of the original crew of the Mayflower. In 1974 Gary Gygax stole the ideas from this game to make Dungeons and Dragons. Then in 1987 Bioware, then known as Guns-N-Games, made a computer version of Galdur's Bate, all text, renaming it ""Baldur's Gate"". Nobody wanted to publish it since it really sucked. It was 4 million lines of text! I mean, really. Years later they put some graphics in, sold it to Atari, and the rest is history.			"

												I love BG, BG2, NWN, and NWN2, which all can be bought on GOG. I got all the old DnD games off GOG for $20 during a sale. The Enhanced Edition doesn't really change much except add things that were added through mods, and add 3 new characters.   If you love BG and want to see what they changed, then I would say buy this game when its on sale. If you do not care about any of the new characters, then I would just go get it off GOG. Regardless I like BG:EE for the most part, granted this also stems from a deep love for the series which I have played through BG 3 times and BG2 15 times at least over the years. Also several of the NPC mods are being updated for BG:EE and BG2:EE.			"

												I had previously attempted to play Baldur's Gate a few years ago and had given up, believing the controls and menus too difficult and intricate to be worth the time learning. Additionally, the number of times I died in combat against the weakest of opponents filled me with a nerdy, indignant rage which in turn demotivated me to try this game again.However, having played it with other people who know how to play the game well for a couple of hours and being walked through the gameplay step by step, I have changed my mind about it. Yes, it's very difficult and yes, it can be infuriating - but it is more fun when you play in a group. It is not like the Diablo series, or Dungeon Siege, or the Divinty games - this game is really hard. If anything, it holds a likeness to Dragon Age in terms of the difficulty and the mechanics.

												The reason I bought this game was to play with my friends. It's so deceiving that it's advertised as a cross platform game. I have a windows computer and can't join in games with my friends on their ipads. Definitely false advertising.. I probably wouldn't have spent the $20 if they didn't lie about this feature. But still, it's a great game.			"

												One of the best games of all time. This game started the RPG game train and showed how in game mechanics can really work with a system that people could understand. It's for mature gamers, around 15+, who have the ability to understand how to build a character from the start. The thing with AD&D is that it's not a pick-up-game. You need to have a plan from that start. It is fun and unlike a lot of games, you can have even more fun on replays.			"

Outside of the cosmetic improvements, there are several slight gameplay tweaks that are highly appreciated.  Stat screens that are hihgly useful (damage range is actually listed vs guessed at) and some balance tweaks make this an all around great version of a classic CRPG.			"

												This game is worth playing. It's actually one of my favourite games. Only lack is serious multiplayer access and buggy game saving. What can you expect from Baldur's Gate? Hours of amazing story, challenging fights, many shiny treasures, lots of quests, diffrent monsters, a lot of areas which you can visit but you do not have to! Why would you choose this game? It is the core of D&D beginning in cRPG genre. It's easy to understand how it works. You can be very happy with the character development. You can find many diffrent ways to approach a given situation.My rate: 9/10Avg. game lenght: 24 hours for speed run (full content with the Tales of the Coast included), over 100 hours for beginners and full enjoying of the game with no rushing.Graphics: 9/10 (for that year of development)Sound: 10/10Plot & quests: 8/10Fighting: 8/10			"

												The very first RPG game I ever played, and by far one of the best. With an amazing story, and interesting characters, this game has lots of replay value. Trying to do it all will cap out your exp long before you finish the final quest.With the Enhanced Edition, some fun new characters are introduced, and it's nice to be able to pick a Kit right from the start.My two biggest complaints are not really all that bad. First, while you can create and role-play as an evil hero, there isn't really a benefit to doing this. All the good rewards are for the good quest endings. Being bad just doesn't pay. Second, with dozens of party members to choose from, there are really only a select few who are worth it. Most are either created with stats that are too weak, or are available too late in the game to be a real consideration. Of course, having one or two weaker companions wont break the game, still kind of sucks knowing you are not as strong as you could be if you brought along another member.I've purchased this game 3x over the years. Once as a special pre release at a video game convention when I was in high school on a whim with out knowing what it was. A second time years later after college, when I had lost the original while moving. And now a 3rd time, as the Enhanced Edition. Worth every penny.			"

The four disc set, a two-disc version, BG:EE and BG2:EE on Steam, and the digital versions on GoG. If you like D&D or isometric RPG's you have to play this.

												Here it is; the myth, the legend. The infamous Baldur's Gate. A high water mark in the CRPG genre, and still considered one of the greatest games of all time even to this day. I happen to agree with these claims. I grew up playing Baldur's Gate, and it has always held a special place in my heart as a gamer. This is about as pure as it gets, it is truly the grand daddy of current western RPGs, you can see playing this game how many of the new games still take inspiration and mechanics from it. If you are an RPG fan, I suggest giving this game a shot. It is very inexpensive and is absolutely worth your money. While it uses the AD&D 2nd edition rules set (My personal favorite), after you get used to the rules, the game really opens up and lets you customize and thrive on the Sword Coast of Faerun. I highly recommend this classic CRPG that defined a genre and became the gold standard that current roleplaying games still borrow from and honor. Baldur's Gate truly is one of the greatest games of all time, and I believe that if you give it a chance, you will understand why so many make that claim and believe it!			"

												Baldur's Gate is an excellent computer version of the old AD&D (2nd edition) system. The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.Personally I don't feel that the ""Enhanced Edition"" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...Definitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.

The looks and gameplay are very old-school, and the game might be difficult for the beginners, but it's also very rewarding, having lots of side-quests and companion NPCs.

												Are you a lover of RPG's? Do you enjoy engaging stories that grab every inch of you attention? Are you willing to play with and infuse your imagination into a world with a very rich and interesting mythology and history? Look no further!The Baldur's Gate series was and still is the crowning RPG series, the one to rule them all and in the darkness of Bhaal bind them. So of course the question is how does this enhanced edition work out?Perfectly. The new companions are interesting with their own back stories that really expand the rather modest repertoire of companion stories This is of course compared to today's standards with games like Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that the original Baldur's Gate was released in 1998 and it still makes me onanate and ♥♥♥♥ me britches from the awesomeness of it. They are prevalently assigned classes that were not in the original, but were in Baldur's Gate 2. The old one. This edition also provides some new locations to explore and have fun with (though they are mostly tied to the new companions). Some might be dissapointed because the original was, with all the mods, a far superior game, in many ways exceeding this newer version. But, and I say this with tears of joy dripping down my red colored baby chins, the modding community and the community as a whole are strong with this one and the mods are already coming out in numbers. My favourite is the NPC Banter mod, which gives just so much to the game that it's a must. Companions get these thinking and emotional dimensions that just must be experienced. It's still in development, but it already does wonders.I'd write more, but I must go feast on the flesh of kobolds now and help an infernal looking kid find his dog. Good day, adventurers!			"

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

 10/10 Maybe I'm just nostalgic and 10/10 is too generous however this game is one of the defining RPGs for me. It's age may be telling, and the visuals are certainly not appealing. However the gameplay and storyline are both very compelling and the setting is perfect for a fantasy RPG. Having played this game recently it still stands up to expectations and is a must for ""purist"" RPG fans.The game allows for different choices to be made in a very real way creating a dynamic experience which significant differences in each playthrough. I must have played through this game four or five times now as different characters, and each playthrough, if done thouroughly takes upwards of 30 hours. Completing  everything  took me almost 90 hours. What is especially great about this game as well as how engaging it is is that characters can be exported to BGII: EE so you can play one character through the entire saga.			"

At the time when I was maybe 11 or 12 and I did not speak an ounce of English, I ♥♥♥♥ you not... I LEARNED English playing this game because I played it so many times. When my idiot classmates were scoring failing grades in English, I was talking to my sizzlin' hot teacher fluently.Besides its capability to make you a boss English speaker, this game will give you an unforgettable D&D experience. It has a very captivating story, complex dialogues and a friendly UI. The graphics might look a teensy bit dated, but I assure you that it'll be all fine once you start chopping hobgoblins into pieces.Enjoy!			"

												I love BG, BG2, NWN, and NWN2, which all can be bought on GOG. I got all the old DnD games off GOG for $20 during a sale. The Enhanced Edition doesn't really change much except add things that were added through mods, and add 3 new characters.   If you love BG and want to see what they changed, then I would say buy this game when its on sale. If you do not care about any of the new characters, then I would just go get it off GOG. Regardless I like BG:EE for the most part, granted this also stems from a deep love for the series which I have played through BG 3 times and BG2 15 times at least over the years. Also several of the NPC mods are being updated for BG:EE and BG2:EE.			"

												This series is probably the best RPG series I've ever played. My mother originally had these games for our computers, but for some reason, they never wanted to work on mine(I think the games hate Windows 7) so I took every advantage of these games going on sale. The story is immensely long and interesting, the combat can be tricky, but fun, and some of the characters' interactions bring a touch of comedy into the world. Who needs good graphics to make a game good?			"

												The reason I bought this game was to play with my friends. It's so deceiving that it's advertised as a cross platform game. I have a windows computer and can't join in games with my friends on their ipads. Definitely false advertising.. I probably wouldn't have spent the $20 if they didn't lie about this feature. But still, it's a great game.			"

												It's so full of WIN.... It's admittedly an older game, one of the first ""modern"" RPGs I ever played, but it's still a lot of fun, and the second-edition rules make the game an actual challange, rather than the semi-mindless track RPGs have taken after the Infinity Engine was phased out.Good game for people who like an actual challange in an RPG, customizability, role-play, epic music of epicness and Gian Miniature Space Hamsters.

												Love the Enhanced Edition of BG!  The extra movies, voices, profiles, areas, items, and BG2 spells were really great to experience.  The thing I liked most about it though is that the classes from BG2 were can be played which meeeeeans... you can create any class that you want and play it all the way through to BG2!  That's what I wanted to do right away when BG2 was released but was let down that I couldn't be a specialized subclass.  All is well now and it was a great throwback to play again			"

												One of my favourite game series of all time, Baldur's Gate starts you off on the adventure of the Bhaalspawn and his party as they travel across the Sword Coast. In 1998 this game was one of the most in depth and replayable games ever, and this remake brings several nice changes including a slicker UI and better graphics. The graphic enhancements on this blow the original away which is worth the money alone, unless you enjoy your modded BG1 to BG2 engine. As with most older games it's all about gameplay so this will keep you entertained for a long long time. A highly addictive rpg and highly recommended for the 90s generation gamer.			"

So yes. I've played this game to death over the years, and the EE content almost made it like it was brand new again. It's a beautiful thing.			"

												Are you a lover of RPG's? Do you enjoy engaging stories that grab every inch of you attention? Are you willing to play with and infuse your imagination into a world with a very rich and interesting mythology and history? Look no further!The Baldur's Gate series was and still is the crowning RPG series, the one to rule them all and in the darkness of Bhaal bind them. So of course the question is how does this enhanced edition work out?Perfectly. The new companions are interesting with their own back stories that really expand the rather modest repertoire of companion stories This is of course compared to today's standards with games like Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age, and Fallout: New Vegas. Keep in mind that the original Baldur's Gate was released in 1998 and it still makes me onanate and ♥♥♥♥ me britches from the awesomeness of it. They are prevalently assigned classes that were not in the original, but were in Baldur's Gate 2. The old one. This edition also provides some new locations to explore and have fun with (though they are mostly tied to the new companions). Some might be dissapointed because the original was, with all the mods, a far superior game, in many ways exceeding this newer version. But, and I say this with tears of joy dripping down my red colored baby chins, the modding community and the community as a whole are strong with this one and the mods are already coming out in numbers. My favourite is the NPC Banter mod, which gives just so much to the game that it's a must. Companions get these thinking and emotional dimensions that just must be experienced. It's still in development, but it already does wonders.I'd write more, but I must go feast on the flesh of kobolds now and help an infernal looking kid find his dog. Good day, adventurers!			"

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

												Baldur's Gate is an excellent computer version of the old AD&D (2nd edition) system. The story is good, the characters excellent and the graphics were beutiful when the game was new. Although the graphics isn't particularly impressive now it is not as anoying as some other old games are when you revisit them 15+ years after release, visually the game manages to be rather pleasing despite it's original release data in the mid-90s.Personally I don't feel that the ""Enhanced Edition"" adds that much to the game, but there was no need to do that either. The new NPCs are alright and the additional quests are fine, though. Beamdog have also corrected some bugs that existed in the original game. It's nice to play this game without having to dig out my five old scratched discs...Definitely recommended for old ad&d nerds, but the clunky system will probably terrify most of the WoW-generation. Overall I think that many younger players may find the game difficult to get to past the first level (and being level 1 in ad&d is horrible), you need to reach at least level 3 before the game gets manageable.

												This game is a classic here on steam and on other services.  Possibly one of the best RPGS ever made. While many would conisder this game to be perfect, I still hold it in high regards.The game was made around the same time as fallout 1, and has the same type of graphics upgraded to modern resolutions and and has included an expansion pack.  While all that I do not know if it is worth ten extra bukcs it does save the user time and effort of downloading content.  The story while I would not say is novel worthy might be something out of a modern medievil movie, or perhaps around 2005 or so.  The length is about 20  hours if you head straight through the story and skip and extra quest.  Despite the length (20 hours is not a long game in my opinion) it is still a memorable RPG sure to stand up there with the greatest of all RPG's, such as Zelda, Deus Ex, Wizardy,Might and Magic,Betrayal at Krondor and many unique Legends of the gaming world.

												Here it is; the myth, the legend. The infamous Baldur's Gate. A high water mark in the CRPG genre, and still considered one of the greatest games of all time even to this day. I happen to agree with these claims. I grew up playing Baldur's Gate, and it has always held a special place in my heart as a gamer. This is about as pure as it gets, it is truly the grand daddy of current western RPGs, you can see playing this game how many of the new games still take inspiration and mechanics from it. If you are an RPG fan, I suggest giving this game a shot. It is very inexpensive and is absolutely worth your money. While it uses the AD&D 2nd edition rules set (My personal favorite), after you get used to the rules, the game really opens up and lets you customize and thrive on the Sword Coast of Faerun. I highly recommend this classic CRPG that defined a genre and became the gold standard that current roleplaying games still borrow from and honor. Baldur's Gate truly is one of the greatest games of all time, and I believe that if you give it a chance, you will understand why so many make that claim and believe it!			"

												Edit: DO NOT BUY!Beamdog has done what I could not have forseen, with their ridiculous Siege of Dragonspear expansion they have managed to turn the original Baldur's Gate Games into a blurry mess of Arcanum-style character sprites and failed UI-""upgrades"". You now have to scroll in your spellbooks, just so that the new kids don't actually have to learn the symbols (which is psychologically idiotic, cuz humans are good at symbolism), the edge of the map now hangs halfway into your screen killing immersion in the process, etc..This does not feel like Baldur's Gate anymore. I tried to play it. I tried to see the good in it, like the more organized journal, but it didn't come to me.Do not buy this anymore until they fix this. I'm going back to my Big World versions. Goodbye Neera.-------I will never understand the haters of this excellent remake. I also bought BG1+2 as original 6/4-CD versions when they came out. First in german, than a few years later as english DVDs, then at GoG again when they came on sale and I still bought the EE's of both games.And you know what? They've done everything right!1) The small tweaks go over extremly well, like 80 arrows per quiver slot.2) The engine works flawlessly and the little UI enhancements alone were worth the money to me.3) The new NPCs are mostly great. I especially adore Neera, who is so very different from the rest, maybe with the exception of Tiax. I also like Dorn, because both BGs generally lacked evil party NPCs that weren't overacting or plain insane.4) Both EE's are easy to mod. Most Gibberling's & Co mods work, but you need far less of them. The 12-hour-installation of the Big World Project was a pain in the rear, and it usually took me several tries.To sum it up, Beamdog delivered a pure Baldur's Gate experience with excellent new content in a very polished package.

												This game was originally released back in 1892 as ""Galdur's Bate"", a Choose Your Own Adventure book  created by the decendents of the original crew of the Mayflower. In 1974 Gary Gygax stole the ideas from this game to make Dungeons and Dragons. Then in 1987 Bioware, then known as Guns-N-Games, made a computer version of Galdur's Bate, all text, renaming it ""Baldur's Gate"". Nobody wanted to publish it since it really sucked. It was 4 million lines of text! I mean, really. Years later they put some graphics in, sold it to Atari, and the rest is history.			"

While limited on a set storyline, you do have freedoms of choice available to you, such as equipment, spells, and other basic RPG aspects. Be mindful, though.

												It is hard sometimes to recognize a truly great game these days without all the beautiful glitz and glamour. A story driven game that engages you in the world yet interests you with the gameplay. This is a game that does both of those spectacularly. I spent hours and hours playing this game 15 years ago when I was in high school, but never beat it. I'm glad that I came back and finally finished it. The revamped Enhanced Edition didn't really do anything for me, except for it was a lot less buggy. I put 70 hours into this game and only spent $15! Thats a bargain! Do yourself a favor and pick this gem up.			"

												Brilliant game with a rich history and an awesome timeless art.This is a true classic from the early 00s that helped to popularize the RPG genre to the big public.  Several features from this game are still being used in many modern RPG games, which proves that Baldur's Gate was a game ahead of its time. This Enhanced Edition has some new feature that doesn't add much to the game, such as forgettable characters with predictable dialogues and weird new maps, but the improvements to make this game playable in higher resolutions do worth the price.I strongly recommend this experience, but do expect to spend more than a month playing it.

												This game is definitely a classic. If you know anything about The Forgotten Realms or Dungeons&Dragons in general, than you definitely need to get this. I am a Dungeon Master myself, and seeing rules and actions of a tabletop role-playing game is definitely exciting. Anyway, here is a full list pros and cons...Pros-Emersion, very emersive world with lots of lore. You don't need any prior D&D experience to really appreciate the vastness of the world. As a Dungeon Master, I have learned a lot about the Forgotten Realm lore from playing Baldur's Gate.Dialogue, although this may seem like a small thing, it is something I thought I would point out. The dialogue is believable when it needs to be, but also very humorous in parts as well. Space Hamster Boo!Combat, the combat is good and well balanced, each class actually serves a unique and power purpose. It is basically taking the combat straight from the tabletop RPG and putting it in the game.Graphics, although the game itself is dated to some degree, graphically it is still good. The enviroment and atmosphere is nearly perfect, areas look believable, feel how they should feel. The characters and monsters fit the overall graphic theme, so overall the graphics just fit perfectly for this kind of game.Cons-Difficulty, this is more or less a problem, it really depends on what your starting class is. Early on you have to be careful as you have limited resources you can use. In later game the difficulty levels out fairly though.Class Balancing, but didn't I say that the combat was balanced? Well, sadly Dungeons&Dragons has had a hard time trying to balance all of the classes to the ""perfectly balanced"" point. This is also true in the pen and paper/tabletop Dungeons&Dragons as well. This isn't really a problem in theory, but it does put more favor on certain class choices. Although early on the classes are all balanced, the late game is where the balancing can vary. Basically, I have noticed that Fighter/Mage duel class is completely overpowered in late game because of high defense plus defensive magic (actually did a solo run with a Fighter/Mage duel class). Anyway, moving on now...Tricky Controls, at first the controls may seem a bit tricky, with little in the way of a tutorial (well, if you don't walk to where the ""tutorial"" is then you don't get anything really). Being able to control your characters is definitely tricky early on, with all of the combat and magic using and so on. You can always pause the combat and give commands, but this feels unnatural and slow.Inefficient Interface, the menu layout is a bit confusing at first, but after a while you get the hang of it. Again, the menu layout and things aren't really explained in a tutorial or anything, so you are left to figure it out. Moving items around and things like that is also somewhat of a problem, having it open one characters inventory and moving it to another characters, so forth and so on...Conclusion-Definitely recommend this game, if you like classic Dungeons&Dragons tabletop gaming or things like it, then this game is a must. The game itself feels like you are playing a session of Dungeons&Dragons with your friends (just without your friends, and on your PC instead of on a table with pens and paper). If you are a Dungeon Master, then this is a must, even if you don't want it. The amount of D&D lore that this game prevides if massive. Anyway, hopefully this review has effected your view as to whether or not to get Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												This game was mostly unplayable at launch due to bugs. For instance, the quest log--after I got to Chapter 5, it went away, impossible to know what the quests are, what to do, where to go. Just one of the many bugs. The people who give this glowing reviews did not finish the game. And, as you can see, I invested many hours into it. There are areas where if you talk to an NPC before doing something else, the game just about blows up--from talking to an NPC! Your party is stuck, unable to leave the zone. I mean, it's just one thing like that after another with this broken mess. Sure, it is nostalgic, it's FUN, but only if you dabble for a few minutes and then quit, as I suspect 99% of the reviewers out there have done. Play it to win it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I played through most of the game's content but am not able to finish it to see how it ends.[addendum] Beamdog fixed a lot of bugs during 2014, and I quit playing at one point toward the end without actually finishing. As someone here and on forums has suggested, the game did have corrupted savegame file problems that made a HUGE mess out of the game if you happen to be unlucky enough to have run into it, where the only solution is to reload from an earlier save. My best guess is, I ran into one of those problems, continued playing, and the game was messed up forever after that. Very possible starting a new game with the final patch would clear it all up.That doesn't change the fact that the game was unplayable for me. And just because *you* played it through 100% without any issues, doesn't mean it didn't have problems last year.			"

												The Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate is not Baldur's Gate. It is worse than playing BG with the BG2 engine in TuTu or BGT, if you want to really understand Baldur's Gate. I'm not going to give any pros and cons. Why? Because they are only my opinions. If you really want to know for yourself, first -- and most importantly -- you must play the original Baldur's Gate(there is a original version up for grabs at GOG) at least once before any other version. Then, and only then, make up your own mind. Other people's opinions will only colour or cloud your objective opinion of which is best, and why... just like this thread will.That being said, aspects of EE feel cheap and unfinished. Any added elements that they tried to intergrate, like the extra voices or added character portraits, are truly horrendous and do not match with the original game's art design whatsoever. So it feels like I'm playing a version with horrible mods that I would have never added due to their subpar quality. It's like, ""hey, lets take a bunch of already made Baldur's Gate modes, cluster them together and release it as a new game for a ridiculous price praying on everyones nostalgia and games good name!""I wish these ""developers"" had some sort of shame to leave such a grand classic and pinacle of RPG era alone.

												I definitely recommend this game as it's been a wonderful experience, getting back to it after years of never forgetting the original. I've had the chance to play it with a couple of friends, something I couldn't experience back then as it was a real struggle setting everything up compared to how easy it is nowadays.Anyway, about the game in itself, I find that this is a huge improvement compared to the original, with modifications really going in the right direction (better map with locations -even though they're kinda dumbing things down for explorers but whatever-, better journal with quests and new iterations appearing on screen while they're added, more classes and sub-classes, etc.)It's always been one of my favourite games of all times, and now I can show my friends why and let them agree on their own, which they do. So go on, buy, and play it if it's not already done !			"

												I Finished classic BG1 with and without Trinity mod million times. BG:T mod enables you to play BG1 in BG2 engine.I bought BG1EE here and BG1EE+BG2EE on GOG just because I love that game so much. However it is a complete disaster. Most of the things that made Baldur's Gate so great are gone. Creators of EE editions had no idea why BG was the best RPG of all time. I would advise you to buy the originals instead but Beamdog did some shady business and combined classics into their EE editions. Still if you can find them, use them instead.EDIT: Ok to be honest, EE edition is not that bad and I gave a negative review after Beamdog's statement that original Baldur's Gate game was sexist and flawed. This is completely unacceptable. I wont argue if it is true or not. If you dont like a game, instead of corrupting it with your own thoughts, you should make a new one and dont touch the story of a masterpiece like Baldur's Gate. And we all saw how that worked for them when they made a new game. Even with legendary characters like Minsc, the expansion was a total disaster in every way. Beamdog crossed the line with their narrow minded shallow story telling.			"

Apparently not.One of the most disgusting attempts at money grab i've ever seen.I was a sucker to fall for it. Don't make a same mistake.			"

												More  like ""Beamdong""...I haven't played SoD yet, but it changes nothing about the poor experiences I had with Beamdog prior to Dragonspear, conerning their port of BG to iphone. It was terrible for SO LONG. They seemed not to care. For the longest time their solutions to certain problems (the sidebar buttons that remove the sidebar, but don't bring it back) were actually work-arounds that the community had discovered. The tone of their responses to people leaned toward defensive, and it is off-putting. From reading these customer reviews, it only further reassures me that I didn't make a mistake by being wary of Beamdog's newest venture. They should just make mods. It seems like that's what they'd rather do, than deal with any mistakes that they make, or the unhappy customers who feel duped when they buy a broken product, or have a less than positive opinion of said product. I really wanted to be happy about Beamdog's latest venture. But it seems I should not be. Which is fine. I'll find other retro/retro-styled games to get excited about. Tides of Numenara, for example.			"

												For an enhanced edition you have to consider price and what it really adds. So for full pirce do i recommend it? No. On sale? Perhaps. The glaring issue is baulders gate 1 + 2 can be bought more cheaply than this, and with mods (which gog.com tells you step by step how to install) you basically have all you wanted from this (aka wide screen). That being said standing alone is it good? Yes it is, is basically just baulder's gate 1 and that means it has many hours of adventure for those willing to seek it.  I personally would buy the originals and mod them but if this is on sale for a decent price (aka less than 50% of full price) it is worth it. Sadly steam bs system is recommended or not, so at full price its a no.			"

I played it for two hours when I first tried it and decided that it had nothing to do with anything I loved about D&D. Ten years later I decide to try it again, thinking maybe I was too hard on it. No, I was way too easy on it. I didn't go through enough of the ridiculously stupid and senseless story line that it claims to have to be able to truly comprehend how inane it is.

												Baldurs Gate is a old classic, a old gem and filled with nostalgia for many. The EE version polishes the old and adds some similar mechanics that mods used to add to the game. The game still to this day holds up pretty well and the EE version do add on more content. I myself do not hold it in the highest regard but the monk they added is probably the best written out of them all while the Black Pits is fun to test builds or parties in but nothing extremely ""must be played"" since it is only an arena campaign not tied to the storyline of the Bhaalspawn. What you get it what you buy, an enchanced version of the original game with a bit more content and some mod fixes glued on to it. The writing can be a bit ""Ham"" at times, cheesy and such but people praise it for being very ""funny"" and ""realistic"" since it is the kind of thing you would hear around a table in pen and paper. I would prefer a more dark and ""real"" tone myself but I can see why it is found funny by old wolves who enjoyed pen and paper campaigns in and around the Sword Coast. The main story is not bad either. Sarevok is a iconic villian much like Jon Irenicus in game two. The game also lack a lot of ""CnC"", choices and consequences and it do not really give much of options for you beside being a goody good guy, a ""I don't care but I do it anyway"" neutral person and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the part , where all three lead to the same D turnabout no matter if you pick option A, B or C before hand. But it do not effect much in the end, but I think atleast it could given us more options. Mostly you are portrayed to be the good side countering the evil side. Not to spoil anything but you are more or less bound to be the good person and playing evil will render you not getting all rewards or losing reputation like mad. Which is a pretty bad thing to lose.But the big big big but now is Siege of Dragonspear. It is tucked in a bit like someones fan fiction mod inbetween the two Baldurs Gate games and the ending chapter expansio nof Throne of Bhaal. Pretty much out of nowhere and it do not really fit. Some hate it for the writing, some hate it for being a cash cow, others find it to filled with shoe horned social justice things and other political agends, which I partially agree with. On the other hand I did not find the writing in retrospect to be so bombastic and excellent as people said it been before and I think I seen one or two well hidden, but non the less social justicy comentaries in the main game but so sublte and small they are barely noticeable. But beside that cocky commentary from some writers, the forced and poorly written SJW I found it atleast some what appealing to play, it was intriguing enough to pull me through it in about a weeks time. But what I did not like was the similar event of no consequences or even worse, not really any options and the forced ending was not that good. Beside that, it is really hard to consider this canon and then look at BG2 where no one even mentions the Shining Lady ever or her crusade. Caelar Argent as the villian, a GOOD villian or anti-hero antagonist was to me very interesting but could been developed much more. I won't spoil it but I hope to hear more about her. A villian not hell bent on destroying the world, conquering it for doing bad or simply put being a lunatic chaotic evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was refreshing. So some things been hits in the  Dragonspear expansion and Baldurs Gate at the core is still a cheesy at times but good RPG game. But there also been some misses in Dragonspear and people complain of the bugs. I had NPCs disappear so I could not recruit them. I might have managed to kill them by mistake, by pulling trolls to the camp but I did not notice that either way until I was looking for them in camp and they where nowhere. A bit more freedom and options, perhaps if they had made Dragonspear into a spin off, another branch in the Saga, a what if Irenicus never happended, it would been nice. But such is life.6.5-7 I think is a decent grade if we do not inflate it like most gaming medias do today, maybe even 7,5 considering that Baldurs Gate was a great game on release, and one of few good RPGs in its time beside Fallout as far as I know. Atleast one of those games who push the genre on for a while longer. A proper 9 out of 10 back then. But a 7 is still well above average and that is not bad, beside that Beamdog is not perfect and done some weird things so 6.5-7 is fiting.			"

												If you're the kind of person that enjoys having to use basic algebra in order to calculate the best build for your RPG characters, this game is for you. Unlike most modern RPGs there is no voice-acting so you'll actually have to read dialogues. You also have to actually read quests entries to figure out where to go and you need basic orientation skills. All in all I would say that most people born in the late 90s or 2000s should probably stay away from this game because they lack the cognitive skills required to play this game. If you do however have basic scholastic skills, this game is quite an enjoyable RPG experience that requires meticulous planning and use of tactics to beat it at the higher difficulty settings. Most of you are probably too stupid to appreciate it though.			"

The new NPCS, plethora of various new options in the UI and gameplay in general, are mostly optional and, in my opinion, a positive addition to the overall game. I've not found the game to be buggy in the least, and have not had any issues whatsoever. The enhanced edition is a welcome update and has brought life back into one of my favorite RPG series of all time. Thank you Beamdog.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a CRPG classic. It's a massive, sprawling adventure that requires hundreds of hours and multiple playthroughs to fully delve experience. I played the original nearly 20 years ago, and it remains one of my favorite games.Beamdog has done a fantastic job at smoothing out some of the most awkward elements of the original:* Being unable to both dual wield and use a bow* Having to quit an adventure mid-way through to run back to down and dump your bagsWhile also adding some fresh stories for folks that have already played through it a hundred times. While the writing quality of the new content feels a bit below that of the original game, it's better than the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion (included in the Enhanced Edition). The balance of the new classes and characters feels little on the weak side (with a couple exceptions--Dorn, Corwyn), but the game isn't so hard as to feel like trying them is impossible.You'll see some negative reviews by people who are incensed that anything has changed, and others who get offended at the existence of a single, minor character of nonbinary gender in the expansion. Take these reviews with a grain of salt; Beamdog has done a great job on both fronts.I recommend this game for anyone that wants to dive deep into a game and explore. It's a bit like reading the original Lord of the Rings, however, in that--as a classic--mechanics that were revolutionary 20 years ago feel stilted and painful now. This game has even made me appreciate 4th and 5th edition D&D significantly more after seeing what 2E was like in practice.One further note, this game has a vibrant modding community, and there's a ton of things you can add. One specific mod, the BG1NPC Project, is practically essential, as it fixes some bugs, adds a ton of great character dialog, gets some fun NPCs into your party earlier in the game, and adds romance options as well.

												Great game with a very interesting lore, wide variety of scenarios, characters, and especially quests. There are many Quests that I wish that would be deeper, the story behind them is kind of flat. But, the story of the city of Baldur's Gate, the main pltoline and how it develops is really amazing. There's a huge variety of characters that can join your party, from the Devil to God himself, and even the new ones that were added are very interesting, along with the new quests that involve them. The gameplay itself is very different from modern RPGs, but it is completely playable nowadays. The strategic aspect of the combat is very good and when you manage to master a combat situation it is a very satisfying feeling. It also has a few minor additions as new character portraits, revisited cutscenes and some tweaks to the overall looks of the game.			"

												Quite simply one of the best games ever made. The story is amazing, the character progression and interaction was ahead of the curve back in the day.An absolute essential for any lover of the RPG genre, still packs quite a difficulty punch compared to most modern RPG's especially if you plan to take on the DLC bosses. That is of course unless you are power gaming and know what you are doing :).It has a vast array of race/class choices to make, each class having their own specific sub classes, these characters can be taken across to Baldur's Gate 2 upon completion. You are also given your 9 alignment's to choose from, be it Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral or True Evil. These will have an effect on any NPC's you wish to take along with you on your quest to save the lands, or destroy them?The loot is great, there is a vast source of loot within the game especially towards the end game content when you get to say Durlag's Tower. You think you hit God Mode but perhaps the lack of petrification protection will make your Beserker get one shotted by a Bassilisk.The voice acting, whilst small, is passable with a few exceptions being fantastic. Perhaps not enough customisation options. I personally love the isometric top down graphics, but they aren't for everyone.THE ONLY downside to this game is the multiplayer, If you are buying this to play with friends, please research the problems you may encounter first. They have patched the issues now to some degree of success but I have had issue when playing with more than 2 people with it booting one of us out. I know a lot of people who have played the entire game with no problem at all as well though. Just be careful if you plan on Multiplayering.All in all, one of my favourite games of all time. 10/10.

												I'd guess most people would play this game for nostalgic reasons. I've played my share of RPGs but not the original BGs. So no additional nostalgia points from me unfortunately. This being said, I found this game to be very well made and fun to play. It's old fashioned in pretty much every way possible (including graphics, interface, game mechanics etc.), but after giving it some time, this didn't really bother me too much.Some things to note:1) While not buggy per se, this game has some balancing issues and it's sometimes hard to know what to expect when fighting enemies. Some fights are just down right annoying and very difficult to win.2) The game doesn't hold your hand in anyway. If you go to wrong places and pick wrong fights, you die. If you don't, you probably still die. Expect to put in some effort and research if you want to get somewhere in this game.			"

Graphics aren't bad for such an old game either, it even changes armor pieces when you switch gear, more then I can say for other newer rpg games than this. For me save and reload alot is though crucial to maintain my enjoyment to the game since one or more of my characters always wants to die in one way or another.Great storyFun world and lots to explore, lots of housesClassic that I should've given a real chance back in the days.Worth every penny! now I need a rest from heavy RPG before purchasing BG2: EE			"

												I wonder if there is any other game that has left such a memorable footprint in my life. The story is truly epic and I prefer the low level fantasy (character dev and inventory) rather than the high level stuff in BG2. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and probably the major reason I will still need to return to this game before I kick the bucket.This enhanced version is great! The whole game got a facelift, the interface especially is nice - doesn't feel old. I also really appreciate to have this on Steam now, patched and ready instead of worrying about patches with the stand alone original version. And no CDs! :)Perhaps best of all - it runs natively in Linux! I could never dream of that becoming a reality when I started gaming BG back in -98. Trying to get the game to work properly in WINE was probably the main reason it took me a decade to finish, the first time around :)If you buy this game, you're in for a great story and experience!

												The first instalment of the Baldur’s Gate series is the perfect introduction to what would become one of the most beloved benchmarks in RPGs; combining a compelling story, ample exploration opportunity, and tactical combat, all blended together in a well-established setting.Baldur’s Gate is the beginning of a journey that will consume countless hours of your time. You begin, as any good fantasy story begins, as a hapless youth who must journey out alone, thrust into a world they’ve never before seen. Along the way you’ll gather your fellowship of companions who’ll support you and provide commentary and banter on your actions and choices (though, this is more prevalent in the game’s sequel, Baldur’s Gate II). Whilst there is a storyline to play out, you’re never truly forced down a linear path towards it; there’s plenty of opportunity to go off the beaten track and explore the verdant countryside, or dreary dungeons. Cap it off with menacing villain and you’ve got an idea of what makes Baldur’s Gate special.Baldur’s Gate isn’t for everyone, however, and that’s a given. In a world where you have your photo-realistic, fast paced Skyrim, and Witcher 2, Baldur’s Gate may feel like a step back, and that’s understandable – when you look at Baldur’s Gate it does look slightly dated in terms of graphics, and not everything is voice acted (as everything tends to be these days,) but those shouldn’t be reasons to turn away from what is, in my opinion, a very special RPG experience. The graphics may be slightly dated, but they do hold up well even today. Their very particular aesthetic ensures that it is still a very playable game, and the Enhanced Edition’s UI overhaul allows for best navigation for the player. When you compare it to games like Dungeon Siege, or Neverwinter Nights, who opted for a 3D graphical engine, the game looks beautiful and timeless. If you’re playing an RPG for its graphics you’re not doing it right, though. What will draw you in is the dialogue and storytelling. The game really set the precedent for what a good RPG should include in terms of story. Admittedly it does use a tried and tested narrative structure (inexperienced adventurer sets off from the homely home, whilst being pursued by an unknown enemy, gathering friends along the way to help take down this evil), but it doesn’t feel overly cliché. The well written dialogue feels like a novel some times, in terms of the quality and sheer amount, which will strike a chord with some players, but understandable put others off; there is a hefty amount of reading to do, when compared to the minimalist approach of modern RPGs. Personally, I find a great chunk of dialogue compelling, but I can see why it would be off-putting.In terms of what the Enhanced Edition actually adds, there are quite a few new features and many more fixes for old bugs that will never get officially patched out in the original games. Firstly, three new NPCs are added in to the mix, each giving a new personality and set of skills to help you in your adventure. The NPCs are fairly well written, and voiced, but I do think that they don’t blend seamlessly in to the catalogue of NPCs for Baldur’s Gate. They aren’t terrible, by any means, but they are noticeable. One of the more important changes is the UI, which really helps to modernise the title as best it can. It is possible to mod the original game in order to make it widescreen, and give it Baldur’s Gate II’s UI, but if you’re not familiar with the way modding working in the Infinity Engine it can be a little daunting and a little tricky. Overhaul did a good job making a working UI that feels like it belongs in the game. The seldom praised aspect that the Enhanced Edition brings is numerous bug fixes. Baldur’s Gate is over a decade old, and is no longer maintained by its developers, and as such it has built up a number of bugs on modern hardware. What the EE aimed to do was squash as many bugs as possible, and make it compatible with as many computers as possible. It has succeeded in that respect, however it has introduced a few new bugs of its own in the process, so be aware of that. The developers are still working on patches for the game, so don’t fret too much, but do be aware of this fact. Other than this, there’s a fairly decent arena style campaign to play through, for those who enjoy the tactical combat Baldur’s Gate employs.A few final things to note in terms of what the game offers are the rule system and general gameplay. Baldur’s Gate uses 2nd Edition rules of Dungeons and Dragons, which for all its praise can be overly complicated at times. Those unfamiliar with D&D rules may find themselves totally bewildered by terms like ‘THAC0’, and ‘saving throws’ but if you do a little research it can be understood. The rule system is one of the main components that puts people off the game initially, but with a little perseverance you’ll be able to play the game without needing to know every little rule mechanic. The pathfinding in the game will also have players feeling the age of the game, as it is very basic and very frustrating. You’ll find characters taking the sub-optimal route when issuing them to move through a corridor, or a street, which can get pretty tiresome after a few hours of babysitting your party; be warned.All in all, Baldur’s Gate is one of those games that I feel should be given a try, even if you’re apprehensive. Of all the series, Baldur’s Gate II is (in my opinion, and many others’) the superior game, and so don’t let Baldur’s Gate put you over getting the sequel, as BG2 improves upon many of the first game’s shortcomings. The price may be a little off-putting, but if you see it on sale then definitely grab it and give it a whirl. Just don’t go in expecting Skyrim or Witcher, because it’s a whole different beast (for the better).			"

												Baldur's Gate is often held up as the epitomy of Role-playing gaming, and a hallmark of excellent writing (there certainly is a great deal of text!) To a certain extent this is true, as Baldur's Gate has a reasonally well developed plot, a plethora of cut and dry standard fantasy characters and well constructed dialogue, that utilizes a quite advanced vocabulary by today's standards. Is it as great as the rose-tinted lenses of nostalgia make it out to be? The answer unfortunately is no, Baldur's Gate is advanced for its time but compared to some of the more modern RPG's is lacking in awareness of broader issues and ideologies. It's a simpler game from a simpler era, that layed the groundwork for the more advanced exploration achieved by later games.As for Beamdog's Enhanced Edition, it adapts the graphics to run on modern resolutions however it still suffers from pixelation due to the nature of the original graphics themselves. The sound runs perfectly, and crystal clear with little to no distortion and the inclusion of the new content is welcome for those who want to experience the old mechanics, yet explore a slightly new adventure.

												EDIT :  Being Slowly consumed by this game. 752 hours in BGEE and BG2EE now. Once IWDEE comes out that'll probably make 1000. If you want a bang for your buck you'll probably not find something better for an old school RPG lover.I've been an RPG fan for many years now. I started on the good ole Final Fantasy series when I was a kid and that evolved to early console games from Bethesda and Bioware mostly. For years my favourite game ever had been Dragon Age Origins. But that was only because I somehow missed out on Baldur's Gate. Playing it now, even with the isometric view and hand painted environs, it has become my new all time favourite game, along with the sequal. The story is epic, the gameplay is fun and exciting, the party members and diverse and interesting, and best of all there is a massive ammout of customization, replayability, and roleplayability. All in all I highly recommend this game, along with the sequal, to any fan of tatical RPGs.			"

												One of the things RPG's always miss is a strong script editor.  I'm not talking about customization, I'm talking about someone who reviews the script, and edits the crap out of it to make sure it makes sense no matter what play through you do.  BG and BG:EE have always had this.  I just wish Dragon Age, NWN, Skyrim, Masseffect and all the other new /major rpgs had this.   One person can change the landsacape of your entire game.			"

												Baldur's Gatewhat is there to say about it.quite a lot as a matter of fact.Back in 1998 when this game first came out, i played it half to death. it used the 2nd edition rules and was overall a great game. im sure i put in a  couple thousand hours playing, trying new characters. then exporting to Baldur's Gate 2 and continuing from their.For a lot of modern gamers, this is a classic title. A must have if one was into D&D.and with the remake and bug patching and making it runnable on todays modern machines.This game gets a 9 out of 10But if you're looking for awesome graphics, this game won't hold that for it. its about playing the game. not drooling over the graphics, though back then this was really high graphics.Is it worth whatever price it is now??I would have to say yes. it is.But only if you loved the older games.

												Step right up and see the game that not only influenced literally all the fantasy rpg games you play today but the game that literally saved the fantasy rpg genre.Seriously, this game saved the genre, no one was interested in pouring more money into something no one was interested in playing, ghen this came along.This is truly a great game, not so much early reward and no superepic endgame items either but what you get is a beautifully dcrafted world and a fantastic gaming experience that gives a prime example that good storytelling and great gaming is its own reward.With almost endless character creation possibility, a storyline that rewards you with growth and encourages perseverance to finish, this game is a must for practically everyone.Characters banter, they argue, they have their own personalities, the game world is literally huge, with lots of hidden treats. With the extra stuff from the tales of the sword coast expansion thrown in and the half orc race and character packs thrown in at creation this game offeres a lot more than even people like myself who enjoyed it back in 98 can remember enjoying.Whether you're an old hat that misses this game or a newbie looking for an hardcore rpg experience, this is totally for you, and whats best is... You can port your save game over to Baldurs gate 2 when youre done.			"

It brings  realism to the table, you wouldn't just go into a dungeon and throw your life away like nothing and just charge like a berserker at any danger you saw, you need to take a lot of things into consideration and this game does that, it makes you think, constantly, its definetly not an easy game, and it definetly does not hold your hand.

												In 1998, Baldur's Gate was an absolutely amazing game. Far ahead of it's time, extremely complex and deep, great combat, and a lot of interesting 'history' to their world. In 2013, it feels eclipsed by more polished, faster paced, and better graphics games. The unforgiving difficulty forces you to replay a lot for seemingly random reasons. Also, it's size makes exploring a bit of a chore at times, and the number of quests with no real clue as to where to find them makes questing almost tedious. I actually completely forget I have quests sometimes and sometimes spend so much time on side quests I forget what was happening in the main story. Overhaul Games has done a great job of porting and upgrading the game. All the changes are subtle but valuable. I would just suggest waiting for it to be on sale. $20 feels a little steep for a 15 year old game.			"

Totally glad I went for it.

NOTE: I’m posting this review on both Baldur’s Gate: Enhanced Edition and Baldur’s Gate 2: Enhanced Edition pages, since my opinion is valid for both products, and they should be considered as one.What can one say in front of such magnificence? These two RPGs are simply the pillar of western production of this genre, and when the two are combined in a single game they definitively are among the top 10 of the must-play for every PC gamer out there, no matter the age.BG:EE and BG2:EE are simply THE definitive Dungeons & Dragons experience, including almost all the possible 2.5 Edition Core and several optional rulebooks of the Forgotten Realms setting and translating them into a marvellous duo of 3rd person games.Although both games are very old (they were developed and published between 1998 and 2001 by Bioware / Black Isle Studios), they have been “enhanced” and made available on modern systems (including Windows 7/8/10 PCs, OSx, Android and IOS) by the guys at Overhaul Games / Beamdog, who not only re-tooled the original Infinity Engine to make it run on modern platforms, but also added several other goodies that were not present in the original release, in addition to bug fixes and standard “curator” jobs.I could go on for pages and pages describing in detail the marvels of the Baldur’s Gate Series, but I’ll try to cut it short and stick to a much shorter format.PROs- Ever dreamed of taking your typical AD&D session with your friends out of the pen & paper setting to a PC screen? This game is for you!- Charismatic characters and companions: Minsc the Ranger (and Boo!), Jaheira, Viconia, Xzar, Sarevok… what else can I say?- Longevity: both games combined are well over 100 hours of gameplay- Replayability: seriously, there are hundreds of possible combinations of classes / races / kits / alignments / companions / choices to completely change your experience at every playthrough- Every action you make affects the game world, like it is expected from a proper Western RPG. Apart from some scripted events to progress with the main story, the rest is up to you- Multiplayer: join with 5 friends to create a fully custom party!- The (new) developers are supporting the game with patches and fixes, and they actually listen to the community- Compatible with most of the original BG / BG2 community mods- Runs on every system, even your mobile phone / tablet (NOTE: the Android / IOs versions are separate purchases). HW requirements are very lowCONs- After more than 16 years from my first BG playthrough I still cannot find a single flaw in any of these games. They are simply a masterpiece.In a nutshell, these games set THE standard all the following RPGs on the market were measured against, and none of them was able to surpass Baldur’s Gate until now.Buy them, play them, enjoy them. 12/10, would pickpocket Drizzt again			"

Yeah i know, some core fans are not happy with the changes and I would much perfer to play the game in its original version too, but nevertheless: The game is on of the best RPGs you will ever find!

Now with me being older, smarter, and more of a nerd(and proud of it) I know what I need to do and how to play it.

												When I first played BG, I hated it. That was a long time ago, when there was no enhanced edition and it only ran in ridiculously low resoloutions (what do you expect, it was an early 90's game).After the Enhanced Edition came out, I loved it! I suppose I always enjoyed the fundamental elements of it, but now that it's un-glitched, and with better resoloutions I can't get enough of it. BG is set in the forgotten Realms, but it does a good job of appealing to people who aren't fimiliar with FR. You play as an orphan who must set out to figure out why you father was murdered, who did it, what connection it has to an iron shortage, and why assassins are after you as well. Its a top-down isometric RPG where you can control your own custom character and up to 5 other characters. This all done in a Dungeons and Dragons style with 2nd edition rules.There are compelling characters that feel real, a lush and vibrant world full of lore, and a plot that is as complex as it is interesting. I would find it hard to believe that someone would be unable to fell immersed and intrigued by this game.My one criticism is that combat is brutal, even on lower difficulties. This is because you start from first level and can only get as high as ninth level during the course of the game. It is somewhat frustrating, but it evens out a quarter of the way through or so. Slogging through it is definately worth it for the later payoff, though. And if you're skilled enough, it isn't even that bad. Some would argue that the difficulty is a good thing. This isn't a game that hold you by the hand, or expects you to be stupid. No, it is intelligent and mature. I only played the vanilla version of BG once, so I'm not an expert on the differences between regular and Enhanced. I think that with 3 extra companions, each with their own personal missions, and the Black Pits game mode, the price is worth it. As far as I know, nothing was deleted or changed that might make fans of the classic version angry. In fact, I think the 3 new companions are even MORE interesting and well-written than the vanilla ones. It's also hard to argue when hundreds of lines of dialouge that were previously silent are now voice acted. BG1 is a classic. It easily fits into my list of top 10 best games ever. If you never played BG, this is your chance. If you did play it, but aren't sure if EE is worth it, let me tell you that it is.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played and the Enhanced Edition is even better. There isn't much enhanced graphics-wise, but there are new items brought in from Baldur's Gate 2, which makes this game more playable and slightly easier. The addition of four new team members was nice, all of them are equally well written and fun to get to know, especially Neera ^^. Somehow, not sure if it was because of this Enhanced Edition, but there were some glitches here and there, blocking me from certain areas or quests. The final fight glitched up too, where the main boss just died when I came in to the room (scaredy cat :P)Certainly recommended if only for the cast of characters, great graphical overworld and well-arranged music tracks. Now, will somebody hold my hamster?			"

												Welcome to the first instalment of one of the best crafted RPG series ever. Yeah I know Mass Effect is big now, and Dragon Age is following in the footsteps remarkably well. Well so long as you’re not Dave anyway, regurgitating some asinine reviewers comment about the game spatially being so small compared to DA:O and found the area re-visiting ‘lazy’. ♥♥♥♥ you Dave. Stop being such a lazy, attitude-poaching son of a gnoll and draw your own ♥♥♥♥ing opinion. Go get a university-level degree and learn how to critically analyse, further your education with honours and write a thesis on the development of players expectations vs. reality  throughout video-game-RPG history, replay DA2 and draw your own god damn opinions for once in your life! I’m not bitter at all, Dave. Anyway so Baldur’s Gate is a finely crafted game, rich in story and full of dynamic ways you can go about your adventuring business. We’re talking about mesh-painted isometric glory, back in the days where screen resolution wasn’t really a thing, and ‘3d acceleration’ was something you could toggle on your mouse cursor. But it’s okay now because Beamdog have optimised it for us modern technophiles. I’ve heard comment from a friend that it’s too slow paced for a modern audience, not enough flashing lights and voice acting and animation to keep your attention. But buck up, you sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es. This is worth your time and all of your attention. All you need is a little passion for some earnest, down-to-earth RPG grit underneath your otherwise pristine, dainty fingernails. RPG up. And seriously if you don’t keep Xzar and Montaron in your party you are dead to me.  "

												Played this for a long time trying to figure it out when I was a teenager and coming back to it now as an adult gives me all sorts of nostalgia. Its the type of nostalgia where I'm like ""Why was I was so stupid and why did I give up so easily and didn't pay attention to game mechanics and why did I  just brute force this"" I wanted this to be my cup of tea when I was a kid because it looked like a really good game, anyway that aside what do I think?I think this game has aged really well, if you like RPGs or D&D and you want to try this, its a classic, but its a classic that requires a lot of patience. It brings  realism to the table, you wouldn't just go into a dungeon and throw your life away like nothing and just charge like a berserker at any danger you saw, you need to take a lot of things into consideration and this game does that, it makes you think, constantly, its definetly not an easy game, and it definetly does not hold your hand. You learn a lot as you play, if and only if you are observant of the mechanics, I didn't do the tutorial though cause I didn't think I needed it, but I could see how it would be very helpfullGraphics: 8/10 This game has aged well and the remasterring did a few touch ups, made a few things look more modern and pleasing to the eye, the only reason I am not giving this a 10 is because dat pixelation when you zoom in, the resolution could have been touched up a bitSound: 7/10I like the soundtrack of this game a lot and it like almost everything else in this game(key word almost) has aged quite well.... except for the hillariously bad playable character voiceovers that get old in 5 minutes tops, some of them are good though, NPCs are pretty good and have also aged welland they also added some new stuff Multiplayer: haven't tried yet cause I want to learn the game and play the main story first/10Gameplay: 7/10Like I said this game has aged very well it just requires a lot of patience, pausing, planning and good ol' trial and error, its not everyones cup of tea but it can grow on you if you give it a chanceFinal verdict If you want a game that will give you hours and hours of gameplay  and have the patience of a saint   I say give it a gobut if you want something easy then this is not the game for you			"

												In 1998, Baldur's Gate was an absolutely amazing game. Far ahead of it's time, extremely complex and deep, great combat, and a lot of interesting 'history' to their world. In 2013, it feels eclipsed by more polished, faster paced, and better graphics games. The unforgiving difficulty forces you to replay a lot for seemingly random reasons. Also, it's size makes exploring a bit of a chore at times, and the number of quests with no real clue as to where to find them makes questing almost tedious. I actually completely forget I have quests sometimes and sometimes spend so much time on side quests I forget what was happening in the main story. Overhaul Games has done a great job of porting and upgrading the game. All the changes are subtle but valuable. I would just suggest waiting for it to be on sale. $20 feels a little steep for a 15 year old game.			"

												I'm a big RPG and BioWare fan, and to hold me over until Dragon Age 3 comes out I decided to try some of BioWare's early games.  I know that you can get the original BG for cheap, but I was interested into the new characters and content, and I wanted to help support bringing back more old games to the current market.  Totally glad I went for it.  This edition is definitely worth it - the new characters are great (especially for people who wanted additional male love interests and same-sex romances), tons of bugs have been fixed, the interface is cleaner, and having an active company supporting the game is a fantastic.

												Ahh, good old Baldur's Gate. Played BG2 when I was really young, like 8 years old and even though I didn't understand it (apart from what my dear brother taught me), I loved it.The Dungeons and Dragon rules is what makes this game. Basically this game uses the same rules as D&D, you know, that game that all the basement-dwelling nerds in the 80s and 90s played with pen, paper and dice? Yeah, that. It's what makes this a hardcore roleplaying game.You make your character any way you want. You want a good but law-breaking drow wizard cross-classed with a thief? Go ahead. You want a neutral, evil half-orc ranger? Go ahead. This game has so many options and the world is so free to do whatever the hell you want, basically. No quests in the entire game feel half-♥♥♥♥♥, everything is very detailed and has a great story.Although I prefer Baldur's Gate 2 (mostly because your characters start on a high level and as a mage, that means more spells), this game is a must for any RPG fan. You'll see such crazy and cool things happen in this game. Your main character getting gibbed (critted into pieces) by gnomes or your mighty fighter getting permanently petrified by someone you thought harmless.This game features a variety of monsters, quests and possibilites and like I said, it's a must for RPG lovers.

												This game is pretty awesome, and you'll like it a lot if you can get past the dated graphics and somewhat harsh combat system. The team at Beamdog has done a fantastic job at rounding a lot of the rough edges that this game had and releasing it again to us with some additional content. I'll get to the additional content later.I had a really fun time playing this game, I had grown up on it when I was a kid, but I had never finished it. So, before this edition was released, I picked up GoG version and played it through to the end with a mixed party, it was a sweet ride, sweet enough that I wanted to go again. So I picked up this version when it game out (I think on the same day or maybe a few after I finished it the first time) and played it again. I finished it up and did just about everything that I could do in the game, trying to find all the hidden tomes, quests, locations, areas, etc. I had a blast. Then I did again! lol. I played it again through for the 3rd time, this time doing a solo speedrun of the game with a ftr/thf/mage (awsome combo), and had an absolute blast doing it again. I can't tell you how impressed I am with this game.But anyways, on to the review.The game is fun, challenging, and has a neat storyline. The graphics... it's a love hate situation; The digitally rendered backgrounds are all really amazing. They are beautiful and stunning to look at, especially after you have completely explored a place. The characters on the otherhand, they are so poorly rendered and animated that you can't even tell that they are actually 3D models and not crapily painted pieces. There are loads of places to go in the game, and a hell of a lot of quests in the game to complete (which is really nice that Beamdog added automatic journal noting so you can actually tell what's a quest and what's not). There are a lot of different monsters to face which eventually require a lot of tactical thinking and spell placement. The classes in the game (AD&D 2nd edition) are unique and are fun to play, especially with the new class kits introduced by Beamdog. The game is fairly straightforward though with it's primary quest chain. Sometimes there's multiple ways to complete a quest (either from alignment, or just dialogue options or approaches), but the game ends the same way no matter what you do.Now for the content that Beamdog has added. There's not much meat here to be honest. The three additional voice acted characters and their quests are cool, but that's about it.I'd reccommend this game to any rpg fan. I wouldn't reccommend this to everyone though, being that the AD&D ruleset is rather archaic hard to understand and comprehend for newbies. 9/10Would speedrun again.			"

												Personal rating: 10/10Replayability: HighBudget: If you already own the original, buy on sale only. Lenght: ... It took me years to finally complete it. I'd wager an experienced player can get it done in a week or more. No less. Baldur's Gate is hands-down one of the best games I've ever played. While initially, porting D&D into a tactical real-time gameplay setting should set off some alarm-bells, this game is one of the most tactical games I've ever played, requiring precison, patience and understanding. It's also a roleplaying game that allows you to explore the, now venerable Forgotten Realms setting that I grew up with (Fantasy books ect.). It features a soundtrack and memorable characters that you will NEVER forget. You'll find yourself hearing things in real life, that almost makes you burst out a quote from this old gem, that no one will get. The biggest problem with Baldur's Gate, is that it's ancient by now... Which is where the enhanced edition comes in! Upgrading the game to HD and even upgrading the game engine and interface to the same standard as the sequel is exactly the kind of boost the game needed to become playable, even to people who didn't grow up with it. Enhanced edition also features some new content. While I appreciated this, I'll be honest and say that I didn't quite feel that this new content entirely fit with the mood of the original game. It was a bit too... Humorous and... Cute. I mean, considering the rather dark underlining theme of the game and the story, it just didn't feel quite right, but this is to be expected as the update was done by a third party. Baldur's Gate, to me, is the predecessor to all modern RPG's.			"

												BG remains a fantastic game to this day, though coming back to it? I was quite frankly irritated with the limitations of the inventory system and reminded very quickly as to why I make sure I pick up Neera (for her Gem Bag) and the Scroll Case that was added in the EE. Anyways, other than that? I want to say ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to whoever decided to keep the level cap for the base game. seriously, ♥♥♥♥ you. My anger about that has nothing to do with game balance and everything to do with the fact that the game is based on a system that lets you go much higher in power and an artificial limiter is left in for ""game balance."" What the ♥♥♥♥. Use the ♥♥♥♥ing rules or don't upgrade the game. Especially when you are literally going to waste my time setting up for the second game in the series.As far as the DLC ""Siege of Dragonspear"" is concerned, I really don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the social pandering of having so many women involved being ""Special."" But I'm am quite irritated that although you figure out Blondies role in the whole matter, to the point that you catch him with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar, you can't change anything with that knowledge. Otherwise, come up with something for BG2, that includes the stuff you opened up with SoD for consistency if you already haven't. Lastly, the DLC was too railroady. Other than that I liked it, especially the use of hiding things behind animations that only people with Infravision can pierce or have to be told about to find. "

Back in 1998 we had to install Baldur's Gate with 7 Disks and Switch Disks that was good times. today Baldur's Gate Original Saga is now on 1 Disk dvd. I really reccommend Baldur's Gate 1 and 2.

												This is a review for a very specific catagory of people.I bought this game, along with it's sequal, only so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of patching it whenever I reinstalled my existing, regular version. I generally play at least one infinity engine game a year and don't keep them on my hard drive inbetween.If this review was for the game itself it would be nothing but glowing praise. Baldur's gate still somehow stands up to more modern releases when coupled with the tutu mod, et al. As it stands, this enhanced edition changes some elements in a way that I, personally don't like.If you are a returning player, like me, and looking for convinience, I recommend a little research into the differences between this, and a modded original.

												Game tweaks and enhancements are very nice compared to the original game, but the added characters are out of place and overall the content Beamdog added feels forced on you. Also, the new characters are scripted into the main plot so you have to talk with them at least once (whether you'd like to or not). Save your money and mod the original with better quality and free upgrades.			"

												This game (and its sequel) is really the single best example of a PC game using actual DnD rules, but in this case the computer is the Game Master.  For its time, it was considered extremely well done.  The story is really strong, and will keep you playing just to find out what happens next.  If you squint real hard, you can sort of see the similarity between this game and more recent fantasy RPGs like Dragon Age.  The idea of pausing the game to issue orders to your squad, then resuming action to see those orders carried out sort of started with Baldur's Gate.			"

												With regard's to Baldur's Gate itself: This is perhaps the greatest RPG that has ever been made. To be a fan of this genre and to have not played this game is pure blasphemy and should be reconciled immediately. All kidding aside, this game is truly incredible and it is a true testament to its quality that it can stand up to current generation games. Baldur's Gate is based upon the Dungeons and Dragons' D20 system and borrows from the Forgotten Realms universe. The game has an incredible cast of characters, varied environments, well-balanced gameplay and so much depth that you'll want to play every class again and again.If there were any black mark's against this game, it is only that people who do not know D&D and Advanced D&D rules will struggle and the difficulty curve is more of a scatter plot on your first play through since the game gives very little direction and it is very easy to get into high difficulty encounters at low levels if you go into the wrong areas.With regards to the Enhanced Edition: The game came out in 1998 and this edition manages to fix many bugs and update the graphics to make them less pixelly and more tolerable to play on high resolution systems. Additionally, several new characters, companions and quests have been added to give veterans something new.There is no game I'd reccomend more than this... except Baldur's Gate II...			"

												The classic lives again. About 15 years after my first Baldur's Gate Experience on the PC (which was quite horrible, Shank and Carvos killed me like 20 times) i got to get back in on the Story and it was as captivating as ever. Maybe even more, because i now omitted the crazy german localization and got to experience everything. The character creation offers more options now, there are some well-writte new recruitable NPCs, so if you're in for a bit of nostalgia and solid RPG-Experience, this is a game for you.			"

												I won this during the Steam Holiday auction for ~$2.50 worth of harvested gems. Well worth the asking price though (I didn't think this originally, as I assumed it was simply what I already knew). The additional content in the Enhanced Edition is pretty cool, however. It's new content to me, so I'm apt to dump another 30-40 hours of my life back into this game on the play through nearly ten years later. 11/10 one of the best RPGs ever and you can export your character for use in Baulders Gate II.

The writing is really good, as is the immersive world. The first game for me that made mages feel really powerful.			"

												My hours on this game are not correctly represented on this,  as I have played many more.  I am still a noob in so many respects,  and I have failed more than I have succeeded.  But it is one of those games that takes time to master, and worth the time.  Follow the main story, or go off the beaten path.  Be whoever you want to be, but with real consequences for your choices.  Choose your party wisely, and pay attention to their needs.  This is no simple game, and that is a good thing.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a classic turn based RPG that looks and plays very nicely in the enhanced version.   I played the original to completion and liked  it a lot; I went through it again with the enhanced version and it actually felt fresh and was fun to play again after so many years.  It helps of course that the there is considerable replay value because of the character creation and playstyle opportunities, including many choices as to companions.If you haven't played it I would suggest it is a lot like Dragon Age Origins (obviously DA  was  heavily influenced by the earlier game).  Of course the graphics aren't going to be quite as good but they are certainly not bad in this version.			"

												Having played Baldur's Gate through at least once every year since it's initial release, I will recommend this. It feels almost alien at first with the interface and ability to duel wield weapons etc, but soon becomes a nice feel. The main selling point for me was to be able to play this on a modern PC instead of the Windows 98 rig I kept running. Still the same game, still the same awe inspiring story and depth, and still have Minsc in my party every single playthrough.			"

The game is just the way you remember it (for better or worse), but has a much more smooth and polished feel to it.  There is a few added extras (including a new dungeon) for all of those who stil are skeptical about paying for the game (again).

												This remake of a amazing classic has managed to stay very true to the orginal. The creators of enhanced edition took the most popular mods and added them into the standard game in addition to fixing various annoyance bugs that plagued the original. While this game offers very little that you cannot get by buying the original and modding it your self, it does off the convenience of a single install without having to mess with the inner files.This game has stood the test of time and will provide you with a amazing amount of depth and replayability, and with the addition of modded content after you finish your first dozen or so playthroughs you can add hundreds of hours to the gameplay.I do infact reccomend this purchase for anyone who has not experienced the saga before as it is perfect for anyone new to the game. For players who already own the original saga and have extended the game with mods this version is less useful, it will not offer you anything aside from new companions that you don't already have.

												Generally very good. Uses an older D&D ruleset (it's quite complex) and from experience takes quite a bit of getting used to. The game is also buggy, I was unable to complete the tutorials, because of a seemingly uncommon glitch which means that you are unable to find traps. However, if you are willing to overlook this, it is a superb game. I would advise reading up on it first (the wiki is a great resource).

												I have barely begun playing the Enhanced Edition of Baldur's Gate, but I've been a Baldur's Gate player since 1999 and a D&D player since the mid 80's. I LOVE the Enhanced Edition of BG! It is AWESOME! New weapons, armor, characters, adventures. The area and world maps are really nice as well. It makes the original BG seem archaic by comparison. Now that I have the Enhanced Edition, I may never play the original again. I can't wait to play the Enhanced Edition of BGII. One question, though: When will Enhanced Editions of Icewind Dale and NeverWinter Nights be coming out?			"

It may not be the best graphically anymore but the storyline is still there and with the enhanced edition there are a lot more options. It took me nearly 50 hours of gaming to max out the experience of my party members and I still had quests left over. If you have played the game the first time round this is a great piece of nostalgia and the added NPC's and areas are just as interesting as the originals.

In ‘98 you had a 15 inch CRT, so you’re not going to notice or care probably. Nowadays when you’ve got an HD screen, you’re like, ‘Oh, those are coffee beans.’ We had to render out new streets and then lay them into the original 2D art and then paint over it. It was this whole process.”i didn't get the DLC SOD, so i dont have to see the unacceptable things they change to char  personality's besides the fact, that it dose not even play like BG or BG2 its pretty much linear it has chapters of open world but once the chapters done you can no longer go to the previous areas.but as for the gay or trans char its not really that forced and in the D&Dfirst edition there's a gods who come to people as what ever gender they want so a trans in the game is no biggie or a gay but the personality's of set characters not the new ones being changed is unacceptable in my opinion also the fact that allot of your choices in the game mean nothing unlike the original BG1&2 i really dont care that i can now see and play with 100+ char in a screen at once means nothing to me			"

												Baldur's Gate and B♥♥♥♥re awsome.  Baldur's gate + new char's + new missions + new areas + new resolution = stop reading this and buy it.Baldur gate had a very strong story that kept you pushing to find out the truth.  There are many twist in the story that makes you believe that you know what is going and who is responsible.  Then boom, you are poorly mistaken.  Baldur's gate's story is able to keep you hooked because of this.Gameplay has always been fun and challenging.  Because of limited resources, wheter spell count, ammo, or broken weapons; this game makes you think (hit the space bar and plan) and then react based on your assets.  Did you spam all your spells?? Bad move, that was just the first fight in this dungeon!! You just brought 2 quivers of bolts/arrows?  Silly Silly man.  Basically, if you enjoy playing  a games that makes you use your brain;  you will be happy.  You enjoy FPS where all you do is dash and shotgun people, then this isn't for you.			"

												Out of the two I always believed Baldur's Gate 1 had more replay value than BG2, by grace of the fact that their were more areas to explore and a few more characters to get in your party. But BG2 SOA always outdid its older brother with its better graphics, cooler abilities and classes. Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is a leveler. It brings the two great titles together as one. No longer the mismatched due of old brother and young brother. Now they are mature, sensible and funny twins that band together in unison to catch the spotlight. I have not enjoyed myself this much playing a video game since TES: Skyrim. Well do Beamdog, well done.			"

												Baldur's Gate is a classic role-playing game, the great grandfather of games such as Skyrim and the Witcher 2. Set in the Forgotten Realms, Baldur's Gate uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. Despite the age of this game and the dated nature of the graphics it remains very playable with plenty of locations to expore and treasures to find. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPG games who is willing to forgive the rather dated graphics. I bought the game when it was on sale, given its age I don't think it is really worth the full RRP, more modern games like Dragon Age Origins and the Witcher 2 offer better value for money.			"

												A lot of what gets added are things that you can get from free Baldur's Gate mods - bug fixes, fixed quests, etc. What you can't get from free mods is support for widescreen/high-res monitors that actually looks good and keeps the interface at a reasonable scale. (Yes, free mods will let you run baldur's gate at a high resolution, but the characters and interface all become very tiny.) Honestly it is worth it just for that.Additionally, the new characters and their quests are pretty decent.			"

												I've had the original Baldur's Gate since it was first released and since then it's been one of my all time favorite games. I was sceptical about the re-release enhanced edition but decided that since it was on sale I would give it a shot. I was not dissapointed.The new interface, while more technical adds a bit more depth to decision making on equipment. The steam-matchmaking system is incredible compared to the old multi-player, and the higher resolution helps with seeing combat without having the move the screen. Lastly and most importantly it works. Without having to alter windows resolution, bit-colors, or not working simply because it was made for such and older system. 10/10 for an amazing rog with a space hamster.			"

												Although old in video game terms, Baldur's Gate is still an incredibly fresh legend and pillar of RPGs. Enhanced Edition is mostly a costmetic facelist; for better or worse, the corse gameplay and all of its quirks are still in place. Even compared to modern RPGs however, Baldur's Gate still excels in incredible ways. The story, characters, and voice acting are still top notch. When reviewers say ""in the spirit of Baldur's Gate"" these are the things that come to mind- a dynamic party of 3-D characters and a world teeming with unique individuals. Many modern RPGs suffer from generic NPCs who only exist to keep the player trodding along the story; Baldur's Gate proves that wasn't a rule a decade ago, and it sure as hell isn't today. The 2nd Edition D&D rules are...tricky at best. As with many older games, you'll need to sit down and read the manual and learn the system before you do anything else, or you'll have a lot of trouble determining which armors are better and why certain items don't work the right way all the time. That's easily the roughest learning curve of the game. Baldur's Gate defined a generation and set a standard that games are still measured by to this day...and its sequel is even /better/. So I suggest starting here, at simple level 1, work your way through a kick-♥♥♥ game, then graduate to the king of RPGs.			"

												This is the game that made me a PC gamer. It it the genesis of games like Dragon Age: Origins and Mass Effect, RTS party based combat, a story progression which was way ahead of it's time. And all of it based around an DnD framework, you won't get a more authentic dungeon-crawling, world-exploring fantasy experience anywhere.PROTIP: Use your spacebar... a lot.			"

The new characters that join your party are fun :) especially Neera, though wild surges can be somewhat bizarre as you cast magic missile and giant confusing birds appear!?!?!  Maybe in future the inventory screen could be paused/unpaused manually, that would be useful.			"

												If you played BG back in the day, you will find this version much, much more playable on your modern PC. I played BD and BG2 for years, multiple times across a decade, but mostly stuck to B♥♥♥♥s the resolution for BG was terrible (thus the game becomes more time-consuming than it need be) and tinkering with the mods was becoming troublesome.If you want a super-playable BG out of the box, I got this for 5 bucks on steam, and oh man, its better than before. BG2 rules and classes/spells means I can look forward to a cleaner import to BG2 (because cmon that's whatcha wanna do isn't it). It should be obvious, I'm speaking to the experienced players of BG. I have no idea what a newcomer would think of the price, given the graphics (even with the awesome resolution fix, its still ten years old). Us old-timers play the game nostalgically, and that's the reason I bought the game. Also I waited for it to come on sale, and am waiting for BG2 to go on sale as well...			"

												I truly think there in no other game like this.  BG2 for PC was a bench mark game in RPG games.  It's stories were a little difficult to follow. You always thought there was a little more you should know because of a random scroll, text, tomble, or ""other"" you just finished reading.  That imperfection is less overwelming in this game.  I think it is under appreciated.  I give it 5 out of 5.  Trying to put the mouse away with this game isn't easy!			"

												Don't let my ""low"" hours fool you, I have a copy of the original game that I've played for at least a hundred hours, and I quite often play my games in ""offline"" mode.A huge amount of story depth, wonderfully rich characters with growth, a true-to-the-source gameplay and character creation...all these things are in Baldur's Gate. And the Enhanced Edition just makes it even better.If you like Role-Playing Games then you'll probably like this game, unless you are a complete graphics-♥♥♥♥♥ that can't stand playing anything less than Crysis games or Skyrim. If you can ""stomach"" games like Diablo 2, Sacrifice, or any other ""old games"" with ""bad graphics"" then you'll discover a rich, wonderful story just waiting to be heard and explored. In addition, you'll find extravagently beautiful (especially for 1998) backgrounds, voice acting, sounds, paintings, and buildings in this game. If you played Neverwinter Nights (1 and/or 2), Planescape: Tormet, Divine Divinity, Icewind Dale, or any other ""iconic"" RPG then you'll definitely want to play this game.However, you also might want to realize that in a game like this you'll want to micromanage the crap out of your party. After every round you'll probably want to pause, make sure your spellcasters (or damage dealers) are going to actually do something that round of attacks, and then unpause. I can't tell you how many times I've had to pause to make sure my Archer is attacking something, since he kills damn near everything in two to three hits and there's no way I'm letting him switch to his AI, which wants him to attack enemies with his DAMN FISTS. STUPID AI!*Ahem* Anyway, yeah, you'll want to make sure your spellcasters do something after each spell, that your high-accuracy high-damaging characters switch targets, and that you probably won't want to use most of the AI (as is always the case in RPGs in my experience).

I love the new zoom feature and most of the little tweaks to the interface. Dialogues are very well written and engaging. I didn't read them so much when I played the old version many years ago, but the writing is very, very good. It's a difficult game, very easy to get slaughtered at the beginning and this takes a player by surprise, especially one who is used to leveled enemies. One could assume they are easy because the heroes are LvL 1, however beware! Not to mention the weapons break at the start of the game. So far, I am enthralled again.			"

												If you ever want to join me in a game that I own, I would tell you to look into Baldur's Gate, its a multi-player RPG. Its really old but it goes of the origanl Dungeon and Dragon's rulebook. I like RPG a lot, but this game is old, but let me tell you its super fun and after we beat the first one, we can both get the second one, and beat that too. LOL, but its up to you. You might want to go on youtube to see if you like it, if you do `note that this is the enhanced  edition, there is a difference. I am down for any recommendations as well. Just imagine Skyrim, but multi-player. Plus I can help anyone who wants to join, its up to 6 players, but if it is just two or three of us we can fill the team with AI that we control. Fantastic game for the time it was made... I am Jamz D3n and I approve this message.			"

												I firest played Baldur's Gate when they actually charged money for demos. It was a great game, so I purchased the whole things and spent a few summers at least playing this game between school years. I've now purchased it again on Steam, and it's better than ever. The enhanced edition brings some new features and helps complete the game in a more modern era of gaming. It is a lot more resource intensive than it used to be however. Making me wonder what method they used to update the game. I was suprised my laptop couldn't play it decently even though it's light years ahead of the computer I played the original version on.

												This isometric strategy rpg rewards you for creative use of your party's skills while you uncover a secret as to why you are hunted by a powerful dark lord. There are so many quest in this game that I would be suprised if you found them all in your first playthrough. Just as fun as the original, but with an improved UI and bug fixes. It includes the extra characters, and their side stories, as well as the expansion. One of the features I enjoyed the most with the new UI is the color changes between each character. It really makes it clear who is who when you have two people wearing the same armor.			"

The graphics aren't as enhanced as it would lead you on to be, it's still presented in it's original pixelated glory(not that there is anything wrong with that), despite an increase in resolution. the slight bit of new content that it does add is refreshing, the two new characters are fun to interact with and are fully voiced.

												The world of Faerun (Pronounced ""Fay-Rune"") is a land of fantasy, where Wizards cast their awesome spells, and Clerics call upon their Diety for their spells.  Fighters, Druids, and Thieves do their own things to help the group as well.  Drizz't Do'urden, the Drow Ranger from R. A. Savaltore, and Elminister from Ed Greenwood are some of the more popular characters from the novelization of Faerun.The Time of Troubles brought the Dieties to mortal form because one of the Gods stole an artifact from the Father of Gods: Ao... and because he didn't know who was responsible, he cast all Gods to the mortal plane of Faerun until the return of the artifact.  If they were killed during this time, the killer could take their place.  20 years have passed since then, and the game starts with you at Candlekeep, the ward of the old mage Gorian.With a good story, multiple Recruitable NPC's such as Minsc the Rasheman Berserker (With Boo, the Giant Minature Space Hamster), the pessimist Xan the Sorcerer, or the axe-loving merchant dwarf Kaigan, and lots and lots of spells and magical loot, Baldur's Gate held it's own as the definitive WRPG, and had 5 disks back in the 90's.The Enhanced Edition adds 4 new NPC's, many of the class kits from the 2nd game, and more loot, contains the expansion Tales of the Sword Coast included, and some graphical upgrades.  Just beware of Wyverns, as they tend to crash the game (at least, for me anyways).I will be the last, and you will go first.			"

												This was one of my first D&D PC games. The enhanced edition captures all the nostalgia of the original game and lives up to its name as the Enhanced Edition with great new features such as new characters, quests, an extra storyline (The Black Pitts), and a much better multiplayer base. If anyone is looking for a great way to just relax, save a few villagers, and kill a BUNCH of Kobolds along the way then try living the 90's D&D adventure.			"

												Best RPG ever made.   :P   if you are an oldschool gamer you've probably heard of or played this.  If you are a newer hardcore gamer and enjoy RPGs I would HIGHLY reccomend playing this game.  It will take you a few tries and countless hours but you will greatly enjoy the story and the experience.   With ~25 classes and even more combinations the ability to reply this game is there.  I have spent easily 200hours or more on this game in my life and still enjoy it every time I come back to play it.			"

												I've only played up to recruiting Jhalid and Jaheira, but so far this game is as awesome and humbling as I remember. I love the new zoom feature and most of the little tweaks to the interface. Dialogues are very well written and engaging. I didn't read them so much when I played the old version many years ago, but the writing is very, very good. It's a difficult game, very easy to get slaughtered at the beginning and this takes a player by surprise, especially one who is used to leveled enemies. One could assume they are easy because the heroes are LvL 1, however beware! Not to mention the weapons break at the start of the game. So far, I am enthralled again.			"

												With regard's to Baldur's Gate itself: This is perhaps the greatest RPG that has ever been made. To be a fan of this genre and to have not played this game is pure blasphemy and should be reconciled immediately. All kidding aside, this game is truly incredible and it is a true testament to its quality that it can stand up to current generation games. Baldur's Gate is based upon the Dungeons and Dragons' D20 system and borrows from the Forgotten Realms universe. The game has an incredible cast of characters, varied environments, well-balanced gameplay and so much depth that you'll want to play every class again and again.If there were any black mark's against this game, it is only that people who do not know D&D and Advanced D&D rules will struggle and the difficulty curve is more of a scatter plot on your first play through since the game gives very little direction and it is very easy to get into high difficulty encounters at low levels if you go into the wrong areas.With regards to the Enhanced Edition: The game came out in 1998 and this edition manages to fix many bugs and update the graphics to make them less pixelly and more tolerable to play on high resolution systems. Additionally, several new characters, companions and quests have been added to give veterans something new.There is no game I'd reccomend more than this... except Baldur's Gate II...			"

												Although old in video game terms, Baldur's Gate is still an incredibly fresh legend and pillar of RPGs. Enhanced Edition is mostly a costmetic facelist; for better or worse, the corse gameplay and all of its quirks are still in place. Even compared to modern RPGs however, Baldur's Gate still excels in incredible ways. The story, characters, and voice acting are still top notch. When reviewers say ""in the spirit of Baldur's Gate"" these are the things that come to mind- a dynamic party of 3-D characters and a world teeming with unique individuals. Many modern RPGs suffer from generic NPCs who only exist to keep the player trodding along the story; Baldur's Gate proves that wasn't a rule a decade ago, and it sure as hell isn't today. The 2nd Edition D&D rules are...tricky at best. As with many older games, you'll need to sit down and read the manual and learn the system before you do anything else, or you'll have a lot of trouble determining which armors are better and why certain items don't work the right way all the time. That's easily the roughest learning curve of the game. Baldur's Gate defined a generation and set a standard that games are still measured by to this day...and its sequel is even /better/. So I suggest starting here, at simple level 1, work your way through a kick-♥♥♥ game, then graduate to the king of RPGs.			"

Graphs are out of date but hey what do you expect from a game originally released in 1998 :-)Ive read bad reviews of the BG-Enhanced version but so far I havent encountered any bugs or shortcomings. The adding of new characters are nice but not needed. A very good game but the price is imho way too high for a remake of such an old game. Same goes for the follow up and Icewind Dale series			"

												I played the original extensively and have to say this is every bit as good!I'm not totally convinced that they haven't nerfed the difficulty slighly but I'm playing on hard and that seems to balance it out nicely. The new items are nice, they could have put in the murderous sword of killing +999, and ruined the game but they thankfully didn't.I've nearly finished the game now and can honestly say this is just as good as ever. The storyline is epic. It is damn hard to play evil in this game though. There's a lot of reviews on here that say ""don't buy this game unless you played the original"", but it's not THAT hard, it's turn based when you want it to be. Just mash quick save a lot so you can try different tactics on a hard encounter. I wouldn't recommend having your character as a mage first time round as assasins (there's always some hired goon after you) etc tend to go for your main character even if you have them further down the running order. I still think this is the closest computer game to proper DnD, and I like how you can turn on hit rolls. Ultimately, I can't wait to play BG2 next (again) as that really is ADnD but with a macastic sadist for dungeon master. The visuals might look dated to some, but I find it endearing really, although I would have thought they might work on the audio a little as it's bugged to buggery. Compatability wise, I'm playing on a crappy toshiba windows 8 laptop and it runs perfectly. Finally, the added ""pits"" mode is great, so much fun trying to make silly parties and seeing if you can do it, ie- 6 mages haha.

												Since this is baldur's gate and most people have already played it I will skip the review of the actual game if it was new which its not, instead I will focus on what this game brings and its changes that I noticed in my playthrough.  When I started BG:EE I first noticed that the text is really crisp on the menu but looks out of place for some reason like the borders around text for the buttons are too large but whatever.  I really like how you can zoom in and out and I like how you can play kits without mods in this version.  I played as a Kensai in my playthrough which is a fighter kit that is focused on raw damage and it was really fun and seemed like a totally different game sometimes.Pros:-More quests-More characters-Native support for HD resolutions-Zoom-BG2 kits and classes along with new ones-Many cutscenes are better-Removed or shortened pointless cutscenes (I think)/allows you to skip them tooCons:-Costs more than original game-I didn't like the multicoloured character circles-Some cutscenes that were Important were shortened or worsened, more on this later-Some of the menu graphics were odd-The chat box would keep enlarging itself without going back-New voices mostly are unfitting, more on thisOverall this was worth the money to me but for many it wont be because they dont mind dealing with the mods and lowere resolution.  The cutscenes experience is weird, for the most part I like it but some of them like the intro and end cutscenes left much to be desired.  The intro on the old game was already good enough, if they wanted it with better graphics they could have atleast did a better job on it especially if its supposed to tell part of the main story.  The end cutscene was even worse, without spoiling it basically even though I know how the end goes I could definatly imagine people getting even more confused than the original because the animation is so bad in the new one. About the voices, they are high quality and have poor voice acting so when you hear your new party member talk immediately before talking to an old NPC you can hear the obvious quality differences.  Also that new wild mage annoys me. "

												Buckle your seatbelt, kids, we're going to take a trip down childhood memory lane. I remember playing Baldur's Gate 2 when I was in my late, nerdy teens, and I fondly remember spending hours on end playing the game. Graphics are AMAZING for the time, and you can't really get anymore immersive without sacrificing your weekend hours going to a Live Action Role Play session in Nerdville! You want to be a Half-Elf Wizard? Do it. An evil Human who wields two daggers, steals from the rich and gives to the poor only to then take it back and keep it for yourself? DO IT. I suggest you buy this game, grab a 12 pack of your favorite soda, a bag or two of your favorite snack and prepare yourself for an adventure you won't soon forget. Ladies and gentlemen, ask not what you can do for your nerd, but what can your nerd do for you?			"
