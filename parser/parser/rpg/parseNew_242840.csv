												EDIT: It's Levioooosa, not Leviossssaaa xDNow that I've resolved some major technical problems, I am editing my original comment to include a more positive review and some warnings/solutions for future players. I recommend this game for its unique and immersive atmosphere along with fascinating lore and challenging puzzles. From the first moment of gameplay, I was pulled into this strange and mysterious world. I was so happy to finally play that I completely lost track of time. There have been some complaints about voice recognition. So far, I have had zero problems with this. The system works great and responds quickly to my voice even if I don't always say the spell 100% correctly. Here are some problems I've personally encountered: 1. Does not work with a second monitor plugged in for me. In order to play this game, I was forced to completely disconect my second monitor. Otherwise, the game wasn't starting up. Inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. I can deal with it. 2. After unplugging said second monitor, the game was still crashing. However, I found that once I added ""-windowed"" to the startup options, I was able to load up the game in windowed mode and fix the resolution manually from there (apparently, that was what was causing the conflict). Make sure you have a microphone plugged in.3. The game periodically loses sound for no apparent reason. The cause is yet to be determined, but the only way I can get the sound back is to restart the entire game. Annoying, but again - not hate worthy.  I don't know what fixed this issue, but it's stopped happening for me.Aside from these pitfalls, I've had a blast playing the actual game and would still recommend it despite a few bugs/glitches here and there. Contacting official support was a breeze and a response came within two hours of my email.			"

 Summary: This isn't a game for everyone, as it's more of an adventure game and an exploration game more then anything else, but the unique feature that's present here with casting spells with the microphone is well, interesting to say the least. People looking for action should stay far away from this game as it's a slow methodical explorer with slight similarities to the original Myst, and you will get lost if you're not careful. It's a beatiful world to explore and take in the sights, even if you don't necessarily get lore or any idea of what truly the world has to offer. Backtracking can be a problem however, and the game does not hold your hand (similar to The Vanishing of Ethan Carter). In short, a game that's an alright experience to pick up on the cheap, if you're looking for a game that takes you through a journey of a wandering wizard.  Gameplay Footage and Video Review:

			I like casting spells. And this definitely has something different going on in terms of the genre.....because it's using the microphone to cast them. Want to feel like an adventuring wizard?		

 Player Match: Those who love to explore at a slow pace, taking in their scenery, and want to experiment with Microphone implementation in games.  Lists: +: The perfect game for someone who loves exploring, and in particular, pays close attention to the details around them.  The world built is intriguing, and rather beatiful in it's artwork and lighting. Voice recognition of the game is implemented wonderful, and it offers options for those who may have trouble getting the default to work. Strong immersion factor.-: There's no hand holding. You will wonder what you're missing, and will get lost at times. Significant backtracking for no good reason. Patches have helped fix this somewhat. Doesn't have an “ooo” factor in terms of gameplay or even the overall picture.  "

												I honestly bought In Verbis Virtus entirely for the gimmicky voice-casting mechanic and I was not disappointed at all. The first time I spoke into my mic and suddenly my fist burst into a flare of holy light, I basically♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. The voice-casting never lost its novelty for me (even though the speech recognition occasionally didn't work for me and my American accent). The game itself is absolutely gorgeous. Like I actually gasped aloud a few times. Dark cramped corridors dotted with bioluminescent mushrooms, crumbling gothic architecture, glowing runes...My only gripe is that the puzzles are sometimes frustrating and not terribly intuitive.Lastly, if this game is ever expanded upon or a sequel made, I'm begging for a female PC as well!

												It's good.ProsVoice control makes for a very immersive game, and it works much better than I expected. (although it will make you super self-conscious)It's pretty. Clearly had a lot of love invested in the environment design and creepy♥♥♥♥♥statues.Excellent level design. The puzzles walk a fine line between easy enough not to frustrate you but difficult enough to not be trivial.Longer than I was expecting for the price bracket. Good value for money.Cons""Voice control"" quickly becomes ""angry shout control"" when it doesn't recognise you the first time and that doesn't help it understand you the second time. It turns out that ""NO! not ♥♥♥♥ing ecto lumeh! I said ♥♥♥♥ing atul ♥♥♥♥ing agni!"" is not one of the recognised spells. Explaining to people nearby that you're casting magic spells makes you look super geeky. My wife's eye-rolling has reached dangerous levels.			"

												A real gem on the Steam Store this one.A beautiful and atmospheric game with great immersion, style and lore. Use your mic to cast spells, solve puzzles and protect yourself from the dangers of the temple with some pretty awesome spells. Having to remember as many spells as you can is a nice touch, rather than it just giving you a button to press to cast ""spell A"", for example, you have to remember the words. In a pinch, that's not always easy to do and fumbling the pronunciation can happen when you are in a rush, but the feeling of pulling these things off is fantastic. Definitely well worth the cost if you want something fresh and interesting and don't mind having to think a little. I won't go into the story as it really needs to be experienced rather than told, but this game is highly recommended since Beta for me and it has only improved from there.			"

												Games with wasted potential like this make me angry. The graphics, controls, and atmosphere are superb. The voice recognition is great and casting spells by voice is a blast. Shame it's wasted on such a lame and incredibly obnoxious puzzler.I don't think I could design more annoying combat or puzzles if I tried. There's very little combat, and thank goodness for that because enemies are as much of a threat to your patience as to your health bar.  Either they're swarms of critters you have to either back away from awkwardly or whittle away, or they're poorly programmed humanoid enemies who spend half the time sitting there and half the time charging you, and only react to your spells half the time.As for the puzzles and exploration, there's very little thinking involved. It's 5% thought, 10% trial and error, and 85% scouring every last area for some easily missed scribbling, statue, hidden mechanic, or other piece of junk you need. The map in the start of the second level is either completely unreadable or for another area, because I spent a good 10 minutes looking at it and looking around trying to orient it and figure out where I was. There's an area where you take damage as long as you stay there for literally no reason, with no indication except for a small grunt when you enter the area.You barely even get to use your spells creatively. They may as well just be keys for various locks.If you will excuse me, I'm going to go pull out all my hair now.			"

Early Access Review
								In Verbis Virtus has eaten up a dozen hours of my time so far, and I don't regret it one bit.Amazing game and atmosphere. Attention has been payed to the details. And you as a player will have to do the same thing. (No pixel hunting however!)A well executed first person exploration and puzzle game with some well integrated action and enjoyable platforming. You will have to use your brain... and your tongue!Highly recommended.Built 0.5.757 - 2 actsStability: very good for an alpha. No crash to deplore. No unsolvable critical bug. Can withstand alt-tabbing and parallel applications very nicely.Video: Very good for an alpha.Audio: Very good.Voice recognition: Excellent compared to some applications. Can be approximative sometimes. But rewarding and not gimmicky. Fun. It becomes natural after a time.SFX: Very good.Voices: Good.Music: Pleasant. Not unforgettable so far.Graphics: Very good. Love the attention to details, the objects and textures, the close-up water effects & waves. Eery, beautiful, creepy...Controls: Nice and simple. Facilitates immersion.Cutscenes: Good.Save mechanics: Takes too much time to load. Limited options due to alpha state.GUI/UI: Main menu is a bit bland. UI in game is discrete.Exploration: Very good.Puzzles: Great puzzles & varied! Observation & probing required, good integration of spells. Some can be devious or a bit obtuse, but lore elements have nice hints. Spells: Very good so far. Put to good use. Environments: Some very beautiful (or creepily well executed) rooms. Excellent use of light & (dynamic) shadows.Ennemies: Scarce and each of them a challenge so far, but in need of functional improvements.Lore: Interesting. Nicely done.Story: Too ealry to be judged.Enjoyment: 9/10Would I recommend it to a friend in its current state: Yes. Even the sometimes approximative voice recognition and occasional critical bug do not remove the fun of the current build.Selling points: main game mechanic, environments, puzzlesWhat I would like to do with it: (if I were proficient enough and had the time) make a full magic-centric action & 3D platforming rpg with it (like a remake of Ultima Underworld or Arx Fatalis).

												In Verbis Virtus is a fantasy adventure game where you cast spells in Maha’ki, the language of the gods, using your own voice. I gotta say: the very first time I cast a light spell just by saying a few words and the game responding immediately after I said it....I had the biggest nerdgasm ever. I felt the need to put on my robe and wizards hat. Yeah, it excited me. I won’t apologize.Throughout the game you discover and learn multiple spells, each with its own purpose and power. You solve challenging puzzles, escape traps and battle monsters with magic.You could lose yourself for hours in captivity by it's stunning graphics. It's one of the most unique and immersive games I've had the chance of buying. In otherwords, I give this game a 10/10. I would become a wizard over and over again.			"

								In Verbis Virtus is a unique game that uses your voice to do your spells which is actually ok to use and it's not gimicky, been playing for a bit but the game does have it's 'you solve the puzzle this certain way only' with only a vague hint, havent gone through the game yet, atleast haven't gotten to the combat, so i'll update the review when im fully done with what they have in the current version.

			In Verbis Virtus allows you to step in the shoes of a wizard and cast spells pronouncing them for real. (mic needed) More info at: http://KSalue.com ~Twitter: http://Twitter.com/KSalue ~TS3IP:...		

Well, the game itself is fun, high quality and everything, but they really 'really' need to add a better hint system, if they do that then we got a solid great game. aside from that the game is great for the asking price. Also, would mind like a side box or something with a reminder of the names of the spells (unless you make an animation where you pull out a book, that would be amazing)More info here: KSalue[www.ksalue.com] "

												Note: This is a borderline game, some people will really enjoy it in spite of its flaws, but I can't recommend it for the average consumer, as you will almost certainly need to look up a guide at some point -- read on for reasons why (no spoilers).This game has a lot going for it, but as a puzzle game it's really let down by the level design. Your objectives are extremely unclear and though the levels are open, it only serves to confuse and frustrate, as you can't actually complete tasks out of order -- there is a very linear progression to each level, but you have to figure out what that is through trial and error.  That's fun when the game is asking you to figure out how to use your arsenal of spells to get through an area, but it's just annoying when you don't have the tool to solve a puzzle, and you can only find that out by banging your head against it for half an hour.  Multiple times so far I have looked up a solution for a room only to discover that I was in the wrong place and needed to go do something on the opposite side of the map. It adds nothing to the difficulty of the puzzles or the enjoyment of the game. I'm seriously questioning my resolve to finish the game at this point, since I know it will take me 2-3 times as long as it could have if levels were better designed and playtested.If you have a high tolerance for obscure puzzles and obtuse level design, the voice-activated spells are truly unique and the game is a lot of fun. If, however, you're not an early adopter of new mechanisms, I would hold off on IVV for now -- maybe the levels will be reworked to be either more linear, or the open world will be given a purpose beyond stretching the game time.  If not, someone will steal the verbal spellcasting idea and put it in a better game soon enough.5/10			"

 Quick Review: In Verbis Virtus does two things right: the visuals (mostly) and then the speaking mechanic. Unfortunately, I think nearly every other mechanic is either annoying or just dumb. The game should have been a pure puzzle game, but it does too much and fails.  Here's what works: Using your voice to pick spells. This is literally the single best mechanic in the game. It works about 85-90% of the time, which may not sound great, but if the game had been a pure puzzle game that would not be an issue. In fact, I am fairly confident it could work in a game like Skyrim, where you have a little bit of leeway between enemy encounter and needing to be completely ready. You can switch between the game's made up language and English for the spells, though the English versions are a little long. The game will say the spells out loud to you if you need it. The visuals. Not very original, and the glowy particles hurt my eyes a few times, (especially the save points) but otherwise the game looks good. Not having mana. All mana would do is slow you down and make puzzles unbearable, I am glad it was not included.Here's what is functional, for the most part: The atmosphere. It's dark fantasy, I guess. I wasn't actually paying too much attention, but there was magic, blood, and breasts. I can't say too much about the actual writing of the game, I skimmed through literally all of it, but the actual feel of the world is lackluster. It is very static, the only things that move are some rocks and the enemies, but most of the enemies take away from the experience so it doesn't matter. The controls, in theory. As long as you are not doing timed puzzles and there is nothing around to hurt you they work just fine. The spells. Like the visuals in that they were fancy, but not interesting. Not your average fantasy spells, but not very exciting either. I found a flashlight, a laser beam that you had to point directly at the puzzle object, a spell that was 100% contextual and just moved stuff for me, and a telekinesis spell that was dumb and clunky because it required two other phrases if you wanted to move things closer or further away. The music, probably. I didn't really listen to it, but it wasn't offensive.Here's what doesn't work: Having health. I guess the no mana guy went to lunch because I don't see any logical connection in getting rid of mana, but not health in a puzzle game. In an action game sure, but this game is supposed to be about puzzles. All losing health does is make the game arbitrarily more difficult. The enemies and puzzles are kept pretty much completely apart, it would have been best if the enemies were removed or made part of the environment instead of kept as a real barrier to progress. The controls, in practice. In order to beat the puzzles you have to be 100% on the target, and a lot of times it doesn't even make sense. Since the voice commands are only mostly accurate, having to really on quick reflexes is completely unfair because you can saying a command right but the game doesn't have to agree with you. In Verbis Virtus seems to be in on it too, spawning enemies to get rid of your health and then putting you in time trial death traps. This is infinitely compounded when you are using a controller. Sure, you can say ""Just don't use a controller."" but if the above issues were fixed it wouldn't be a problem. At best the controls in-game finicky and annoying. Story telling. It was either text dumps or cutscences, absolutely no atmospheric story telling. Okay okay, it isn't much reading, but the problem is you can ignore 95% of it with no problem until you run into a bad puzzle. This leads me into... The game is either too upfront or not helpful in the least. The story is in the first camp, but the puzzles are in the latter. One puzzle is literally this: stare at the floor, walk into a statue, and then stare at this statue without moving for like 5 seconds. That is an awful puzzle, and I only would have known if I had read the text logs, which was unnecessary until that point. Platforming. Not 100% awful, but overly difficult due to being in first person and just not necessary. The puzzles. This should have been pretty much the only element of the game, but it isn't. Had the developers spent more time on the puzzles and less time on everything else (except the speaking mechanic of course) then I this game would be such an easy sell. I am not big into puzzle games, not at all, but in my 80 minutes of playing the game (which appears to be about 1/4th of the game or less based on achievements) almost all the puzzles were either reflecting a lazer or using a spell on the contextual green spot, if they weren't simply unsolvable without googling the issue. There was one puzzle that involved using boxes to hold a door up that I liked, every other puzzle sucked.All of these negatives culminated on one puzzle and I could not go on. This puzzle required super precise controls and two second timing, where if I failed I died because my health was pretty much zero, and what was my reward? A completely new and entirely obtuse enemy murdered me. I am legitimately not sure if I could even damage this guy, but if I could it would have required super accurate aiming on my part anyways. I had no old saves to load to because making new ones required me bending over to use my keyboard, and reloading my only save left me with almost zero health and no other way to proceed but that awful timing puzzle. I had no other option but to quit.What should have been changed: The health bar should have been thrown away. The enemies needed to be fundamentally different. They could have added to the a lot to the atmosphere, made the world feel alive. If all of the enemies were like the bat enemies, where they don't directly attack, but you can interact (i.e. kill) with them things would be much better. At least let me scare off the bug swarms with the flashlight instead of having to ineffectively laser beam away individuals who are only one part of massive groups. It feels like the enemies are from Metroid: Prime and it does not work. Remove any puzzle that requires precise timing or aiming. Unfortunately, that was basically every puzzle I faced so the dev team would need to do a serious rehaul. Make changes to the graphics options apply without a restart. Also give me an option to get rid of flashing lights if there isn't already one. Make the story less ambiguous and get rid of most of the cutscenes, or add more atmospheric story telling.I think the dev team lost focus of what they wanted to make. The game should have been either about puzzles or killing monsters, probably the former to be honest, but the way they mashed those two goals together doesn't work. In Verbis Virtus really is not that far away from a pretty good game, but the designers at Indomitus Games seem to lack discipline in their work. Actually, that probably isn't fair, maybe the publisher meddled too much or maybe the team had bigger ambitions and it fell flat; but in all honesty I'd rather see the spell selection mechanic sold to a bigger developer who could handle it better. I don't think In Verbis Virtus is worth your money. Maybe if you really want to check out the voice mechanic take a look, but don't spend more than five bucks.			"

Early Access Review
								I wan't sure how to review this game based on my mixed experiences but I ultimatly asked myself - Did I enjoy this game? Am I happy having payed what I did for it? Am I looking forward to more?Yes to all the above.The first part of the game frustrated me. A lot. The level design leaves something to be desired. I spent a good deal of time at puzzles wondering ""Am I not noticing something, or do I not have the proper spells to solve this problem yet?"" On one hand it certainly helps immerse you in the role and really feel like you're exploring something strange and enigmatic; however, if you are frustrated easily this may turn you away early from what is otherwise a very enjoyable experience. I would like to see just a *little* something to help players know they are on the right track or properly equiped for the current puzzle. The second part of the game is a bit less linear and makes the game for me. I wanted to hate the game so much for the frustration I experienced early on but the setting and exileration of learning new spells just kept me hooked - I couldn't hate it. I was reminded of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and there is something almost Lovecraftian about the game. The graphics are beautiful, and the setting I could go on and on about. Suffice to say visually and thematically the setting is lovingly crafted. I don't think the verbal spell casting is not at it's full potential at this point in the game. On one hand it's very immerseive having to speak another language to cast, but, on the other hand, I don't feel there's enough about it yet to make me say that this game couldn't be the same WITHOUT verbal casting. I would like to see more depth added to the mechanics - such as further contol over spells using voice commands rather than using your voice JUST to cast.If I come across as overly critical it's simply because I see a gem in In Verbis Virtus and I really want to see it polished so it can shine as much as I think it can.Bottom line: I'm very pleased with In Verbis Virtus and I eagerly await everything the devs have in store for us. I think if you have a love for dark settings and puzzles your money will be well spent here. "

								A dream come true.At least for me. You can cast spells by actually use sing your voice! When I bought it I was first bit sceptical if voice thingy would actually function. And even in Early-access it works really good! It recognize your voice and the words you're trying to speak very well. Of course you'll need a  microphone for this.. I have a pretty cheap one and it still works wonders.  The game so far mostly contains puzzles so far with some pretty easy enemies. I haven't gotten that far yet and the looks from trailer show me there some awesome enemies coming ahead.  Even though I haven't played it that much yet..I am having a real blast so far.  Oh but I would recommoned to use the English language for casting spells first, the other language is sometimes quite hard to pronounce probadly.  Oh did I mention that the game looks stunning? because it does. I would recommend this game for anyone who is looking for unigue game with a voice-systyem that actually works. The game makes me really feel like a wizard.			"

								Jesus christ!First off let me just say i am a whimp when i comes to horror. I simply get scared far too easily. I did not realise when i purchased this game that it would be like this. I am terrified right now. HOw can a game that looks really pretty and be about magic be so bloody creepy.Putting my fears behind let me review this game after only about 3 hours in. This game is brilliant! Saying the spells makes you feel like a total badass. Yes all i am able to do so far is light up the darkness and move some stuff but because i opted for the spells in to be in the games made up language you feel like a real wizard. If you like to try new concepts out then definatley give this a go. If you like wizardly things then give this a go. If you are easily scared like myself you may want to give this a miss.			"

												This is one of those games that fall into the category of being uniquely special. The scenery is so stunningly beautiful that I've caught myself standing in one spot for minutes at a time just to watch the twinkles. The graphics can get a bit laggy in certain areas, but it goes away quickly. The sound ambiance is magical and creepy at the same time, made me feel like I was being followed or something was about to murder me.The Maha'ki language failed to be recognised for me, even after pronouncing it the same as it was spoken to me. I sadly had to swap to English (which worked instantly) when I collected my first spell or I wouldn't of been able to advance in the game. It's a shame, I would of loved to gone through the game speaking the language of the creative deities.Some of the puzzles can be really frustrating, especially when there are no tips. More then likely you will have to look up what to do, which kind of sucks for those who like to do everything without help. But when you are stuck on one puzzle for an hour I think enough is enough lol.I would love to see more games like this on Steam. I am so glad this game came across the Steam store page or I would have never found it.			"

												Do I recommend buying In Verbis Virtus?If you like a) pretty things, b) puzzle platformers, c) very fun, innovative and actually working gameplay mechanics, and if you either aren't prone to ragequitting or don't mind doing it too much - yes, I absolutely do recommend you buy this thing.But you might want to wait until the next sale if the game is not completely up your alley, like I did - just read on to find out if it is worth the full price to you.Technical StuffsThe game runs on my Dell Inspiron 15R laptop on high settings - the thing has a Radeon 7730m graphics card - without any problems - I very rarely get some framerate drops and the laptop runs somewhat hotter than usual, but as I wasn't quite sure if I could run the game at all, I was very surprised. I had one crash to desktop, which was most likely my fault, since I forgot to close my browser and its absurd amount of tabs before starting the game. There was one bug, which others also experienced, going by the forums on here - at one point, looking down triggers something, which doesn't work reliably. Trying again seems to work, usually. VisualsOH MAN this game is absolutely visually stunning. The entire environment, every little bit of it, is hugely detailed. The lighting is also absolutely beautiful and atmospheric. Some parts almost reminded me of the chapel scene from Bioshock Infinite, except WAY more detailed. Unfortunately, it can become kind of straining to look at it for a long period of time, with the generally dark-ish surroundings and patterns and intricate details everywhere.Luckily, I usually ragequitted way before that happened, because I actually really hate puzzle games.The fact that I'm recommending it regardless probably says a lot about the quality of this game.GameplaySo, as you might know by now, the Gimmicky Gameplay Feature is casting your spells by saying them out loud and hoping that nobody entered your room without you noticing, lest you'd feel a bit silly.The voice recognition works surprisingly well - it's not 100% perfect, but you don't have to pronounce everything super precisely either.In fact, I happen to be German, but I always play my video games in English - this one's no different. That means I have to speak a Latin-esque conlang with a badly-faked american accent (in an originally Italian game, no less), which the game handles superbly well, too. The voice casting doesn't just work very well, it becomes natural after a while. This should absolutely be a thing in most magic-using video games - it's actually easier than having to switch spells via hotkeys or a menu.One big problem is having to remember the names of the spells (there's an option to switch from using the in-game language to normal English, which would probably be easier to remember, but where's the fun in that), which can be pretty difficult, especially in dangerous situations. You can easily look them up with one key press, but that's not a perfect solution either. I recomment sticky notes, to be honest. Or, you know, a reasonably good memory for vocabs. Otherwise you'll probably end up with a very impressive f-word-to-spells-ratio. I know I did.On a slightly less positive note, the normal WASD-controls seem somewhat sluggish and imprecise - I normally wouldn't mind, but the game definitely has too many bottomless pits for that kind of thing.My biggest problem, however, were the puzzles.Now, I absolutely suck at puzzle games, I readily admit that. If I had to beat a puzzle platformer to save my life, I'd probably start saving up for a tombstone.I didn't get the feeling that the puzzles were all that evil - challenging, yes, but I probably, maybe, might have been able to figure them out on my own eventually. If not for the fact that you constantly have to use random items to solve the puzzles, which are usually hidden in some way, or just really hard to notice.Did I mention the super-intricate graphics? Yes? Now imagine finding one specific piece of clutter in that, especially if you're not even sure what you're looking for.I don't know if this is a general problem or if I'm just bad at this game, but to me it was hugely frustrating either way.Another odd gameplay element is health regen.You have a health bar. If it's empty, you're dead. You know the deal. That's a bit odd for a puzzle game, but since there are combat elements... sure, why not.Except that there's no auto regen, and there's usually a pretty big distance between savepoints (yes, there's savepoints /sigh).You mileage may vary on that one, but I hate the lack of auto regen and I really hate savepoints.ConclusionI like it, it's a very well-made game - definitely one of the better indie games on Steam and, as far as 3D games go, most likely one of the best.I don't always agree with the devs' design choices, but it's still very enjoyable. Not a game I play regularly or for long periods of time, but I keep coming back to it, and I never regret doing so, despite my dislike for the genre as such.I can't really tell you whether you are going to like the game or not, but I'd honestly recommend picking it up if you can afford it. If nothing else, the visuals are certainly worth it.I'd also recommend you take the time to enjoy your journey - read all the journal entries, enjoy the scenery and don't rush it.			"

												The spell casting is actually very engaging but the level design and puzzles are so abysmal I can barely even articulate the extent of it.Real example for the choosy buyer:In one instance you have to activate a panel to open a door, laser a crystal to spin a platform, then do a running jump into lava and teleport at the last minute get through the door, all on a five second timer. The jump requires so much precision it's hard to tell that you're even supposed to be doing that in the first place (and then you'll look it up and, yes, that is the solution). All of that uses multiple voice commands which actually feels pretty slick, but in practice pushes the limits in terms of the precision being demanded. Then when you miss the jump, you take damage. If you finally make the jump, you have to fight a room full of enemies with 10% of your health left (they have horrible AI, but there's like 4 of them) and your fireball spell does almost no damage. And if you die, you have to do the stupid platforming again.And that's just one example, the whole game is like this. You take an unintuitive 'puzzle' that punishes you for trying to solve it (there's a reason Portal and Talos Principle don't have fall damage), then follow it up with a combat or platforming sequence that's needlessly difficult because you have no health left. What makes this even more horrible is that there's a healing spell that is overpowered but it only works in water; so every time you'd want to use it you can't, but whenever there's water around you're literally immortal because it just channels forever keeping you at max health. This means you'll incrementally be whittled down by the aforementioned stupid hazards then one shotted by a brain dead enemy or a 10ft drop, but when the first actual boss battle happens you literally cannot die because the arena floor is water.As good as the visuals and voice recognition are, they're just wasted potential tacked onto hot garbage.Get it when it's on extreme sale (like >70% off) if you're very curious, otherwise save your money.

												TL:DR: Buy this game. Beautiful level design, tough puzzles, fun spells, and fascinating world.Felt a little odd at first, wasn't sure if it was just going to be a novelty thing or actually a cool game mechanic. Then I started to realize that I was having a load of fun and pushing myself to remember each spell so that I could recall it automatically should the need arise, and it definitely does. The combat is a little different, but I think they did a good job given the way you have to fight. It can be tough to keep yourself from speaking too fast for the spell to activate when you are being threatened. I feel it was fairly forgiving because sometimes I'd be running away from something trying to rip my face off and say ""Nomet Abul"" or some variation instead of the Namet Atul teleport and it would still give it to me. Only one that I consistently had trouble with was the fire spell Atul Aghni. But then again I played through the whole game without ever knowing that I could have made a voice profile that would have captured by pronunciation better than the default.Some people might think this is a gimmick game, but I think it is actually a step in the right direction for an adventure/puzzle game. Lots of potential for more spells, puzzles, combat scenarios, level design, you name it. The only negative thing I could say about this game was that I felt it was too short, as it left me wanting more. But that is just a byproduct of a good game.			"

												Welcome to your first Wizard Simulator!In Verbis Virtus, an amazing game, where with the aid of a microphone, you cast spells with your voice! Using the spells to solve puzzles, explore, and survive the perils of the temple. The game has amazing design, every detail of every room and puzzle looks abolutely beautiful!Casting spells with your voice works near flawlessly most of the time. I say most of the time, because depending on the quality of your microphone, you may run into some issues getting the desired results. I have a rather decent Turtle Beach Gaming headset, and some spells still give me trouble.The lore of the game, is scattered about the temple, finding tablets will give you some interesting stories.You have the option of speaking your spells in ""Maha'ki"" the language of the gods, or in English, the language of normal people.As this is more of a puzzle game, don't expect to use spells for combat too often. You will occaisonally be given a monster to dispatch with your spells, but most of the time, it's just puzzle solving, and for good reason.There ARE boss fights,3, to major bosses, and 1 mini-boss, but since most of your spells aren't meant for combat, it becomes increasingly hard to defeat the more deadly foes. Simply put, combat isn't the focus of the game, so it's not a strong point. It took me so long to defeat the first boss, and now that I have, I dread fighting the others, and it's for that very reason.The music is great, and epic, and personally, i think it really fits the atmosphere.And lastly, I mentioned puzzles, Well, the puzzles are great! They're so simple, yet still require some effort and thinking in order to solve them. Most of the puzzles involve directing a beam of light through a colored gem to activate a mechanism, but this puzzle type gets more creative with each new spell.There's a few unique puzzels, such as one where you need to distrubute water flow in a certain way.There's even a monster that you fight that could be considered a puzzle, as you need to listen to it's voice, and cast the right spells to counter his own.So, now it's time to list plainly, the pros and consPros-Voice recognition works pretty well-It looks beautiful, in both design and graphics-Puzzles are simple, but still challenging-10 spells, each with their own unique usesCons-Combat is not a strong point, so it might become frustrating when forced to fight-If your mic isn't amazing, you will encounter some problems casting spells.-It's short, with only 3 chapters.-I don't see much replayability after the first playthroughAll in all, I think the devs did a wonderful job with this idea, and, despite its flaws, I actually do think it was executed quite well.If you're looking for an interesting new game, with gameplay, and a unique concept, I can fully reccomend this to you, with a solid 9/10.Just be sure you invest in a microphone, or else you can not play it.Hope you enjoy the review, and I hope it helps you make your decision			"

												This Game can be frustraiting at times but it is fun.I will start off with the cons just to get them out of the way:the voice commands don't always register if you speak them too quickly.some of the puzzles are frustraiting to solve and with some will take a couple of reloads to do.now to the pros:it will always tell you how to pronounce the spells.it is filled with lore (if you like to find it).you can switch the spells to english.you play by speaking the spells aloud!I will end with a snipet of my experience:I was having trouble remembering some of the spells in the heat of the moment so I switched the spells to english and it was working fine, then I saw an enemy. thinking quickly I flung fire runes at him in quick sucsession, and then proceded to back away as he noticed me, he got closer and closer, so I stoped pilling on the fire runes and said the spell to ignite them: UNLEASH THE FLAMES, nothing happened, UNLEASH THE FLAMES, still nothing happened I started panicking as he got too close and swiped at me, UNLEASH THE FLAMES, UNLEASH THE FLAMES, UNLEASH THE FLAMES, still the runes did not ignite, so out of desperation after my health got to almost 0 I yelled into the mike: UNLEASH THE ♥♥♥♥ING FLAMES, and it finally worked. so the lesson is swear in frustration earlier, it might save your life.

 Terrible voice recognition for women Beautiful game, splendid idea, great imaginative spells. If you are a man go for it! But if you are a woman stay away. It's driving me crazy with it's voice recognition that can't pick up my voice. When I gave my headset to male friend sitting next to me everything went well for him. But for me? Nope. Even the so called personal voice pick up didn't work. I can say the same spell 15 times and it picks it up maybe 2 times and one time does some other spell.Imagine facing an opponent and trying to cast a spell....Nerve wrecking if it does not pick up your voice well.

								It's still a work in progress and I'm already in love with it.The voice recognition is great, but it can take a little time for you to learn the correct pronunciation. It's like learning to talk all over again, but this time to talk in the language of the Gods.The graphics are awesome, very vibrant, and the game runs smoothly. I had no problem running around and didn't encounter any glitches so far, though there are problems with the colision in some plataforms.It has the problems all early access games have. It once gave me a BSOD; that or maybe me trying too hard to cast a light spell ended up casting Crash to Desktop instead...			"

												Played the very first alpha and was amased even back then. Didn't want to play the latter versions to keep all the fun unspoiled for the final release. I was really afraid that devs will mess it up like the most of other Early Access developers do, but now I'm kinda ashamed of myself for that. The game became only better: the lore is amazing, the graphics are astonishing, the idea of having a fictional language for casting spells is great (since it was a bit awkward to cast with English phrases). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with what this game turned out to be. Keep up the good work, Indomitus.			"

												First off, the voice recognition is amazing. However this is purely the opinion of a Dutch guy, so I don't know how well it works with other accents.Secondly, if you were hoping for a puzzler that'll take you by your hand you're out of luck. This game will give you tools and a problem, it's up to you to find out how to solve it through trial and error. Some may find this frustrating, I loved it. It's been too long since we've had a tough puzzler. Buy it, now. Good luck pilgrim.			"

												This game brings you a unique experience with gorgeous graphics.I'm a guy who likes to try new stuff so I jumped into this game when I found it's using mic to cast spells. I loved the Harry Potter series so I wanted to experience this for myself and guess what; It actually works!When I say ""Echto Lume"" I shoot a beam of light from my hand and when I say ""Obee Kenu"" I stun my enemy and throw him away from me. Its great that everything works so good. I have rare occasions when I wanted to cast a spell and another spell gets cast instead, mostly it's my fault not spelling it right. Consider this a challenge that you should learn the correct way of pronouncing your spells. This is how it should be so don't complain about it not picking up your accent. The puzzles in this game are challenging. I don't know if I like it or not but I have to say this. I hate it when the game puts me in a puzzle that I'm not yet capable of solving because I lack a certain spell.This game has so many flaws in how it guids you through the map but I'll excuse it because they've done a great job in everything else especially the gorgeous graphics and the level design Kudos to the developers for making such a beautiful game. I would love to see more  games like this.Edited: for spelling.			"

												I desperately want to like this game. I was completely unsure about it until I spoke the first spell and it worked flawlessly. Instant smile and I fell in love. I'm a huge RPG fan and the spoken spells fits into my likes like a puzzle piece. Then I discovered that so far this game is nothing but a jumping puzzle. And  an extremely un-intuitive one at that, and now I'm scared to put in more than 2 hours trying to figure out where to jump so I can still return it if it turns out that the beginning sucks. The whole part where you lose 15% of your health on every checkpoint reload is a total gut-punch for a filthy casual like me. I don't want to get super crazy good at perfectly timing my jumps just so I can have a chance at the game, I just want to play.I am really torn because I want more games like this one, but I don't really want this game.

												I really want to give that game a thumbs up... but I can't. I simply can't do that.In fact the game is amazing. It is quite unique. The story is mysterious and engaging - but it is only readable and you will miss a journal-update very quickly. The graphics and textures are nice. Personally I love the lighting effects and the reflections on the floors. And of course - the architecture.But... the game doesn't understand me. The fireball spell you need in fights most, works only the third or fourth time I try to hit the enemy. The time you lose that way is deadly if you fight two or three foes at once.  Like others reviewed: The enemies are ridicilous hard, you have no option to make it easier and I lost the interest in fighting after the first encounters completly.The command spell is the second spell that doesn't work for me. There are a lot of puzzles, where you have to be quick. And then I sit before that rune and try endless times to activate that thing.Every spell activates, but not the one I want. I tried to configure my microphone - ingame and in WIndows. With no positive result. I think, the game has problems with higher frequencies than a normal male voice. Yes - I'm a female and I have to sound incredibly bored or the game slaps me in the face, teleporting me around or shooting light beams in every way possible.The puzzles... I don't know. I think they're too hard. I'm no genius at solving difficult puzzles, but finding the right room for the next challenge is hard enough. In the first level, you have a very useful map. In the second you have a less useful map. In the third you have no clue where you are and where to go.Another thing that bothers me is the saving point location. Sometime they're incredibly far away from one another and I had to find out that not every puzzle progress is saved - so I lost 2,5h moving mirrors and I have to do it again. Yeah!You may give it a try. But have in mind, that the casting problem won't pop up until you have more than four or five spells. Till then you will have more than 2h playtime.I will play the game till the end. But only once. Then I will deinstall it and move on. It's too frustrating for another playthrough.Another point I have to say is, that I got a bug in the third level, which blocked my progress.I tried to activate a door with a light beam, through some coloured crystals -> The door didn't open. The solution for this was to start the game in the Save Mode through the Steam library. After the activation I saved and started the game normally and everything was fine.			"

												What a damn wonderful game this is! Sadly, my microphone just broke (waiting on a new one).I can highly recommend this game, despite perhaps a few flaws. The language is not easy, but that's part of the challenge personally.. For those truelly struggling, or for those with difficulty of learning new languages in general, the spells can be cast in English instead.Additionally, I see a lot of people complaining about the puzzles being too complicated, and the game not showing you the path... I think the majority of players seem to have forgotten the definition of PUZZLE!! Yes, this game requires some thought at time, but you wouldn't be a magician if you weren't able to see past the most basic principles now, would you?... Try thinking laterally from time to time, this will truelly help you in this game!And, should you just get 'bored' or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off' with a puzzle, try using google.. I don't like to cheat, but, if you enjoy the gameplay but not the puzzles so much, then there's always a way ;)The gameplay itself, casting the spells, personally is empowering! There are a few games I've played were I actually feel mighty using the power I can posses in game, and this is definitely one of them!! Essentially acting as the character in reality makes for one truelly connecting gameplay.Also for those rare wizarding LARPers out there, this game can actually help prepare you for any LARP magic duels you might do. I don't do this, but my friend does and actually said this game helped her a lot! Completely random benefit of the game, but there you have it ^.^There appear to be a few random bugs here and there, but personally they're rare and seldom affect gameplay. I think the gameplay itself in general surpasses the bugs and so playing the game well makes up for any crashes you may get (I have never had a crash myself, just little 'wall' glitches and such.Definitely recommended from myself, 8/10! If you''re wanting a pure puzzle based game that will test your will as a human, then go play Antichamber - Also highly recommended.			"

												If a game gets the important things right then I can forgive alot in terms of design and execution, and In Verbis Virtus leaves me overflowing with magnanimity toward it in spite of its obvious (and not so obvious) flaws. The atmosphere and tone of the game had me forgetting that I was wandering through an--at times--poorly designed maze because the sights that maze had to show me expertly sold the premise of the game: that this was a place where pilgrims underwent a rite of passage. Confusion, disorientation, exhaustion. . . these things are par for the course when it comes to religious experiences, and I can accept that as justification for all the backtracking I've done thus far. The resemblance of the temple's facade to the famous treasury building of the city of Petra was another wonderful touch, and the piecemeal revealing of our not-so-silent protagonist's backstory had me willing to suspend my disbelief from quite a height, even though I ocassionally had to check the internet for hints.If you're thinking about buying this game for its unique selling point I can only say that if In Verbis Virtus has managed to pique your interest you will find your curiosity aptly satisfied time and again. Being able to directly communicate with the game world adds a unique layer of immersion to the story, and one which is not only easy to get to grips with, but well paced and thought out. Sure, being able to call down fire on your enemies is one thing, but being able to *literally* do it is another thing entirely. Yes it's a gimmick, but as a gimmick it is well executed and it showcases what more games can, should, and will be making use of in the future. One thing I would recommend is taking the time to generate a voice profile before you start playing. I haven't had an issue being understood, but I didn't bother with the defaults either.All in all: In Verbis Virtus is one of those games that I can see myself playing over and over again simply because it really puts me right in the middle of the action. It is not perfect by any means, but what it doesn't do perfectly it still manages competently, and what it does differently it does exceptionally well.			"

												This has to be one of the most unique games I have played in a very long time. Not only are the different areas that you go to interesting and wonderous, the puzzles are well done, and the voice-controlled spells are very well executed. The fact that the spells are all cast by speaking them yourself has the potential for disaster, but the dev team behind this game really made the detection for the spoken words quite professionally, and as long as you speak clearly, it never has trouble determining what you are saying. On a huge plus side for me, the fact that I was actually speaking the spells made it that much more immersive to play, and it also makes you feel like a real wizard - That is, if you panic and fail to speak clearly as a result, or blank on a word or pronouciation, you have real concequences.All in all, it was a very intense and amazingly crafted game, it is certainly worth looking into if any of this appeals to you. I had a damn blast playing this, as well as goofing off at times and figuring out what other silly words I could shout to have a reaction ingame.			"

TL;DR:This game has great atmosphere with an immersive spellcasting system and nonlinear level design that also at times has really clever and hard to figure out puzzles!Pros:Fun and a really Great way of doing spellcasting that makes the game so much immersive!Also if for some reason you're having trouble casing some of the spells, make your own voice recognition model (it's a feature implemented in the game, just go into the options menu).This actually, for me at least, nullifies the 'con' I'd otherwise have since I found it a bit tricky to cast the 'mark of fire' spell.Artwork, effects and overall leveldesign and graphics are not only great but Truly Awesome!Music is also great, although for my taste, a little loud at first. But luckily, there's a bar in the options to tone it down a bit so you can hear the other sounds better.Puzzles are quite hard to figure out sometimes. You really have to make use of the tiny grey cells you have up there.It aint that clear what you have to do or where to go and you can sertainly miss important things if you just try to force your way trough!Even the clues to what you're supposed to do are easy to miss sometimes ;)This might be a good game if you want to level up on your personal map making skills ( although not required since there are a few maps spread out, but it is encuraged ).Neat Credits! They were actually the first thing I watched, and I was impressed!Acievements are verry acievable. Most come naturally as you progress but there are a few you really have to work for.Like the 'Tomb Raider'... damn if I hadn't missed that obvious 'Call from Chaos' document at the entrance of the fiery room on chapter two...Cons:Some spells can be tricky to cast... Oh, you could make your own voice recognition model... that fixes things!Combat. Well, let's just start off by saying: I kinda like it, but it has it's flaws...Even though it's not a huge part of the game, but this is actually also the only real downside I can actually find with this game.The AI ain't all that bright. It's quite all right, it doesn't have to be much smarter than it is, but on some occations it feels as it could improve just a bit.I didn't enjoy all the 'safe spots' where monsters can't follow you for no apparent reason. They jus stand there at an invisible wall untill you pass trough it again... or till you safely pick them off one by one.Multiple 'Mark of Fire' should really be able to charge up to full potitential at the same time.So This is not that big of a deal, but I found that lightsources may seem like they're pointing in the wrong direction (at least the first one when you enter the temple), but only when: You stand in a patch where light shines and look at the source from where it's coming from. It sems like it's shining in another direction and you wonder what might be over there... you start walking towards it but when you get out of the lightpatch you were standing in, it dissapears and only shines at the patch you just were standing in....also a few shadows in some tight spots might seem a little out of place or twitchy when using 'Lume Tial'.Also not a real biggie, but I wish it had VR support... That would have been AWESOME!Connclusion:Would I reccomend this game:Yes!...At full price?...then the answer would still definatley be; Yes!Ok, it has some downsides...Well, the only real one I found was actually the combat.So what about it?Sure combat ain't such a big part of the game... and sure it's fun to 'Athul Aghni' a whole bunch of Saevars, wait till the runes reaches full potential and then say the magic words and watch as they perish in a beautiful display of fireworks!...but that can be a real pain to pull of...On the other hand, even though it can be rather fun laughihg situation every time you find yourself shouting the wrong spell at stressfull times (not just in combat) and also feel really rewardning when you make it work.So... even though the combat is it's only real downside. I still kinda like it, but it feels it could use a bit fine-tuning.But all in all I think I'd probably sumarice it something like this:This game has great atmosphere with an immersive spellcasting system and nonlinear level design that also at times has really clever and hard to figure out puzzles!

								Very cool idea for a game. I love the language that has been created for this game. Using your voice to control the game adds a layer of depth to the game that can't be achieved otherwise. It will suck you in.			"

												It has everything you need for becoming a wizard!You learn spells and how to say them, you get better the more you use them, you have puzzles and a stunning environment as well.Funny when you are first learning the spells and keep making a small mis-pronunciation of some sort and it won't work at times. I recomment this game to anyone interested in magic and fantasy, those who love a challenge, those who love puzzles and the atmosphere in a game and anyone who likes the look of it!10/10 Wizard of the year.

Visuals: Aesthetically this game is absolutely beautiful, you can turn almost every step into a wallpaper.  The developers used a real mix of texture, colour and light to create a very convincing world that oozes a history you don't know.  In particular the use of light and dark is very effective.  Many of the elements used are very familiar to those who have experience with fantasy and sci-fi genres but still feel very foreign and alienating.  Obstacles and enemies are visually striking but they also look like they fit into the environment.Sounds: The sound design in this game is very simple but very effective.  The developer knows that silence is sometimes the best option and they use it very well.  There isn't much music but what is there is well composed and adds to the experience.  It's the ambient noise that really stands out.  There are times when you'll hear nothing but your own footsteps echoing off the stones walls, or water in the distance, or another sound that can't be identified.  There are some enemies that make noise, which you'll learn through play.  The most important sound you'll hear of course is your own voice, which you will be using frequently.  Gameplay: The controls in this game are very simple and standard, they'll come naturally to anyone with FPS experience.  The part you're most likely to get tangled up in is remembering the voice commands.  The developers took a lot of care in creating a language that shouldn't be too difficult for anyone to pronounce, and none of them are long incantations, but it will be a foreign language that you'll have to learn through practice.  The game doesn't pile these spells on all at once though, so if you don't wait months between sessions you shouldn't have too much trouble with the learning curve.  Spells are staggered out and introduced in tangible, practical ways that give you a full understanding of the use before you move on to the next concept.  Having given this aspect of the game some very thorough testing I can say that the system can't be tricked, you can't just throw sounds at the wall and have them stick.  However that does not mean it's tedious to cast the spells, the game is very good at picking up what you're saying and responding instantly.  Conclusion/TL;DR:If you have a mic and want to be an actual wizard this is the game for you.  An in-depth and beautiful world, haunting sound design and simple, tight controls have all been well thought out and built to compliment some largely unexplored vocal mechanics that just work.  Everything just works. "

												Okay I have to admit what drew me first into this game was the in game feature where you could use your mic to activate spells/actions.   Thought it would be great for my YT channel especially as I like to hear myself talk.  I thought this would be a quick one video having phone with the voice activation then moving on....boy was I wrong!While the voice activation is a very fun feature of this game (especially when you can't remember a spell and are yelling out funny sounds) as you venture further other features will get you hooked.   I'll give you a quick rundown-Graphics-  These guys have truly mastered the Unreal Engine as the lighting, textures, etc. are just stunning.Environment-  As you get farther into the game you really start to enter environments/areas that are truly amazing.  I was so impressed by some of the areas I just stood there for a couple of minutes and took in all the detail..while looking over my shoulder of course!  The areas are not your usual blood and gore they are done in a very artistic yet creepy way that seems to even get better the longer you play.   Again using some original design coupled with the lighting, textures, etc. this games environments are truly amazing (even if they are not outside).Sound-  Sounds are really good and there is a good balance between the music and ambient sounds.  I think the sounds could even be improved upon by adding a little more ambient sounds to add to the tension as you explore.  But a great start!Game mechanics-  No issues here movement is solid and the voice activation is spot on.I have some videos on my YouTube channel if you want to see the game maxed out and in 1080- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtEMFPsqo5Fq9X_CD1JKI1ALatest video showing some of the amazing areas-

												I'm a bit torn apart...First off I'll go with what i DIDN'T like. I saw the trailers and thought; DAMN, old crypt in the desert, cast spells with your voice... awesome! While it definitly is awesome to do so and the spell casting via microphone works extremely well I feel a bit misleaded...There are almost NO fights at all. And if there are fights they're more or less the same enemies or won by doing the same procederes. WHY? I ask? WHY??? Fighting using my voice was SO FUN!!! It really pushes you to remember the spells while trying to dodge, the fights felt so good... However 95% of the game were puzzles... It might be me but I just don't like videogame puzzles... I like board games, small mobile puzzle games but in a 3d game playing a mighty sorcerer in a super atmospheric underground temple? connecting hundreds of light rays via crystals? It might be so that I found them too hard. Some puzzles almost made me angry with their difficulty... Also in my area if you google ""in verbis virtus ..."" what follows is ""walkthrough"". Whatsoever I'll recommend the game, because I imagine if you like the concept AND you like videogame puzzles you'd buy it. If you were looking for an immersive story with twists, difficult fights etc... look elsewhere.			"

												To sum it up: brilliant ideas buried by poor design decisions.Instead of making this game action-oriented, with awesome spells that can turn legions of enemies to cinder, the devs produced a very slow-paced walking simulator where once in a while you get to cast something to light a path or open a door. Most of the time you're just wandering through endless corridors, hoping to find some hidden inscription or button you've missed, because the puzzles are unsolvable without it. Combat - as little of it as there is - is incredibly clunky and redundant. The only thing that keeps you going are the new spells you get from time to time. But then you get slowed down even more by things like corridors that drain your health. And to save the game you've got to find a checkpoint, so after another 30 minutes-long stroll you can easily lose all your progress by taking a wrong turn and dying randomly.Overall, while the spell mechanic actually works and feels great, the game does not capitalize on that at all.

												The voice system works beautifully and almost justifies a recommendation. Unfortunately the rest of the game is limp. It has platform, puzzle and adventure elements but none of them amounts to much. The graphics are ok but not as atmospheric as state of the art. The story didn't grip me.  It feels like they called up a student of creative writing and said, ""spin us some bulls*** about an ET world with spells"".The biggest disappointment is the spells. The way you use them isn't very interesting. I think the idea would have worked much better in an RPG game.  Sorry, overall I can't recommend it.			"

												PROS:*Voice recognition works most of the time*Good spell variety*Beautiful environments*Good atmosphere*Appropriate music and mostly appropriate sounds*Lore is interesting for the most partCONS:*Too many puzzles where even the objective is unclear and where necessary items are hidden away*Voice recognition still sometimes fails, which can quickly lead to death during combat or dangerous platforming*Spell potential is untapped*Writing quality is inconsistent*Lore is conveyed entirely through easily missable ""documents""*Some parts of puzzles are reset upon loading a saveGAME LENGTH:If the player follows a guide and has good luck with voice recognition, this game could last around 10 hours.  Achievement hunters will need a bit more time to hunt down all 35 documents.  Without a guide, this game could last over 20 hours.SCORE:6 out of 10This game's best features are its voice recognition concept and implementation, visuals, and spell variety.  It is impressive to me that such a small team pulled all of this off.  Unfortunately, core design decisions regarding puzzles, combat, and direction dealt a serious blow to my enjoyment of the game.I like to know what my goal is in a puzzle game so that I can consider the tools at my disposal and develop a logical plan for how to achieve it.  I don't mind a bit of experimentation and exploration, but they are taken to extremes here.  Puzzles frequently lack clear objectives even when one is halfway through them, objects necessary to solutions are sometimes hidden away or meant for other rooms' puzzles, repeated platforming around death traps is often necessary to get perspective, it is not always clear if a player is equipped to solve a puzzle he finds yet, and the player frequently does not even always know what solving a puzzle will accomplish.One room in the last chapter of the game stands out to me (spoilers ahead):  after going through several steps to lift or move platforms and open up floor and wall panels, the player is ""rewarded"" with a mysterious ball of ice.  Like the room in which it resides, it has no obvious purpose, but as the player considers it, he realizes that it is growing smaller.  It is melting.  Now the player, with no sense whatsoever of what to do, feels rushed to do something.  It turns out that the solution here is to cast a fiery bomb spell on it, get out of the underground corridor where it was found, take it to another room, place it in one of three holes in the wall that lead to an opening in the ceiling, walk a particular path around a large room while using telekinesis on the ball in the ceiling (because the floor path matches a path in the ceiling that the player cannot see), freeze the ball in place at the end of the path, and make it explode, all before it melts to nothing.  If he fails, he has to start the process all over again.  And this is just one part of one puzzle.Even if I had the time to devote to reaching such a solution on my own, it would not be time well spent.  Worse, if I need to leave the game, parts of the puzzle (e.g. object positions) may be reset.  Thus, in the absence of a hint system, busy players may find themselves frequently starting the game up to face not just the same puzzle again, but parts that they have already solved.  It is no surprise, then, that only 5% of players reach the end of chapter 2, according to the Steam achievements.  This is a shame, as chapter 3 is the best-looking part of the game and has more spells to introduce.Players who are interested in challenging puzzles or willing to use a walkthrough may still find a reason to walk away from this game:  the combat.There is only a handful of normal enemies:  walking and flying swarms that follow a set path and die easily, wisps that follow a set path and die easily, bipeds who charge the player, and floating mages who can cast three spells.  Dealing with the first two types is no big deal, but the bipeds (Saevar) are another story.  One-on-one, they are a joke:  the player can simply cast a bomb spell on them, then stun them to give the bomb enough time to charge.  But since they can spawn in twos or threes, the player never gets any great area of effect spells, and voice recognition may fail, these creatures can actually pose a challenge sometimes.  The floating mages (Shar-Seth), in contrast, are somewhat fun to fight because the player has to listen to the words that they chant for their spells, then act accordingly.  But these are much deadlier if the voice recognition happens to fail.  This would all be fine if battles were always preceded by healing ponds and save points, but they aren't--and sometimes the battles are surprises.  Death means having to re-do whatever platforming was necessary to reach these battles in the first place.Then there are the three bosses:  the first is almost like a battle with the Shar-Seth, but requires a trick to kill it when it heals itself; the second is a two-part chase involving the ice, teleport, and telekinesis spells; and the third is a battle against clones with powerful spells.  Fortunately, the game either saves automatically at the beginning of these battles or has a save point right before them.  Unfortunately, voice recognition failures tend to result in instant death and the third boss in particular is very frustrating.Clearly, imperfect voice recognition is my biggest reason for judging the combat negatively.  But there are other annoyances.  Every spell cast requires that the player hold down LMB, speak the proper words, then release LMB.  This is obviously to let the game know when to ""listen"" for the player's voice and when he is done speaking, but since it makes actions take noticeably longer to perform, situations that require quick reflexes become all the more tense.  Additionally, if the player casts the wrong spell, he has to first cancel it before he can cast another, interfering with the flow of combat.  Two spells--the light beam and the ice beam--even look similar, so it may not be immediately apparent that the wrong spell was cast.  Finally, releasing projectiles caught by the shield spell too often sends them flying everywhere except where the player is aiming, which can make the final boss battle take much longer than it should.(NOTE:  It has come to my attention that the game offers the player the option to record his own voice for spells to improve voice recognition.  I will not be playing the entire game again to test this, so I can't say if this would have improved the speech recognition.  Regardless, the game's obtuse puzzles and awkward combat were enough to hurt my experience.)The story is all right:  the player character is simply out to bring his loved one back to life by using the magic he finds in the temple, while the god who guides him wants him to do something else.  Occasionally the journal will update with a little bit of his backstory or his feelings about what he is experiencing, but it didn't add anything to the game.  The 35 hidden documents, however, provide a good deal of lore, explaining some of the history of the temple, the gods, and the civilizations that worshiped them.  It's just a shame that so many of them are hidden (why hide the meat of the story?) and that the writing is a bit inconsistent, sometimes sounding proper and authoritative and other times sounding modern, even sloppy.I would like to give this game a higher score and a recommendation for its unique mechanic (an experience in itself), visuals, and spell variety, but the core aspects of gameplay--the puzzles and the combat--just don't work for me.  As another reviewer remarks, this game has a lot of wasted potential.  I give this game a 6 out of 10, though more hardcore puzzlers might get more enjoyment out of it.Be wary of reviewers with only a few hours played:  chapters 2 and 3 are longer and harder than 1.

												While the vocal spellcasting is a very interesting concept in theory, in practice it means you have to spend time memorizing a bunch of gibberish, or frequently interrupt gameplay to crack into your journal to play the game effectively. To add to the problem, the map layout and puzzles aren't very intuitive.Overall, it's a unique idea that's executed poorly. If you've got a tenner to blow during a sale and don't mind paying for a game that's 'interesting, but not very good', go for it. Otherwise, pass this one up.			"

												Great concept and a beautiful game. Actually having to say your spells instead of just pressing hotkeys X and Y is a really fun way of playing a mage. The biggest downside seems to be that the voice recognition gets wonky on a few occasions (not too many to be bothersome though): casting a beam of light when you actually said the telekinesis spell is not exactly what I expected.Also, my girlfriend now thinks I've gone completely crazy.

												I write 'yes' as recommendation, but with some reservations... Notice: A microphone is required to play this game. Also, nerves of friggin’ steel.Welcome to a land of magic. You are a wizard in search for a strong, ancient power for reasons I will not spoil; but to get to it, you will have to explore the temple, solve its puzzles, and battle unspeakable evil! That last part is more annoying than exciting, by the way.In Verbis Virtus is, in essence, a fantasy RPG halfway between puzzle and action. Do not that you are required to own and use a microphone in order to play this game, for that is the whole point of it. As a wizard, you will be doing the spell casting via voice commands. That’s right, that means the game depends on a voice recognition system. That could only bode for fun and frustration, right?But lets take it one thing at a time! Because in order to play the game, I had to be able to open the game, which in itself was a puzzle. I have no idea why, but the game alternated between crashing and freezing; probably something related to the resolution.On the upside, In Verbis Virtus has a “safe” mode that opens it in a window on super low res. On the downside, that it has a safe mode because you may need to use it to get into the game is kind of a sad state. Once I was able to start it without crashing, the game ran fairly well only getting a bit choppy when entering a new area for the first time that day.Visually, the game is quite stunning. even in low settings it didn’t look as bad as other ‘better’ games do, so there’s something to be said for that. The music was really nice too, and what voice acting there was (to show you how to pronounce the spells and in cutscenes) was… I wouldn’t say good, but it wasn’t bad either. The ambient sounds left something to be desired, however, though they weren’t too bad. The fire for some reason sounded fairly similar to the critters, and while I’m guessing the idea of keeping a semi-constant critter-like noise in the background was to keep you on edge, it became annoying as you couldn’t be sure when they were actually coming for you unless you’d been in the area before. The game mechanics are pretty nice. Controls are basic: you jump with space, move with wasd, use mouse to aim and look around, shift to run - there is no ducking, however. In order to cast the spells, you interact via voice. Just aim your mouse at something, click and call out the spell name, and release your click. The spell will be cast. To stop the spell, right click. There are checkpoints that auto-save when passing a chapter, and save points spread out through the game, not nearly close enough to what I’d normally like, but not too far apart either. I just like to save every time I accomplish something, I’m obsessive like that. Surprisingly, the voice recognition system works fairly well, and it has plenty of ways to be used. In the game options you can choose to cast the spells in English or the made-up language of the game, Maha’Ki, I went back to try them both (though my original playthrough was in Maha’Ki) and both worked pretty well. There was the occasional moment where a spell wasn’t cast, which included times such as slightly panicky, rushed casts for getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked by enemies, the infuriated “I’ve said it three times already, would you please cast it??” rushed casting, and the “I clicked after I started casting” casting. But overall the spells cast 99% of the times, and when it didn’t, it was user fault. Within the voice recognition options you also have the choice to record your own words for the spells. Now, I didn’t try this, but I can only imagine it can be great fun, and it’s a neat option to have.As for the puzzles themselves, some are easy, some are hard, some are really not overly intuitive kind of hard, but for the most they were fairly good. Until, that was, you reached a timed puzzle. Really now, why would you do that to me? Is casting and running and casting while running not hard enough that you have to put the time limit so that we barely make it? There was quite a bit of backtracking to be made from some of the puzzles to other parts of it, which would have been much less annoying without the critters roaming around, but I can overlook that since they had pretty scripted areas in which they appeared and paths they followed, so they were entirely predictable.All in all, I was pretty content with the puzzles except for the timed ones, and then I was a slightly less happy camper until that was over.I knew there’d be some fighting when I went into this game, I just didn’t expect them to be that annoying. Now, your mileage might vary, but I feel like the greatest downfall of this game is precisely that: the fighting. Ahhh… what can I say about it other than I completely hated it, and it got me stuck in each encounter I had to the point where I didn’t get to finish the entirety of the story because of it. I got completely stuck, not even because I didn’t know how to beat the bad guys, but because they were so friggin’ annoying, and casting while trying not to die while trying to time something else was just not my thing. The very first fight you encounter is not just a fight, but a bit of a timing puzzle as well, and I seriously spent way too long trying to pass it, to the point where more than once I considered quitting right there. I didn’t. I quit further ahead, but I still quit. Could this game have done well with fighting? Yes, if enemies had been defeatable via actual fighting spells, as opposed to trying to make them puzzly-difficult for the sake of making you use the several spells. Now, don’t get me wrong, while it could have been “fun” to fling an enemy across a room with my spell to stun him before putting a fire ball on his face (note: you get a fire spell, and then an explosion spell, not a fireball spell, making it even more annoying), you can’t really base the entire experience on the player’s timing skills with juggling 3 different spells in a moment of heated combat. Particularly if the enemy isn’t even a boss.I feel like maybe if casting spells hadn’t been dependant of you clicking, calling out, then releasing the button to get it to actually cast, and it would have just recognized voice commands without the need of any clicking (and unclicking) in between, it would have made things much easier and I wouldn’t have been quite so frustrated with it all.  I can see where they wanted to go with the fights in terms of creativity, I just feel like it wasn’t well handled, or just… didn’t belong in this particular game.As it was, most the fights I came across were just annoying and brought down the entire experience for me.Bug wise I didn’t come across anything very obvious, except for the problems I had getting it to start and the occasional crash which happened mostly when I started a game, usually before I even loaded a save. But there were some crashes after as well. They really added to the frustration. There’s little else to be said about In Verbis Virtus, I wish the puzzles would have been more open, giving you a chance of using various of your spells in order to complete it creatively, instead of “here is this rune or button, so this thing requires this particular spell while you stand in this particular spot.” (The fights suffered from this too; certain enemies required certain particular series of spells, except for the occasional one “easily” defeatable with fire, which still took two spells.)You don’t need mazes and hours of backtracking to make good puzzles, you just need to give the user more creative ways to solve it in a single room. I also wish there would have been a “no monsters” option, it would have made my experience much more enjoyable. I could’ve probably done with just the critters and a final boss at most.			"

												Love the unique concept, unfortunately the game failed to recognize my voice most of the time. The platforming felt out of place and imprecise. I found that the ""combat"" was extremely frustrating because it relies on quick use of your spells, and yet the game doesn't feel responsive enough.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm very ambivalent about this game.On one hand I love the idea, and it's been worked out really well, to cast spells by actually saying their power words (Verbis Virtus).The puzzle solving isn't too complicated, but this is where my amvilance comes in. The puzzles aren't too complicated, but to solve them, the developers have you run through a maze a couple dozen times to collect all the pieces. 1 piece will be over here, the 2nd piece over there, the third piece there, and carrying 1 at a time, they all need to go to location number 4, and in a certain order as well.Since it's early access, there's little story and therefore only few hints, of what you're supposed to do. This only adds to the confusion.Now, I'm still recommending this game, because it's awesome and even though it's Early Access, it has a lot going for it already. The graphics are good, the ambience is great and the casting of your spells is brilliant. Ever wanted to feel like a wizard? Well, here's your chance!			"

								Firstly, thanks a lot for giving birth to such an amazing game!I've tried both its demo and official version, which are so exciting and fantastic :)However, the engine optimization (I'm not sure whether this is the correct word) of this official version is frustrating.It is extremely fluently when I play the demo version with both qualities are HIGH, while in the official version even all LOW can drive my ultrabook go burning.Although the type of my pc is not for large independent game, I hope you consider of most players. You know we cannot all process something like a sophisticated intellegent computer.I believe that MANY PLAYERS WILL BE PLEASED IF YOU IMPROVE THIS PART.Anyway, In Verbis Virtus is a great game! And I understand this is just a beginning, which means IVV is going to be better after time. It worths a try and support.Again, thank youIndomitus. "

												Wow, such a disappointment. The speaking spell system works fine, I even imagine why other games don't use it more often, but, wow... The story  is bad, or at least the little story that it was presented for me. I finished the game without knowing clearly what my main objective was. I don't know who my character was, and I understood too little of the background story of the scenario because it was really not interesting.At the end,  I killed the same goddess that helped me throughout the jorney and I DON'T KNOW WHY.  (?!?) I read that they got corrupted over time and stuff but... Urrrgg... And not counting the fact that after defeating the goddess I got stuck in the game because I turned the fire on before activating the light, and I had to reload the game and kill the damn thing again... =\And the scenario? Wow... Everything is overwhelmingly lavish since the very beginning of your quest for no good reason. Sometime you think you are in a Temple and then you are in a H.R. Giger art galery. Thinks just don't fit...And the puzzles were super frustrating and not intuitive at all. And sometimes the game doesn't even give me a proper checkpoint when I finish one, and if by any chance I end up dying, I need to do the same thing one more time.Such a beautiful possibility, such a poor implementation.

								I love the first battle! I haven't learnt any spell that can attack the monster, only can freeze it some seconds with the 'Mind over matter' spell, and when it rushed to me and showed its scary mouth I was frightened to forget how to cast the spell! It's the first time that I have the feeling 'I'm a wizard', and the first time I feel frustrated from failing to cast a spell... After this battle I don't dream to became a wizard in some fantasy world any more.  Or maybe I should find a warrior as friend?lol.			"

												Let me start off by saying that this game is beautiful, the premise is amazing, and from what I was able to play the who thing actually pulled together very well. The mechanic of physically speaking out loud and having your virtual hand alight with magic? It's stunning. It's wonderful. I would have loved to explore more of it.All the problems that I had with this game were technical. The lag in this game was /terrible./ My system is well above the recommended requirements and it was still so choppy as to be virtually unplayable. I tried turning the resolution and graphic settings down (the game also has an impressive number of adjustable settings), I tried running it in windowed mode, and in ""safe mode,"" but none of that had any effect on the terrible frame rate. Also, the very first time I booted it up it crashed immediately after the opening cut scene.I would love to play and recommend this game because it seems like it would be so much fun. Maybe if the frame rate issue could be resolved I would give it another chance. If you have the technical know-how or feel like it's something you're willing to put up with for the chance of setting a fire with the power of your voice, go for it. But for me it's just a shame.

												This Game is AWESOMELY FUN. It's really different to normal games. It's mostly puzzles, and the combat is rare but challenging due to the need to speak your actions. This is a diffcult but strangely rewarding form of play. It is something of a puzzle game, and fairly experimental, but this is an experiment that should be rewarded. Buy this game.			"

												Nice Idea. Beautiful graphics, etc.It's worth it's money. But voice recognition sucks for me. Even with trained profile. Maybe I'm to stupid to repeat the same words more than once or it simply doesn't get it.Sucks, since I cannot continue to play after the first enemy encounter since casting a fireball is not possible.It always casts lightray as if I had said ekto lumeh but yeah.

												I give this game a solid 4 stars. The gimmic of voice activated spells never loses its charm. With every light spell to every fireball I get tingles every time. The powerful feeling of chanting out your spells just makes you as a player feel good.The visuals are superb, even on my craptastic computer I am blown away at the scenes. The big begining desert entrance, the glowing caves and mushrooms. the vast puzzle rooms. Gah so much to see.The lore and the journal entries are very well written, and provied excellent immersion into the story and getting to know just what happened in these ruins. But alas, the game is not perfect. The casting while all together glorious, can be a little hit-or-miss. Especially if you have an accent (Cajun American here) so the spells sometimes missfire. ( Somehow i ended up casting one spell instead of my intended one, and the pronunciation for both have nothing in common. )Second, with the misfire of spells, means the bad guys dont always get the knuckle sandwich you were trying to serve. And instead they feast on you. The aiming is tough to get down pat at first, being used to when you shoot, it hits immediatly after. The spells fire slowly, so you have to learn to lead and anticipate. And some of the bosses are damn fast and s♥♥♥♥♥tic in movement, so it is sometimes like a bullet hell of just repeating chants until you land a hit.The puzzles while they do have that grandeur from the visuals, arent all that complicated initially. They are really just a tad obnoxious run arounds of find the right angle for this, or find the out of the way symbol. They arent bad, but they arent brain benders. The spells, while fun to cast, are a tad one trick pony. It is always obvious from the time you get into a room which spell you are gonna be repeating the entire time. Every spell has one use, and one use only. (Save for 2 basic spells you can ""stun"" enemies instead of killing them with these) One charges this, the other opens these, the other activates this thing, and so on. There is little diversity to how the spells can be used. ***[TL;DR]***So all in all, great visual game with a real great hook for gameplay, just combat is a bit messy and wishing that the spells could be a little more creative with how you use them. But it is a really really great game, worth the money, and worth supporting these devs to taking this to the next level and exploring all possibilities. Really looking forward to a expansion or sequal to this game. Really want to see more voice recognition in games like this. Has excellent potential and this game is a great start for what can be an epic game changer.			"

 In MY opinion	 This game was amazing/frustrating. The whole uniqueness of the game making you use your voice as your own spell casting is brilliant. Although speaking your spells will get VERY repetitive. (Only 3-4 spells are only useful) There are only a handful of spells that are used a lot in order to get around the whole map. Some of the NPC's that you fight are ridiculously hard. The more freuquent enemy spawns are annoying in a group, and if you didn't save. Well looks like you have to redo it again. Sorry bud. Some of the puzzles in the game (can be super fun) are also ridiculously hard. The game gives you no hints or tip's on how to actually do them. You're just left there pondering what to do exactly. The story of this Man going trough what seems like a whole revelation, learning the Mahaki is extremely beautiful. I would love to see a seccond game of this because I enjoyed this so much. TL;DR	 A game that can get very complicated at times when fighting NPC's and voice activation. But it's brilliance and uniqueness of it's immersion in the game is inspiring. PROS	  Unique gameplay Decent graphics that can make you ""Wow"" Game makes you feel like you're actually learning a new language (Game immersion)   CONS	  Incredibly hard NPC's  Voice activation can be off at times Ridiculous puzzles that are hard and no hint's are given  "

								It is by no stretch of the imagination perfect, and has some of the downsides you have to expect from voice control (faulty recognition, wrong spells being cast, etc) and you sound like a bit of a ponce when playing while talking to others, but the game is well worth your money assuming the devs don't pull a Cube World and run off into the sunset with their piles of money, never to be heard from again.

												Bought a brand new headset just to play this game because it had an interesting premise, and what do I get? Spent close to an hour hollering 'Lumeh tial' into my mic until my voice was near hoarse, jumped from English pronunciations to latin, re-recorded my own personal pronunciations with my voice in the options menu, tried to use my laptop mic instead and it STILL would not let there be ******* light!!! If one has to jump through that many hoops to enjoy a game, then it's not a game anymore, it's strenuous work. I'm not just disappointed with the faulty voice recognition system however, I'm disappointed that I had to put in for my refund as I thought the game looked extraordinarily beautiful and the bandwidth I'll never get back. However I refuse to invest another second working for something I paid for instead of having it work for me. Going forward, will avoid voice recognition games not put forth by developers with thoroughly reputable backgrounds due to this experience. Lesson learned.			"

												I don't often write reviews for games, but this one actually deserves one. The premise of the game is incredibly unique, and the developers did an amazing job at making it feel like you're truly learning and casting spells derived from a language of power. The backdrops are beautiful, and as I go further through the game I find the story itself intriguing. It's gameplay is simple, but challenging, though not enough to make you frustrated.The story and Temple itself are the real good points though. It has a very Lovecraftian feel to it, but not in the most well known cosmic horror stories, but more from his Dream cycle. I find that extremely poetic, and to see that sort of story in a game is refreshing. Just the general premise makes me hunger for more, not just the same sort of game or the same temple, but just more of the -world- itself. I would say the game isn't for everyone, but it's definitely an experience. I would *LOVE* to see this in VR, but from the forums it appears like it's unlikely. I think that would bring an entirely new level of immersion to an already immersive game.			"

												Two words: BEYOND FRUSTRATINGHere's why:- no help or clues as to what you have to do ever- save points are few and far between so you die and have to do everything over again- later can heal yourself with water but there's never water when you need to heal- WAYY TOO MANY SPELLS to remember and the magic language is hard: Lumeh tial, Ekto namet, Yegah mideh...- most of the time the wrong spell happens even when ""Obee kenhu"" sounds nothing like ""Atulaghni""- the game glitches all the time i.e. you're floating in midair instead of standing on a platform or you just start moving backwards for no reason- Journal entries tell you about this temple but it's so long-winded and confusing that nobody reads it- If you're off by one millimeter when jumping, you'll miss the platform and injure yourself falling. Then you die and start everything over YAY- most of the rooms are so dark you can't see what you're doing and you can't always use the ""light"" spellPros:- Cool concept that's not executed correctly- Imaginative puzzles and rooms but they're too complicated to the point of frustration, not fun			"

												So where to begin with this game, I love the Story and Mystery behind everything you do in this game. The Audio is amazing and engaging. The Art Design is beautiful and stunning. The Stage progression was good and it was easy to understand where you were supposed to go as long as you explore a bit to begin with. Now the Voice recognition is cool and all but there were a few times were I would cough and it would count it as the Command spell or I would say one spell and it would interpret as another and I even set up my own Voice profile in the settings though it was mostly on the dot with what I said most of the time. Oh but I do love the sounds of the language used for the spells it was mystic yet regal.So to wrap it up I love everything about this game even with the few times I got annoyed at the Voice stuff. I would give this  game a 9/10. Mostly because there are a few areas where you can bug the game out a bit and the voice recognition still needs some improvement in techonogly before it can be prefected for a game like this. Still though Great work for a very small team.			"

												This is ridonculously epic. I was watching the trailer thinking: ""meh, main focus is magic, its usually more interesting when magic is 1 well developed aspect in the rpg"" then I scroll down a little and notice ""a microphone is required to play this game"" and im like: ""wait a minute, that's not voice acting Oo!?"" I instantly got goosebumps watching the trailer. I don't get goosebumps for a game since Morrowind... yes when it was new and shinny.Haven't either had an immersion/exploration vibe of this kind since playing said game and Riven and some old Tomb Raiders. Chapter 2 will show you what we have been missing in the last years in map design on FPS, it's pure intricate genius and outright gorgeous at times. Keep in mind this is a cerebral exploration game. If you feel something is missing in that room keep looking and don't forget to backtrack. It's not busywork, its exploration.Voice recognition is fairly lenient and if you have trouble remembering some spells you can use what works for you. I once forgot the telekenises spell and I said ""OP keanu!"" well... he bent a spoon on that movie and stoped bullets with his mind :P . Spell name also reminds of ""obee wan kenobi"" so most are easy to remember, other you can go by their name logic. It also worked when I had some snacks in my mouth on ocasion and the oposite was also true resulting in wonderful moments where I struggled to hold the food in my mouth while I laughed with joy at the awesomeness of the game.If you are like me, and used to recite out loud spell names when casting for the lols because you thought the latin/giberish names sounded epic (disciples II, baldurs gate/icewind dale), you know, the kind of thing you don't do in public, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU THAT ->YOU DID NOT EVEN KNOW YOU WANTED<-! Have a bottle of water near you because this doesn't get old!10/10 now when I go to the kitchen: ""Namet Atul! Namet Atul! Namet Atul!"" and if it's to cook something: ""Atul Aghni!"" , im 8 years old playing zelda again!			"

												I was pleasantly surprised by this title, so many games falter when it comes to the whole voice activated controls. But In Verbis Virtus does it exceptionally well! And to make sure I am not kidding you should check my video (be warned am Scottish but the amount of voice activated things that don't respond to Scottish this is a pleasant relief to see finally) The game also looks freaking fantastic and has some interesting puzzles that will take some proper thinking to work out!

												Hold onto your socks gamers, you’re just about to get the opportunity to geek out like you’ve never geeked before! Enter the world of In Verbis Virtus and learn the Maha’ki language to impact and control your surroundings. No… your character doesn’t learn Maha’ki, YOU do! Well you’ll need to if you want to get anywhere in these puzzles. Continue reading for the rest of our In Verbis Virtus review!I just had to try out In Verbis Virtus. A game that lets you cast spells with your own voice? I was all over that idea and I have to say that I’m impressed!The whole game is played through a first-person view using the usual ‘WASD’ keys to move around, and your mouse controls where you look. Holding down ‘left-click’ raises your character’s hand and allows you to speak into the mic to cast a spell you’ve learned.The beginning of In Verbis Virtus starts you off in a desert outside of a temple. Navigating to the entrance of the temple acts as the tutorial, introducing you to moving, jumping, sprinting and interacting with objects. After this brief period of learning, the puzzles begin.Placed throughout each level are signs showing a map of the area you are in. The maps show your current position, places of interest and the pathways needed to progress. If you don’t have a very good memory or you prefer to progress through games methodically, it might be a good idea to take a photo of these maps to use for reference further down the track. The entire game is pretty much one giant maze.By using these maps, you can successfully navigate through tunnels and the like, to find new spells or puzzles to be solved. Most puzzles will require you to have learned a certain spell in order to solve them. So there is a little bit of backtracking.For example, right at the beginning, one of the passageways you can take is completely dark. Not only that, but the only way to get through this room is to walk a very thin path that zigs and zags. Therefore, you need to have learned a spell that lights the area up to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Falling is bad, but not bad enough to kill you. Instead you’ll be transported somewhere nearby to where you fell, albeit missing a portion of your health. However once that health bar is depleted, death will follow, prompting you to restart from your previous saved game. So make sure you save whenever you get to one of the few save points.Puzzling TimesThe puzzles found throughout In Verbis Virtus are quite often very difficult and, if you choose to not have any hints, will require you to explore every nook and cranny of an area to find out exactly what you have to do. I must admit that a few puzzles had me visiting some forums and gaining some *ahem* inspiration to find the solution.Seriously though, there’s going to be at least one puzzle you come across which will have you pulling out your hair, trying desperately to work out the solution. Alternatively you can just turn on hints from the Options menu.The story of In Verbis Virtus is played out via animated cut-scenes. As you progress, the story, spells and other information about the temple are filled in to your journal for future reference. For someone as forgetful as myself, this is a god-send. My memory seems to only be able to hold two or three spells at a time… So I’m accessing my journal quite frequently to re-listen to magic words and pronunciations.My one qualm I have with In Verbis Virtus is that the voice recognition can, at times, seem a bit picky. (Although it might just be my dreadful pronunciation.) My wife can attest to me repeating spells over and over until they work. But then again, she’ll come over, listen to it and cast the spell in one attempt… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Being able to cast spells using your own voice is the best part of In Verbis Virtus. It’s one thing to be able to take control of an epic sorcerer, but it’s another to run around a lost temple shouting spells on-the-go and making an impact on your surroundings. It’s even fun to just run around aimlessly and cast any spell you want willy-nilly!Aesthetic CharmIn Verbis Virtus is quite a graphically intense game and you may need to change your graphics card settings to make sure your high-end GPU is being utilised.A little tip for NVIDIA users, go to your NVIDIA Control Panel and navigate to the Manage 3D Settings area. Add the game in the Program Settings if it’s not already there by clicking the Add button, going to where your Steam folder is and adding the In Verbis Virtus EXE file by navigating through the following folders: steam\steamapps\common\in verbis virtus\binaries\win32\ivv.exeAfterwards, make sure the preferred graphics processor is set to use your NVIDIA GPU.It will definitely be worth it to be using a GPU that can handle a lot. The environment is designed so beautifully, and textures bring the world to life brilliantly. Enemy designs and animations are extremely well done and you’ll find yourself trying to get a good close-up view of these foes without being beaten to death in the process.Spell effects are gorgeous and add to the pleasure of being able to cast spells using your own voice. My favourite one to look at has to be the telekinesis spell. It just looks too cool!The soundtrack is epic and matches the atmosphere perfectly. You might be facing off against a Saevar in a closed off room with nowhere to go, and the music will rise to a crescendo, making you run around even more frantically than before.Ethereal flutes create an atmosphere of mystery and energetic drum poundings inject you with a feeling of pure epicness! The soundtrack can be purchased from Steam for an extra $24.99USD but to be fair, it is a really good soundtrack.Final ThoughtsSome gamers are put off by the thought of talking to their computer to play, but to be brutally honest, man up and give it a go! Even if you have to wait for an empty house to play, In Verbis Virtus is definitely worth your time. To begin with, you will probably feel a bit silly speaking to your computer in an unknown language, but as you fall deeper into the role of your magic-wielding character, you’ll ignore everyone around you and find a sense of normality in speaking words such as “Lumeh Tial” to light up an area.If you’re looking for an action packed game, this probably isn’t going to meet your criteria. In Verbis Virtus is firstly a puzzle game with elements of action squeezed in. Fast reflexes and a good memory are key to success in completing the game.I honestly think that In Verbis Virtus is a game that all fantasy game fans should play. There are times of frustration and not everyone enjoys difficult puzzles, but you can always get hints and I haven’t found any other games out there that let you utilise your voice to cast spells as wonderfully as this one.Read the full review[gamereviewsau.com] "

												Honest Review!!!!Puzzles... Lots of Puzzles... While I'm not really a big fan of doing intense puzzles, this game involves both combat and puzzles while making it very fun. My very first time trying to cast Lumeh Tial I spoke into my mic and said ""Crash to Desktop"" and what do you know, it worked! Since then I have made my own spell names, such as explosion for the Atul Aghni spell... but since they weren't working 100% of the time I decided to learn the actual spells. Though the speaking portion isn't 100% accurate for each and every spell you try to cast, I'd say that it was about 90-95% accurate for when I actually used a spell. For instance, there were times when I said Atul Aghni, but instead cast Namet Atul instead. Most of the time the accuracy of the speech-to-spell cast ratio wasn't a problem. Other than that, I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for an interesting game that will cause others to look at you strangely as you play it, but be warned that these puzzles are not as easy as they might appear. One room (the lava room with the rotating pillars in Chapter 3) took me approximately 2 hours to solve, so by no means is this thing a walk in the park. If you are someone that doesn't have a ton of money, wait for a discount on the game.Read on if you plan on getting this fantastic game for a few tips:1) Be sure to check every possible solution that is available to you before moving onto a new area or returning to an old area. Many of the puzzles have hidden sections or hints as to how to complete different sections if you look hard enough.2) Remain calm when in a combat scenario - I panicked a few times and I couldn't remember the spells, pressing the spells list in the middle of combat helped me quite a bit to both think and calm myself a bit.3) If all else fails, don't quit, I'd recommend looking up a guide to answer a question or find a hint, full solutions will probably ruin the game as it is intended to be a puzzle. I had to use a guide to know that I was doing the correct thing and not wasting 30 minutes pouring water into buckets to find a pattern...4) Sometimes taking a leap of faith is required to advance to the next area or to complete a puzzle.

												Challenging puzzles, dark surreal ambiance, huge Balrog-like enemy. Sweet.For me the speech-recognition worked mostly flawlessly, if it didn't, it was almost always my fault for talking to fast in a hectic situation.For some puzzles the hints that may be there are easy to overlook or misconceive., making them really hard to solve.Overall really recommend the game, but don't wonder if your flatmate will think you are crazy for shouting ATUL AGHNI multiple times aloud.

												This game isn't bad as a whole per say. To be honest, I really enjoyed a good deal of the first part of the game. The first chapter was intuitive, thematic, and overall nice and to the point in terms of the puzzles. Once you get to chapter 2, however, things begin to go downhill, though not straight away. The 'hall of pain' as a guide calls it is the first true test of your patience. It's a maze, but you die relatively quickly. I won't say more as that would be a spoiler, but you end up desperately trying to stay alive while also trying to solve the maze at the same time, and unless you pick up on the clues before entering the maze, you'll be completely lost.That, however, isn't that bad. What's bad is everything from the lava-room onwards. Rather than trying to explain just how frustrating this game can be, I think it's best to just see it for yourself. Look up Cry's stream of the game, go to the 3-hour point and watch from there. If you can live with those frustruations, this game will be for you. If you can't, get it on sale just to experience the gimmick and then drop it after 2 hours or so of gameplay. Before it gets bad.Either that or just look through the guide when you get stuck. Seriously. The guide might save the game for you.**EDIT**Just looked at the stats. The achievement for completing the game has a bit less than 3% achievement rate. I think that underlines my above points fairly well.			"

Early Access Review
								Brilliant game so far, capturing and very moreish lol.  Even though I found a few moments when I thought ""Wait... what am I supposed to do?""  A little time thinking for once in a game and solved!  (I miss games where you have to actually think!)  The environment is amazing, forgive the cliche but it is a game about magic, and you get that feel from the environment, the puzzle rooms, the incantations, the story you start to unfold through the notes in your journal as you play...  It all adds to a great gaming fun experience.  I found myself more absorbed into it due to the incantation aspect of the spell casting through saying the spells instead of pressing a button to cast it for you.  You feel more in control and deeper into the game yourself, more than just reading skill descriptions and BOOM it's done something to a target.  (again, you have to think.  ""You have spells, with a multitude of things to cast them on, now go solve the puzzle!"" :D)Very nicely done and I'm looking forward to more developments! :-)			"

												TL;DR: A wonderful surreal first-person fantasy puzzle game with a unique central mechanic of using one's own voice to cast spells to solve puzzles and progressing forward.+ Excellently executed fantasy backdrop supported by a good engine.+ Complex puzzle mechanics that reward smart exploration over blind ""trying everything once"", that rewards one to explore and think things through.+ A voice control mechanic that not only works very well, but actually is central to the game and adds to the experience, rather than feeling tacked-on.- Voice commands may take a while to get used to your specific voice and accent, and miscasts and noncasts are common when there's a lot of background noise or you mispronounce. Take time to tweak the microphone settings both in Windows and ingame, and enunciate in a clear voice.- The puzzle-based world you travel through is difficult enough that many may be turned off by feeling lost, even with the many signs and maps around the area.- Backtracking is a thing, and sometimes backtracking at the wrong time, or not noticing an element here or there can leave you feeling lost.

Early Access Review
								First of all, keep in mind that this game is in early access. That being said the developers are very involved in helping solve any and all issues, and have managed to push out a unique game that already, in its third early access update, contains roughly 6-8 hours of great gameplay. The game itself is a blend of first-person horror, puzzle, and classic rpg games that does not feel like three genres thrown together in a blender. They have been elegantly interlaced in the main story and gameplay. The story is not shoved down your throat either like many of today's games, but rather subtley unlocked. In a way, as you discover more and more about the templethe player discovers more and more about his motivation. I won't say any more on that subject for fear of spoilers.     Now the big thing that sets this game apart and is possibly its biggest selling point is the voice functionality. It is through this command that the game really shines. I have never felt more like my character as I have playing this game, because in this game I have to literally speak for my character. The downside of this function is that sometimes it bugs out. It may use a different spell than what you wanted or may even not cast a spell at all. The develpers, however, are even working on this drawback, as they plan on adding voice recognition training functionality to the game itself, so what the game hears is you, rather then some generic coding that you have to imitate. On top of the pure awesomeness of casting a spell, you can choose which language, english, or the games own made up language, Maha'ki, to cast spells in. Maha'ki is a very latin-ish fantasy-ish language that feels great to speak in. But if that's not your cup of tea, the english functionality works just as well.     Overall, this is probably the best, and most challenging game I have purchased in a long time. I urge the developers to keep up the good work because this games shows the promise of surpassing games from the very genres that it pulls from, such as myst, or even games of the elder scrolls franchise. In the future, this game could be worth a lot more than the $16.99 it is now, especially if they add nearly as much content as it looks like they are going to!P.S. Even though I don't have one, Occulus Rift support would make this game BEYOND amazing! I would actually probably invest in one (once the price goes down a bit :P) just to play this game and truly feel like a wizard!			"

												Very entertaining. Voice recognition works like a charm IF you use a headset with a mic. With an internal mic, not that much. It's such a thrill to cast spell with your voice! The game is more puzzle oriented than classic FPS (which doesn't repel me at all). Grabbed it while it was 75% discounted and didn't regret.			"

												Yay, Finally talking to my Pc has an effect! And it works way better than I expected. While there are some critters to kill, the game mainly is a puzzle game and some of these puzzles are pretty hard. If you don't like to talk to inanimate objects or/and if you are more into killing things this game isn't for you. There isn't much action, its more about thinking and showing patience.

												beautiful game for anyone who wanted to have magic or powers.the 'spells' in thier native language can be tricky sometimes, it relies on sound pitch more than verbalization of the words.everytime you stop playing and come back, you have to remember the spells, which increase as you play.other than that, its quite fun, you are kind of just dropped into play, without much direction but with the story gradually revealing who, what, where you are and why. i admit, i was annoyed at first, but you move past it, and its enjoyable.

												Well, yeah,.. I'm recommending this game even tho I have not finished it yet. Controls are quite intuitive and it really does not matter if you want to play it on keybord or using a gamepad. At first, It's kind of confusing to get the right spell on. First chapter is guiding you and teaching you to use correct spells and to get into the casting system. I casted diferent spell then I pronounced only few times and it was probably my fault. The voice recongnition works really well, tho I tried only the ""mystic"" language, not english.If you can get it in some kind of sale and you do like adventures and (not only) ocasional puzzle solving, it's the right game for you! I would by it even for the full price after the experience I have.Remember, any kind of adventure gives you sometimes thoughts about rage-quiting :)			"

												Pros: The voice recognition works well, only about one in every 10-15 spells cast are the wrong one.The atmosphere is great.The spell effects look nice enough.Cons: Saying this game is ""light on story"" would be an exaggeration. You're better off imagining your own than piecing one together from what's in the game.The targeting system is a mess.While the game knows what spell you want to cast, it has great difficulty figuring out what you want to cast it on.A target standing still is fine, but any scenario where you need to do things quickly it all falls apart. Whether aiming at a stationary point you have to run up to, or an enemy you need to target, the game seems to just throw its hands in the air.Great potential, poorly executed.			"

												[Pros]*Speech recognition workswell - They have did a good job on making this one work almost all the time. It work so well  even I don't speak I will cast Lumeh Tial *Wellcrafted models - They really took a great effort on modeling the structures. They have done a good job on making it based on the lore of the game*Harry Potter Simulator - I'm a Harry Potter myself and that is why I bought it in the first places. I was awe'd the first time a cast a spell WITH MY OWN VOICE like a real wizard's reaction. I told myself ♥♥♥♥ yes*Looks Beautiful than my crush - I think this is one of the games that has beautiful lightings. They nailed it on using light effects to highlight the beauty of the environment[Cons]*Only for Hardcore players - This is hard♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't expect an objective guide. You have to find out everything on your own. I know that they are trying to make the game immersive as possible but I think it would be better if they made it an optional. Make a mode that is for Casual players and Hardcore players so everyone can join. I was confused on what the hell to do or am I really making a progress. And Wtf why is the floor sucking my health.*It has Bugs - Enemies respawn each time you reload a save. It really annoying that you have to deal with then again and again after you died on a game you always die. Also using spells is buggy. Lumeh Tial sometimes take 5 seconds to cast. and one time I was standing on a Water Yegah Wideh?? I dont remember but I keep saying the spell and doesn't work. There maybe more bugs but I'm gonna delay for awhile on finishing this game.*Stupid enemy AI - I was standing near infront of a recently spawn enemy he isn't doing anything even if I attacked him. Also the caged enemy still keep running on me even tho he doesnt have anywhere to go*Poor Opimazation - The beautiful looks comes with a prices. The lighting effects needed to be opimize. My fps is dropping to 20fps whenever I'm near lights.*Controls needs to be enhanced - In this hardcore puzzle game controls must be very effecient. Especially the spell Obee Kuhne. I was playing this gem on top of a statue. I was having a badtime putting it on the right places.*Weak Story presentation - This game needed some voice acting on reading journal or maybe also for the character. It's really boring just to read it.*Back tracking - I've done tons of backtracking on this game. As a linear game they should have done it with no back trackings so I would feel rewarded when solving puzzles. This really turns me off for playing this.I really admire developer's ambitious game for making this game voice recognition commanded. This is a step forward for future gaming/virtual reality experience. I hope this keep the good things and fix the bad ones next time they will make another kind of these game. I can't really recommend this one neither not recommend it for everyone. So for the sake of supporting the developer on making another of this I would recommend it. I hope you guys do better next time.			"

												This is a cautious recommendation, it's definetly not a game for everyone for a few reasons:First of all it's a puzzle game and it doesn't hold your hand at all, this can be a positive depending on your point of view but some solutions definetly get on the harder side later on and another problem is that each of the chapters (2 and 3 especially) take place in really huge maps and it can be disorienting as to where you have to go / what you have to do next,  which isn't really helped by the backtracking you have to do a lot of timesThen there's the main gimmick of the game which is the voice recognition spells and aside from the obvious factor that you could be saying a bunch of weird things in front of other people (the game uses it's own fantasy language but you can change that if you want, although it's recommended for immersion) I've got to admit that it is quite cool at first but more than a couple of problems start to appear later onThe speech regonition seems fine at first but it only seems to get worse after you get more spells and it starts confusing between them sometimes like I can't tell you how many times it confused ""Obee Kehnu"" with ""Udah Notem"" and so you just keep saying the same spell over and over again until it actually works, which you sorta need it to be 100% or very close to it especially near the end of the game which sometimes ended up in me shouting the spells sometimes in frustration and also the novelty of the whole thing starts to wear off too somewhat and makes you wish you had hotkeys for all of them so they'd be guaranteed to work / not mix upStory wise it's kinda basic and totally optional, you get journal entries at certain points in the game and you can find documents that tell you a little bit more about the game's world and all that, so you can read them if you want, a few of them can provide clues in certain points of the game though, side note here it's usually a stone tablet with runes but weirdly enough later in the game they change that and I didn't even realize it at first because the new ""documents"" really just look like decoration more than anything else so I ended up missing quite a few of them, but the ending at least was somewhat interesting but obviously story wasn't the main focus of this gameOverall it's a nice game with an interesting gimmick, it looks quite good too, there are some really beaultiful enviroments most notably in the third chapter and the game isn't that long either so it doesn't really overstay it's welcome too much (although I gotta admit it was starting to grind my gears near the end) so if you're into this sort of genre I'd say give it a go, it's at least worth that much			"

												Pretty cool experience. It's a bit buggy which sometimes really annoyed me but I really liked it.The best thing is you can replace spell's words with some funny senteces, had lots of fun while talking with my friends and thinking of something that would sound familiar to the original version.8/10			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game! Disclaimer:  THIS GAME REQUIRES A MICROPHONE IN ORDER TO PLAYThis is a puzzle atmosphere game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play with the xbox controller and keyboard.You can customise the keyboard controls.There is a microphone volume slidebar available.You can choose if you wish to say English or ingame language to cast a spell.The game has many different resolution sizes.There is a gamma slidebar available.You can play the game fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a mouse sensitivity slidebar available.About the game.After the struggle for buying a (decent) microphone which is required to play this game. You will be wandering around in the middle of the dessert and eventually you will find a temple. Obviously you will enter this as it's part of the game and you will see some weird scribblings on the pillars. After interacting with every one of them, the door will finally open. But the door will be shut down behind you once you are walking through the door. You will have to discover the secrets and learn the magical spells in order to defeat enemies or complete the obstacles.You have to cast abilities through your microphone.Has puzzles, enemies and obstactles.Ingame instructions and tips.You can't skip cutscenes.Has save stations.Has map stations.There are some collectables but the game doesn't really need that to be honest.The atmosphere in this game is very good too. Also the light effects and reflection is very well done. Other things.The voice pickup is decent. (better then mario party 7).You might not want to play this if you are in a room full of people.. They might declare you are crazy as you are trying to announce or say the spells.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Pros: The voice recognition works well, only about one in every 10-15 spells cast are the wrong one.The atmosphere is great.The spell effects look nice enough.Cons: Saying this game is ""light on story"" would be an exaggeration. You're better off imagining your own than piecing one together from what's in the game.The targeting system is a mess.While the game knows what spell you want to cast, it has great difficulty figuring out what you want to cast it on.A target standing still is fine, but any scenario where you need to do things quickly it all falls apart. Whether aiming at a stationary point you have to run up to, or an enemy you need to target, the game seems to just throw its hands in the air.Great potential, poorly executed.			"

												I would like to state at the beginning of this review that I DO NOT recommend this game.Reasons to recommend this gameThere are not many games that support casting spells of your own.You can listen to the sounds of spells as long as you need them, which makes it easier to start.The graphics and musics are not bad, though I didn't really pay attention to them.Reasons not to recommend this gameIt took me about 30 minutes adjusting my microphone because it keeps failing. I am quite sure that this is the problem of the game.Solving puzzles is fun, but wasting my time on looking for god-knows-what all around the map is not.I really, really dislike the fact that I have to read all those texts just to be sure that I am not missing any crucial clues.Still about texts. A good story telling shouldn't be like this. There's definitely no atmosphere when I have to stop exploring and start to read a book.The idea of performing tricks by speaking out the spell is amazing, undoubtedly. But I don't see any sense in adopting such a feature in this game. Probably it fits games like The Elder Scroll or The Witcher more.Also the AI of this game is not satisfying. Sometimes when I'm standing right in front of a monster at a very close distance he gives no response ;)This game is a very nice try, but it doesn't meet my expectation.Ps. As for the problem of microphone, I am quit sure this is the problem of the game because several minutes before I started this game, I was preparing for a Skype interview so that I thoroughly check my microphone. I tried three different mics in the game and none of them worked. I followed the instructions on the discussion page but nothing changed. I understand many of you don't have such a problem, but to me, it just doesn't work.			"

												Games with wasted potential like this make me angry. The graphics, controls, and atmosphere are superb. The voice recognition is great and casting spells by voice is a blast. Shame it's wasted on such a lame and incredibly obnoxious puzzler.I don't think I could design more annoying combat or puzzles if I tried. There's very little combat, and thank goodness for that because enemies are as much of a threat to your patience as to your health bar.  Either they're swarms of critters you have to either back away from awkwardly or whittle away, or they're poorly programmed humanoid enemies who spend half the time sitting there and half the time charging you, and only react to your spells half the time.As for the puzzles and exploration, there's very little thinking involved. It's 5% thought, 10% trial and error, and 85% scouring every last area for some easily missed scribbling, statue, hidden mechanic, or other piece of junk you need. The map in the start of the second level is either completely unreadable or for another area, because I spent a good 10 minutes looking at it and looking around trying to orient it and figure out where I was. There's an area where you take damage as long as you stay there for literally no reason, with no indication except for a small grunt when you enter the area.You barely even get to use your spells creatively. They may as well just be keys for various locks.If you will excuse me, I'm going to go pull out all my hair now.			"

												Disclaimer : this is more a puzzle game than anything else, so if you expect to fight with spells like in an RPG but with voice recognition, you will be disappointed.The game has a very interesting concept. The voice recognition can sometimes fail (which can be quite frustrating at times) but most of the time it works just fine.The puzzles (and even finding your way in mazes) can be quite challenging.The combat can be very frustrating, but fortunately there is not too much of it.Overall not a great game, but a very good one.

The only problem is that the game is ♥♥♥♥ing creepy and when you need to cerrectly cast a spell to prevent yourself from diying, you probably won't cast your spell correctly and shout something like ""ekto lomeeaeaeaaaeaeh f*ck i'm dead"".♥♥♥♥ing great game btw, no regret for buying it on Early Access, keep working !(Plz no more scary ennemies plz)			"

												I entered the temple with nothing, my skin sore from being baked in the unforgiving desert sun. I find myself cautiously moving through the dark halls and tunnels illuminated by faintly glowing crystals and plants, my step growing bolder as I gain new and amazing powers to conquer any challenge before me. It was intoxicating. All I had to do was to raise my hand and loudly declare my will, and light would show me the way. Obstacles would be moved by sheer willpower. Grievous wounds would mend in mere moments. Even the temple itself would obey my commands.The neighbour is at the door, asking me to keep my voice down, but they don't understand me.They don't understand what it's like to be a wizard.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. I've had a good deal of fun playing it thus far and the inclusion of using your voice to cast spells has been exeptionally novel.I can't however, recommend this game as a puzzle game. The puzzles I've encountered thus far are incredibly obscure and require tons of time spent bashing your head against your keyboard to unravel. Clues tend to be useless, even when present. After about 20-30 minutes of play, I have to quit the game and walk away before I get so frustrated that I punch a hole in my monitor. I love a good puzzle game, but this game really lacks the satisfaction element of completing a difficult puzzle.			"

												Few things needed to play this game:1) talent for puzzles2) ability to speak clearly3) have a GOOD quality mic with no background noise!These things said, I've had a hell of a time with this game... Puzzles are imaginative and the graphics are pretty.  Music is nice too.  But I'm also getting alot of technical problems: the game crashes to the point I have to reinstall it when I try to rig the speech rcognition.  Try to play without this and the game frequently either misses spells I speak or casts the wrong ones (Tial Udah is FAR DIFFERENT from Ekto Lumeh!!).  There is also a lag time between my speaking the spell and it taking effect, sometimes you also need to let go of the 'hand' trigger for the spell to do its thing.  And not all spells do this.While I want to continue this game (it's a great and beautiful game), I'm starting to get into combat scenarios and puzzles where timing is a real key.  need precision responses from the casting system that I'm just not getting.  maybe in a few updates....

												Before I begin, let me just clarify why I would not recommend this game. It's a good game, really good in fact. Graphics are nice, though there is a bit of stuttering here and there. The story is deep and interesting, and who doesn't want to be able to cast spells with their voice? However, there is one MAJOR drawback to all of that, and that is this: It's a puzzle game. I know it may seem like a stupid reason to not recommend a game, but let's be perfectly honest. Even a puzzle game like this is boring, even with the ability to cast spells with your own voice. And to be brutally honest, that's this game's only selling point; ""cast spells with your voice!"". It's a great concept, but I just cannot recommend a game that takes a good concept and puts it in a game it doesn't belong in. This game would've been much better off as an RPG with Co-Op and/or PvP, where you fight other people and hear them cast spells and have that one split second to think of the proper counter-spell. Instead, we get a game where you roam through a boring (though well-designed) crumbling temple that makes you feel like Indiana Jones while you beat your head against a wall trying to figure out what the heck you're supposed to do next. Bottom Line: Beautiful game, well designed, good concept but in the wrong type of game. If your only reason for buying this game is ""Oooh, I get to cast spells with my voice? Heck yes!"", don't buy it. It'll just disappoint you. But if you love puzzle games, then this just might be your cup of proverbial tea.			"

												In Verbis Vertus consists of a mixture of first person exploration, puzzle solving, and, spell-casting through the use of voice commands. Throughout In Verbis Vertus the player will move through an underground system of tunnels and caves, progressing deeper into the earth. The majority of the game consists of interacting with and exploring this environment by solving puzzles and mastering spells.The main appeal of In Verbis Vertus is it's spell casting. In order to cast spells, the player must memorize the words of a spell and clearly speak them into their microphone. The player may choose to preform these voice commands in English or in a fantasy language designed for the game. Using voice commands to cast spells is a novel concept, and I found myself initially enjoying the system more than a traditional hot-key approach. However, the novelty wears off quickly, and is soon replaced with frustration. This is due to the game's tendency to misinterpret the player's speech, requiring them to repeat commands multiple times. I found this extremely frustrating, especially when rapid action is required. I also was disappointed to find that throughout my time with the game, it failed to introduce any interesting or unique spells, the most interesting being a fireball that can be detonated mid flight. For a game which focused so heavily on spell-casting, I would have expected a more in depth or interesting system. It was sad to see a system that showed so much promise end up feeling lifeless and dull.The environmental design In Verbis Vertus also leaves much to be desired. Although exploration and discovery are clearly meant to be a focus, I found the game oddly linear. In order to progress, the player must complete actions in a set order and way. Puzzles seem to have a single solution, leaving the player feeling like they are simply going through the motions rather than figuring things out on their own. Occasionally some puzzles will deviate from this, allowing a bit more experimentation, but these are few and far between. The game also allows backtracking, but provides no incentive for doing so. Fortunately, In Verbis Vertus is a good looking game. It's environments are often packed with color and interesting scenery, which is enjoyable to look at.In Verbis Vertus has such a strong concept, but unfortunately falls short in execution, making what should have been a unique, captivating experience feel like a chore. Somewhere underneath all poor design decisions is a truly special game, which makes it all the more sad that I cannot recommend In Verbis Vertus. I hope a sequel is released which further develops all the unique ideas in In Verbis Vertus without its mistakes.			"

												Bottom line:  if it interests you, buy it for half off.It's a very solid game.  The voice recognition works decently, even with a little hurry or slurring.  But not too much of either.I like it, I'll finish it eventually.  I'm currently not liking where I'm at in it as it feels more like a horror/survival game at times - you have extremely limited options in dealing with emenies that you cannot kill but who are MORE than capable of killing you.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but neither is it truly what I expected out of the game.			"

												When most people think, 'Okay, I'm a hardcore nerd,' they never envision casting spells with their voice, no matter how much they may wish to. If you are one of those people, play this game so long as you have the confidence to withstand the snickering of your family as you scream 'Lumeh Tial!' and your characters hand glows then you proceed to literally bounce around with ecstatic energy. This game made my wishes for a Hogwarts letter seem absurd; who wants to have to use a wand when YOU CAN SHOUT SPELLS INTO YOUR COMPUTER FOR ELONGATED PERIODS OF HAPPINESS! If you think, 'nah this game costs to much', then I tell you this: 'Don't let your dreams be dreams. JUST DO IT!' You know how much you actually want this game. If you are looking or have looked in the negative reviews, you will see the fact that barely anyone doesn't like this game, all of them stupid. They probably say something about terrible voice recognition, but they probably forgot to release the left mouse button after saying the spell's formula to actually cast the spell (REMEMBER TO DO THAT IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS GAME; NAY, REMEMBER TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE PLAYING THIS GAME, WHETHER YOU WANT TO OR NOT, ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD WANT TO LEST YOU BE DEEMED FOOLISH).I know that my argument seems kind of childish, but hey, I bear no shame. Here's the less childish truths of the matter:Pros:You can use your voice to be like, 'BLOW ALL THE THINGS UP!' and 'I HAVE MENTAL POWERS (Obee Kehnu)!'You can blow up little thingies with streams of light; if someone asks you if that is stupid, ask them if THEY'VE ever shot beams of light that damage creatures from their hands.You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice. You can cast spells with your voice.The graphics are amazing (I have a 'meh' graphics card and I can run it on full AND it is really astounding; the game was configured to allow common computers run it on beautiful graphics).Cons:You're stupid if you actually think that there would be anything bad about this game; YOU'RE A FRACKING MAGE WHO USES A MICROPHONE TO CAST SPELLS WITH YOUR VOICE. How could anything be bad?Rating:100/10 I would, with complete and total confidence in the validity of this statement, blow up irritating creatures and midgets flying around again, even though my dad mocks me by talking like a guy from Magicka.NB: If you think that you're not going to by the game, stop being an idiot and go back to the top of this review and read it again. Repeat this if your innate foolishness wins the war with common sense inside of you.No, I have not finished this game.			"

												     As others have said, the voice-casting would have been great as a mod/feature added to another game, like maybe Skyrim (""Fus-Ro-Da!"").  But in this game here it feels out of place.     Basicaly, you walk until you find a spell . . . use that spell to open the next path . . . to get to the next area . . . to start looking for the next spell . . . repeat.     Ther are a couple of tricky platform-jumping spots, but nothing exciting.  There are no real challenges along the way.  There are a few places where you think you're in the right place, and just need to puzzle out exactly which spell to use on what object or such in order to advance, only to eventually figure out that you don't kave the right spell yet, and you need to go wandering the map again to find it.     To, me this is a good proof-of-concept for a voice-based spell casting system (maybe as a mod for the next Elder Scrolls game), but not a great game on it's own.			"

												Its a good game with something very interesting new mechanic... Casting a spell with your own voice. Which all and all along with a FPS puzzle element it should be something I should recomended.........I wish to but I CANT. Because the very selling point of this game on voice recognition is like a two edge sword. When the mechanic work it can make you feel as if you were a wizard  But when this voice recognition doesn't work it can make you feel really frustrate which has a reminisance to a game where control won't response according to your command..... But to top this off, The game got a God damn COMBAT which...if you can imagine made this game even more frustrate. In most game when you fight with spell you were pressing just a button and whatever happen after that you could blame yourself for not response quick or maybe a bad strategic have something to do with your failure and you could adapted for better by next round. But in this game.......................Imagine this, You were stuck in a very close quater room where there are 2 enemies constantly chasing you around and you require to put on a magic to fight them which should be very simple. STUNT them with one spell, MARK them with another spell, EXPLODE mark target with spell. Very simple indeed in most game but in a game where voice recognition was ""sometime work and won't"", The situation became unforgiven and I can't pass this stage no matter how much I yelled to the top of my lungs on microphone. In Conclusion, I'm sadly to not be able recommended this little gem here, It does offer me a great experience as initialy intend. But failed when including some very unnecessary and burden such as a ""normal combat mechanic""			"

								The idea of the game is amazing and it's working very well so far. The only thing I didn't like it, is about the clues which are not so clear and logic yet. But I saw that there are others complaining about it so I think they are going to improve it. Anyway, the game is in the way to be one of the best games that I've ever played, because it gets together what I like most (puzzle and magic) in an innovative way. Congratulations to the producers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!			"

								Let me start off by saying that this game is new, fresh, and very worth the buy. That's all you need to know. If you like magic fantasy games then this is for you. Cast spells with your voice? Screw the ""hotbar"" using all your number keys and every other key you might have on your keyboard, cast spells with a single mouse click.Personally, I NEVER buy games. I've played something close to maybe 100 (maybe more like 50+ but who's counting) games and I haven't paid for squat. Why? Because they weren't worth it. Hell I wasn't gonna pay for this thing at first, but after seeing the potential I knew it was a good idea. Honetly the developers should feel honored they were better than many of the mainstream games around now, good enough to get my measly 17$ and a review. Both of which i never do! Expect great things from this game, and being that this is only alpha expect beta and full release to be a masterpiece.Now if only they'd input Oculus Rift support it'd be that much better...			"

								I already love this game! I haven't gamed till late into the nigth but I saw the sun rise when I finally shut my pc down to go to bed (this was day 1 of having the game). The spellcasting system works pretty well, and it's a relief to not have to use your keyboard for spells (though I did write myself a little spell overview note because in the heat of it all forgetting the healing spell can kill you...) So it will probably take some getting used to to being able to cast just as well in stressed conditions compared to ""normal"" ones. But hey, it's a lot more realistic than the simple button mashing in all the other games :)As for the surroundings, I can only call that eye candy ♥ I'm very happy I got this game now, not only for the early enjoyment of it, but also because I have a feeeling this game will become a lot more expensive by the time it's finished. (16 euros? That's going to be a bargain!)			"

								This game is really cool. U get to feel like a real wizard/socerer or whatever b/c u literally get to say the spells. Sometimes it gets annoying that u backtrack a lot but that just adds to the fact that if u were searching some ancient temple u'd probably b backtracking a lot too lol. You have to pay attention to the slightest things and also reading lore helps a lot in this game so u can't just get by with just going around w/o reading lore at all.			"

												This game should explain its premis better, such as explaining why the protagonist was stumbling in the desert. The combat in this game seems it be pointless and frustrating, The 'Beam Of Light' spell is not efficient enough to fight the 'glowing bugs' and the narrow passages don't allow for any tactics to avoid them. I suggest that the 'Glowing Bugs' should be repealed by the 'Let There Be Light' spell. The visuals and spell mechanics are intriguing and the game as a whole needs improving.			"

												I bought this game on a whim and it is quite cool. In this game you explore a vast system of caves and puzzles, you kill little bugs and you jump around like a madman from platform to platform. What makes this game cool is you use your voice to cast spells, which can seem a little daunting at first but the first time you say a spell right and a laser bursts out of your hand it is really ♥♥♥♥ing cool.

												This game seems like it would be a decent and unique puzzle game. When I bought the game on sale, I was very excited to try it out, but it just wasn't what I though it would be. The graphics and details of your surroundings were just beautiful, and  (I don't know if this was just for me or not but...) the voice recognition was okay, but I had a few problems with it. The rest of the game however, no offens to the devs, it just bad. I have eight hours on this game and haven't finished it or gotten anywhere in chapter 2, because I spent most of my time running around looking for how to get to the puzzle I was trying to solve. The puzzles were initially easy, but getting to them was not. It involves much running around to just find a tiny detail you missed, and it just angered me so much that I stopped playing. The enemies were annoying and pretty buggy for me. Had one enemy just disappear, not sure why still. I don't recommend this game to anyone who wants a decent puzzle game where you spend most of your time actually solving the puzzles.			"

												A really nice game brimming with atmosphere provided by the excellent art design and captivating music.The spell casting mechanic through voice is a very nice variety and works very well (for the most part). It's quite fun to cast using this method, although combat becomes a bit hectic, when more than one enemy is involved.The Puzzles are not too hard when one remembers all the options provided by the known spells and analyzes thoroughly.

												In Verbis Virtus is a unique RPG Magic Adventure game in that instead of clicking to cast a spell, you can use the power of your own voice to cast. Feel your way through the game, memorizing different incantations and beating your foes with magic you created. It has very nice graphics, although if you don't have a good enough processor, all the special effects can slow down your game. Conclusion: In Verbis Virtus is a innovative, immersing, and pretty RPG, although can be difficult without proper software.Overall: 8.5/10			"

The game is...IMMERSING: From now on you are not only clicking the mouse/gamepad buttons, you are the part of the game and your voice will be heard. It feels very creepy when you forget the spell in the middle of battle!...BREATH TAKING: The environmental design is made with on the high quality side that allows you to feel like the ancient explorer of the abandoned temple. Complex structures, environmental puzzles along with breath taking landscapes will not let you go until you complete the game.STORY TELLING: By exploring the shattered knowledge of the temple, you will learn the magical spells as well as some unique stories of human beings and history of this strange place. This is all about the exploration, watching and learning.SURREAL: This is a world full of magic, strange creatures and dangerous places. In order to survive here - you need to understand how the things work and put your knowledge into the good use.This game is completely beyond your imagination that brings you to the new experience of gaming. Higly recommended for those who love exploration and magical games!			"

												Well, I tried. This game looked like it had great potential, but I quickly realized that the developers have zero idea of what puzzles are.Puzzles aren't ""pore over every nook and cranny looking for the solution to be told to you, because there's zero way to work it out yourself,"" they're ""think creatively and find the solution""I got to one that I finally had to look up a guide for. The guide basically said ""yeah, if you didn't find a random document a few rooms back, there's no way you'll know how to do this thing."" I tried to go back, but the way the platforms were set, I couldn't.I lasted 41 minutes before requesting a refund, which sucks, because it looked interesting.			"

												I often try and immerse myself in game as much as I can; try and think and see the world as your character does. Most games you can't actually achieve this, but on those which I can, and are designed with that intend, makes the experience more enjoyable and intense.... Well, in this game I didn't even had to try; the microphone feature, along with the fact that you gotta learn all those spells by heart, really makes you feel like the main character in game. This also includes all the emotions and the cheer curiosity you get as you see yourself discovering new things each passing minute. Oh, btw, keep in mind the hot keys for your notebook; there's nothing worse that get nervous because you're against an enemy and realize you forgot all your spells.Oh, right.... If you didnt realize this by now, I'm telling you: in this game YOU are the one yelling the spells, not just pressing buttons to cast them, so enjoy while aware of your surroundings.			"

												A very fun game, you will feel pretty dorky at first but it is incredibly fun once you get into it. The story is intriguing, and I wasn't expecting a horror game going in but it's not terrible, it does a good job of unnerving you and making you feel vulnerable, but not helpless. I can't speak for the default voice profiles, I did the custom profile which I would avise doing anyway.My onyl complaint is that sometimes there is not a lot of direction on where to go and you can wind up walking in circles or sometimes even struggling to execute the solution to a puzzle after having figured it out. As it stands, I'd give the parts I played a 7.5/10, definitely worth the experience but once I got stuck I found it hard to revisit. $15 or less is a good deal (The 2016 summer sale has it at $8, so if you're interested, I'd say go for it).

												Decent Adventure/Puzzle-game with its own twist,casting spells with your voice. It recognizes what you say pretty well and combat can get really messy when in rush trying to say the spell. Bit short,but fun and puzzles are pretty well designed.Give it a try.			"

												The voice recognition, on which this game depends, is nowhere near good enough.Roughly two thirds of the time it fails for me, which makes the game an exercise in frustration, especially when some of the puzzles rely on it working several times in a row. It's so bad that sometimes it casts a completely different spell. I guess that if you're lucky enough to have a voice similar to that of the testers you'll probably have more luck, but buying this is a gamble. It's a shame because apart from that one fundamental flaw the game seems pretty good, but there's nothing quite so annoying as controls that don't work.			"

												Normally, when I’m writing up a review, I start off the article with some pithy wordsmithing. I use it to set up an air of humor so that we all remember that this is a video game we’re talking about, and there’s no reason to take it seriously. Even if the game was not a good game (like The Good Life), it’s still just a video game. There’s no reason to get stressed out over it.But not this time. In Verbis Vertus is the most obtuse, pretentious game I have ever had the misfortune of having to try to play.Read the rest of this review here: http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/146464/verbis-vertis-sort-review-no-one-likes-first-person-platforming/ "

												Ok, fine. Stop downvoting my stupid review, I'll write it. Here's why you should buy it: -The voice control is AMAZING. This augmented reality thing is really worth it. It's one of the most pleasant things I experienced in my life, and that includes Cadbury's Battenberg cake. -You can come up with your own silly spells that sound like the original ones, and sometimes they work. For example, Obi Wan Kenobi works as a spell for telekinesis. It's a lot of fun.-It looks pretty.Here's why you shouldn't buy it.-Backtracking-Level design. It's BAD. Not only [see above], but also it's hard to locate important elements in all the jumble that the levels are. At some point I explicitly wanted to find an element in a room and failed, while it was there and was necessary to proceed. At some other point I stuck and used a walkthrough to see what to do, and it said to locate a thing in a room, and it said where, and I still couldn't find it, until I saw a tiny light that was supposed to attract attention to the thing. So success, much triumph. So if you're looking for new experience, and would forgive the virtual unplayability for it, then give it a go. If not, go play some DND and shout spells at your friends. It's much more fun anyway.			"

												It is a nice concept and I really would have loved to play it but there occured the following situation:There was a puzzle at the start with an eye which I have to approach and then look at it, which I concluded from a hitn within the game and actually this is a nice idea for a puzzle. The problem just was that it didn't work. In a guide there is mentioned that I have to do that: Walk to the eye, then look at it, then there follows a cut scene. It worked after around 20 attempts.The problem I have here is that the idea of that puzzle is nice, but if you get to figure out the correct solution and the event that should follow just doesn't trigger reliably then this is game breaking for me.

												Total waste of money even though it 60% off atm, i have a very good mic (blue yeti) still the spells activate about 60% of the time. (It only works when i mock the accent of the girl reading them)  There's no auto save, just save points, meaning that if you die you'll have to do a whole load of♥♥♥♥♥♥over again, which really sucks because there's parcour involved and the game doesn't really help you with with that, considering it's really messy and don't really explain anything or guide you anywhere. If they worked half as much with the game as they did with the graphics it might have been a decent game, and every time you want to change something in the settings you have to restart the game, if you haven't gotten to a save point before changing settings, enjoy watching the unnecessarily long cut scene at the start of the game over and over again, because you cannot skip it. And you can only change one thing in the settings at a time before you have to restart.Would not recommend this game to anyone, unless i really hated them and wanted them to waste their money.Sincerely, eat a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Early Access Review
								I find it really hard NOT to reccomend this game, because its central mechanic, using your voice to use magic, just works SO WELL! The problem is, as far as I've gotten, I've spent the last four hours in the same damn area, with the same two dull spells, because there are almost no clues about where you're supposed to go in a small mess of samey underground tunnels. You'll go one way and find a dead end, go another way and find a puzzle that you may or may not be able to complete, and go yet another way and find a thing you should be able to interact with but can't for... some reason?The reason I spent four hours on it was because I love using the magic so much that I want to push through and see the rest of the game, but I can't reccomend the game until the rest of it is fixed.Also there's no save feature, and the game can crash randomely on you, but that doesn't much matter when you can't make any progress.Edit: Alright, so after looking online for a few hours, I figured out that when you get to the huge eye temple thing, you have to stand outside of the room it's in, look down at the ground, navigate into the room, look up at the shrine, and hold E, all of which was vaugely hinted at by a plaque in the Mush-room. After a few seconds, you are teleported to the realm of Veritas, who gives you a new power. Unfortunately, now I am stuck again, because the game gave me no more hints on where to go, or what to do, and now I'm worried I'm going to have to do that on every eye in the building. This is less of a review than a cry for help at this point. Anyone?			"

								The spell system is a good concept, but whoever designed the ""riddles"" is an idiot. There's a difference between hard to solve but satisfying riddles (see Antichamber), and needlessly specific/obtuse ""riddles"" that make you feel LESS satisfied after ""solving"" them (this game).I recommend not buying unless you enjoy just reading a walkthrough to play every step (And there isn't even a walkthrough at this point).

												Don't recommend, it's definitely a good game though. I really enjoy casting spells by my own vocie. However I hate puzzle games, not metion the terrible guidance (There is almost no guidance) . The locations of checkpoints are even worse. You played for mintues and died by accident then you restarted. I hate this kind of setting. There are some puzzles that are just too hard to be worked out. If you just want to enjoy the magic and cast spells to have combats, don't buy this game, Try something else.			"

												In Verbis Vertus manages to make a compelling puzzle, adventure game with a great working voice mechanic.So I've played about an hour of In Verbis Vertis and it was so well done.You learn spells as you play that are cast by speaking them! This game completely hinges on the mechnic working. I didn't have any real problems with it. It works so well it makes me wish more games did something like this. Think Skyrim where you can yell your Dragon Shouts (I'm sure there's a mod for this)!It's a great looking game, with challenging puzzles and a mechanic that makes it worth playing.This is a hard game to really descibe since much of it is the voice spell casting. So you should check out my first look below. It'll give a good idea of how well the mechanic works. I think I only had to resay a spell maybe twice?

												Okay, so I'm just gonna get straight to the point for those TL;DR people.Rating: 11/10For those who enjoy taking the time to read why, here's why.NegativeThe story isn't clear if you don't like to sit down and take the time to read the journal logs. The backstory is unclear, and the reason of ""why"" fades quickly. Why you? Why are you doing this and risking your life for this? This is cleared up a little bit by reading absolutely everything and understanding it. Though the seemingly endless puzzles is basically what I get from playing it.PostiveThe unclear instructions to the puzzles get on my good side, and here's why. I absolutely love puzzles which seem impossible and you literally have answers to the puzzle in different rooms, or hidden somewhere in the room you're in. The original Zelda games did this, the original Metroid games did this. Nowadays, there are map markers and waypoints telling you where to go next, and that's too easy. Annoyingly easy. This game goes back and touches my memories of being forced to pay attention to the game, otherwise get stuck for hours. Even when I'm not playing the game, I'll go back and try to figure out the puzzle I'm stuck on in my head.(If you pay attention and read everything) The story is probably one of the best stories I've ever experienced. Though the backstory is a little shaky, you start to feel like you are the character you are playing. It's so immersive, it makes you feel like you're actually a part of the game.The voice recognition is phenominal. I know some people on here are giving poor reviews for the voice recognition, but they are probably using $10 microphones to play. The game can't hear you if your microphone is cheap, as any voice recognition works. But anyway, after playing the game for 15+ hours, then try to use Siri, I got to realize just how good the voice recognition is. I have a $60 microphone I picked up off of Amazon, and the recording quality is better than needed. My experience with the voice recognition only messed up maybe five times throughout my current playthrough, and it was probably my fault for mispronouncing the spell. Every other time is the right spell, but wrong situational requirements ( like trying to teleport but the cursor is aimed at a location it cannot place you, or trying to heal without standing in water).The combat is actually intimidating. Enemies terrify me, because in the heat of the moment, I cannot remember the spells required to defeat them. This sets a boundary between me and my goal, and those are always the most fun to complete and accomplish (however irritating people say it is).Exploration is rewarded. I have always loved games like this. Halo has skulls to find if you explored and ignored the objective, Skyrim has... well, everything. This game has extra information to read or a creepy backstory about a particular room you're in, or possibly a place to heal hidden away somewhere when you desperately need it! Things easily missed are things that fascinate me, like in the room where you aquire teleport, there are statues that look at you and track you when you do not look at them. This game has a lot of those moments.Basically everything about this game has either amazed, scared, intimidated, or fascinated me. This is a rare moment for me to say this about something, but I wish I could forget everything about this game so I can play it for the first time again. Do I recommend this game? Heck yeah I do! Pick up a $30+ microphone and please play this game. This game is revolutionary and widens the gaming universe of what people can do. Owning a copy of this game is absolutely phenominal and makes me feel good. This was absolutely the best purchase I've made in years. It's the perfect mixture of difficult, challenging, intimidating, and interesting. It's absolutely gorgeous.So my rating for this game exceeds the maximum because it has exceeded my expectations. By a lot. 11/10			"

												Even though this game is not for me, it is still a good game. I love the idea of having to speak a spell rather than just hitting a hotkey or clicking an icon. There is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning, but once I got the hang of it, it's all good.Where things fell apart for me was the OVER ABUNDANCE of puzzle/platforming. Jump here, jump there, miss the jump and start over. I quit playing out of sheer frustration. If I can't even get throught the beginner area....... I realize other people love this kind of thing. I don't. I just like to kill stuff. I'm glad I tried it out. Personally, I won't play it again.			"

												Playing with voice recognition is not entirely new thing in games, but this puzzle adventure with action elements takes voice recognition mechanics to the absolutely new level, making it a main and the best feature of the game and not just a pleasant addition that could be ignored if you don't have a microphone.Game's plot is another thing as it presents a bleak and a standart story where the main and the only reason for the protagonist's quest is a dead woman. Yes, again.Also, somewhere around the middle of the game the puzzles become confusing and pretty difficult, so the initial fun starts to fade away.Nice game to play with your voice, mediocre at everything else.

I am still trying to get it to function decently, but nothing I try appears to be working.

												When I saw the concept for this game, I knew I had to play it. Cast spells by actually speaking them? Count me in!In Verbis Virtus is a puzzle platformer with some combat. Solve the puzzles and destroy enemies with your growing repertoire of spells to further explore and learn the lore behind the mysterious ruins. I appreciate a good puzzle platformer, and In Verbis Virtus doesn't disappoint. The spells being activated by voice does a great job of making you feel like a Wizard, and it is satisfying to finally solve a puzzle that has left you stumped, or to learn a new spell that changes a dynamic of the game or allows you to solve a puzzle you previously couldn't clear. The game does a decent job of having you use a spell often enough after learning it that you'll remember it, but you can always look back at the in-game journal to remember any incantations that have fled your mind.A slight hiccup I had with the game: when I was preparing to play, I checked the in-game Microphone Settings menu, which seemed to suggest that my microphone was far too soft. It said my voice should fill the bar halfway, but I was only getting about a tenth, if that. However, I started the game anyway, and found that I typically have no problem activating the spells I desire without raising my voice. I occasionally find it hard to cast when I'm in a tight spot, but I'll chalk that down to my nerves messing up my incantation.Overall, I definitely recommend this game to fans of puzzle platformers and/or Wizards. Feel like a Wizard, as you Puzzle Platform. In Verbis Virtus.			"

												Okay, I'm not terribly far into the game...but let me say that so far, I'm loving it.  Yes, it could use a little more ""action,"" I think, but a game where you are literally required to speak the spells you wish to cast has to balance that necessity SOMEHOW.  I cannot imagine trying to fight enemies and having to constantly repeat a spell to cast it.  The amount of time you'd waste and focus you'd lose would suck.  Maybe further into the game this will become an issue...but for now, it works.  Sure, the game is mostly exploration and puzzles, but that's okay.  If those types of games aren't your speed, don't pick this one up.  It's that simple.  However, if you DO like puzzle games, and you enjoy exploration, then honestly, this is kind of a must-have.  Yeah, your roommates/spouses/families might think you're nutballs for talking to your computer, but there is something IMMENSELY satisfying about speaking a spell and watching the effects take place.  And seriously?  Play with the in-game language.  Don't dumb it down.  You're a freaking sorcerer, for Pete's sake.  OWN THAT.All in all, yes, I recommend the game wholeheartedly.  I will say this; combat, when it comes, isn't necessarily easy, and you DO have to stay on your toes...that said, the people complaining that there's no health regen have apparently never killed an enemy--enemies drop orbs that help replenish your health.  So...fight, and you live.  Run/avoid, and you die.  Plain and simple.Play this.  Honestly, it's a blast.			"

												Literally so much fun. You're mind will be tested with these seemingly impossible puzzles. But being able to cast spells with your voice is the absolute best, just make sure you're not saying them wrong like i do all the time. As you progress the names of the spells get harder and more complicated and actually have sub spells attatched to them. This is becoming a really fun game and i hope they add tons more to it! I give it a 5/5 and highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to be a mage!watch me play it on twitch.tv/stoidibro "

												Quite an entertaining little game. I enjoy the voice command system for the break from normalcy.If you don't like the concept, you'll probably hate the game since you won't go more than a few seconds without using a chant.Couple things to note:1. The level design is a bit poor. I provide three examples of many:- Journal says stay out of the dark, you must walk around two pitch-black corners to find the light power. - The light ray power room - it allows you to exit the way you came in but you're supposed to continue behind the carving.- In one instance it's intentional (i.e, you read a journal entry telling you that you've lost your way, then it kills you for slipping by a door you can open and it's literally right infront of you to run through). It's poor design, not a clever trick.2. Voice recog is fine - you can train it in the menu if you cannot into proper english and as long as YOU are consistent, it will be too. I've had a little trouble with the fire spell casting the light ray sometimes, but when i speak a bit louder it's fine, so i blame myself for that.3. Thanks for the demon when i have no offensive spells, jerks. You could at least play the Benny Hill theme while i work out the puzzle.			"

												It's a very enjoyable game. It's fun, entertaining, and the fact that you cast the spells ith your own voice is creative and amazing. The graphics are nice, too. However, there is no map. There is no objective. It pretty much juts drops you somewhere and lets you find your own way, which is really hard and difficult when everything looks the same. But once you know what you're doing (I suggest walkthroughs) it's a fun, enjoyable, and you can really take in the beautiful scenery. But if you get frustrated when it doesn't tell you to go and you roam around for an hour, then don't play it. Also, I had some problems with the voice recognition.7/10			"

												I hate to review a game that I've barely played, but when I've barely played because I literally cannot play the game due to extreme performance issues on a pretty good gaming laptop that can run The Witcher 3 and Battlfield 4 decently well, amongst other demanding games.The fact that I am getting less than 10 FPS on the lowest settings is disappointing, because I was really excited to try this game and the voice spellcasting system. I am still trying to get it to function decently, but nothing I try appears to be working. Sorry to the devs, this game has an amazing concept and I want to love it, but if I can't play it then I can't possibly enjoy it, much less recommend it to others.			"

												Okay, so I'm just gonna get straight to the point for those TL;DR people.Rating: 11/10For those who enjoy taking the time to read why, here's why.NegativeThe story isn't clear if you don't like to sit down and take the time to read the journal logs. The backstory is unclear, and the reason of ""why"" fades quickly. Why you? Why are you doing this and risking your life for this? This is cleared up a little bit by reading absolutely everything and understanding it. Though the seemingly endless puzzles is basically what I get from playing it.PostiveThe unclear instructions to the puzzles get on my good side, and here's why. I absolutely love puzzles which seem impossible and you literally have answers to the puzzle in different rooms, or hidden somewhere in the room you're in. The original Zelda games did this, the original Metroid games did this. Nowadays, there are map markers and waypoints telling you where to go next, and that's too easy. Annoyingly easy. This game goes back and touches my memories of being forced to pay attention to the game, otherwise get stuck for hours. Even when I'm not playing the game, I'll go back and try to figure out the puzzle I'm stuck on in my head.(If you pay attention and read everything) The story is probably one of the best stories I've ever experienced. Though the backstory is a little shaky, you start to feel like you are the character you are playing. It's so immersive, it makes you feel like you're actually a part of the game.The voice recognition is phenominal. I know some people on here are giving poor reviews for the voice recognition, but they are probably using $10 microphones to play. The game can't hear you if your microphone is cheap, as any voice recognition works. But anyway, after playing the game for 15+ hours, then try to use Siri, I got to realize just how good the voice recognition is. I have a $60 microphone I picked up off of Amazon, and the recording quality is better than needed. My experience with the voice recognition only messed up maybe five times throughout my current playthrough, and it was probably my fault for mispronouncing the spell. Every other time is the right spell, but wrong situational requirements ( like trying to teleport but the cursor is aimed at a location it cannot place you, or trying to heal without standing in water).The combat is actually intimidating. Enemies terrify me, because in the heat of the moment, I cannot remember the spells required to defeat them. This sets a boundary between me and my goal, and those are always the most fun to complete and accomplish (however irritating people say it is).Exploration is rewarded. I have always loved games like this. Halo has skulls to find if you explored and ignored the objective, Skyrim has... well, everything. This game has extra information to read or a creepy backstory about a particular room you're in, or possibly a place to heal hidden away somewhere when you desperately need it! Things easily missed are things that fascinate me, like in the room where you aquire teleport, there are statues that look at you and track you when you do not look at them. This game has a lot of those moments.Basically everything about this game has either amazed, scared, intimidated, or fascinated me. This is a rare moment for me to say this about something, but I wish I could forget everything about this game so I can play it for the first time again. Do I recommend this game? Heck yeah I do! Pick up a $30+ microphone and please play this game. This game is revolutionary and widens the gaming universe of what people can do. Owning a copy of this game is absolutely phenominal and makes me feel good. This was absolutely the best purchase I've made in years. It's the perfect mixture of difficult, challenging, intimidating, and interesting. It's absolutely gorgeous.So my rating for this game exceeds the maximum because it has exceeded my expectations. By a lot. 11/10			"

												I do not recomend this game for 2 resons  it is an experimental game  voice recogniton does not allways work  full discloshure here i did not play it to the end and had to pruchase a micrphone to play it .   I got frustrated at the boss battle at the end of chapter one with the looping sound and videoboss is called winged glory  i beleve .  I strongly suspect the the  creators have put in some type of quick time event .  quick time events for those of you who dont know  also calld  press x or die events .    Are  in a game where  you have to press  a  button  or  a  set of buttons  in a certian seqence in order for something to happen . usually killing a boss  If you have any  sort of god mode cheat  it does not matter  the boss will just continue its seqence untill you press the preprogramed buttons at the corect  time usually very quickley the graphics are nice  but that dificult boss battle at the end of chaper 1  made me quite playing  If you know what the game space  invaders is just google it   Now imagine every time you had to  fire a shot at the space invaders  in the space invaders game you had to push down the left button on your game controler an shout""load  lazer ray ""  then you had to  push down the left control a second time and   yell out"" fire shot .""  for each and every shot .  and you had to  yell for at least 6  min  in order to win the same  5 words over and over again   "" load lazer ray   push left controler  "" FIre shot ""  push left controler and so on . thats what this game is like   watch this video of a person playing to get an idea he has to yell at his computer  for a full  6 min

												Wow. Not at all what I expected but nevertheless very cool. I was expected more of a combat-centric, Elder Scrolls type game with the added specialness of using your microphone to cast magic on-the-fly. Not at all accurate.In this game, you have no weapons, no items, no equipment or inventory of any kind. You have a journal and a voice. You start out with zero magic. You know how to walk and jump. You soon learn how to make light, then how to make a beam of light, then... well I won't spoil it.In Verbis Virtus is a first-person puzzler. You use the magic you learn in the course of the game to solve puzzles and overcome physical obstacles. The language of magic in IVV is clever. Once you've learned a few spells, you start to figure out rudimentary meanings of individual words and that makes it easier to remember how to combine those words into magical phrases.I'd love to see something like this applied to a game like Magicka. I loved the idea of Magicka but remembering spell combinations and using the interface to cast on-the-fly was too much to hold in one brain all at once. If I could just say a combination of power words into my microphone, it would be much easier.But I digress. IVV is a good-looking game and fun. It's just challenging enough to keep me interested without being difficult enough to be frustrating. Some recent adventure games left you at screen three with no hints, making you google how to progress. Never even crossed my mind to google solutions for IVV. Having said that, I'm only about an hour in so maybe the puzzles get trickier.Bottom line: Very cool concept and well-executed. I'd love to see another game with voice-casting in a different sort of game. An Elder Scrolls sort of adventure or even something like Nox (anybody remember Nox?).			"

												Excellent game.The voice-command mechanic, while having the potential to be extremely gimmicky, was exceedingly well-implemented, and adds a level of immersion to the game that I typically associate with high-end VR interfaces.The story felt a bit brief, but the presentation was strong, and the puzzles are challenging enough to keep your attention engaged while you unravel what exactly is going on here.The graphics lack the dirt-in-your-eye photorealism of a 5-star title, but I don't think that this is a bad thing.  The main feature of this game was not supposed to be astonishing graphics (which we've had for long enough that there is nothing ""astonishing"" about them anymore anyway).What I would like is to see the voice-interaction mechanic from this game woven into more fantasy (and even SciFi) RPG type games.  With the recent release of consumer-grade VR headsets, this is the next logical step in PC Gaming.			"

Early Access Review
								I didn't play this for too long (yet), but it's promising until now. It's a bit (well not a bit... really) annoying that I can't get more than 15 FPS out of it even on lowest, even though my hardware - I think - should be enough even for highest:Intel Core i5 3337UnVidia GeForce GT 720M (yep, it's a laptop)I even lowered the resolution and everything is on the lowest possible. I think I should be able to run it fine. Anyway, the game seems really good, it really feels like being a wizard (I already learnt the first spell and I pronounced it multiple times successfully, and I felt like a boss), so I hope I can find a way to make that FPS be at least 25-30.

												As far as games that immerse you in your world, this is one of the most immersive I've ever seen. Have you ever heard of those langauge classes that drop you fully into learning by not speaking your own native language? This game does that with a completely made up language that you actually use via microphone to cast the spells you learn throughout the game. Via the microphone (which is absolutely required for this game). You'll find as you play this game that the puizzles can get very hard,a nd you WILL ragequit at least once or twice in your playthorugh.			"

												I do not recomend this game for 2 resons  it is an experimental game  voice recogniton does not allways work  full discloshure here i did not play it to the end and had to pruchase a micrphone to play it .   I got frustrated at the boss battle at the end of chapter one with the looping sound and videoboss is called winged glory  i beleve .  I strongly suspect the the  creators have put in some type of quick time event .  quick time events for those of you who dont know  also calld  press x or die events .    Are  in a game where  you have to press  a  button  or  a  set of buttons  in a certian seqence in order for something to happen . usually killing a boss  If you have any  sort of god mode cheat  it does not matter  the boss will just continue its seqence untill you press the preprogramed buttons at the corect  time usually very quickley the graphics are nice  but that dificult boss battle at the end of chaper 1  made me quite playing  If you know what the game space  invaders is just google it   Now imagine every time you had to  fire a shot at the space invaders  in the space invaders game you had to push down the left button on your game controler an shout""load  lazer ray ""  then you had to  push down the left control a second time and   yell out"" fire shot .""  for each and every shot .  and you had to  yell for at least 6  min  in order to win the same  5 words over and over again   "" load lazer ray   push left controler  "" FIre shot ""  push left controler and so on . thats what this game is like   watch this video of a person playing to get an idea he has to yell at his computer  for a full  6 min

												A really wonderful game!The fact that the spell casting system works with the actual voice of the player is a really cool feature, that all other games featuring magic content should consider adding! It adds a total new level of immersion to the game and challenges the player to memorize and use the right spell for each occasion. I'd really like to see that idea being used on more games like this in the future. The only downside I could find, is the fact that the developers did not emphasize that much on the combat system. It would be so cool to fight foes with spells you ""cast"" yourself!			"

												The gameplay is intense in my opinion. The atmosphere is set very good and it feels extremely satisfying to a person who lived within the Harry Potter and other magic fantasy books, to be ""casting"" your own spells.			"

												I found myself having a pretty grand time with this nifty game. It has so much mystique to it, and the mechanic of using your voice to activate spells in the game is fleshed out pretty well. After a while, I found out that, instead of the regular words for some spells, you can instead substitute other phrases that activate the same spell for some reason. For instance, there was a spell in the game that I learned is also activated by saying, ""John Cena."" I used that phrase instead so much, that I ended up completely forgetting the other phrase and just used John Cena. One time, I was in a panic and I tried to use that spell, so I ended up yelling out his name several times, and I can only hope my neighbors didn't hear it. They might actually invite me over to their WWE get-together, and just the mere thought of that makes me shudder in fear.Just buy the game, dude. It's a blast, and it has plenty of content.			"

												The novelty of the voice commands wore off after half an hour, after that (especially in combat), it becomes downright frustrating.  Not only is the voice magic frustrating, the entire game design is (levels require you to back track when it isn't clear you have to, some puzzles have to be solved in ways that the game doesn't pick up on which leads to the conclusion it's broke, areas in levels appear to be designed expressly to♥♥♥♥♥♥the player off in as many ways as possible, and so on).  The only thing good I have to say about the game is the art.  Someone spent a lot of time modeling unique stuff for this game.  Unfortunately they didn't spend as much time play testing and polishing the voice system (or implementing an alternative).			"

												Indomitus Games came up with a really cool and unique concept for this game - a game where your voice is your biggest ally.  You speak commands and spells to shape the outcome of your experience!The graphics in this game are breathtaking, and the pacing is nice and smooth!  The story is told in a way that keeps you engaged and intrigued as to how things unfold.  The soundtrack score is very atmospheric, and keeps you in the mood and in the moment.The only downside I encountered with this game is that if the game does not recognize your microphone,  you'll have to do some troubleshooting, but there is a FAQ in the forums that helps with that.  Once it works, it works very well.			"

												Good puzzle game, the voice mechanics with the fantasy spells are fun for a while, until it comes to a point when I cant manage them anymore, and had to switch to english commands (I have terrible memory and can only hold 3-4 of them at a time) I kinda wish more words on the spells repeated so they would be easier to remember.The parts when you fight enemies are the weakest part of it, but... ok they're terrible. The the lore messages you can find are fun to read.For the price it runs for these days, its a decent pick, and can be a a lot of fun. Pro tip: cast the spells with an evil wizard voice ;D			"

												I had an issue with the game and my bluetooth headset where the moment I enter into the mic setting from the menu, all the sound just ended. Had to reinstall game to fix but I could simply break it again by entering the mic seting. As my $200 sony headset was my only mic I could not play he game. It seems really fun though so I'll recomend to other players. Steam refund seems rather simple to use just in case...			"
