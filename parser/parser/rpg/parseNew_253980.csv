												OK, first of all, this game is not really an RPG. I know it reads up there on the genre description here on Steam, but this game is more of an Action RPG then anything else.So, basically you enter this world where humans are fighting against demons and vice versa. In your first playthrough you start playing on the Light campaign, as one of the humans. The controls function like any other RPG, except here the combat is more fast paced. You don't go around and do quests and there is very little dialog. What you do is basically kill everything you see, and collect as much gold as you can. With the gold you collect, you can equip better weapons, armor, and bring more potions with you each time. There are quite a lot of races/classes that you gain as you play (some by completing levels, and some are special classes that you get after collecting all of the gold in the game).The game itself is fun. It's obviously not a modern game. The graphics are dated, but they're not ugly or anything. The soundtrack is lacking, with only a few songs that you keep hearing over and over, but hey, at least they're good. The gameplay is simple and intuitive, but I have to warn you that the hitboxes are very small, and the game can be a bit difficult sometimes. I finished the game on medium but even then I had to replay most levels quite a few times. After you finish the game for the first time, you can play the game now on the Dark campaign and get a different perspective.Even though the game is from 2003 its It puts a lot of new games to shame. It's challenging, fun, and has a lot of content. I recommend.			"

												The adware has been gone for a long time now, so don't worry about that. Disregard anyone's negative review if it is soley based upon adware. Okay now for the real review, Game: EnclaveDev: StarBreezePublisher: TopwarePROS: Complex level design 2 campaigns (Light and Dark)Multiple character choices (classes if you will)Optional first person modeScripted EventsMultiple different kinds of enemiesChallenging but not too challenging (from 1-10 (1 being some rediculously easy kids game and 10 being DARKS SOULS) I'd say about a 5)Headshots insta-kill (enemies without helms, although most of those guys still die from a headshot) (you'd understand why this is a pro if you have played Skyrim)Different damage for different body parts, hell, you can even hit them in the weapon if you get lucky.Pricepoint (I mean seriously, only $5)___________________________________________________________________________________So-Sos:SoundsMusicVoice acting________________________________________________________________________________Cons: Topware's main RPG problem, the story isn't great.

Enclave is a fantasy action-adventure game. The rift that separated the Enclave of Magic from the Outlands is slowly closing, and heroes emerge from both sides, either to defend or conquer the Enclave.Pros: The game offers two campaigns, first the light campaign where you defend the Enclave from the invaders, and then the dark campaign where you are a minion seeking the glory of conquest. As the story progresses, you find or unlock additional equipment and up to six characters (per campaign) to play as. At the start of each chapters, you get to pick your character and equipment, limited by how much gold you found in each mission. For the most part, you can backtrack as much as you want for each missions, and replay any of them at any time if you missed out on some gold and want to try to do better (allowing you to select more equipment).Cons: I don't know why this was tagged as an RPG on Steam, 'cause it sure isn't: you have no stats, no upgrades, no character interaction or dialog choice. You don't even really purchase and manage an inventory, gold serves as ""points"" that determine how much equipment you can bring in a mission, being able to swap out at full value any item in between chapters. It is a Hack & Slash in the most basic fashion, battles consisting merely of slashing in the wind, only knowing whether you hit anything if damage numbers appear, while the AI is monstrously bad (enemies just jiggle about, only occasionally chasing assuming you don't break line of sight, like passing behind a chair). Voice acting is horrible, the story is rather poor, character progression is absent, and having up-to-date resolution doesn't save the graphics that have aged so badly that most 3D Fantasy early access indie titles are doing better than this blocky 2-Gen-Old world. Verdict: ★☆☆☆☆ - May it rot in your backlogIt's not horrible, but it is pretty bad by today's standards. I simply cannot get myself invested enough to ever play it again, leave alone complete a playthrough of even the first campaign. Maybe once upon a time it was considered a good game, but I can't see how I could recommend it to anyone, even for the low price.P.S.: At the time of my review, there were dozens of Steam Recommendations that were fake, just to raise the score. They all said ""gg"" or ""ggg"" with usernames starting by X or ending by XYZ and all had the same account picture (once my review topped the store page for a few months, the fake reviews were removed or altered to make them more subtle). Seriously, dev/fans? You sank so low that you wanted to ""cheat"" the Steam score to make more sales?—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Its already says award-winning in the description. This game is insanely good considering it was made in 2002, you can choose to play as a mage, archer, engineer and many more classes that can be unlocked as you progress! You can even unlock various arenas. A nice long campaign with a variety of puzzles, parkour, and of course lots and lots of combat. The missions are diverse, consisting of escorts, boss battles, and just fighting your way through the beautifully rendered levels. :D Just look at the reviews on Enclave's store page			"

												Let me start by saying, I REALLY tried to like this game. And at first? I loved it. Enclave is an action-based RPG where you hack and slash your way through levels (depending on your class) all while collecting gold so you can afford better gear at a shop you visit in-between levels. Collecting gold is HUGELY important. In later levels archers are OP with their damage and warriors are brutally tanky. You NEED to collect gold otherwise you stand no chance. Let me also state one thing. THERE IS NO ADWARE IN THIS GAME. THESE MANY REVIEWS THAT SAY SO ARE OLD, AND HAVE NOT CHANGED EVEN THOUGH THE ADWARE HAS BEEN REMOVED. So what does this game have going for it?+From 2002 I never would have expected these kinds of graphics. +The soundtrack is amazing. +And the sound effects aren't too shabby either. +The level design and placement of enemies is genius.+The destruction in this game is fantastic. In buildings during sieges the roof can fall on your head, fatally damaging you. You can slash the beam of a wooden watch tower and bring it falling to the ground. Crates can be broken into flying pieces by explosives that are essentially flying wooden weapons.UNFORTUNATELY.-The story is really...bland. A 3 year old that watched lord of the rings could have thought this story up.-The enemies are very generic and repetitive. Again, a 3 year old that watched lord of the rings could have created these extremely generic characters.-The voice acting is mediocre. -The AI is nonsensical is how it acts. Enemies are jumping and breakdancing all over the place while you're supposed to be in a serious fight.-The combat. The core element of ARPGs, the COMBAT. Is the worst combat I have ever seen in an RPG in my entire life.  Ranged weapons work around a little dot you see in the center of your screen. Place it over an enemy and shoot, and you hit. Miss by an inch and you miss completely. It's pathetic. The melee combat is even worse. You just spam left mouse click to swing a sword aimlessly, missing tiny enemies completely unless you can get down to their level most of the time. Your shield is basically useless because there's a delay between raising it and lowering it that you could have used to get attacks in, that your enemies WILL use to attack you. The swordplay is also very unresponsive. I mouse click twice and suddenly my character is doing a 4-move sword swinging fiasco while I'm right clicking and trying to raise my shield. So an enemy pummels me while my character is having fun being some kind of sword dancer.Even if you get this for free like I did I would not recommend playing it. Maybe this kind of gameplay was good in an ARPG once, but at the same time, RUNESCAPE had better combat than this. So I could never condone a game that flops on its main element so badly. STAY AWAY.			"

												I suppose its worth a try, but do play on Easy difficulty the first time, because you will find yourself dieing quite a bit, even on Easy mode. Its a game that doesn't take combat lightly, especially against certain enemies. You need to use your shield, as well as avoiding enemy attacks to maximize your combat efficiency and save on health.The game is also kind of a collect-a-thon in where each level has treasure for you to find hidden throughout, you also get a mandatory sum of gold after each level. However, if you get more gold hidden in the levels, you can equip yourself with better gear and more potions at a time at the start of each level. The way you spend money is well, you don't exactly spend it like you normally would. Everything costs a certain amount and you will always have the amount of gold prior to ""spending"" it on your loadout. So the more gold you have, the better gear you can have, and more potions too.The combat is a bit lackluster, in fact the hitboxes seem damn near god awful and random. Also the damage you deal seems vague at best, its random seeming sometimes as well. I guess I can't quite nail the pattern down. Ever.The levels work on a checkpoint system and there is no quicksaving/quickloading. So if you die before a checkpoint, you're screwed, and have to start the level over again. Also I'm not sure if you can use the checkpoints more than once each or not, never died more than once per checkpoint. Well its the type of checkpoint where it teleports you to the point with full health, but your progress is not altered.Still, at that price its worth a play, even if it can only keep your attention long enough to play the Light Campaign. Oh yeah, theres two campaigns. Light Campaign, and the Dark Campaign, available after you beat the Light Campaign.			"

												Enclave is a gem of a game from the original X-Box era back in 2003. Its a third or first person medieval fantasy hack and slash with engaging combat and exceptional environments. For the rogue in all us there is a dark campaign where you play as several evil classes like assassin, berserker, lich and sorceress to name a few. If there are any good hearts out there, you also have the light campaign with their human counterpart classes such as knight, huntress, druid, wizard and half-ling. Each campaign lasted me a fun and joyous seven hours. At the start of each level you select your class and assign their equipment from the money you have. Nothing is permanently bought, so if you want expensive armor and a weak weapon with a few potions, you can do it or if zero potions, expensive weapons and armor is more to your liking go for it. The money is never spent, just assigned. These classes, play styles and different equipment go a long way to making each play through different, even if its your twentieth time on a level.So why is this game so good? Let's start with the controls and movement. While this was an X-Box game, there doesn't seem to be controller support. You're stuck with your keyboard and rebindable keys. Its more than that though, your character seems to have a good sense of movement. You'll climb ladders, duck to crawl through tunnels, jump up boxes and over collapsed bridges. Even jump from rooftop to rooftop. Each class has its own speed. For the most part the heroes of the light campaign feel slower than their dark counterparts. Knights and berserkers move slow, while half-lings and goblins are the fastest. There is no run button, heroic classes are so slow that it really feels like you need to fight.Getting there is half the fun, but along the way you'll of course find enemies and you've got the fantastic combat to take them out with. I can't call it deep combat so much as its fun. Each class can have a melee weapon that you really just mouse click bash to flail it around. Each weapon has its own strength, speed and range. Others have enchantments that will light enemies on fire. Most classes also have a shield too. Hold the right mouse button to have your shield up to block arrows and wow you will be blocking a lot of arrows. With some enemies that can fire a shotgun of bolts at you, it becomes mandatory if you're going to survive at close range.To add some depth there, each time your shield gets bashed, that will knock it away for a split second leaving you open to attack. So if two archers time it just right they can break through your defenses. This goes for enemies with shields too. They're just like you, when their shield is up, you need to knock it down to hurt them.Wizards, sorceresses, lich and druids have magic. Each magician has a magic meter that refills over time.  So if you run out from fire balling an enemy, you've got to wait, where the enemies see your weakness and will rush at you. You can equip two spell staffs, so you have a variety there in the level. A lot of the spells make the game easier. Plenty of them seek out enemies and turn in the air to hit them. Instead of a shield, the right mouse will raise a force field, but I never used it that much, since mages are such long range classes. Some staffs also have a summoning ability to raise an ally to help you. Oh and the spells can't get blocked. You still take damage.Form there, non magic classes can also have a long range bow or cross bow. Even the knight and grenaders can use them, but you need to equip them at the start of each level, you can't just find one. I've gotta say crossbows and bows are far too difficult to accurately hit anything. Sure melee enemies running to you will take arrows til they're dead. Its shooting the other archers that becomes incredibly difficult. They can dodge arrows just as good as any human player. Its difficult to accurately hit them, so to compensate, there are several different tricks. You can load several bolts into a bow at once by pressing the right mouse button. Then release so one of them will hit its target if not all to instantly kill a close enemy. There are also fire bolts that will ignite enemies or the ground on fire. The abilities add some interesting facets to the game when you're forced to play as an assassin for the dark campaign's original character.You have a quick health potion button that really plays into combat, because you need to chug the potion. Its not just instant energy, so if you're getting beaten to death, you need to hide and chug the potion before you can attack or defend again. It adds a lot to the combat and gives the enemies a better chance.You'll need to unlock the classes as you go through the game. This means you'll be rescuing your comrades in their levels. With them freed, they'll temporarily aide you, fight shoulder to shoulder with you and guide you to the next part. They can die too, but as long as you've saved them and complete the level, they're unlocked.Enclave puts you into incredible environments and assets are not used from level to level. So each level has a completely different look and feel. Crypts, tombs, caves, castles, lava caverns, shadowy towns, human towns. There is a ton of variety here. Between the light and dark campaigns only a few levels get reused among the two. Even if it is a shared level, you start from the opposite end of it, to make it feel fresher. The levels feel like they're just the right amount of time. Each level has plenty of exploration and a lot of levels feel open enough where you can look around without feeling like you're forced down a corridor. They never overstay their welcome. I never think of it as a chore, because there's always something new and beautiful to see around every corner.The pre rendered cut scenes and menus are pretty dated with low resolution quality so they don't look as gorgeous as the game itself. Not that the game itself is high definition, but over a decade later it still looks amazing. The only thing lacking are the ground textures. Grassy fields could have used Oblivion style grass, but for a game that came out when Morrowind did it still looks better than its contemporaries.Its not all roses and sunshine in this dark enchanted world. The game goes from a fun treat and knuckles down on you in later levels to beat you down. I appreciated the challenge, even if some levels took me five minutes to make it across a bridge. If you die, you need to restart the level. To balance it out, if you can make it to a checkpoint, you will respawn there when you die. There's just one catch. You need enough gold collected in that level to respawn. I'm thankful for the checkpoints even at a cost. Having each revive cost gold gives you incentive to return to each level after you complete it. Oh by the way, you only keep the gold if you beat the level. So if you died ten times, you spent one hundred gold, so you can return to the level, not die and get an extra hundred gold to spend. Assuming you collected what you had before. That's the beauty with all the exploration, you can find things or miss them.You won't get limited to combat, there are some puzzles and a few brief, yet fun turret sections that don't tie you to the turrets. The bosses are giant and feel engaging without being overwhelming or frustrating. A giant dragon, a huge lava monster and the mega evil boss has you shooting its hanging heart. If that wasn't enough for you, there are unlockable mini games that are actually fun. You'll find maps in levels that will unlock games like a survival mode and a cool turret gallery.The music is also something to take note of. Its great and really fits the medieval epicness of the game. Its beautiful and touching, but with big and bold moments too.Once again, this is just a gem of a game that I would have paid full price for when it was $50. Thanks to someone from Sweden for giving me the game!			"

Nice visuals and sound are trying to cover the remaining gaps.The game has more than 10 years, although it is at pretty good technical level. When the game starts, greets us a little rather dynamic and impressive intro, but which fulfills its role as it should be - give the stories being pretext for threshing, which is to take place.  After this introduction, we have to choose side for which we'll be fighting for - good or evil. I chose the path of light (I'm such a thoroughly good man). Interestingly, this choice is important. Because each party has a completely different missions and different course of the game. It is worth to finish the game twice (that's what I did).After passing each stage we get access to new characters. Accessories, or rather equipment, does not impress anything in particular more fasting RPG fans. Besides, the Enclave is not rpg, although it may give such an impression, especially the world of game, full of mages, orcs and dragons. But returning to the equipment. We have swords, axes, hammers, but also bows or crossbows, ideally proven in the battles at distance. There is also something for the defense - shields and armor.  Everything we gain as you progress in the game. As far as we can afford it ... After each mission in ""shop"" there are new, better, items, and to buy them, we must have enough gold. Installment system in the world Enclave unfortunately does not exist, so the only solution is to keep your eyes wide open. Gold is scattered throughout the stages - often in various nooks and burrows.As I said, the game was created a few years ago, but the graphic design looks passably well and still manages to attract the eyes to the screen without feeling disgust. Game menu looks impressive, being a foretaste of what awaits us in the game. Graphics look nothing less than more, as nicely. Textures are highly varied, and also flattering for a single pixel. Also, light effects and shadows have their charm. I must also mention about the interesting animation of monsters (large stock of movements). I have only caveat to NPC's faces. During expression in the cutscenes look like they had founded mask. The movable is only jaw, which gives quite unsightly visual effect. But the water ... the water looks beautiful. It is true that the whole persists to today's productions, but heck, this game is already on his neck showing its age! Soundtrack is another strong element of Enclave. The soundtrack is great, and the sound effects round out the rest.The game is based roughly on the exploration of stages, which generously dotted with monsters, gold and various necessary to complete the map objects. We have a whole range of enemies. Some may complain about the level of difficulty, because the monsters were waving the weapon incredibly fast and agile. You need to skillfully put tactic, otherwise death will take us quickly. I played at the level of medium, namely the middle, and I have to admit that the level of irritation pierced several times the national average.The combat system and the game itself falls moderately. The title is linear. Is it negative? I do not know, maybe, but for me not having any meaning. The combat system is extremely simple. Click the mouse and our soldier is attacking what he has in his hands. We will not experience any finesse. Attack, Defense, that's all.However, this game was able to catch me on a couple of good hours. Somehow I got this game for free. And I'm not sure if it's worth it for the moment these 6 euros. But do not hesitate to buy this game if it will be on promotion.			"

												This game is something else, truly. For starters it has beautiful graphics for it's time, it look wonderful and you can tell the developers worked really hard on them. The same goes for the weapon and shields, they are very nice to look at, and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you can buy that sword, axe, staff, that completely obliterates your enemies in 2-3 hits.Now, gameplay, the controls are very solid and quite easy to control. At times it feels the mouse is a tad slow when it comes moving around and viewing everything, but it's easy to adjust in the menu. Also, there is no delay in the buttons so it is very nice. The fighting is very unispired and makes combat feel more like a chore. After completing the main objective in the quest, towards the end of the game I just bolted out of there. No experience is gained whatsoever, so what's my incentive? Oh, that's right, gold!Gold, you must collect gold througout the campaign. Some which is hidden VERY well and is extremely UNFAIR to get. When I say unfair, I mean that in this game, there are VERY FEW checkpoints. And if you aim to 100% this, you are going to pull out  your hair. Thing about checkpoints is, if you happen to reach one, but die..you lose gold. And that means you have to start over on the level completely in order to get all gold. Note, you need gold if you want to 100% the guy, buy more items and also  unlock all the characters. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if they weren't in such ridiculous spots. Earlier I said the controls are spot on, which they are, but the way these pots of gold and jewels are placed, it's beyond ridiculous. Storyline, it was very meh. You don't connect the chracters at all and the cutscenes and whatnot are very short and semi-informative. I didn't really play it for the storyline, mainly nostalgic reasons. I played it previously on Xbox and just had to relive this games graphical beauties one more time.Overall, I do recommend this game. And give it a 6/10. The graphics are what really makes this game, but also the nice weapons you purchase as well. The combat is very so so and the story is..well it's a story. Fun game if you want to hack and slash, but that's all you're really getting out of it.			"

												A great title for RPG fans though keep in mind this isn't an open world or story-rich experience. There's no loot system here, it's mostly simple linear pathing over two seperate campaigns. You only deviate to find currency collectibles which carry over for the entire game, allowing you to purchase a selection of weapons and armor from a wide arsenal before each mission. That, combined with the ability to change your hero class is what keeps this game fresh and interesting. Combat is similar to Rune but sharper and more customisable - pretty reminiscent of the early 2000's but genuinely fun. Performance wise I've had no issues with Enclave. Actually I was surprised to see it has a decent options menu for such a dated game, which includes support for modern resolution scalings. As far as I'm concerned, Enclave is a damn fine game. Its biggest crime is a lackluster story. Edit: In closing I'd like to address negative feedback for Enclave which concerns an in-game advertisement. You will not be subjected to advertisements when booting Enclave as they no longer exist. It was unfortunately forced in from the new publisher, but has long since been removed.			"

												The Good:+ Given its age the graphics are pretty decent. Nothing spectacular but I was surprised how good it looked for such an old game+ Multiple characters to fit your own playstyle. The main element of this game is that you choose what kind of character you want, knight, hunter, druid, wizard etc collect gold in the levels and then outfit your favorite character with weapons and armor+28 levels between light and dark campaign. The Bad:-Game has no balance, some character are completely useless while others just destroy eveything, -level difficulty is all over the place, some levels are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥while others you will breeze through with no difficulty -the combat in the game is very basic, -The story is forgettable and serves only as an excuse to kill things Overall:6.5/10- If you can get the game cheap then go for it but currently I wouldn't really recommend it.

												Interesting game.  I enjoyed what I played of Enclave eventhough it's clearly dated by this point, but unforunately, I decided to uninstall the game and move on because of crash troubles.Enclave plays fairly well.  The controls are straight forward and not overly complicated.  It's easy to dive into it with a minimal tutorial.I wanted to keep playing it, but the game randomly crashes too often (windows 8.1).  You have to reload and start the last mission again, the in-mission checkpoints aren't save points, just start points if you die inside that particular mission.  I found a fix that tells you how to change a line in the config file from Direct3D to OpenGL.  This fix stabilizes Enclave quite a bit so that it doesn't crash quite as often, but it still crashes.  I found that your chances of crashing increase if you die and restart the mission, or die and load at a checkpoint.  Maybe someday I will revisit it and try to finish it, but due to the crash problems, I have to give Enclave a thumbs down.			"

												Kind of a fantasy third-person action, more of an arcade than classic RPG, which surprised me. Looks fine even between contemporary games with similar mechanics and settings (Fable is the first thing comes to mind, don't know why). Setting is a bit creepy, by the way - but it's a fantasy game, after all.Recommended, especially if you missed it when it was released, like it happened with me.			"

												An underrated game with beautiful narration and cutscenes. You will see that character voice acting is awful, that is partly because of this game's mediocre budget, it doesn't reflect the talent of the developers. If you take this game and consider that, it really is amazing because for what little the devs had to work with it came out being a fairly challenging, fun, and interesting game.The story was actually very unique, and I loved the cutscenes. I had this on Xbox a long time ago and enjoyed it then, and it's just as good now.This game isn't going to blow your mind but it is definitely entertaining, and they have TWO campaigns. I very rarely see games that let you play as the enemy, and this game came out at a time when that concept was almost never employed.I enjoyed the character customization, and the level design was pretty nice.The only downside is that due to low budget the voice acting is mediocre, and the new publishers are♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is a good game to spend a few hours on. Unlike the other people who reviewed this game, mine never opened any windows or anything, I use Adblock and AVG, and skip through the developer logos.			"

In anycase, if you're looking for a decent RPG that delivers an above average experience, Enclave should fit the bill quite well.Enclave isn't a clever game, nor is it an ambitious one...

You go around dungeons and by saving characters it adds them so you may play them in further dungeons.   The graphics are dated but still have moments of pure beauty.  There is not a whole lot to be said.  It is not the greatest game ever, but, it is definitely fun and playable.

												Enclave is a good game.Now, take my word for what it's worth because I am very, very much biased in favor of this game; I've completed it at least ten times on disc with another two since I purchased it on steam.But, in my opinion, the fact I like it enough to have played it this many times is something of a statement as to it's quality.The pros are easy to list:-Very intuitive.-Fast paced.-Hitboxes are very much what you'd expect.-Hitting someone with a melee weapon has the weight and impact you'd expect.-The way the missions are handled makes shooting for the 100% both very much doable and rewarding.-The paradox of ""But I might need it later"" never arises. You use what you need, when you need it, and it's bloody satisfying blasting a bunch of armored knights with a bomb.-No serious difficulty spikes; the game picks up the pace as you go along, not suddenly bombards you with something unreasonable you've never seen before.-Stealth works the way you'd expect.-Multiple weapon types that actually feel different and require different timings for their attacks to actually land. Each of the several staves also has a very different main and secondary attack.-Has a great cast of diverse characters for you to play as that actually have an impact on their playstyle; each of them has different equipment that they can use, different size hitboxes, different health and damage modifiers.-Locational damage is very accurate and makes aiming for the most vulnerable part of your enemy a good way of removing them. This mechanic works well with the fact different characters have different armor types for different sections of their body, depending on armor class.The cons are also easy to list:-It's too short.-Sound design. On multiple occasions I found the voice lines got sped up, raised in pitch or what-have-you.-It's duration leaves something to be desired.-Soundtrack is not that great.-It's very, very brief.-It's pretty old, and hasn't aged too well in most areas.-It's gone too quickly.-The story is stupid. Not even funny stupid, just flat out stupid. It's not offensive or anything, though.-And yeah, it's length is insufficient.-By now I'm so proficient in this game I can complete any mission of either campaign with just the starting bow and arrows, armorless and without consuming health potions. Send help.-It's clock-time isn't all too great.Yes, you could say I'm crazy, but I'd be far too busy hearing you over the dying grunts of an orc being shot in the neck by my magical arrows to notice.Far as I'm concernd, 10/10. Would shoot hundreds of enemies in the neck with magical armor-piercing arrows again.-Sleepy			"

												One of the jankiest, most unbalanced games I've played - I love it. The graphics hold up fairly well and the game supports modern widescreen resolutions (although the menus are all pre-rendered to 4:3). The game does seem to crash without warning sometimes, but not even that was enough to prevent me from enjoying everything this game had to offer. Completing both campaigns took me about eight hours.The combat is very basic, but I found it oddly satisfying. Just hit things until they die. In each level you can choose from a selection of characters and then outfit them with various weapons, magic and equipment using the gold you find scattered in each area. Finding the most overpowered loadouts and putting them to use is a lot of fun and makes the difficulty of the later levels a lot more tolerable.The story and setting of Enclave certainly could be described as 'generic western fantasy,' but I did find some of the visual designs to be quite interesting and original. The music is fairly standard stuff, but is effective. I would recommend this game if you like old PC fantasy games and can put up with the possiblity of crashes.			"

												Most of my experience with Enclave has been via the DotEmu and original Xbox releases. So don't let my Steam stats fool you.Enclave was released at a time when third person action games were really gaining an edge: the 6th generation (early 2000s). What sets Enclave apart is its RPG-like character unlocking, character swapping, upgrades, and back stories. During the 5th generation (PS1/N64/Sega Saturn) we had the likes of Tenchu and Syphon Filter, but nothing quite like Enclave. While the likes of Blood Rayne and Prince of Persia were backed by bigger budgets and better marketing, it was games like Enclave and MDK 2 that injected the third person action genre with this thing called ""replay value"".Whether you're a fan of the steam-punk aesthetic or third person action games or just want a fun (and very cheap) boredom killer, Enclave is a worthy addition to your PC gaming library.

Probably ok for its time but not now.NPC's, which are there to help and aid you usually end up doing nothing or getting in the way.

												I have a strange suspision that Enclave might not be a very good game. On the other hand, I enjoyed this third person hack 'n' slash enough to finish both of its campaigns (the Light one and the Dark), so maybe it's not all that bad either.I wish I knew what the story in this game was about, but it was delivered in the most boring way, so my mind began to wander everytime I was exposed to it, making me unable to take notice. Basically, what you get is something that I like to call ""a talking book"" - cutscenes showing nothing but an old looking book with a voiceover put on top of it. I guess, all you really need to know is that the good guys fight the bad guys, right? What really matters, is the gameplay......And the gameplay is quite engaging. You play through different levels unlocking new characters that you can choose between at the beginning of each stage. All the playable characters are essentially split between three classes - a fighter for melee combat (sword, axe, hammer + shield), a ranger for ranged combat (bow, crossbow + different types of ammo) and a mage for... ranged combat also, but with MAGIC (various staves that shoot magic missiles). As you go along, you are also provided with better equipement, that you can chose from based on the collective amount of gold you aquired on your adventures. Good stuff.Graphics are quite nice too. Must have been really nice when the game came out. Not much else to say. Overall, I had fun with Enclave. Might recommend.			"

												I'll try to be as fair as possible with this game. I've played both campaigns on difficult setting with 100% gold, though I had sometimes the urge to just quit the game. First of all, the game looks neat, especially by 2002 standards, the basics of gameplay are pretty easy to learn, the AI is ok and the soundtrack is really atmospheric. So much for the positive aspects of the game.The story is rather lame, run-of-the-mill fantasy with some steampunk elements. But the cutscenes and the presentation of the story make up a little for the weak story. The biggest problem with the game are the messed up hitboxes. And that's a big issue in a hack 'n slash game. Arrows going right through enemies, melee fighters can't hit enemies on stairways if they are below them and missiles going right through massive obstacles. That seems to be intended for magic missiles, but I have noticed some examples where enemy bowmen attacked me through a solid wall while I couldn't hit them, which is pretty frustrating. Also, the 1st person view is rather glitchy, especially in narrow spaces.The balancing is a mess. Sorcerers spam homing missiles at you which drain 1/4 of your life AND do damage over time while most melee fighters are push overs. Since the overall difficulty isn't very high (except for level 13 in the light campaign, that one was really tough), you can rush through most of the levels. You can beat this game with difficult setting and a 100% score in less than 15 hours.I've never even read a single word about bugs referring to this game, but it has its fair share of them. Enemies dropping of cliffs who were supposed to drop gold => 100% no achievable. Traps not triggering. Even important NPCs tend to get stuck in the environment, so you have to start all over again. To be fair, most of the levels are pretty short (sometimes even ridiculously tiny), so that's not a big problem. In summary this game could have used a lot of testing, it feels a little unfinished in some places. But for 5 € you can't go wrong, and as a hack n slash fan you should definitely try this one out.

												I'm not sure why this is advertised as an RPG, as ""Enclave"" is an Action game. It's not an Action RPG, it's not even an Action game with RPG elements, unless ""there are several characters who can use different weapons"" counts as one. There are no dialogues, no character stats, no development, no quests, no (semi-) open world to discover, and most importantly of all, there's no role-playing. Naturally an Action game can be a nice experience as well, but sadly, ""Enclave"" isn't. For once, this is because there's hardly any gameplay. You can walk, jump, attack, and raise your shield in defense - that's it. It's really your basic ego-shooter range of actions. The combat feels incredibly clunky. Your attacks seldomly seem to connect, arrows go through the enemies without causing damage even if they're right in front of you; melee weapons flail wildly and hit everything but your foe. Combat doesn't feel rewarding in any way.The missions are terribly simple as well. You'll always get several aims you need to complete, but it all comes down to ""run through the tube-levels and kill everything"". There's also a bunch of gold lying around in the levels, granting you access to other (read: stronger) weapons in the next one. The first couple of levels (which I played) feature only two basic types of enemies: small guys and big guys. It's boring, plain and simple.On the pro side, the game environments look really nice. The story seemed alright, too, but I just couldn't be bothered to continue playing the game to find out how it unfolds.I can see why it would still spark nostalgia today for those who played ""Enclave"" when it was first released, but I just can't recommend buying it now, not even for 99 cents.

												I went in the game with no expectations at all and after lauching it I actually was pleasantly surprisied how similar it looked and fellt like my all time favorites action rpgs.As much as I tried to enjoy this game, it's just plain broken.I haven't seen a game this bugged in my life and I've played all bethesda games and AC Unity.If you move your mouse too fast in this game it completely freaks out and it's very hard not to do so.Your character begins to move at mach 5 in a random direction and the camera can't keep up with that. I tried to endure this by moving the mouse as slow as possible but in the third mission, where you had to escort a merchant it was imposible for me to do so because I allways fell from the rooftops due to the mach 5 bug.I tried to use the second class ""the huntress"" but the ranged combat is just a complete joke. It was completely random if I'd hit or not regardless where I aimed at or if the radical was green or red... and the most stupid thing about it is that there's a headshot multiplier and without it you don't deal nearly enough damage to kill the lowest of the enemies.The enemies bug a lot aswell.Sometimes they just stand there and do absolutley nothing even when you hit them and sometimes they rund against you and press you INTO a wall where you get stuck and have to leave the game.Every minute of playing this game I found another hand full of game breaking bugs.I bought this for 0,64euro so it's not a big loss but don't buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥for 5 euro... just don't.

You earn gold to buy items and make your Character stronger. Sometimes you gotta grind a level a little if you want a specific item, but it was never boring to do so.Overall, this game gets a solid 8/10 because of the age of the game and how awesome it is. Good buy for $5.49 HOWEVER get it on sale when its $1.37 and save yourself a couple dollars! trust me, this game will be waiting for you!			"

												Really starting to show its age. Enclave is an RPG where you can play both as the good guys and the bad guys in two different campaigns. Its story is slightly boring and not very insteresting, failing to pull me in at all.Decent amount of classes, but only a few actually do any good. Ranged is king since the combat is so floaty. You get a certain amount of money each level and you can look for optional bonus gold by finding it hidden in spots on the map or certain enemies that are optional to kill which will drop gold upon death.The combat is really boring and flaky. You just swing and shoot arrows constantly at enemies who dodge them like they know when your shooting. The boss combat is also bland and uninteresting. You also die at random events if you don't watch your every step and checkpoints are pretty few and far between. Graphics are average for its age, nothing special to write home about. The levels are neat, being pretty full and there is room for exploration. 5$ isn't what I would pay for it, wait until its on sale for a dollar or two, but even then I would just put that money towards a better 5$ game.Personal Rating 1.5/5			"

												A very good third-person action game where you just murder a lot of beings. Very good combat system and gameplay, albeit it's not on the level of Severance's, the game is well worth playing. Great visuals too, albeit audio (voices, sounds and music) is average at best. Story and characters are quite bad too, but who cares anyway.			"

												Enclave is a game that I had many doubts about. I tried it out and suddenly found myself struggling to step away!  Unlocking characters, finding gold to enhance my character and fighting off bad guys with many types of weapons? I'm in! I didn't like the fact that it wasn't open world at first, but now that I've played it, it feels right to have level selection!I give it a 8/10 Go ahead and get this game and give it a try :D			"

												Enclave is a 2002 action game from Starbreeze studios, the studio that went on to develop Chronicles of Riddick, The Darkness, and even Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. The first few steps of a storied team.Your first mistake will be to think that this is a roleplaying game in the slightest. It is not. Campaigns are divided into an odd 13 missions (14 for Light), and you begin each one by picking a class and loadout. Collecting gold within levels only increases the amount you can purchase with your persistent loadout. This was originally intended as a multiplayer experience, perhaps even solely multiplayer, and it shows. From ""You are leaving the mission"" messages when you stray too far from the intended game arena, to several ""Capture the Castle"" missions left wholesale in the Dark Campaign.For the most part this isn't actually a bad thing. It lends itself positively in some other areas - the variety of playstyles is appreciated, and the open-ended levels (whilst obviously meant to accommodate multiple players) make the levels infinitely more interesting than if they were linear. This has all the trappings of a typical Pandemic title in a single-player only package.However, your second mistake is to buy this game, because it's terrible. It's a real letdown that it is. The graphics are nice - much better than the screenshots let on, with some of the Dark Campaign levels being outright beautiful. The character models are comparable to Fable's in quality and art direction, both of which have aged very well, and even the OST is excellent, with battle music and environmental shifting out of each other seamlessly.Though the VA is terrible (narrators aside), it's endearingly so, with exaggerated movements to make up for their lack of emoting that only early 3D titles could provide. Enclave is terrible because it plays terrible. Melee is a wet fish slapping affair, madly bashing the single attack button as you desperately play footsies in a sad display that makes QWOP look elegant, and ranged will see you backpeddle through entire levels as you fish for headshots (along with some hopelessly onesided shootouts against the lazer-sighted AI), In both cases, the hitboxes are completely shot, with both melee and ranged strikes regularly phasing through opponents. Even when you do connect, don't expect any hitstun as you continue dancing like a puppet held by a Parkinson's patient, because this is still a multiplayer title in all but name,It's a disgrace that makes shovelware indie titles look good by comparison. You feel like you're compensating for lag that isn't there, trying to play by the rapidly shifting rules of this broken shoddy gameplay. You shouldn't buy this game, and I don't recommend it. Not because of the ""aging graphics"", or the pricetag, or even the single save file that gets annoying when your Dark Campaign overwrites the unlocks of your Light Campaign, but because even when compared to its contemporaries, it is an absolute nightmare to actually play.Enclave, a sloppy start to a long career, belongs to the annals of time. You should move on to greener pastures.			"

												Played this game back when it came out long time ago.  Came across a game manual recently and remembered how much fun it was, and low and behold found it on sale on Steam for super cheap.  Got exited to play again, install went great.  First couple hours went great! But then ended up crashing to desktop every 5 min.  Looked up online to try and fix crashes with multi core/ modern computers.  Found some suggestions but were no help.  Game is fun, if you get to play it.  Lots of different gameplay opportunites.... if you can get to it play with out crashing.			"

												Cool game for its day, to bad I can't get it working well enough to give it a full playthrough. GFX: I'm sure I remember the graphics being amazing way back when pre-rendering was all the fad; which it does use for some things (intro/menus), and scripted scenes in game! Music/SFX: Decent enough music but some sound-fx are a bit odd. Story: Seemed engaging enough, though some of the dialog was a bit hammy.Gameplay: Again, I remember it being great back in the day but I couldn't get it working well enough to tolerate more than 3-4 levels. Game Breaking Bug: Moving the mouse to look around, or change your heading, while moving causes the forward speed to increase by some huge amount. Sometimes the same bug would cause forward movement to continue without any input. Sometimes it would cause mouse look to get a serious case of the jitters.TL;DRWhile the game is cool enough to recommend, the bug killed it for me.			"

												Don't judge this review by my time in steam, I've played alot in non-steam version.The story is enjoyable albeit not one of the best stories out there.Combat is pretty fluid.I like the setting and the crisp graphics for it's time, even now it looks really appealing in my opinion.The idea of having limited gold and potions is great, you always have to be on the lookout for the gold and potions in levels and not chug countless potions while having unlimited gold, alot of games that are like that are easy.This game isn't the most difficult either  but it isn't too easy... the difficulty is just right. I played this game in my childhood and never knew that people had kinda mixed thoughs about it (More positive thoughts  than negative which is nice).The game is also really atmospheric.There are some bad points in the game -Paladin is probably the most useful in the Light side and the others are kinda just there, the Dark side is more balanced.Alot of the Negative reviews are outdated, the game no longer pops up any ads for Raven's Cry so you can enjoy it without ads.

												Well first of all, it is not about THAT Enclave, and game's story is totally not it's strongest part. Combat part of the game is pretty solid, it does not have that depth of Dark Messiah, but it comes with variety, because each character got different fighting style. Though knight is supposed to be ""tanky"", he does not feel ""tanky"" at all. Also like 90% of enemies are smaller than him, so he got a problem with hitting enemies.  In any case, game is alright for it's age and price, but there is nothing great or challenging about it, though collecting all gold is not that easy.			"

												Great game. Other reviews already tell why it is great so I'll leave a recomendation here:When you pick up this game, stay away from bows, they're complete garbage, stick to crossbows and you'll be happy with how they play around. The green dot turns red when you're aiming at a valid target, it works in a weird way, if you have it red it will score a hit regardless if your character actually has line of sight or not which also means that when enemies come into close range you'll most likely miss them unless you put the dot on top of them, anywhere else it'll shoot across the enemy dealing no damage.

												This game is one of those that has aged pretty badly, but it has a frustrated swedish goblin, so my nostalgia-glasses are gold-rimmed for it.In all seriousness though, it is a pretty janky and mediocre game by modern standards, and as others have highlighted, it has some gamebreakers which require a restart of the level. But I will honestly say it is an enjoyable game once you get into it. If nothing else, it's more player-friendly than TES: oblivion.And it costs the same as a box of mediocre chocolate, but lasts at least twice as long. What's not to like?			"

												Enclave is a Real under rated Hack n Slash RPG Gem... I played it on the XBOX A Long Time Ago and after configuring the controls to my liking and setting the graphic to 1080P... I am totally digging it....It has a neat 1st person 3rd person camera switch that makes your shield, Sword, Bow transparent in 1st person mode..... its one of the little things that make this game different. Some have reported an adware in the game but I havent seen any of that. The game Runs Great and with it on sale less than a Dollar its a steal. As you collect gold in the levels you buy better gear and you can replay the levels after you complete them with any unlocked character to look for the missed gold. There are both light and dark campaigns to unlock 2 hidden characters not seen in the campaign and there is a config hack to unlock console commands but it is reccommended to back up your save before you try it. Also a level editor exists for the game, which has been updated if you look for it... I really wish the MOD community gave this game some Love....Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection.

												An old school action-adventure game.  It's old, so don't expect anything ground breaking.  Premade characters with premade fighting styles that get upgrades as you progress through the story & earn money.  The combat is hack/slash with different styles between which character you choose to play.  There are archers & mages which play like a 1st/3rd person shooter of sorts.  Just make sure you have mana before starting fights.  Enemies don't have much variation between them.  You'll encounter the same types throughout every level with them getting harder & more armored as you progress.STORYThere isn't really a good story here.  It's mostly about you being in a war & your leader telling you to go do stuff.  There are good & evil stories to play through but you can't play the villain story until you beat the good one which is a bummer.GRAPHICSDon't expect much visually since it's an older game.  It's not bad looking but everything does look brown/grey.  Like they were going for a more realistic tone.  It's pretty bland & boring overall.  The character models look good at least.AUDIONothing major here either.  The game does have basic 3D surround sound, but I'm not sure how it is since I don't have a setup for it.  Music is generic & loops through the levels.  Voice acting is good & tolerable.  Sound effects are basic explosions, clangs, footsteps, etc.  Nothing super impressive.UIThere is no map in this game, but levels aren't that big so you won't really get lost.  Before each mission you equip your character with weapons & armor. You choose the missions to play via a world map.  Each mission is repeatable but you can't earn bonus gold from replaying each mission unless you earn more gold than you did in your previous playthrough.  Depending on how much gold you've earned you can equip yourself with better items & more potions.  You don't really ""BUY/SELL"" stuff in this game.  You find gold throughout the levels & it adds to your total gold pool.  The higher your gold pool the more you can equip.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay changes depending on the classes & there are 3 class types.  Warrior, Archer, & Mage.   You start with the warrior & unlock the rest as you play the game.  You unlock different versions of each as you progress as well.WARRIORS  The combat can get cumbersome for warriors.  You'll need to be constantly moving & attacking to avoid being hit & to get around some enemies defenses.  The Warrior is tall & a lot of your enemies are short so you'll keep swinging over their heads from time to time. He also often swings at an odd angle so even if the enemy isn't short you'll still miss.  You can use shields to block arrows & attacks, just make sure they hit the shield or you'll take damage.ARCHERS  They play pretty much like you'd expect.  You have to draw & time your shots.  Headshots do 10x bonus damage & are pretty much instant kills.  You get a variety of arrows like fire, explosive & sniper arrows.  Gameplay is slightly different depending on what bow you use.  You pretty much need to headshot enemies & that's easier said than done.  Each shot has a delay as well.MAGES  Mages equip staves & shoot things similar to the archers except they are more versatile. Each attack uses mana & their playstyle changes depending on which staff you're using.  The 1st staff is the most balanced.  A slow attack with a wide berth to give you room for errors.  The 2nd staff requires much more precision & is similar to using a bow without needing to draw an arrow.  The 3rd staff poisons your enemies & allows you to damage them over time.  Some enemies are immune/weak to certain staves so it's best to bring 2 staves with you if you can afford it.OVERALLThe game is monotanous & poorly designed.  The enemy AI is terrible & goes from being completely stupid to jump around & avoid all your attacks while they bash your face in.  If you play a ranged character you're gonna have a hard time because the enemies are constantly moving & have tiny heads and you NEED to headshot them in order to kill them.  If you play a melee character you're gonna have an even worse time because every enemy is so small your swings will always go over them or he'll just swing at wierd angles so if the enemy isn't short you'll miss anyways.  The levels are really linear as well.  It's pretty much a straight line, with one offshoot that unlocks if you can save someone from dying & some dead ends that hide more gold.  Enemies also spawn out of no where.  You'll often walk through an area with no enemies only to have them spawn behind you.The games not unplayable, but it is frustrating.  I'd not recommend it unless you get it on a good sale.			"

Product received for free
												I have recieved this game from a friend who gave me a key they got for free. I like this game, its graphics is decent. Ive had my moments with this game, took me two days to find the entrance to a house to retrieve a key for some dude that claims ""Celinhiem needs this gold."" When I saw the stache of gold I stopped playing and thought to myself...im going to be rich, but now I relized it was not even enough to upgrade your armor to light armor. I progressed just to see a goblin with armor as thick as my roof, I shot it with my ""Dwarven Crossbow"" just to see it jump out of a tower and slaughter me. Now im stuck on level five and have no life. It has a nice combat system I geuss. All you need to run it on max graphics is a stone-age ""Stonehenge 68 windows 64 .1 gb ram computer."" Overall, I love it...			"

												It's alright, haven't seen any major bugs, combat tends to be a bit finicky but it's pretty good, sometimes the shield feels useless buuut you always get proven wrong, the game can be very very challenging at times, take mission 3 for example. mean ♥♥♥♥ those necromancers, I wound up using god mode after a bit because the game was getting to harsh and I just wanted to have fun and I can easily see how much more difficult it can get.One thing I like however is your gold collection is shared between your races/classes which is quite nice, like you can power through the first like, I unno, 6 or 7 missions as aKnight then you'll have enough gold to instantly kit out a Druid, I have noticed that in certain stages other classes do much better, take that fire level for example, where you get that frost blade, doing that on a druid is difficult, those little fire golems are like 96% resistant to your attacks.Would be cool to have achivements tho, in regards to cheating it's very limited and all you really have is God Mode and Finish Mission, that's it.Graphically and mechanically I'd say it's fairly decent for the time it was made, the voice acting in-game (not cutscenes) is pretty weird but eh, sub titles help alot.The price seems to be spot on for a game such as this, I recomend it if you want a decent medieval game with some nostalgia, I deffinately recomend getting it while it's on sale, it's pretty fun.

												Its a hack and slash game, so there is not a whole lot to expect.You run around and hack and slash yourself through the enemies. There is a bunch of hidden treasures and even some maps that give you access to hidden levels. You collect gold in each level and in between you can buy better armor/weapons more motions etc. You unlock a bunch of different characters, that repeat themself not only in the form of being the same characters with different looks for both the dark and light campaign, but also by getting, lets say a sworsman in level 1 and in level 10 you can play the knight, that is the swordsman with more life and attack. so why bother with the swordsman? The classes therefor are basically: archer, mage, swordguy, something wird with bombs (never used that guy). The gold part is very interesting by the way. If you have, lets say 1000 gold and you get an armor for 500 and a sword for 200 then you still have 300 for potions or whatever. BUT: if you unequip the armor you get those full 500 back. This means you have a certain amount of gold, with which you can work and which equips whatever you want. Its seperate for each character as well. So you can use those 1000 gold to equip your archer and if you feel like playing mage instead you can use those 1000 gold no matter what your archer has equipped. The graphics are old but they dont hurt the eye or anything. The story is meh, but its about hacking and slashing not questing. you have small levels which you go through one after another and except for hidden treasures and levels there is not a whole lot else to do than to fight yourself through these levels. There is two more things you need to know: 1 Its brutally hard. Even on easy mode you will die often. Why is this a problem? Because if you die you have to restart the entire mission, unless you found a checkpoint. if you got one of those you only lose 5 gold if you die and restart from there. the monsters you have slain even after reaching the checkpoint stay dead. what else makes it hard? terrible hit detection. I played through the entire game light and dark campaign and I have no clue whatsoever as to when something counts as hit and when it doesnt. I smash my enemy 15 times and they dont take a scratch, I hit somewhere completely else and they get damage? Same goes for me, believing that hiding behind my shild will block the enemy hit. What a foolish thought.Fazit and TL:DR:Its mindless fun. See the enemy, kill the enemy, plunder the gold floating around everywhere and slay more enemys. And die a lot of times meanwhile.			"

												Enclave is great game set to modern standards. I played it when it first came out and it was a blast, however it has not aged well over 14 years. Many of the bugs that were expected then just seem terrible and game breaking now. Worth $5 if you're looking for a little nostalgia but if not than this game is not for you			"

												Enclave is an old 2002 game which brought to steam in 2003, exactly 12 years before i played this game.The game itself is about medieval-style hack and slash game with a great graphic (from 2002 timeline perspective).I tried to like this game but.... somehow i felt something missing from the game while playing it, something that should be exist in game, enjoyment.I know it's subjective matter about enjoyment, but even an old game like Crash Team Racing can give me enjoyment while playing it better than this game.So here are the pros and cons of the game :Pros :+ Great and enticing graphic from 2002 game+ Nice UI game+ Smooth even in low spec PC (why can't this implemented in any other games? Dev?)+ Many weapons and armors choicesCons :- THE STORY, it's so bland and so obvious. Something that makes this game can't meet its expectation- Unresponsive control and stiff movements- Combat system and movement is so dull from 3D perspective. Should make it 2D side scrolling instead- Not too intelligent Artificial Intelligent (AI)- still too expensive for and old game (subjective but i got it free from friends lol)Still, i can't recommend this game for who seeks a great story based hack-and-slash game (because the game itself is trying to be one).But i if you don't mind about the bland and so-so story, you can try this game.4/10 because bland story and dull combat movement.

												I don't set my bar very high when I buy an obscure fantasy game for under $5 bucks. The odd unexpected gem, occasional clever art design, or just experiencing the personal projects of earnest developers. Enclave is none of those. I've only played through maybe the first third of the Light campaign (there's an entire second one that you need to unlock), but my patience is officially dried up.The game starts with a lengthy cutscene that could have just as easily been titled ""How Not to Write a Fantasy Story 101,"" opening up a quasi-mystical looking tome while a bored-sounding woman rambles on about the setting's origin story, throwing in some made-up fantasy words like ""Dreg'atar"" every third word in a deseperate effort to alienate the audience before the game even starts. (Tip for writers: foreign-sounding words are the deep end of the pool. The bigger the plot point the less likely you want to have to pull out a glossary to understand it.)Once the game starts it's a pretty bog-standard sloppy hack-and-slasher, paving through orcs and goblins because of course you are. Survival can get pretty finnicky as the clunky combat controls make tapdancing around your opponent the best means of defense, and occasionally an unpredictable exploding setpiece can kick you back to the start of the level. Still, not something I lost sleep over seeing as how it cost less than a dollar.The quality just sort of slowly slides downhill from there. Ranged attacks are borderline useless as they require extreme precision, which in a game where no one ever sits still and your rate of fire is roughly the same as horse droppings, means that at mid-ranges you'll miss, at close ranges you'll miss and get stabbed, and at long ranges you might hit and give your target a small papercut.Basically every level introduces a new class to play as, most of which are slight variations on your standard sword/shield/crossbow Knight that you started with. The most distinct one (that I've unlocked, anyway) is the Druid, who takes any semblance of class balance and crushes it between her gratuitously exposed thighs (you can unlock armor with pauldrons, but not pants. How does that make sense?). Her most basic staff summons spectral ravens that home in on their target and has a secondary power to summon an elemental as a disposable meatshield, and her mana restores so fast it basically serves only to slightly limit your rate of fire.Now if this were a sensibly balanced game, the average class would be able to plow through levels with moderate difficutly and the hilariously overpowered Druid would just sort of wander through spamming magic like you snuck Starkiller into a game of Star Wars Battlefront. But this isn't a sensibly balanced game, and the clumsy controls will have your melee characters limping with no potions inside of five minutes, basically giving you the options of ""play Druid or get really familiar with the first room of each level.""My patients burned up around level seven, which seemed easy enough like all the rest: wander around murdering ugly green people, grab loot, find exit. Unfortunately, the level is also littered with archer assassins, who use the same burst arrows as your Huntress class, but with unlimited ammo and impeccable aim. They can, and will, take you from full health to dead in one shot before you can even make out their silhouette through the game's heavy fog, and in a game where each level has MAYBE two checkpoints, there's only so many times I can try and play Russian Roulette with trying to snipe them through the fog before I give up and chuck the game in the trash.

												Good, solid action-RPGStory: 18/25 Gameplay: 16/25 Graphics: 20/25 Sound: 15/25OVERALL: 69/100Enclave is just a good old game, and like many old games, suffers from being an old game. The story was good but not at all memorable and I felt the dark campaign's story was way more intriguing than the light campaign's. The gameplay is a bit all over the place, some levels are hard, some easy. Some classes are overpowered, some useless. It also suffers from occasionally poor hit detection. The graphics are pretty decent for the age and there is a wide variety of locales, but they seem really bland after a while. The the sound is fair but repetitive and the grunts got annoying very quickly. I would get on sale or in a bundle.Final Note: The Dark Campaign, just ... why, it gets so stupidly hard. Hard in the ""unfair"" and not the ""difficult"" aspect of hard.			"

												This isn't an RPG at all,  its a typical hack and slash action game.  There has barely any loot accept gold and health pots and very rarely a particular level will reward you with an upgraded item for the various characters you'll unlock as you progress.  The combat is a mess with button bashing the par for the game, blocking serves limited purpose as you'll be wildly swinging your weapon around hoping for actual contact with enemies, sometimes it doesn't even register.The defence Enclave has is its age, its quite old now - but even so, back in 2003 there was RPGS around that did a better job in the third person action rpg genre.   Levels are all extremely linear in nature, and some areas are quite confusing and its easy to get lost and frustrated.Graphics wise, its above par considering its age - this is probably why it got so many positive reviews.  But in terms of actual gameplay, its sub-par and the difficulty increases quite rapidly to a point you'll rage over cheap deaths from traps or other stupid game mechanics.			"

												If you're looking for a nostalgic romp, this game will work for you.I find the loosey goosey hit detection rather frustrating.  And as a core mechanic, it drives me away from the game.This title pales in comparison when compared to other similar titles from the era.Skip this game and grab Rune Classic for a similar game with tighter and more nuanced combat.  Fable is another game from this era that puts Enclave to shame on every level.This game was pretty meh. 3/10 by today's standards.  6/10 by 2003 standards.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

The story is to the point so you can get on with the action, filled with hords of enemies, different unique playable characters that you can destory them with and amazing enviroments that will take ur breath away. There are aslo secrets in each level as well as a solid amount of content. Its price its great also but when its the holidays and its gets cheeper its well worth, its basically a steal!!!!I honestly cant praise this game enough, its really that amazing, i was shocked when i bought it and gave it a try.

												I first played this game on the original Xbox and I beat it many times, but I was honestly sad that it wasn't compatible on the Xbox 360. Our original Xbox works great so I can play Enclave on it again, but I found this game on steam long before we got the console repaired. The checkpoint system makes the game a little easier to play for rookie players, and the removal of the lock-on circles equalizes the use of all ranged weapons and staves. And the difficulty settings are cool too for a classic game. Honestly I was ok with the original game with the lock-on circles, no checkpoints (except for Durzu and Mordessa in the Light Campaign), and no separate difficulty settings. However, I was so excited to see this game again and I just love to be able to experience part of the very beginning of my teen years once again. I just play on the Hard difficulty so I can avoid having the checkpoints, and the game is easy enough to beat anyways. I woud recommend this game because its very simple and straight forward, but it can be also challenging as well because I have still not been able to perfect all characters for all levels just yet. Graphics were excellent back when it was released and the gameplay was just fine back then too. So anyone complaing about the graphics and gameplay can just shut go back to their overdone next gen games because this is my favorite all time game.			"

												Don't buy this game if you are looking for an RPG. It is much more action hack'n'slash game than RPG, but the combat is mediocre at best. It's pretty cheap, so I would say it is worth a try if you are a fan of oldschool games as it certainly has that look and feel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, if you are looking for an actual RPG, this is the wrong game.			"

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #56 - EnclaveI'll start with the good, since it won't take me very long.  The graphics are really nice considering this game came out in 2003.  I also enjoyed the music.  A little less impressive is the level design.  I did like the way the game encourages exploration to find hidden gold.  But the levels are very linear.  There's definitely nothing open world about Enclave.I didn't play long enough to get a good sense of the story.  But the main character seems to be the ""silent protagonist"", which personally I am not a fan of, but sometimes it can work.  Other characters do talk however, and I found the voice acting to be somewhat uneven.  Some of it was good, and some of it sounded like they asked someone in QA to fill in for a day.Also, you might notice the game is tagged as ""RPG"", but don't make the mistake of thinking it is one, because it's really not.  It's more of an action adventure game in a fantasy setting.  But it lacks many of the things you'd expect in a typical RPG, like an inventory screen, or character customization, or skills or stats, or a map of some kind.For a game that focuses on action, I wished the actual action was a little better.  Combat just seemed to be your basic button mashing.  There is some variety in the sense that you can change weapons and use a ranged weapon instead of a melee weapon, and the weapons can have different speeds.   But that's about it for the variety, and mostly I found myself just mashing the attack button.Speaking of the mouse button, I found myself wishing the game supported a controller, but it doesn't.  Another annoyance I found is, even though the game uses keyboard and mouse, from the main menu the mouse doesn't work, so you have to navigate solely with the keyboard, which made the initital setup and configuration annoying.It's a shame that the developers didn't put a little more work into the gameplay, instead of just making the game pretty.  Perhaps if I had reviewed this in 2003 I would have been a little kinder.  But even so, there were far better RPGs to play even back then.  What little is good about this game is outweighed by the bland combat and gameplay, and other annoyances like having to skip credits when you quit, which for me it's been the last time.  Don't even need to finish my hour on this one.			"

												What can I say? it didn't age well. The combat is pretty dull and repetitive by modern stadards, and both story and world/character designs are very, very cliche. While I  imagine this would look pretty impressive back in 2003 or so, now it looks really lame and there's no reason to play it.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												Like any game out there, there are pro's & cons// I have to say that the AI & the engagement of enclave is a unique one, set in graphics while not the most detailed- I found have continued to age well... there are some very challanging (even infuriating) moments to this game: one of the more notable coming from a single witch doing her best catwoman impersonation from a set of roof tops...its not a game that will particularly punish you for one mistake, but one that feels rewarding for having played ithack n slash, magic, ranged weapons, even lighting your enemies on fire with grease bombs & watching as they wither at your feet... if you dont enjoy simple combat, then this isnt your game... lots of fun can come from just exploring areas to find all the booty (and deal with the enemies that spawn for grabbing the goods) there are times that it can even feel unfair... but it is after all, just a game; one I happen to enjoy- & for $5 USD... i believe you will too			"

Story isnt epic, graphics for today arent, too. But nevertheless i really enjoy playing it. Played it back in 2004 and now i am about to play though it a third time, even if the missions are totally the same and nothing changes i like to replay with another class. So i would say, the money is well spend here. Dunno if it goes for sale or not but even if not, 5€ arent that much for a few great hours. Enyoed it even more than most new games these days.

												I first played this game on the original Xbox and I beat it many times, but I was honestly sad that it wasn't compatible on the Xbox 360. Our original Xbox works great so I can play Enclave on it again, but I found this game on steam long before we got the console repaired. The checkpoint system makes the game a little easier to play for rookie players, and the removal of the lock-on circles equalizes the use of all ranged weapons and staves. And the difficulty settings are cool too for a classic game. Honestly I was ok with the original game with the lock-on circles, no checkpoints (except for Durzu and Mordessa in the Light Campaign), and no separate difficulty settings. However, I was so excited to see this game again and I just love to be able to experience part of the very beginning of my teen years once again. I just play on the Hard difficulty so I can avoid having the checkpoints, and the game is easy enough to beat anyways. I woud recommend this game because its very simple and straight forward, but it can be also challenging as well because I have still not been able to perfect all characters for all levels just yet.

												This isn't an RPG at all, its a typical hack and slash action game. There has barely any loot accept gold and health pots and very rarely a particular level will reward you with an upgraded item for the various characters you'll unlock as you progress. The combat is a mess with button bashing the par for the game, blocking serves limited purpose as you'll be wildly swinging your weapon around hoping for actual contact with enemies, sometimes it doesn't even register.The defence Enclave has is its age, its quite old now - but even so, back in 2003 there was RPGS around that did a better job in the third person action rpg genre. Levels are all extremely linear in nature, and some areas are quite confusing and its easy to get lost and frustrated.Graphics wise, its above par considering its age - this is probably why it got so many positive reviews. But in terms of actual gameplay, its sub-par and the difficulty increases quite rapidly to a point you'll rage over cheap deaths from traps or other stupid game mechanics.			"

												This game is neither a rpg or a beat 'n' up. You have to complete quests and every quest is a complete level. There's no open world, there is only one possible way to go on. In every level you can find hidden gold which you need to buy armor, weapons and healing potions before you start a level/quest and you unlock new characters. And that's it. No level ups, no experience and no inventory. Before a quest starts you just choose a character like a warrior, mage or archer and buy him equippment. There's no a big difference between the weapons and armor, it's just like: pay more gold and it do more damage. Once a quest started you run with your character through a scripted tube-level and kill everything you meet. Sounds like fun, but the fighting-system is bad. I just played as warrior and he could only attack. If you equip a shield you can block, but there aren't special abilities or something similar. The fighting system is comparabel with the fighting system from Oblivion, but without magic. This game will disappoint you if you want a rpg with focus on confrontations, because this game isn't really a rpg and the fighting-system is bad. But if you want to run through scripted levels and kill everthing by useing only two buttons, this game could be entertaining.			"

												The basic premise of the game is to go around various dungeons, kill stuff, collect gold to buy items and do the next dungeon.  I really wouldnt consider this a RPG, as there is no real role play, its an action game, and a pretty decent one at that.The story is simple;  bad guys coming to kill you.. kill them before they can kill you.  And the dark campaign is basically the same, except youre the baddy. Its pretty for its age, it has some nice environments and nicely done mechanics. A good example of these mechanics would be the halfling lady. Shes too short to be hit with certain  attacks, so shes good when facing certain enemies.  I know this may sound broken, but its pretty obvious its intentional. Enclave is a game that has a refreshing level of difficulty as well. If you die, and dont have a checkpoint, you restart from the beginning. If you do have a checkpoint activated, it costs 10 gold to bring you back. I never died enough to lose all of my money so I dont know what happens then.  Alot of the complaints about the difficulty are from people who did not get far enough in to get the checkpoints. Really the only issues I had with the game, is that its rather short, and linear, and the fact that its labeled an RPG when it barely has RPG elements to it. Its an action game 100%. That being said its worth it, especially if its on sale!			"

This game would be fun playing if this were still 2003, but now it just doesn't hold up.By all means, the game itself isn't bad, but it just felt like theres much better games in the genre that just play a bit better if you're willing to spend a bit more.Also it kinda has slight performance issues, so theres that as well. Oh, and it has a built-in advertisement that opens your browser without your permission and shows you a newer game that the devs made. That was a huge turn off for me.Get it if you like fantasy RPGs but have don't have a nice computer and not that much money/nothing else in your library.			"

												Enclave is an ARPG that has gone terribly wrong. The ""action"" portion of this game is a joke, completely mundane and extremely repetitive. If you are a melee character all you do is hold down the mouse to swing your weapon like a mad man (and your attacks will randomly hit or miss), and if you're a ranged character you can shoot enemies from range since the AI is not smart enough to detect you. While attacking you can just keep dancing around your enemies and they have nothing to answer your dance. Furthermore, there is no skill tree or any character customization besides equipping your character with different items at the start of each mission. That's right, there is no continuous character with quests, instead you get a mission selection screen where you can pick a specific character and choose your loadout. You can purchase different items by finding gold, which are all scattered throughout the levels making you run around looking for bags of gold instead of focusing on the action and the combat. Lastly, the story is nothing special and is your generic save our kingdom for the bad guys - easily forgettable. Luckily I was able to get this game for free, and I do not recommend anyone picking this one up when there are much better ARPGs out there!			"

												The graphics are outstanding for such an old game, and it has a beautiful soundtrack, but the combat is really starting to show it's age. I picked it up with a badge discount and I can't say I'm impressed with the gameplay. I guess it's an okay buy if you are getting a discount, but I couldn't justify spending the whole 5 dollars to myself if I knew that the combat would feel so repetitive and boring.			"

												This is one of those games you don't hear about too much, and no one's really sure about why. It's very good, awesome if you consider it's a decade old. Plus it has an enjoyable gameplay which you don't see around too often nowadays: you can't level up with abilities, but you can pump up your gear if you manage to catch all the gold hidden in the levels... loot!

												It's a classic action-rpg blended with classic-fps sensibilities; there's even a toggle for first person view, in fact, and some of the characters are very ranged-weapon heavy.The characters and the equipment they can be given give you some choice in how you're going to hack, slash, arrow, or burn your way through each level, and the levels themselves are chock full of secrets.Sometimes the melee combat feels a bit spammy, and the archery is slightly more awkward than a full FPS game, but overall it's a lot of fun.

												Enclave is a gem of a game from the original X-Box era back in 2003. Its a third or first person medieval fantasy hack and slash with engaging combat and exceptional environments. For the rogue in all us there is a dark campaign where you play as several evil classes like assassin, berserker, lich and sorceress to name a few. If there are any good hearts out there, you also have the light campaign with their human counterpart classes such as knight, huntress, druid, wizard and half-ling. Each campaign lasted me a fun and joyous seven hours. At the start of each level you select your class and assign their equipment from the money you have. Nothing is permanently bought, so if you want expensive armor and a weak weapon with a few potions, you can do it or if zero potions, expensive weapons and armor is more to your liking go for it. The money is never spent, just assigned. These classes, play styles and different equipment go a long way to making each play through different, even if its your twentieth time on a level.			"

Third, this is a TERRIBLE console port. You can't even navigate the menu with your mouse... that's how lazy they were. No real graphics improvements either. Ironically you can't use a controller to play either. They did not make the gold fun to find either, its always just hiding behind the rock you are passing or stairs you are going up. And the saving is automatic at start of level with no checkpoints in between, meaning if you fell off a thin flight of stairs or something, you are stuck repeating the level.			"

YouTube™ Video: Random Opinion: First Impression of Enclave 

			Views: 70		

			http://www.gog.com/game/enclave http://store.steampowered.com/app/253980/ Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming Check out my friend bambeast27 channel for some awesome videos:...		

I didn't finish the game, so keep that in mindHave you ever wanted to like a game, that looks fun and you hope it really is, but in the end you got bored and never finish it? I'm sure you have. This is the case with Enclave for me. After 6 h (around half of the game, I think) I just stop playing it. The game is not bad, but few things I don't like, contribute for my boredom.For such an old game it have a lot of video options. Resolution, separated menus for graphics and textures, sliders for sound and music and even syncing with refresh rate. Last but not least, you can rebind keys, use a controller, on and of damage number indicator and so on. But make no mistake, the game is ugly, but not unbearably ugly. Graphics didn't age very well, textures are bad, enemies tends to jump really high, levels don't have enough details, but it's an old game, so it's expected. The story is simple – you have to save the world and it is the worst part of the game. There somewhat interesstig backstory, but the developer didn't capitalized the fun premise. In the end, one can say it is absent. Even other reviews pointed this. It is cliché fantasy story, not develop enough.So, next is gameplay. It is where I had some fun and there is a lot to talk about. Here you can find some interesting ideas – character classes and fighting system. Let's dive in.The game have two campaigns – Light and Dark. As far as my knowledge, first you have to start with the Light and beat it to unlock the Dark. Enclave is hack 'n slash third-person action game with options for first-person, focusing on strategic combat for melee classes. If you enter thinking that this is similar to Devil May Cry or Dynasty Warriors, you will be killed really fast. The combat is slow and methodical. I think the best comparison is Dark Souls, but probably not that hard. Your shield is valuable as much as your weapons. The game is tough, but I can say with some patience every challenge can be overcome. The character you start is a Knight class. He is using melee weapons primarily. When you enter a battle, it's with your shield raised. You have to keep track of enemy hit patterns to find when is the best time to strike. You have to be patience. Interesting thing here is that size matters. What I mean is you may raise your shield, but your feet and head are not protected. You have to consider where to put it. In the beginning you will encounter short imp-like creatures and lowering the shield is crucial and vice versa. If your characters is short, taller enemies are easy. You can even use the terrain at your advantage, if you manage to get the enemy on higher ground. When using a melee weapon you can do a three hit combo and with every hit your damage increase, but it leaves open for attack. So, it's up to you to decide do more damage or hit once and bring up the shield. It's risk-reward situation. Depending on your movement, you make a different swing with the weapon and this add to the strategic gameplay.Through the most of my play time, I used the Knight class. At some point I decide to see the other classes. What I found is range classes are boring. The combat with them is like any other third-person shooter and they weren't interesting as melee classes.Every character have a melee and range weapon, but depending on the class, they are specialize in certain play style, so don't expect Knight class, for example, to get the best range weapons and vice versa. And speaking of classes, they are total of 12, but you don't get them right away, you will unlock them by playing the game. I don't like that. Why? What is the point of that? Unlock them from the beginning. But there is one interesting thing about that. You don't level up by getting XP. You just have to gatter gold for new gear. And since this is the case, the dev decide after each level, for all unlocked classes, you will get additional money, so you can swap character before entering a level and not playing the whole game again. New gear is unlocked by beating a level. This is all it required. They don't have statistic, so i assume, if it's cost more, it's better. Weapons include swords, crossbows, maces, bows, axes and so on. Some classes have can equip additional stuff like bombs, different types of arrows and so on.One of the things I don't like is the AI. I feel enemies can walk only in a straight line and when get the chance I use this the get them to suicide or to stuck in the environment. The other thing is range enemies. Their projectiles can go through solid surfaces and it was annoying. The third things is the level design. Building after building after building. There are some places like vulcano and small harbor town. Although their design is somewhat diverse, in the end I find it boring and not very inspired.Enemies are not very creative. Small imp-like creatures, orc without armor, orcs with armor and shield, big ogres, spell casting enemy and so on. But most disappointg are the bosses. I only saw two. They also have uninspired design and they are boring to fight.Sound design is meh. Noting to remember. Music feels like typical for fantasy game, sound fx are okay and the voice acting is average. Don't expect something groundbreaking or something to remember here.I'm somewhere in the middle about this game. Although old, there is something to see, something to enjoy. Melee characters are worth playing in my opinion. Everything else is like sound and level design, some of the classes, the AI are average and story – completely forgetable. I couldn't bring my self the finish the whole game. I almost reach half of the journey and got bored, so take my opinion with a pinch of salt. Nothing exciting happened during my time with the game. There is enough here that pushed me away, but it still have my cautious recommendation. Get it on sale. Why I recommend it? Because I can see something that others might enjoy, but not me. Melee classes have more interesting play style, than the others. The game is not garbage, I had some fun, but there is nothing here that could hold my attention for a long period of time. Maybe someday I will revist it to see if I can enjoy it more and finish it.			"

												Enclave doesn't stand out in any one facet of gameplay, but the overall product is decent. While it isn't a game I can see people truly getting invested in, it can certainly be a ""pass the time"" standby.As I implied, most of the features are average. A few inventory options, decent graphics, normal story, fairly fluid movement and reasonably intuitive controls.Overall I'd recommend it for those who aren't expecting a lot, and are looking for a stop-gap solution between games.

												This game is really clunky, the characters can be pretty strange when attacking and you can actually take a lot of damage because of that. It is hard to block most of the damages that the enemies do.The graphics are pretty outdated, since this game is old, but it is actually not bad.You can have some weapons, but I didn't really notice that much of a change between them.The story is pretty simple. That can be either good or bad, if you don't mind a simple history with not much depth in it.Overall, the game is not bad, and it is cheap, if you want you may buy it for an even cheapier price and prove this somewhat of a 'classic' game. It has some things to do in here, like some exploration, that probably will make you get into it for some time.			"

												Never mind the 13 year old graphics >> you play the game for the experience, right?  Right.Pros:  - hack n' slash goodness.Cons: - horrible, and I mean HOOORRRRRIBLE gameplay. - awful controls - absolute fail physics, or, the Warrior is completely drunk off his keister and couldn't hit the    broadside of a barn with his sword; not sure if it's a hitbox thing, or what, but melee in this game is   horrendous. - Due to the physics fail, the Warrior takes A LOT of damage.  Health potions don't help much. - Terrible balance; why do some baddies take one or two hit, and others take 50 to kill?I feel pretty stupid spending money on this game.  Bleh....			"

												[ENG] Seriously, if it wasn't for reading it was released in 2003 i would have no mercy, but let's be objective.The gameplay is banal without attention to details, the graphic overall is ok (considering the old release date) but the shadows are so bad quality that i'd prefer playing without them. The menu interface is also something really unpleasant, it's rough because it's a scripted video as background, so it results in a real bad interface. Perhaps the storyline could be interesting, but i can't judge the plot because i'm not going to finish this game.Maybe it's just me, but i find this title so empty, i just don't feel to play it anymore. Just leaving it in background for steam cards.Guess this is one of those games that only old-gen guys who played it during childhood can enjoy it, in fact i never heard of it.[ITA] Seriamente, se non era per aver visto la data di pubblicazione del 2003 non avrei avuto nessuna pietà nel scrivere questa recensione, tuttavia sarò obiettivo.Trovo il gameplay molto banale e non curato, la grafica tutto sommato (considerando che è del 2003) è ok, ma le ombre sono un qualcosa di veramente fatto male che preferirei godermi il titolo senza esse. L'interfaccia del menu è veramente sgradevole, questo perchè è stato impostato un video scriptato come sfondo, risultando in un'interfaccia esteticamente rozza.Forse la trama sarà interessante, ma non posso valutarla poichè non avrò intenzione di finire questo gioco.Forse sono io, ma trovo questo gioco così vuoto, non mi dà proprio nessuna sensazione, nessuna voglia di continuarlo. Lo lascierò in background solo per le carte di Steam...Immagino che comunque questo sia uno di quei giochi che solamente i ragazzi della vecchia generazione che magari lo hanno giocato durante l'infanzia possano apprezzarlo.

												I thought that this will be a fun game despite of its bad graphics because it's an old game. I was wrong. Actually, i want to finish the game before even reviewing this game, but i can't really stand it anymore.This game doesn't have any RPG or adventure feeling at all; you have to beat a stage in order to continue the other stage. Your map is limited to the stage and there is nothing to explore at all (except if looking for coin can be called as exploring).Just as the other reviews said, melee is really a bad choice in this game. Sometimes the hit isn't registering at all, forcing you to take some damage. The swings have a long animation which could render the shield useless because you hardly can use it (unless if you play it slow).I want to say that bow is a good choice in this game, but sadly, (again), the animation is very slow, not to mention that there are delays between shots. Your walking speed is slow, which means that you can't really use it for a very long time, which is a bad thing. I doubt that there is a head shot though, but i think there is an area where you can deal more damage on the enemy (maybe the head? who knows.)Well, despite all that, i must say that the environment and sound really create a good atmosphere to the game. You really can feel the environment to the bone. I can't really deny that i somewhat enjoy it up to some point, although it's crumbled with the very poor battle mechanic.Pros:- Two campaigns, lots of stages.- You can choose the difficulty level.- Multiple characters available.- Secondary weapon available.- Great atmosphere.Cons:- Long and slow attack animation speed.- Slow movement speed.- Bad graphics.- Auto death in some stage (yes, forced restart) if you fall in a pit or such.- Camera rotation suck.I might redo this review when i finished the game. But for the time being, this is how i think about it.There are tons of better games out there rather than this game. This game might be good in 2003, but it's not in 2016.			"

												This is a really old and classic RPG. It is really fun to play and for the 2 hours of my own playtime, it doesn't seem to get boring.One could say that it is an old version of Dark Souls, but both games have their pros and cons.The only problem that I have discovered is while you are in the fight. When you are swinging your sword at the enemy it should be a perfect hit but it somehow misses the enemy, although it is not something that makes you wanna quit the game or anything.Now about the difficulty. If you are not familiar with those kind of games, go on easy mode and the game will still be fairly challenging. Don't think as a coward of yourself for playing easy mode, believe me :DFor the playtime of 2h I would give it a 7.5/10 :D			"

												Enclave is considered as an underrated gem. Even story setup is quite weak, but its gameplay is solid. The combination of 3rd person hack-slash with dungeon crawler feels give us enjoyable experience. The more you progress through the game the more characters and customization are unlocked which give variaty of gameplay. Even some levels likely force the player to choose proper character to beat and there's no checkpoint during one level.It's still fun and challenge game.			"

												Considering this game originally came out in 2003, it's a classic gem for many of the 90's children. The game still has that unique feeling back from the glory days, but naturally any old game from today's perspective can't meet the standards of most modern games.STORYIn a fantasy setting, you can experience both good and evil campaigns of the same story with different outcomes. I found it very exciting, that at some points, the storyline for the unique campaigns collide and you get to kill ""your good side character"" in the evil campaign plot. Overall the plot is a bit generic, but serves it's function as intended.GAMEPLAYDuring both campaigns, you can choose 1 character to complete missions. You have access to 3 warrior, 1 archer and 2  mage type characters. I really missed some stealth mechanics, because the archer could have been an even better class, it already has a very tactical setup with over 4 or 5 arrow types. The mage is a bit overpowered mid game and the warriors are near invincible at the very end.The game features a ""collectible - upgrade"" system, there are many gems and gold hidden during the levels, which can be used to get better weapons and gear. Getting 100% on each level can be challenging, so you will be revisiting levels quite a lot.COMBATEasy to learn, it can be a bit strange the first time, I always thought the whole melee combat was a bit odd. The archer class might have a little learning curve, but the other classes are easy to play. There are little additions in the form of explosives and flame bombs that mix up the warrior classes.Considering 10 years have past since it's initial release, I was still able to enjoy playing this game, so I would give it a 8/10, given what you can expect from an old game to deliver.

												The combat in this game is very clunky and simple. There's no real strategy to it, you just run up and spam left click to do your combos. You can use a shield but it isn't very useful since it doesn't knock an enemy back when they hit it or stun them. You will often find your strikes missing even though you can clearly see that your weapon hit the enemy. Just assume that your weapon is always half as long as it looks to be. Your enemies are also usually just as fast if not faster than you. Once they get close there's no escaping them, they'll stick to you like a tick until you kill them. That can be pretty annoying when you have to fight groups of enemies at once. I got this for 59 cents and for its time I can see that it would have been a good game but melee combat has become more complex since then. It all feels very dated and is honestly pretty boring.			"

												Enclave is a 13-year old game which was defined as an RPG, although I think it is more of an Action-RPG. The game is consideribly good considering the time period in which it was released and offered me quite a bit of fun.Pros:-Reasonably easy to play, linear story and closed maps, so no getting lost or searching for objective-Combat is fairly simple and with the right loadout, you can defeat anything quite easily-Trading cards are available, and the game comes at a reasonable priceCons:-Graphics and sound is dated, so might not appeal to some in that sense-Mouse sensitivity issues, can be corrected setting it to 125Hz-Although the game is widescreen enabled, the menus are locked to 4:3 aspect ratio-Game becomes repitive and tiring after some time, you do the same things over and over againThe game is okay considering its time, if you are into old games, get it (DLH.net was giving free keys out a while ago). For the more modern gamer, I advise you steer clear5/10			"

												This is a really old and classic RPG. It is really fun to play and for the 2 hours of my own playtime, it doesn't seem to get boring.One could say that it is an old version of Dark Souls, but both games have their pros and cons.The only problem that I have discovered is while you are in the fight. When you are swinging your sword at the enemy it should be a perfect hit but it somehow misses the enemy, although it is not something that makes you wanna quit the game or anything.Now about the difficulty. If you are not familiar with those kind of games, go on easy mode and the game will still be fairly challenging. Don't think as a coward of yourself for playing easy mode, believe me :DFor the playtime of 2h I would give it a 7.5/10 :D			"

												Enclave is considered as an underrated gem. Even story setup is quite weak, but its gameplay is solid. The combination of 3rd person hack-slash with dungeon crawler feels give us enjoyable experience. The more you progress through the game the more characters and customization are unlocked which give variaty of gameplay. Even some levels likely force the player to choose proper character to beat and there's no checkpoint during one level.It's still fun and challenge game.			"

												A basic non rpg hack and slash puzzle game with lots of problems and lack of imagination. As for graphics they aren't bad, sound is ok, but gameplay is horrible. You basically get to gather gold coins while you kill some monsters in the ""levels"" which allow you to pick weapons and armor for your level playthroughs. Combat is as simple as face the monster and push the mouse button until dead. You have range combat which is ok for sniping at the start of encounters that you can snipe, a early headshot gives you extra damage, plus some foes like archers like to sit out of melee range requiring you to use a ranged weapon often.Now as to the bad parts, the game really is just ""go through the level kill any foes that are there and collect gold coins"". Thats it. Its like Mario with sword and crossbow. Your goal is to get all the gold coins in the level and finish it, which will unlock other characters to play, and lets you choose better items during each mission beiefing. The bad part about the game is that there isn't really any save points other than start mission-finish mission. If you die during the mission either 1 of 2 things happen. 1, if you didn't reach a ""checkpoint"" you have to redo the whole mission from start. If you did reach a checkpoint, you rez at the checkpoint, but lose gold, which means you can't collect all the gold coins in the mission which is why you are doing the mission in the first place, thus, making you restart from the beginning.This is especially annoying in missions where the bad jump mechanics make you fall down a hole and die often, or hit a trap badly, or something else making you pull your hair out having to re-do missions over and over from the very beginning. Sadlly this bad game mechanic made me quit the game very early just gritting my teeth over ""hey, we are going to make a badly designed jump mechanic in the game, which by the way will get you killed a lot making you restart that annoying mission where you have bad jump mechanics to die, over and over. Have fun."". Sorry, not fun, and I didn't think twice after quitting and deleting the game and moving on to a much better game.			"

												This game is a single player hack and slash 3D fantasy game. Imagine linear skyrim from 2003, mixed with elements of counter strike. You play as a hero you chose, saving your city from invaders. If you want to cut, shoot, burn, corrode, blow up, or squash orcs, goblins, sorcerers, golems and other monsters, this game is for you. After you beat the good side, you can also play as the evil side, taking over the city and cutting, shooting, burning, corroding, blowing up, or squashing humans for a change.Pros Interesting Story, provides backstory Many classes Customization Beautiful Scenery Amazing physics Multiple Storylines Level replayability Optional first personNeutral Checkpoints respawn you as you died, without resetting, leaving the world as it was on death.Cons Glitchy JumpingOverall, I really enjoy this game.Edit: The adware is gone, so you can ignore reviews solely complaining of that.

												This was a amazing game at its time. Sadly we can't return to the old times and enjoy everything from the beggining again x)Wont write the Pros/Cons of a outdated game cause it feel plain wrong. If you have a urge to return to the ""good old days"" then this is one of them for me. Finished it around 8 times when i had it on disk, mb will finish another few tames later on. But still even in this very old game, there are several things that new devs should look into and patch it in new games, mb its not something so special to must have, maybe its just my mind, but those small details took me into this game and i loved it for my share of time in it.

												Enclave is a fantasy action game. You unlock new characters with different weapons and abilities as you play and depending on your saved budget and unlocked items, you can equip your selected character with a choice of weps, armor and potions, and thats pretty much all the ""rpg"" aspect.The game has a story which is not bad but pretty basic and you can play it from the perspective of two opposing factions, you can chose the ""light"" or dark"" campaign at the begining of the game and you will get to play different characters with different stories.The game stands out by its very well made fantasy setting and an excellent soundtrack. Personally i found the graphics and the music to be outstanding back in the day.The graphics aged of course but they aged quite well, for the most part they look good even by today standards. They might be technically dated but artistically they are still great.The combat is solid and quite varied for a hack and slash game. The choice of character is vital because the game is pretty difficult and some characters will do a lot better than others in certain levels. Every level can be completed with any character but the difference in difficulty can be unforgiving.The levels are not very big but most of them are intricated enough to allow some exploration in search for hidden stuff.It was one of my fave PC action games back in 2003 but i still enjoy playing it today.

Voice could have done better I still liked follow along the story linesGraphics: 34/100The graphics are Outdated the developer should update the textures and everything or Remake the game a better version of it with amazing graphics. This game might be old but its worth playingBalance Between Challenging and Impossible: 54/100 (Don't count as points)When I played this game at first it was going pretty much I got lost and stuck on some parts since there was no hints to help me out to complete a certain part of a room like the first level I went back and forth just to figure out that the answer was to use the cannon to blow up a door.. I thought it was not useable since it didn't hint me well. At the moment I'm stuck at the part where I need to bring the old man a log which again have no hint where it is.Other: 45/100I understand that the game has some potential but when you collide with npc you get almost completely stuck until you force the npc out your way Plus the camera views are a bit bad I would recommend this game to those who love old gaming.Rated 237/400 "

												A decent enough little hack & slash rpg. The combat is a bit...basic to say the least and the AI isn't the greatest. The graphics are decent given the time it was made. The enemies that I have encoutered have all been basic fantasy-ish baddies which is probably to be expected. The biggest gribes, in my opinion, is the story and the voice acting. Moreso the voice acting. The story is pretty much just your average fantasy dribble and is totally forgettable. And, the voce acting at it's best is 'meh' but most of the time it's somewhat of a cringe fest. So, yeah, like I said before this is a decent enough little game. It keeps you entertained and, really, isn't that what a game is for?6.5/10 - I wouldn't pay over what Steam is asking for it but I'd probably wait for it to go on sale.			"

												If you're looking for a deep, story driven game, then don't buy this one. However, if you're looking for something to kill time...or looking for a game with a very loose story but mostly serves as an excuse to grind through kills...then go ahead and buy this game. I admit, I haven't played this game for long, so I could very well be proven wrong, but it's maybe worth about the $5 I paid for it. I can't say I love it, and I can't say I hate it. All I can say is...meh. It's OK. The good is the graphics are good for the age of the game and you can (once you have ground your way through campaigns to collect all the characters), play a character to fit your play style. The combat mechanics are simple, but solid. The bad news is it is a bit samey-same and it is, so far a bit of a grind. I can only hope it gets better...at which point I will happily admit I'm wrong, but at first blush it really isn't much to sing about. PIty I can only choose between two options here...thumbs up or thumbs down. We really do need a so-so option. I'll go ahead and give this a thumbs up, but with one caveat...if it's more than a few bucks you may be over spending. But if this is your thing, then go for it. It's good, mindless entertainment.

												One of these great games underated you should play at least 'cause of action/adventure gameplay basis it founded !It's a well managed port of an 1st & 3rd person action rpg xbox game... To be honest, this pc version has way better optimized graphics and controls than this last one. Kinda précious thing i could estimate while todays developers are not getting confortable with pc for mercantile and pessimistic reasons.Graphics are clearly outdated from nowadays, lots of clipping, little bit tearing when speeding up camera movement, global cubic rendering but it also works like a charm. Textures are clean even if obsolete and non-HD designed. The game offers quite a few graphical settings very pleasant for a console port. Generally, the good quality  level design and architecture serves the medieval fantastic ambiance, environments are inspired and never get redundant. Levels stay linear but some of them are very wide-open ans submited to a labyrinthine path, so it's easy to walk round while you are looking tirelessly for a wood key that will bring you to the next room.Gameplay is very interesting and fun. As you complete levels , the game gives ability to unlock and play characters with its own skills, and retribute you with coins you gather during the mission. Indeed, before each mission, a menu lets users spend budget in new weapons such as enchanted crossbows, tremendous magical swords, big boom bombs, powerful magical sticks, warrior armors,... Each of these new supplies has a certain cost and doing the cupid globetrotter roaming through the entire level will make you quickly one of the best bashing champions all over the enclave. In game, controls are very reactive but aiming is a little bit buggy ; the shots given by your character don't reach ennemy each time you wanna touch its, in fact lots of shots with no damage are expected.The game has a very hard feeling mostly because of this part of the gameplay. It remains thought fairy difficult and at any moment, it become nonsense of frustration as demon's souls can be often.Soundtrack is a classical variety of dark medieval themes and participates in making the ambiance immersive. However, it is repetitive to hear all the same themes for differents levels so It doesn't offer necessarily an audio consistency to each level that make this boring and annoying after hours. Vocal dubbing is correct, voices actors are convinient despite conviction missing for some of them.Two campaigns : light and darkness... Very cute and original. Player start first with the light campaign which has a storyline better exploited, longer and devoided with narrative ellipses instead of dark campaign less rich lingering on crucial moments that can be rapidly sent over.Now it's your turn to save people of the light and/or darkness... And kill them above all, that's the real purpose and leitmotiv of this outlet epic game ! "

												+ Fun and fast paced combat.+ Interesting plot.+ Beautiful game for its time (2002).+ Unique gold and character system.  Instead of sticking to a character from start till end, the player can switch classes and equipments at will before the beginning of every stage.  No need to replay the whole game to try different classes, yay!- No autosaves, so this game is hardcore (but it can also be a good thing!)  There are checkpoints in the longer stages, though it takes a while to get to them.- Crashes on me 50% of the time.  Despite the frequent crashes, I still play Enclave because it's just that awesome.  Go ahead and grab it during sale!			"

												Enclave is a fun action game in a fantasy setting (though I wouldn't call it an RPG). You can find it cheap (sometimes FREE if you look around), and for such a low/no cost it's worth a playthrough.Pros:Action-packed combatSome environment interaction (exploding barrels, siege weapons)Decent story/loreHidden areas to promote explorationWell-designed maps/levelsYou can play the game from two ""sides"" (good and evil), with different objectives.Cons:Less gear options than expected (especially since any progression is gear-based)Only 1 character to start with (unlock others as you play)Some areas are very difficult using certain charactersYou must complete the first campaign to unlock the second one (IIRC)No controller support (but it plays fine on KBM)Most multicore systems will freak out the game. You can run it on a single processor though (the forums have info on how to do this).My biggest complaint is that the game has no multiplayer, which would've been amazing as a battle arena/map feature. Otherwise, it's a decent game for a few hours of fun.			"

												Fun and easy to play. Run around in 3rd person with a character chosen from an ever-growing band of classic fantasy heroes (or villains, after 1st playthrough). Swing your medieval killing tool of choice. Or zap some fireballs if you selected a mage. Jump and dodge, explore and run some more. Soup up with new maces and mail afterwards.Repeat for two campaigns a ~12 maps each.Everything is pretty solid- puzzles, character/monster design, pacing, even the music. Combat is VERY basic. No complicated combos, chains or counters.Enclave aged relatively well since...a) its a small niche b) the character designs are rather decent and c) -that is the game's main strength- Enclave did aim low but totally gets it right.Verdict:Hideous paws arrange 3/5 skulls for Vatar's throne.

												Fun Hack and Slash action adventure with that certain Conan the Barbarian fantasy pulp feel.Evil is afoot or whatever so you kill stuff. Theres no leveling, you pick up gold in the levels which after completion gets added to a total you use to not really but kinda buy and sell - its more of a point limit you get to spend on equipment. For example with 100 gold you could equip a sword and armor for both 50 or a bow for 100. Theres usually one checkpoint each level (no quicksaves) and dieing means losing 10 gold - if you manage to find the checkpoint, else game over.Theres multiple character types to unlock altho some are just straight upgrades (in one case not strangely).Levels are well designed and varied, for such an old game it really looks amazing if you put all the sliders to the right. Gameplaywise it starts out abit slow but picks up pace along with higher difficulty. Melee fighting is rather simplistic tho, you can block and do a 3 strike combo. Something seems off with hitboxes, i had attacks whiff which really should have connected, this is especially noticeable using bows and such in very close range, shots pass right thru enemies if you dont aim at their feet or in first person. Annyoing but workable.Other minor cons:- very crashy if not in XP compatibility mode which breaks the steam overlay- rename or delete install.vdf in the reg folder in the games folder or have a steam store page for some♥♥♥♥♥♥open each time you start thisIf you remember Severance: Blade of Darkness - this is kinda a lite version. Good fun, recommended.			"

												Enjoyable.Though it is indeed generic and brings nothing new to the table, It's a fun game to play and beat over the weekend.I like the devision of classes, adds a lot of replayability and makes the game a lot more dynamic in terms of gameplay.Having played it on normal difficulty I found the difficulty to be fair, perhaps a bit easy at times. Luckily there is also a hard difficulty setting for those looking for more of a challenge. I will say that the AI tends to be a bit dumb at times. I occasionally encountered enemies simply standing still waiting for me to kill them, falling to thier deaths, or just jumping around like idiots with no purpose. Also, they seem to find it difficult to climb up stairs, ending up jumping back and forth.I dislike some of the level design, at certain points it was very unclear to me in which direction I should be heading or what I am currently supposed to be looking for. I basically just ended up running around until I found my way, but sometimes it could take up to several minutes which was very tedious.Overall it's a solid game. 7/10 "

												Este un joc de actiune la persoana a treia in care poti juca atat de partea binelui cat si de partea raului intr-un conflict de proportii epice. Cu toate ca incepi cu un singur caracter posibil, mai departe salvezi alte personaje de diferite clase cu care poti juca. Un punct in minus este acela ca in lupte loviturile sunt imprecise. Cateodata sagetile si sabiile vor trece prin inamici fara a provoca lovituri iar inamicii pot lovii scutul si cu toate acestea sa iti ia din viata. Caracterele nu se misca prea repede si dureaza ceva pana incarca de exemplu arcul cu o noua sageata. Caracterul tau poate lua si bea potiuni de viata dar si aceasta actiune este foarte lenta, asemenea luptelor, schimbarii armelor, deci potiunile mai bine le lasi dupa ce eliberezi zona de inamici. Jocul este destul de dificil, deoarece te poti rani usor in cursele intinse pe parcursul jocului si daca te aventurezi direct in lupta poti fi incolnjurat de inamici de unde poti scapa foarte greu. Grafica: 5/5, Game play: 4/5, Storyline: 4/5, Sunet/ muzica : 5/5, Prezentare: 4/5.			"

												It's not bad, but not great either. I don't see any popup ads, the game looks decent in 1080p, and it runs fine on my 8 core Windows 10 computer. So all those old problems must have been fixed.I'm 9 levels in, I've unlocked most of the characters. The melee fighting never gets good, eventually your weapon will one hit kill most enemies, except a few stronger ones with 10x more hitpoints. I can only kill them with ranged weapons and running away. Killing them with a sword doesn't work because their AI spams their attack nonstop, and their attack is just as fast as yours, so you end up trading damage - which could work if you buy lots of potions.The third person crossbow shooting is kind of fun, and the level designs are interesting.It's a decent game if you like third person shooters and can get it on sale or in a bundle.

												This game can be a steal in steam sales periods. Going for only 49 cents.This game is extremely nostalgic. Back in 2002 this game had a demo with only 2 playable levels. It was one of the most downloaded demo's on the site games.telenet.be. :) I loved that site. I didn't have internet at home, so a friend of mine burned the demo on a disc for me. Sadly I never found a physical copy of the game in stores. The graphics. I love these kind graphics but I don't like hack n slash games. Especially when they are top down (Diablo, Torchlight...). Since this is a 3th person game, It's forgivable. At the time I thought hacknslash was awesome. This is a kind of game they don't make anymore. A lineair action game. Follow the path, kill everybody, progress through the story.  Repeat till you see the credits. The sword fighting feels a little bit like the Jedi Knight series btw...It's an ok game. At 50 cents it's a steal.			"

												One of these great games underated you should play at least 'cause of action/adventure gameplay basis it founded !It's a well managed port of an 1st & 3rd person action rpg xbox game... To be honest, this pc version has way better optimized graphics and controls than this last one. Kinda précious thing i could estimate while todays developers are not getting confortable with pc for mercantile and pessimistic reasons.Graphics are clearly outdated from nowadays, lots of clipping, little bit tearing when speeding up camera movement, global cubic rendering but it also works like a charm. Textures are clean even if obsolete and non-HD designed. The game offers quite a few graphical settings very pleasant for a console port. Generally, the good quality  level design and architecture serves the medieval fantastic ambiance, environments are inspired and never get redundant. Levels stay linear but some of them are very wide-open ans submited to a labyrinthine path, so it's easy to walk round while you are looking tirelessly for a wood key that will bring you to the next room.Gameplay is very interesting and fun. As you complete levels , the game gives ability to unlock and play characters with its own skills, and retribute you with coins you gather during the mission. Indeed, before each mission, a menu lets users spend budget in new weapons such as enchanted crossbows, tremendous magical swords, big boom bombs, powerful magical sticks, warrior armors,... Each of these new supplies has a certain cost and doing the cupid globetrotter roaming through the entire level will make you quickly one of the best bashing champions all over the enclave. In game, controls are very reactive but aiming is a little bit buggy ; the shots given by your character don't reach ennemy each time you wanna touch its, in fact lots of shots with no damage are expected.The game has a very hard feeling mostly because of this part of the gameplay. It remains thought fairy difficult and at any moment, it become nonsense of frustration as demon's souls can be often.Soundtrack is a classical variety of dark medieval themes and participates in making the ambiance immersive. However, it is repetitive to hear all the same themes for differents levels so It doesn't offer necessarily an audio consistency to each level that make this boring and annoying after hours. Vocal dubbing is correct, voices actors are convinient despite conviction missing for some of them.Two campaigns : light and darkness... Very cute and original. Player start first with the light campaign which has a storyline better exploited, longer and devoided with narrative ellipses instead of dark campaign less rich lingering on crucial moments that can be rapidly sent over.Now it's your turn to save people of the light and/or darkness... And kill them above all, that's the real purpose and leitmotiv of this outlet epic game ! "

												With nowadays standards this game is horrible. Jumping mechanics are clunky, sometimes you can jump on something sometimes not. Ladders work as they please. Shooting with a bow is a disaster (always choose crossbow). Hit detection is poor - you need to have hope for some numbers to come up. AI is stupid and acts weirdly. What is strange, despite all of this I enjoyed coming back to this game quite a bit. I suppose it is how nostalgia works.			"

												Enclave is an excelent classic RPG one of ""the greats"" for me -for its time. Allthou it can be compared with Gothic alot its alot diferent and offers another direction character progretion wise and story wise. Good and rich story and dinamic and interesting gameplay with a dark fantasy tone. The recognizable Main menu with the sreaching steampunk Raven brougth pleasent memories from this game from when it was popular. Allthou it hasnt aged well graphics and  animation wise -it still holds its charm and value as a nostalgia playtrough game and holds alot of replayebility.  In that sense i recomend this game. ;-}			"

												Encalve is a great game for what it is - an action focussed Hack and Slash. There's no character development but you find money on levels which you can buy better gear with. This creates a cool puzzle/platform element as it's no easy task to find it all as there are some very interesting places the money is stored. I played this a lot years ago and on the hardest difficulty it will give you a run for your money. It's of an older vein of games that will be frustrating at first as you need to place arrows carefully and time your swings exactly or you'll be flailing around hitting nothing.2 Campaigns with plenty of replayability due to around 6 different characters for both the light and dark faction. They basically mirror each other - so there's a warrior/archer/wizard/engineer/etc for both factions. Each character requires a different play style as you can imagine and get some unique equipment that you can buy.I was pretty excited that this was on discount on steam - 47p or thereabouts. However I've only been playing about 30 mins and the game crashed on the second level. Tried again and crashed right at the end again. Very frustrating -- and I imagine all support for the game will be gone now so no hope of a fix. The error message only flashed up for a brief second so apologise for not giving the exact error. Hopefully it's just me but worth bearing in mind if you're paying full price.For what is a game you'll easily get 40 hours playtime out of, it's a shame that the steam version seems a little unstable.The game itself is a solid 7/10			"

												Although not an open world,  it is very similar to Oblivion.  You can choose character classes with unique specs, and you gain gold as you beat levels which you use to equip your character with weapons and armor,  Can play on linux and older computers very well.Only $5, really cheap for someone who wants an Elder Scrolls-like game for linux.

												Enjoyable.Though it is indeed generic and brings nothing new to the table, It's a fun game to play and beat over the weekend.I like the devision of classes, adds a lot of replayability and makes the game a lot more dynamic in terms of gameplay.Having played it on normal difficulty I found the difficulty to be fair, perhaps a bit easy at times. Luckily there is also a hard difficulty setting for those looking for more of a challenge. I will say that the AI tends to be a bit dumb at times. I occasionally encountered enemies simply standing still waiting for me to kill them, falling to thier deaths, or just jumping around like idiots with no purpose. Also, they seem to find it difficult to climb up stairs, ending up jumping back and forth.I dislike some of the level design, at certain points it was very unclear to me in which direction I should be heading or what I am currently supposed to be looking for. I basically just ended up running around until I found my way, but sometimes it could take up to several minutes which was very tedious.Overall it's a solid game. 7/10 "

												Fun and easy to play. Run around in 3rd person with a character chosen from an ever-growing band of classic fantasy heroes (or villains, after 1st playthrough). Swing your medieval killing tool of choice. Or zap some fireballs if you selected a mage. Jump and dodge, explore and run some more. Soup up with new maces and mail afterwards.Repeat for two campaigns a ~12 maps each.Everything is pretty solid- puzzles, character/monster design, pacing, even the music. Combat is VERY basic. No complicated combos, chains or counters.Enclave aged relatively well since...a) its a small niche b) the character designs are rather decent and c) -that is the game's main strength- Enclave did aim low but totally gets it right.Verdict:Hideous paws arrange 3/5 skulls for Vatar's throne.

												So I got this game for $0.82 during the final days of a christmas sale, and I thought ""for 82 cents I don't expect much. I didn't get more than about 8-15 minutes in before I got bored and gave up to go play some Super Hexagon instead. Controls are acceptable. atmosphere, which is glorified in the trailer and the description, is as atmospheric and interesting as a generic action/adventure game of the later 90's. The actual gameplay is fine, the graphics are quite dated and the overall quality of the game is subpar, but not bad. It's not a matter of graphics or controls with this game, so much as its fault being in its boring landscapes, strangely disjointed combat and utterly generic feel. Nothing interesting, new, innovative or even remotely eye-catching is done with this game. It rides its way comfortably into the safe zone of action/adventure gaming set in a bland and uninteresting medevial world devoid of anything that might make it stand out of the hundreds of its boring and generic cousins at the bottom of the value priced games you find in a cardboard bin at a department store, left to wallow in all they're boring blandness. for $0.82, it is ok, but for full price of $5.60, I think I would rather go have some tempura dynamite sushi..Better that awful, but can't muster the strength to jump over that ""Berlin Wall of Generic Gaming"" fence - 5.5/10			"

												I love Enclave. It's a dumb hack 'n' slash but with a great soundtrack and atmosphere. Though the character models don't hold up well (they weren't great for the time) the environments are amazing. It's a button masher with simple upgrades. There's light exploration but you can't get lost. The story is pretty generic action fantasy stuff. There isn't much else to say about Enclave. It's cheap and well worth it if you dig this kind of run around and kill everything sort of thing. You either ""get"" this game or you don't. Also, it runs on Linux using a Wine wrapper. Other than a brightness glitch when changing video settings, that disappered once I restarted the game, it runs great on Elementary OS (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS).			"

It is an old game and in a lot of ways it really shows, it's really not all the complex, but it's got a fun mission-based bite sized approach and the gold system it uses allows for experimenting without being punished. A cheap and surprisingly solid little hack and slasher.			"

												Fun Hack and Slash action adventure with that certain Conan the Barbarian fantasy pulp feel.Evil is afoot or whatever so you kill stuff. Theres no leveling, you pick up gold in the levels which after completion gets added to a total you use to not really but kinda buy and sell - its more of a point limit you get to spend on equipment. For example with 100 gold you could equip a sword and armor for both 50 or a bow for 100. Theres usually one checkpoint each level (no quicksaves) and dieing means losing 10 gold - if you manage to find the checkpoint, else game over.Theres multiple character types to unlock altho some are just straight upgrades (in one case not strangely).Levels are well designed and varied, for such an old game it really looks amazing if you put all the sliders to the right. Gameplaywise it starts out abit slow but picks up pace along with higher difficulty. Melee fighting is rather simplistic tho, you can block and do a 3 strike combo. Something seems off with hitboxes, i had attacks whiff which really should have connected, this is especially noticeable using bows and such in very close range, shots pass right thru enemies if you dont aim at their feet or in first person. Annyoing but workable.Other minor cons:- very crashy if not in XP compatibility mode which breaks the steam overlay- rename or delete install.vdf in the reg folder in the games folder or have a steam store page for some♥♥♥♥♥♥open each time you start thisIf you remember Severance: Blade of Darkness - this is kinda a lite version.

												Before you make your descision on buying it or not it is VERY IMPORTANT to know that this game came out in over 10 years ago, in 2003(?), meaning that if you need your fix for high graphics, walk away now. It's not that they are bad or are comparable to a game like Nidhogg, however you are able to see it's age by all of the flat and repeating textures, lack of any anti alising and even a few very pixely items.It also has to be mentioned that the menus do not have mouse support, meaning you have to use the arrow keys, Enter and Esc to navigate the menus.That being said Enclave can be a fairly fun experience if you enjoy it's combat and exploration, the only problem being that the combat is very simple, somewhat cluncky and even unreliable as far as the hitboxes go when it comes to using ranged weapons close up to enemies. No matter who you choose to play as (will be explained upon better later in the review) it feels like an M1 spam fest as that is your only way of attacking with your sword/axe/hammer/dagger. Your other other ways of doing damage is (depending on the character) by pulling out your crossbow/bow/staff, and pressing M1. For it's time it was OK however in a day and age where we have a long list of games with numerous abilities and ways of doing damage, Enclave begins to show it's age. Though it has to be said that the combat is fairly satisfying. When you pull off a combo (depending on the weapon, M1 x Type Of Melee Weapon) the last hit will do double damage, and even give the attack splash damage so any nearby enemy will also take damage. This alone isn't much, but paired with a nice 'smashing' sound and a little bit of screen shake, it truely does feel good when you finish off multiple enemies with your final swing.Exploration is a different story, whereas the age of Enclave has been hurting it, Enclave shows how older games did their exploration and it made you want to explore the land you were put in. When you start a mission you are put inside a medium/large sized area where there are a number of pickups that will become extremely important in your journey through each level, and ultimately the game itself. You will come across ammo pick ups for your crossbow/bow (may you have one on you or not), health potions, checkpoints and even gold. The health potions and ammo are given and taken away on a mission by mission basis, where you can find 3 potions in a mission, however they will be taken away after the mission is over.The gold on the other hand is collected and kept for a equipment screen you will use before each mission. When you select your mission, you will be given the option of who you want to use for that mission. Each character has their own loadout (the Druid is the only one who can use staffs, etc.) that you can fill up, which is where the gold comes into play. You use the gold as more of a borrowing system then a buying system seeing as you choose your items from the equipment screen by just swapping through them, taking or returning gold depending on the quaility/quantity of the item. An easier way of thinking of it is by switching out gold with a weight system. Instead of gaining +5 gold, you picked up +5 max weight, allowing you to use better/more weapons/armour/ammo/health potions. The better equipment comes back to help you complete more difficult missions and get more gold.If you enjoyed playing through the game once then you will be very happy to know that there are actually TWO campaigns to Enclave, the Light side where you face the forces of evil, and a more difficult Dark campaign where you face the forces of good. Besides that there are hoard mode missions on both sides of of the game where you face increasingly difficult groups of enemies to gain gold for the main missions and other hoard missions. These missions can be found by finding maps in the main missions which will open up a new spot on the mission select screen.All in all, Enclave can be a fun game if you can get past the fact that it's over 10 years old and has nearly everything that comes with it being old. Personally I wouldn't buy it for $5.00 US dollars, but if you can get it while it's on sale (75%+), then I would recommend giving it at least an hour of your time just so you can at least experience what Enclave has to offer. It's not a bad game, it's just dated.			"

												It's fun, but there are some really cheesy issues.  Aiming is awful, and even if your reticle ""guarantees"" a hit by turning red, you may still miss.  There are some suddenly falling floors or traps in the game that lead to instant death, which is fairly sinful in a game that requires you start the entire stage over upon character death.  Melee attacking has its own problems too, in that every encounter is basically a slap fight with weapons.  Hit detection is iffy and any nuance like spacing or positioning is out the window.  Click, click, click.  Beyond that, the game is still fun and looks ok, player models aside. I can't recommend this to anyone but the morbidly interested.   It's not all bad, but it would have been a 6/10 in 2002.  If you just need something to play, then maybe go for it?  Or work on your backlog first, you lazy bum.			"

												Honestly, i wanted to like this so bad. I love older games and this sort of clunky rpg is my childhood and i wanted to love this so much. But i cannot recommend this game unfortunately.PROS:•Good voice acting (when comparing to when the game was made the voice acting is actually quite top notch)•Easy to learn controls (and actually having to hit them with your blade)CONS:•Terrible console port that just feels half arsed•Lack of interactivity•A lack of explanation around certain thingsI wanted to like this... i just don't.

												Bought it during the halloween sale for less than a dollar and, considering the number of positive reviews, it really looked like a good deal. Well, I decided to write this review so you won't be fooled by the people who say the game is awesome and looks good even for 2014 standards. That's not true at all. In fact, the graphics are really, really outdated. I could live with that, but unfortunately this game has a number of serious and infuriating issues.First, they use a script to shove ADs down your throat. EVERY TIME you click the ""Play"" button, it will open a browser tab and show the steam page for a different game from the same company. That could create a stupid situation in which you have the game loading in the foreground and a video loading in the background at the same time - IF I could get the game to load right from start. For some reason, though, I have to kill the game process and start it again, otherwise the game simply won't open. As a result, it will load the same steam page TWICE. Can we have a round of applause for that awful business decision? They managed to make me hate their company even before I could load up the game for the first time, and that is something not even Electronic Arts had done before. Impressive. Well, after actually loading the game, I found out it's quite generic and unimaginative. There's some loooong narration to set the scenario but it's not particularlly interesting or engaging. The battles are boring and repetitive. Run up to an enemy, hit him, step back. Rinse, repeat. And you'll have to repeat that a lot, because the hit boxes are very small and it's very common to miss swings that should have connected.I couldn't feel a real sense of progression. There are no shopkeepers, but you can buy your equipment from a virtual shop before starting a mission. Didn't find any loot besides coin, potion and the starting sword/shield. There's a limited amount of money you can find in each level too. So far the game looks ugly and boring, but those are subjective aspects and they might not prevent you from actually enjoying Enclave. However, there is a very objective issue that can and most likely will ruin your day.  Enclave has a tendency to crash with a message that says ""UNRECOVERABLE ERROR FOUND, press any key to close"". It can happen anywhere, any time, for any reason or for no reason at all. Well, if you're thinking ""I could live with the occasional crash"", think again, because you cannot save the game. There are a few checkpoints scattered around the maps and you will respawn in one of them if you die, but if the game crashes, all your progress is lost - you will have to restart the mission from the beginning. All the puzzles, all the enemies, all the traps and doors - you will have to do everything again. Unfortunately, the game crashes frequently. It happened six times in the two hours I tried to play. I wanted to keep going but it felt like a chore and I wasn't having fun anymore. I didn't have great expectations (it was only a dollar after all), but  Enclave still managed to let me down. I can't in good faith recommend this game.			"

												If you look for a good RPG/ARPG or Hack-n-slash - you've taken a wrong turn.First and only reason why is game is not even remotely worth your attention - this is a bad port from original xbox game.1) There's no proper gamepad support, at least I didn't manage to make it usable with both x-input and d-input. What make matters worse - game doesn't react to keyboard keys bound to gamepad buttons, so I had to stick with mouse + KB. And yes, you cannot use mouse in main menu (makes sense since it's a console game in first place).2) The gameplay itself constantly suffers from random camera spins, random teleportation of your character and sometimes illogical reaction to commands - it can react slowly to button presses, it can execute your attacks way faster than usual. Hitboxes are quite off as well, in fact they are so off from visuals that it's obvious just a few minutes into the game.I see no point in describing the gameplay itself since I didn't see much, the only thing I can point out is that the combat is really too simple and narrows down to some kind of hit-n-run M1 spam, ranged weapons are almost unusable due to technical issues described earlier. Character development is also pretty much non-existent. Probably was okay for 2003, but now I'd not recommend playing it.			"

												tl;dr version first:+ Solid graphics that aged pretty well+ Serviceable music+ Okay level design(Yes, the only positives are still just ""OK"" and not great...)- Literally everything else:- Terrible clunky controls- Overly simplistic and boring combat- Generic medieval fantasy setting- Even more generic story- Voice acting ranges between mediocre to comically badDetailed version:Someone gifted me a free key, so I went in with an open mind and low standards, and... it's still pretty terrible. I absolutely don't mind older games, and still play games from several generations ago and still enjoy them, but this is beyond janky. The controls are atrocious, even for the time. Older games like Soul Reaver and Ocarina of Time still manage to have fluid and serviceable melee combat and character movement and they aren't even necessarily purely combat-driven; this  is a hack-and-slash with little else than combat, yet it moves horribly stiffly, the hack and slash combat is repetitive and boring, and the hitboxes are a total joke. Ranged combat is even worse, aiming is clunky and painful. I didn't even get far enough to try any kind of magic, though I unlocked a druidess (who honestly looked more like a stripper than any kind of priestess or adventurer) but I was too bored to bother continuing.I don't know why this is tagged as an RPG, this is a hack-and-slash action/adventure game (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I love those too, but don't go in expecting an RPG); there are no RPG elements such as stats, character progression, looting, story choices, etc. Missions are linear; you buy the best loadout you can afford, and go in (again I don't have a problem with that kind of structure, but don't expect tons of exploration or non-linear progression or anything like that), and levels are short, with okay level design I guess. The only gameplay element are killing boring monsters, sometimes jumping, and picking up gold and keys or flipping switches. Oh yeah, the second mission is an escort mission, and gods help you if the NPC AI decides to walk in straight into the monsters and get himself killed. Because yep, that can happen. Oh, you activated a checkpoint, and died? Cool, you lose a bit of gold, but respawn with everything else exactly as is, which in theory would be fine except... meanwhile monsters are attacking your NPC escort and you've failed the mission before getting back to where you were.  Oops?Don't waste your time on this mediocrity. Even if you're really really starving for an old-school hack-and-slash game, there are tons of better options out there. Like, say, any of the Ys games, or Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, Salt and Sanctuary, hell even the otherwise mediocre Bound By Flame and Lord of the Fallen are still much better than this.			"

												It's a nice old game. The combat system works. No glitches so far. a mix of 3rd person hack & slash and a 1st person shooter. so far I have unlocked three characters warrior, archer, druid.... despite classes they are the same, just use different weapons. The gold serves as a sort of an XP system here... before each mission you can pick one character and use gold to choose their weapons... the higher the price the better the weapon... gold stacks up for the party and doesn't dissapear. so after each mission you have more gold for more equipment. there is at least one arena location with waves of ennemies and different difficulties.... all in all it's not a bad game from the old days... graphics are dated and so are the game mechanics but for the sake of old times I'd give this 7/10 Play it!!!

												I am sorry to say this, but this is either the most broken game out of my selection or just the most un-directed game.What i mean:On the first level, the game did not tell you anything (besides from how to draw your weapons).I was practicly stuck on the first level for roughly 30 min. because i did not know what to do next. Also thought it was a glitch so i restarted it many times aswell.PS- I finally found that there was a lever that was at the first room with out any hint that it was there, besides from spamming MC2 (the use button in this game)On the second level, the main idea from the ""compainion"" was that you needed to defeat a few, easy monsters, simple right? Well yeah they were easy, but after you defeated them i could not go anyware, only advice from the so called ""compainion"" was ""We need to protect the Outpost!"" Well, ok, lets go! But there was nothing there, not even a letter or another monster to lead way, NOTHING! You could not go back where you came from or open or destroy any doors, so what then? Well i wasted another, rough 30 min (In my opinion) looking for something, and because i am pretty tolerant towards games i, restarted it many times to see if it was a glitch. NOPE . . .Disappointed in this game, had hopes for it.Although there are Pro's and Con's with every game here are a few i can sayPro'sConstant 60fps Note bad graphics for 2003Unique game style (names areas and ect.)Fast load time*For you to decide*Con'sNo help (beside from ""what buttons do what"")Short areasBad voice actors (sounds dull and not into the game style)Either buggy or hard (could just be me)*For you to decide*PS- These are just my opinions so do not take offence to this if you enjoy this game!

												Experience incredibly atmospheric and intense medieval combat action! Go ahead and enter a new world, the award-winning world of ENCLAVE! The people of Light and Darkness are divided by a bottomless rift that split the earth many millennia ago. The lands of light are an Enclave of truth and order surrounded by the twisted and barren lands of the dark, known as the Outlands. Over the centuries the rift has started to close…And now it is only a matter of time before the forces of Light and Darkness will clash in an unprecedented, merciless struggle for survival! Remember... When a storm comes up, for some it’s better to keep out of its way… while for others it’s time to block its path! Русификатор: {LINK REMOVED}http://yadi.sk/d/PedUzf3xBkLv6 "

												One of those games where my memories of it were WAY better. Its too hard to get past the awkward ""oldness"" that permeates the game at every level. The crummy UI, ultra-shallow combat, imbalances, and the missions that fail to ""pull you in"" story-wise all just make the game feel dead and empty.Granted its usually on sale for less than a dollar. But mark my words. If you buy this, you'll be like ""man i should have spent that dollar on something else.""			"

												I already owned the game before I added it to Steam. For the time it was made the graphics were amazing and still hold their weight  today. Textures are crisp and I can play this game at 1080p with no issue, the only downside is FoV is locked, though at 95 it isn't that bad.  Story progression is ok. Light vs Dark and a rift that divides both. Unfortunately the rift is shrinking and both sides are now butting heads. I only wish the characters you meet in playing through the game had at least some back story or names, rather than just Warrior, Druid, Halfling, etc.. Combat is fine. Melee combat offers 3 weapon classes, Sword, Axe and Hammer.  Melee weapons also have some form of a combo in where if you swing successively 3 times it produces an end effect. Bows offer a wide range of ammunition from sniper bolts which lets you zoom in at far away targets, standard bolts that allow you to stack them up for a burst shot, fire bolts for damage over time, and explosive bolts for aoe damage. Crossbows are your medium ranged weapon and can be used by both ranged and melee classes. Staffs used by your mages offer a standard attack, close ranged aoe attack, and a shield to block melee and ranged hits.Character customization goes as far as how much gold you've collected in your play through. Gold acts a point system and it's scattered throughout the game world, some in pots and others in the form of gems.  The more gold you've collected the better things you can equip. This can range from better armor, weapons, shields, staffs, more ammo for bows, etc... I would say your bow users as well as your engineers/bombardiers are more demanding in gold requirements due to how much stuff they can equip while other classes like warriors don't require much at all. Gold you've collected stays with you for your entire progression. Also collecting it all awards something special in the end.The only sad part about this game is there's no multiplayer, which at the time would have been great as it looks like it could have supported at least 4 players (Just judging by the wave levels in the campaign). All in all it's a good game.I also still hope for an Enclave 2.			"

MechanicsHave you ever swung a sword in a zero-grav environment? Well it feels that way, You do get used to it super fast and it's easy to look past.The movement/Mouse movement is actually really decent and better than I expected.Graphics & SoundsThe graphics are amazing for a game port that's over 10 years old! I personally adore the art/graphic styles.The shading is nice, the blood, and the enemies look nice as well! I'm actually very pleased with the ""new"" feel to it.The only issue with the graphics I have is they seem to degrade during cutscenes.I also dislike how the main menu screen is in a 4:3 ratio though if you have a 1080p res.The sounds are perfectly okay in my book for the type of game/way it was put together.GameplayThe story so far is nice and enjoyable, however it is very easy to get lost and no real indication that certain environment elements can harm you. (Which I love that, but I'd like a tiny heads up.)I spent my time feeling like I was playing a maze game running around trying to find the next area to enter. (I could just be blind.)I also find it funny that the goblins speak Swedish.OverallFor 5$ it's worth it, I'm enjoying it and I'll be returning to playing it shortly for the story.			"

												I got this game for free off of DLH. It's a very old game (2002), and I'm mindful of that. It doesn't even seem to register that my mouse is there. My mouse is a Logitech (#1 brand, mind you) track ball. I'm fairly sure I bought it circa 2004. I've heard about the game having issues with newer laser mice, but with an eleven-year-old (optical) trackball? This thing works fine with DOS games, Win16 games, DirectX, Flash games, you name it. If a game can't deal with my aging USB mouse, there's probably something fairly wrong with said game.* My trackball IS attached to my keyboard's inbuilt USB hub, that's the only rationale I can imagine. Thing is, with the game being published in 2002, it HAS TO be a Windows app and not the last of the DOS games, right? Anyways, I'm uninstalling and giving it a thumbs down.			"

												I already owned the game before I added it to Steam. For the time it was made the graphics were amazing and still hold their weight  today. Textures are crisp and I can play this game at 1080p with no issue, the only downside is FoV is locked, though at 95 it isn't that bad.  Story progression is ok. Light vs Dark and a rift that divides both. Unfortunately the rift is shrinking and both sides are now butting heads. I only wish the characters you meet in playing through the game had at least some back story or names, rather than just Warrior, Druid, Halfling, etc.. Combat is fine. Melee combat offers 3 weapon classes, Sword, Axe and Hammer.  Melee weapons also have some form of a combo in where if you swing successively 3 times it produces an end effect. Bows offer a wide range of ammunition from sniper bolts which lets you zoom in at far away targets, standard bolts that allow you to stack them up for a burst shot, fire bolts for damage over time, and explosive bolts for aoe damage. Crossbows are your medium ranged weapon and can be used by both ranged and melee classes. Staffs used by your mages offer a standard attack, close ranged aoe attack, and a shield to block melee and ranged hits.Character customization goes as far as how much gold you've collected in your play through. Gold acts a point system and it's scattered throughout the game world, some in pots and others in the form of gems.  The more gold you've collected the better things you can equip. This can range from better armor, weapons, shields, staffs, more ammo for bows, etc... I would say your bow users as well as your engineers/bombardiers are more demanding in gold requirements due to how much stuff they can equip while other classes like warriors don't require much at all. Gold you've collected stays with you for your entire progression. Also collecting it all awards something special in the end.The only sad part about this game is there's no multiplayer, which at the time would have been great as it looks like it could have supported at least 4 players (Just judging by the wave levels in the campaign). All in all it's a good game.I also still hope for an Enclave 2.			"

												This game is 13 years old and by today's standard I think it is pretty decent overall. It takes me 10 hours to finish both light and dark campaigns and although the graphics is outdated but it is still fun to play. Some flaws here and there but can be ignored. I got it for free and it even has trading cards so that is a plus.			"

												Underrated Gem. A game says it's a hack & slash while actually being a hack & slash, no quick-time events, no uber-special moves that will kill all the enemies in an instant. In order to win at this game you have to be good at dodgeing, parrying and attacking, interractive fights.			"

												7/10 - An enclave you'll not regret to visit.Got this game in a bundle and what a pleasant surprise! Everything about this game is retro in the best possible way. The map design, the models, the graphics, the effects - it all has that 00s charm from games that made the best out of technical limitations.++PROS++ +The maps are actually pretty small but with every design trick in the book (the one still used for Half-Life maps) you can run around quite long until you've been to every corner. Maps are very diverse from temples, dungeons and caves over castles and even whole villages but due to the small size there are no wilderness areas.+Combat is rather demanding with melee weapons, bows and spells. Everytime you thought you found a working routine a new kind of enemy or tactical situation makes you throw it over board again.+There is a lot of action apart from combat, your character can swim, dive, jump ledges, climb ladders, and pull levers. There are several TR-like puzzles and on occassion you can use physics to kill enemies.+The menu is simple and accessbile and the controls work properly most of the time.+You get additional characters along the way (who sometimes accompany you in the maps you find them) and you can choose for each new map which cahracter should tackle it--CONS---The game is completely railroaded. Everytime you finish a map,a new one gets available.- Some of the characters you get to use are pretty useless- The range of equipment (different for most characters) is very underwhelming and there is actually not much choice how a character is equipped at every stage of the game- Sound effects are not good, Mostly a torch or waterfall is as loud in the next room as it was standing in front of it only to vanish completely once you're far away enough.- After a dozen maps or so it gets a little repetetive, I admit I haven't played it to the end.All in all I had a lot of fun and I can recommend it as one of the games to can play if you just have an hour or two and want some fast&fun action in between.

Back then it was a good game 8/10.			"

												Go to Store (Featured), Click on Games, Narrow by Feature (Steam Trading Cards), Relevance (Lowest Price).Then skip to Page 9 or 10, until you find the .50 - $1.00 games.Add them to your Wishlist, games that are a dollar can go on sale and you may be able to purchase for cheap!A game at .50 may give you that value back in trading cards.Search and Install ""Idle Master"" which will run your games even without the game being installed.I may or may not ever play this game, but some games I have installed and messed around with on a rainy day!@ .50-$1.00 it's hard not to recommend!

												I can recommend this game for 2 reasons. First, you can literally get this game for free at DHL.net. No scam, no identity theft. The PC news website Rock, Paper, Shotgun even tested this. Second, it's hack-and-slash elements are reminiscent of a simpler time in video games. Graphics are poor, and sometimes the gameplay is repetitive. I would rate 6/10, only get for free on that website, or on a sale.			"

												     Quite an outstanding game! It has a perfect balance of Storyline and gameplay, but i does have a lack of tutorial. You will be aimlessly swinging your knights sword trying to figure out where the perfect point is. For being an old game, it has amazing graphics! Once you reach an area with lava, you will not mind being killed by enemies as the wonderfully colorful lava distracts you. This game has its surprises like random goblins and orcs jumping out of windows and bushes to try and scare you a bit, so it's never a dull moment.  Overall, i recommend picking this game up, you won't regret it!			"

												In general, the first toy seems very interesting. But in the future quickly tired of the lack of diversity. I can not advise to play it, but the taste and color of comrades there. Who will explain why.1. First and foremost, probably minus in the game - the standard plot. To describe it, I will not, for those who are interested - Will play will understand what I mean. The storyline does not cling, do not have enough of its disclosure and understandable narrative scheme, which is why the game is lost meaning and the essence of our actions.2. Graphics. Yes, I do not argue, in the gaming industry can not complain on the schedule, but even in the same Serious Sam she was better.3. The same type of combat system. Oh, this is generally a separate topic. Where have you seen a blunt poking the mouse button? Your gerogy will produce the same attack, no matter where your opponent to what he outfit, its growth, and so on.4. Gameplay. In general, what can be said about the gameplay ... He is not. And it did not exist. Maps are based on the same scheme, the world is boring and monotonous.And finally, 5. Artificial Intelligence. Guys, local AI is so stupid that, I'm sorry of course, children 4 years of age are smarter than NPC here.So, what I say Mogo. Ten criteria.1. Theme. -2. Gameplay. -3. Artificial Intelligence. -4. World. -5. Graphics. -6. Musical arrangement (the only thing that I somehow liked it). +7. Interest. -8. playability. -9. To kill time. +10. Spend money on something worthwhile. -Total 2/10.			"

												Ugh, this game...*In Jontrons voice* OOOHHHHHHHH! I picked it up for a buck, because why not, ya know? I saw the graphics, and said ""Wow, this looks really good for 2003!"" Well, looks and plays are two different things, my friend.To compliment this game, yes, it actually has very nice visuals. Nothing groundbreaking by todays standards, but for its time, they were pretty good. Aside from that? This is kinda terrible. But! it does fall under ""So bad, it's good"". The combat is just an M1 fest, with absolutely no strategy. Simplicity is one thing, but this is pretty braindead. Enemies either just stand there and take it or run. Actually, I gotta say, the combat reminds me of Kings Field on ps1...all the bad aspects of it. Run forward, slash once or twice, step backward, repeat. It's incredibily dull, to say the least. Oh, and hit collision is choppy.Not much to say about music or voice acting, nothing stood out. Nothing good, nothing horrible, it's all just kind of...there. The game is very linear. Now, I actually don't have a problem with a game being linear. However, this game is insultingly linear. Not Hallway Simulator 13 linear, mind you, but pretty damn close. Overall, Enclave feels kinda like the testing stages for a game. Like, they just finished the engine, impleminted the basic features, but shipped it out before it could be polished up. I guess I could compare it to a beat-em up, but without the satisfaction from said beating up. Can't say I recommened, Enclave, unless you feel like burning a dollar while it's on sale.			"

So yeah if you aren't a cuck and you got a buck (or $4.99), go ahead and give this one a whirl.My only complaint so far is the enemies are pretty small. I mean yeah they have muscles, but it's really easy to build mass on a midget frame. I'd like some bigger enemies please. I still recommend this game though			"

												I got this game for free, This game is more like, a i cant really put this in words, but ok so you start off not knowing what your doing (because like me you skip the cutsences of EVERYTHING) and then out of no where the building start to break you dont have a choice but then you notice a lever you flip the lever, and you find a sewer thing wanna be, but anyways you fight these wanna be ""zombies"" and  then you have to find keys and all that and find your way out, play 16 minutes not my type of game but for me it was free, i was bored, and i just wanted to play a game, Hope you have fun if you buy it, it you dont i told you the beginning so yeah dont say ""Oh this guy said it was good"" sort of i said its NOT my type of game but i got it for free, Enjoy it if you buy it, find a different game to buy and play.

The people of Light and Darkness are divided by a bottomless rift that split the earth many millennia ago.I have to be honest with you guys, The first few hours of the game, i loved it but after that, i didin't like it that much. So i am afraid i can't recommend this. I Just can't, it's superb gameplay for the first few hours but then it just starts getting boring.The graphics are good keeping in mind this game was made in 2003.5/10 Disappointed.			"

												Enclave is clearly a ported console game from a different generation.  While it permits key mapping, it fails to allow the player to save where they want; instead, it comes in episodes that must be finished before one's place is saved.The game fails to make much use of the mouse, relying largely on the mouse buttons to hit stuff and do things, while movement is keyboard based.  The game has ""gold"" scattered around each section, and keeps track of how much is available vs. how much the player has collected in some action game-esque scorekeeping.The real annoyance remains the ""on-the-rails"" style of play that Enclave delivers.  It's pretty, it seems to have its heart in the right place, but it gives the player no freedom.  One quest at a time, with marks for how much gold you collect, and then on to the next.  You cannot even open a door until the necessary trigger event(s) have been completed.To be honest, this is really not a game that I would call an RPG.  Action, yes.  Adventure, sure.  But it lacks most of what makes a good RPG - including multiple active quests and ability to stray from the path.  I didn't even see character building in the short time I spent in the Enclave world.I had such high hopes for this game, but it is time to resume the search for a good RPG.			"

												Couldn't play the game when it was first released over 13 years ago.Jumping right into it when I found a free key of it!So far, this game was as enchanting to me as I first remember wanting it more than a decade ago. It has a graphic that fairly aged well, and an interesting story line.I would recommend this game to any of you that like an Action-RPG game, like an alternative-medieval-aged-based game a la Lord of The Ring, or both of above!And if you'd like see more gameplay footage before deciding on the game, I'm having a Let's Play Series just right here!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0LwcUqbaZcqO3LA_N2cy7g "

												Enclave was one of Starbreeze's very first titles, and it kind of shows in a lot of ways.The game is an extremely average hack and slash. It focuses on combat exclusively, the plot is just there to change the set pieces, and it has two campaigns. The more interesting one of the two, the Dark campaign, is not open to you until you complete the game once over.It's more or less one of those games that time forgot, and not one I'm particularly sad that it happened.

												I am thumbs downing because of my overall experience and the hassles of trying to get this game to run without crashing. I would have given it a thumbs up otherwise because the game is fun, based off the little amount I was able to play. This recommendation is based off my own experiences with the game. If you can get this game to run fine without problems, then that's great since it is a pretty decent game.My full overview and opinions on this game is in my Steam Backlog series:

												This game plays and feels like a proto Dark Souls style of game in the sense that death is meaningful but not too harsh and it being a kind of third person character game. Melee seems to be the only choice and the ranged combat is really finicky; as if something was lost in translation from its original console port over to PC. What makes the ranged combat difficult leads into a positive I found in the melee combat. Though many enemies are melee based they don't simply run straight at you and play as if it's a multiplayer melee combat where they'll constantly zig zag to avoid ranged attacks and circle strafe/ dodge in melee combat. Unfortunately this leads to the Elder Scrolls style of combat where I'm diving in and back-peddling to avoid hits; this makes up the majority of the combat I've played.			"

												Outdated, and lacks a lot of RPG gameplay elements.I get that this is an old game and all, but if you're going to release it on Steam, you should really add in better support for 16:9 monitors, and the lack of mouse support on the menu interfaces in beyond disapointing as well. As for the gameplay, it's pretty boring. Seems like nothing but platforming and killing stuff, which gets pretty old pretty fast. A lot of elements I'm used to seeing in RPGs (Mostly the Elder Scrolls series) are nonexistant, and I wouldn't say it was worth the money.While I was given a key for this game for free for signing up on some forum (Don't remember which one), I'm not even sure if I can say it was worth wasting the time to sign up on that forum as a result of what I've seen.2/10 - Not even worth the hard drive space.

												I had high expectations. Maby too high expectations. I regret buying this game on so many levels. I have only played the first 15 minutes of this game. My first complaint is that the game is very glitchy. What I mean is that, I can't walk in a straight line because the game keeps teleporting me either in front of me or behind me. This is beyond annoying. My second major problem with the game is how clunky the gameplay is - it takes almost too long to swing a ♥♥♥♥ing sword and the AI is terrible. The voices of the characters is also very annoying and bad. This may be possibly the WORST game I have ever played on Steam. I am very dissapointed that I just wasted $5 on a game that I thought would be like Fable - an MMO, RPG (which what it was casted under) that I thought I could enjoy. The game starts off terrible too, you start off in a jail cell with an insane lady threatening to kill you. Then you get shot at with a giant catapult (the game is set in olden ages) and you have to escape through a hole. I won't spoil the rest. I get that this game was made awhile ago, but the game looks absolutely terrible. Even with all of the textures and normal video settings, the game looks terrible. I must also remind that the developers had absolutely no idea on what resolutions were. My moniter has a resolution of 1440x900 and when I switched to it, it gave me a resolution of 800x600 in a letterbox style. This was absolutely annoying to have to go through and find a decient resolution that didn't look half as bad. I could go on all day about how BAD this game was. Please, please, please don't waste your money on this game! 2/10			"

												Game has aged but it's still fun. Has a sort of arcade-y feel to it letting you have other character to play missions and replay them for more loot and gold. Get it on a big sale if you enjoy old style adventure fantasy games :)Haters are going to hate, especially those with crappy comps or who have not even hit 17 years old or older - everyone with a steam account thinks they are a big critic now-a-days and that their googled terms to post up a review may look impressive, but ignore it.

												Short version: this game is bad, don’t play it.Slightly longer version:  Do not buy this game, do not play this game.  The whole thing is clunky and awkward.  The animations for everything are awful.  The textures look like they belong in an edgy version of the original fable, and I don’t mean that in a good way (if you even think there is a good way to interpret that).  The combat is worse than many free to play rpgs.  The characters (to the point where I couldn’t take it anymore) were uninteresting.  The combat consisted of A. sniping enemies with ranged attacks and never fighting anything, or B. running forward at the enemy and left clicking.  There are many free to play games of much higher quality than this, play anything else.			"

I spent a few hours online looking for a fix, and saw that this was a common problem for PC's with multiple cores (which is pretty much all of them these days).I tried reconfiguring the config files, setting admin start, even setting the affinity to one processor core, but nothing worked. Sadly this game seems to be one of the older games Steam sells that just won't run.			"

												Was pretty awful, but it was 3 bucks.  You get what you pay for.   The gameplay was crud, I fell through a lot of stairs, or flew up them.  Felt like the character floated.  Didn't seem like there was much story, but that could just be because I couldn't get through more than 30 minutes with it.			"

The AI is abysmal. The maps are way too small to be THAT confusing. The combat is some of the worst I have ever seem in my entire life. Seriously, I'd rather play Skyrim with no weapons or magic on a Commodore 64 than go through another 5 minutes of this mess they call a combat system.And I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ over when this game was released, There's no way those lightining effects were acceptable, and I'm not one to look too deeply into graphics.I have nothing to recommend about this game.NOTHING			"

												I have never played a worst game in my entire 21 years on this beautiful space rock. To subject yourself to the absolute depressing abyss that is Enclave is equal to being thrown into a psychotic blind rage and killing everyone on earth. Afterwards coming to your senses in a field full of their cold corpses, having built a small hut in the middle of it and adorned it with their entrails and various bits of clothing.To even be subconsciously aware that this title exists is pure and visceral pain that I cannot repress. All ye who enter here abandon hope.			"

												If not for the horrible combat this would be a good game from 2003. But the combat has some of the worst hit detection I have ever seen in a game in my life. It does not matter if you can see your sword blade hitting the enemy. You wont hit it unless an enemy is directly in front of you, and I mean DIRECTLY in a very thin line hit box, and you are so close to it you are touching it. The combat is laughably bad anyway. Just really generic and has no substance at all. The combat is so laughably generic I kept laughing at how it just feels like the very baasic 0's and 1's binary code for an atari game. The ONE THING this game has going for it is that amazingly for a game from 2003 it has vsync and supports 1920x1080. Blows my mind a game that old supports that res unless it was updated since 2003. It also installed and played fine with no technical issues at all, unless you count the fact that the game sucks balls as a technical issue, which I do. If the game sucks so bad you can't stand to play it, that is a stand out technical issue.3/10.			"

												Not horrible, but poorly made. You get more characters as the game goes on that carry different gear, otherwise they are all the same. There is no leveling, just new gear.  The new gear isn't always better, just more expenive.  There's no stats on any of the gear, just guess.  It is hard to hit targets, as they jump around like some kind of multi-player game.  Your jump however is very limited and painful to get on a box or jump a hole that will kill you.  Jumping looks very awkward, and is also required in every level of the game.  The melee fighting sucks the most, just use a crossbow or a staff. The story is stupid, just skip that and play. You basically get thrown into fighting and collecting money, without teaching you how to do much. Traps will kill you, and appear without reason, so use your psycic ability(not real).  There are checkpoints, costs money to revive, unless you haven't found one, then restart map. So it's a cheaply made game, bugs won't get fixed, it's too old.  It's not worth more than $1, and only if you're really bored.			"

												I was in the mood for a little early 2000s hack-and-slash. Saw enclave and thought 'why not' ?Well? Its a mediocre game, but for about 10 minutes it seemed mildly amusing. Then i got to a part in section II where you kill an orc where there is a broken ladder. After killing the orc, I was trapped in a snall room! After about 10 minutes of frustration: I looked online. Apparently the orc is supposed to drop a key. Well? No key.That means: the game is literally broken. Don't buy it.			"

												A very cheap linear pseudo-RPG. You play a guy, run him through a level, collect coins and stuff and unlock Characters. Starting the next Level you can select a Character, its equipment and give him/her potions, etc..This could be a very fun game but the combat system is worse than the graphics look, which for a game like this is very bad. I'm not very far in, but that is because the game isn't really engaging either! Also would the one factor to return be that it's some good brainless fun - but that would require the combat system to be  entertaining. It is, if you're cynical though. The ""coins"" (money bags) are hidden so cheaply within all in all very badly designed Levels that it doesn't feel like an achievement at the end of the Level and doesn't really add a lot of replay value because that would require one to play a Level again! Yes - as bad as that!You need to be desperate to play this game, then you may enjoy it for a while.			"

The Shadows are glitching and sometimes I am stuck in the Wall. It looks like a nice game but its really buggy and unplayable. Don't waste your money.			"

												Looks and plays like a trashy PlayStation game from the nineties. If you're looking for that, you found it.Music and sound are generic fluff. The voice acting is atrocious, and I just couldn't care about the story.The combat feels like the game isn't done yet. Colliision, animation, and weapon balance are all a mess.On the plus side, the controls are simple and rebindable, and some of the character designs are cute. "

												Yuck.. Just yuck!  I dont even want to take the time to do a proper review, as it was so bad... Terrible combat, and combat controls.. Its old, and  Not in a good way... In the way nostalgia allows Morrowind, or Baldurs Gate, Or Dragon Age, Icewind Dale, or any other childhood favorie/classic to remain playable, and more importantly, enjoyable still today, this does not.. Nor can I imagine this having ever been! Dont let the very misleading screenshots fool you.. You probably wont wanna play beyond the intro..Everything was little more than a narrow hallway.. Admittedly, i barely played an hour..So i couldnt even say if it gets better.. It was just.. I cant even put it into words.. If you tried that really bad Game of Thrones rpg, youll know what i mean by bad.. I have nothing good to say about it..			"

												The Good:- Great visuals for a game released in 2002- Good soundtrack (works well enough for the fantasy themes...)The Bad:- The combat system is pure garbage. Really bad hit detection thrown in with cheap enemies who seem to strike masses of damage while you struggle to even land a decent blow. - Enemy AI is crap (but it often helps me when they jump to their deaths...)- Storyline and voice acting is medicore. - No RPG systems in place whatsoever. Purely gear based (which is not a bad thing), but I am not convinced on its overall execution, as the game's emphasis on combat just doesnt come across as fun. The Verdict - A Polished Turd.Visuals and sound aside, I found little to actually enjoy from the gameplay. If you like this style of this game, go and play Risen, Gothic or Two Worlds instead... They are superior titles.  "

												Overall it's a very good game both graphically and gameplay wise. Though, if i had to say one thing bad about it, It would have to be along the lines of it lagging and speeding up randomly through the game making the casm clearing jumps very, very difficult. (My computer more than exceeds minimum and recommended specs) That would be my only complaint about the game. In every other aspect of the game you will be stunned at what you find. This game both looks beautiful (given the age of its graphics), sounds amazing, have much diversity with play (both how you play and what you play with character and weapon wise), and above all is it is cheap and easy to get a system to run it. I most definitly recommend this game to anyone that has $5 they want to spend on a game. I enjoy it and I wish for everyone else to enjoy it.			"

												Dont buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥unless from nostalgic reasons, I have never played this game before I bought it on steam:Pros:+ different classes+ coins collectibles makes exploring worthwhile (but this applies only for some people)+ relatively long gameplay (20+ hours I would say for most poeple, but I am doing all coins which sometimes require 3x - 4x restart because of cheap deaths - to collect all coins you must no die a single time)+ changing enviroment (mission from mission)Cons:- terrible camera, I have been in game for 5 minutes in 1st mission and already hated it- RPG? Where? Just get the best equipment and gogogo- actual combat, the worst meele combat I have chance to witnessed, the worst part of it - you are swinging your weapon against enemy and nothing happens unless you are very specifically turned towards your enemy, even though it looks like you should be hitting all enemies in radius of 90+ degrees (graphics) the reality is about from 30 - 40, for me the most frustrating part of this game- cheap deaths (applies for gold collectors only, fall into lava, pit etc., you just must restart whole level if you want 100% of gold coins)- AI - shooting with a crossbow/bow in this game is absolutely delightful (sarcasm) - AI jumps like mad (seriously you must see it to understand) and it is almost impossible, also stucks behind objects sometimes cant even follow you upstairs etc..Result: Mediocre, but those frustrating parts I have written down (camera, combat system...) will follow you throughout this whole game therefore -> not worth it (I have bought it for 0.99 Eur, so for this price it is decent)			"

												Classic and fun action game, yes as many have said this isnt really an RPG, its an action platform game and a good one. ( The genre tag was placed by users not the developer ) Its a solid action game with lots of combat and light platforming.                     The combat is loose ( not very precise ) but because hit detection is forgiving it makes combat fast and fun, and there is a good variety of weapons in the game to keep you interested. In fact variety is one of the games strengths, there are several characters you can play in the campaign and you can choose freely before every level which one you want to play and every character specializes in different weapons and attributes so they all are very different to play ( most have exclusive abilities. ) And the most unique part of the game, adding even more variety, is that there is a good and evil campaign and you can choose either one to play, this isnt just a gimmick either both campaigns have there very own story and levels. ( Each side has there own version of each class and character ) Speaking of those levels, level design is excellent. Levels are labrynth style with lots  of hidden gold to find and even if they are short they still provide exploration. Also the levels have a good amount going on with lots of scripted enviromental changes ( Such as falling walls and ceilings ) and props ( like shootable cannons ), the geometry is always changing from tight cordoors to wide open enviroments with lots of verticality such as muti-story buildings and archway bridges. Finally the enemy placement is great as well as you will be suprised often by enemies that hide around or rush around corners, down stairways, etc or how archers that nest up in high vantage points or off in the distance. Overall some good engaging level design.                 What also must be said is how good the game looks in 1080p concidering it is over 10 years old. Textures look great ( not quite as much if you get really close though ). Art design is amazing, all the architecture and details put into the enviroment surpass alot of games today and it has aged remarkably well, seriously what other game from 2002 looks this good today. The only gripe I have is that character models and animations are old and stiff, but still nothing too terrible.                 The game isnt perfect of coarse. A.I. can and will be dumb ( there are times that your enemy will just stand there and take hits especially if there are more than one enemy at a time ). The spending of gold is very strange as it is never actually expended but more a value of how much or with what a character is equiped with before they enter the level. Also the game only saves between levels and there are only a couple of checkpoint in level at most, if you die before you reach a checkpoint you will have to repeat everything you did in that level. The game has some balancing issues such as the sorceress character is overpowered as she is basically a machine gun spellcaster. But still this is a steal for 5$ and especially on sale.			"

												This game hasn't aged well. Admittedly, I didn't get very far into the game before stopping, but having hit a game-breaking bug quite quickly I couldn't be bothered to reload the level I was playing.The game is from 2003 according to the store page, and for a game of that time it actually looks fairly good. However, I found that whilst you could defend with a shield, most of your combat experience (at least as a ""Knight"") would involve furiously circle-strafing and mashing the LMB to hit the rather stupid AI opponents.The allied AI isn't much better. In the second mission I managed to lose a friendly AI that should have been following me, and in the third mission, the AI and the scenery bugged out, causing the AI I was escorting to get fatally stuck on a door.Finally, the vast majority of the story (from what I could tell) was relayed through skippable cutscenes, making it all to easy to lose track of what was going on. There was no obvious way to receive cues on the story whilst in the game itself either, making it quite hard to follow.Overall, the experience was somewhat frustrating, and I'd give this game a miss.

The Verdict - A Polished Turd.Visuals and sound aside, I found little to actually enjoy from the gameplay. If you like this style of this game, go and play Risen, Gothic or Two Worlds instead... They are superior titles.  "

												Dont buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥unless from nostalgic reasons, I have never played this game before I bought it on steam:Pros:+ different classes+ coins collectibles makes exploring worthwhile (but this applies only for some people)+ relatively long gameplay (20+ hours I would say for most poeple, but I am doing all coins which sometimes require 3x - 4x restart because of cheap deaths - to collect all coins you must no die a single time)+ changing enviroment (mission from mission)Cons:- terrible camera, I have been in game for 5 minutes in 1st mission and already hated it- RPG? Where? Just get the best equipment and gogogo- actual combat, the worst meele combat I have chance to witnessed, the worst part of it - you are swinging your weapon against enemy and nothing happens unless you are very specifically turned towards your enemy, even though it looks like you should be hitting all enemies in radius of 90+ degrees (graphics) the reality is about from 30 - 40, for me the most frustrating part of this game- cheap deaths (applies for gold collectors only, fall into lava, pit etc., you just must restart whole level if you want 100% of gold coins)- AI - shooting with a crossbow/bow in this game is absolutely delightful (sarcasm) - AI jumps like mad (seriously you must see it to understand) and it is almost impossible, also stucks behind objects sometimes cant even follow you upstairs etc..Result: Mediocre, but those frustrating parts I have written down (camera, combat system...) will follow you throughout this whole game therefore -> not worth it (I have bought it for 0.99 Eur, so for this price it is decent)			"

												I picked this game up off steam for 59p using the left over change in my wallet. i bought it thniking it was going to be one of those poorly made, cheap, crappy games you see lying at the bottom of the store, i was wrong. This game is fun, good looking, and runs great. The game features a wide range of linear missions to choose from including survival mode. each map has verious secrets and hidden places where you can find secret pickups to help aid you. You will spend most of your time exploring the wide path. The game also offers a fair amount of customisation. Their are multiple characters you can choose from, each having thier own abilities. Using the money you collected in the previous missions, you can buy new weapons such as hammers, swords, maces, axes, bows, crossbows. You can also buy new shields, armor and other equipment such as health and other items that you come across in the game. the gameplay is great but aiming the ranged weapons could use some improvement. The game also offers a good challenge. the game can also get very difficult from time to time. The checkpoints are also kind of spaced out too far though, with some mission being around 30-45 minuites long, only one checkpoint is usually placed in that map, making it very fustrating if you die. Overall i'm impressed, however, very rarely, the game just instantly closes and quits to the desktop without me doing annything, that can also be very fustrating as the game does not save during missions. This game is aging well, it runs well on my high end PC and my cheap, low end laptop. Besides that bug, this game is great, its not perfect, but at least its fun. Should you pick it up? for under £4, yes.			"

												Classic and fun action game, yes as many have said this isnt really an RPG, its an action platform game and a good one. ( The genre tag was placed by users not the developer ) Its a solid action game with lots of combat and light platforming.                     The combat is loose ( not very precise ) but because hit detection is forgiving it makes combat fast and fun, and there is a good variety of weapons in the game to keep you interested. In fact variety is one of the games strengths, there are several characters you can play in the campaign and you can choose freely before every level which one you want to play and every character specializes in different weapons and attributes so they all are very different to play ( most have exclusive abilities. ) And the most unique part of the game, adding even more variety, is that there is a good and evil campaign and you can choose either one to play, this isnt just a gimmick either both campaigns have there very own story and levels. ( Each side has there own version of each class and character ) Speaking of those levels, level design is excellent. Levels are labrynth style with lots  of hidden gold to find and even if they are short they still provide exploration. Also the levels have a good amount going on with lots of scripted enviromental changes ( Such as falling walls and ceilings ) and props ( like shootable cannons ), the geometry is always changing from tight cordoors to wide open enviroments with lots of verticality such as muti-story buildings and archway bridges. Finally the enemy placement is great as well as you will be suprised often by enemies that hide around or rush around corners, down stairways, etc or how archers that nest up in high vantage points or off in the distance. Overall some good engaging level design.                 What also must be said is how good the game looks in 1080p concidering it is over 10 years old. Textures look great ( not quite as much if you get really close though ). Art design is amazing, all the architecture and details put into the enviroment surpass alot of games today and it has aged remarkably well, seriously what other game from 2002 looks this good today. The only gripe I have is that character models and animations are old and stiff, but still nothing too terrible.                 The game isnt perfect of coarse. A.I. can and will be dumb ( there are times that your enemy will just stand there and take hits especially if there are more than one enemy at a time ). The spending of gold is very strange as it is never actually expended but more a value of how much or with what a character is equiped with before they enter the level. Also the game only saves between levels and there are only a couple of checkpoint in level at most, if you die before you reach a checkpoint you will have to repeat everything you did in that level. The game has some balancing issues such as the sorceress character is overpowered as she is basically a machine gun spellcaster. But still this is a steal for 5$ and especially on sale.			"

												Bought this game at a cut price; such a classic style Action RPG. Great combat, solid controls which are easy to learn and remember. Haven't got a controller to work with it yet, but with programs like XPadder, I don't see why it would be difficult; not necessary, but it shouldn't be too hard if you really dislike keyboard and mouse.The only downside is the low graphical quality; which is understandable when you consider the 2003 release date. Character models are pretty good for the age, but landscape textures are very blurred. Resolution goes up to 1080p, which is awesome, and for a port, the options menu is pretty detailed.I probably wouldn't recommend you buy this game at £3.99, since the game is so old now, that just sounds unnecessarily high. Like I said, I bought this in a sale and it cost me £1.			"

												This game is quite old, and yes, it crashes sometimes (Actually now seems fixed by removing v sync) frame rate is embarassing same is the camera angle, but still I think the game itself is quite enjoyable: Many characters to play with, many weapons, 2 different campaigns.The graphics are not that bad for a game of more than 10 years ago, and some effects and plot twists are almost surprising.It has even the right level of difficulty. In particular, it is damn hard to find all the coins in all levels, but doing so is unsuitable and annoying 'cause of backtracking.I am actually enjoying playing it again after so much time. It was one of the first game in bought as a 11 years old :')Totally worth it for 1 $ on Steam (actually 0,65 € in my country).75/100Update: Each time you start the game a browser page open up with raven cry page, really annoying !!

												While the game has aged rather well in a graphical sense, the game play and story are lack luster. The game feels very unbalanced at times, in some cases you can knock everything the game throws at you down, but in others your ♥♥♥♥ed.  The mechanics seem broken at times good luck landing a hit with a ranged weapon in close quarters or actually blocking your enemies attacks. Both the player and enemy hit boxes are broken, and the is coupled with the lack of balance is real a shame. The story is forgettable and generic, but it is nice that the player is given the option to choose a dark side story route.This game is really not worth the time or money, but if the opportunity presents itself and you can get the game for less than a dollar go for it.

												I read weird reviews about how the game tries to make pop-up ads come on, but as I saw myself and as someone else who I saw reviewd this game, it doesn't do that anymore. I don't even know why that's a big deal in the first place. Anyway, this game was kind of fun. It had its moments and it was surprisingly difficult. It suffered from a lot of gameplay and level design issues. At times the game mechancis made the experience frustrating, although in the end the hardest levels were not impossible, but required immense precision and determination in order to overcome the questionable gaming mechanics and level design. Like some other people said before; collecting gold is KEY. It's the only way to have good equipment in the game. Thankfully you can replay levels to collect more gold in order to have better equipment before moving on to the next level. Ther are 14 missions and I missed like 2000 gold, but I was able to get the best equipment for each character. Anyway, it's a good time waster if you wait for it to be on 95% off, like I did. Otherwise I don't think it's worth 4.99.			"

The game is split up into levels (is not open world).To compare with a game of similar age/price, I would recommend playing the original Mount & Blade instead of this. They're not exactly the same sort of game as this one is a story on rails and Mount & Blade is open world, but the latter is much better at a similar technological and price level.			"

												Another of my childhood classics. I played this alot more than Steam says due to the fact that I got it a long time ago thanks to a gaming magazine. This is a great example of a game that passed the test of time: both the graphics and the gameplay are amazing even by today`s standards.The combat is the meat of this game and everything blends in nicely. The weapons are AMAZING...swinging a giant orcish axe never felt so satisfying and being a stealthy assassin is just amazing due to the multitude of tools available (all the arrow types remind me of the Thief series). This game also has one of my all time favourite levels in video game history: the haunted mansion. Evading all the traps in that place was just amazing.There is not much more I could say about this game other than the fact that it`s a must have for all lovers of classic old games. If I`d use a raing system this would get a perfect 10 out of 10.			"

												I finished this game last night, and i certainly dont understand all the bad rep this game got when i got it.The game is very good, you hack and slash through the level and collect coin bags and gems stashed and hidden throughout the map to add funds to your ""campaign"" after a few levels you start getting more characters to use who can also benefit from those war funds.You can buy your characters weapons, shields, crossbows, bolts (for the crossbow), bows, arrows (i'll let you guess for what), oil flasks, bombs, magic staves, and armor. Not all characters can carry all this, it depends on their class.You first play as the good guys, and once you finish that campaign, you can turn the table and play as the bad guys which was very rewarding for me. The last few levels (end-game) were dissapointingly easy, but after the madness of missions 8 through 10, it was a welcome break.I totally recomend the game, you get a few days worth of fun (if you have a busy schedule like i do) for just 5$			"

												Nice graphics for the time,♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay for the ages.For it's era it has nice graphics and they knew that. They push the graphics all over your face. Every menu transition has overly elaborate and unnecessary transition animations. But now that it is a decade later and the graphics have aged all of these are just tedious instead. The game is an obvious console showcase title, and I could tell this was originally a console game just from the menu screen without prior knowledge. It just feels like a console game.Music is nothing special, I forget all about it about in 5 seconds as soon as I quit the game.Story is non-existant. Sure there is a huge plot dump with cutscenes and inter-mission logs but it is entirely forgettable. It's the most generic Good vs Evil plot ever. NPCs have no character and neither does the guy you control for that matter. And speaking of the guy you control, you can actually control many different types of classes. They unlock one by one after completing the first few missions. It's rather pointless since they all unlock just a few missions in.So you can choose what class you want to play as and by choose I mean choose Druid or suffer. Why? Because combat sucks. Hit detection is terrible. Picking an archer might sound nice but it is not so nice when you realize it is impossibile to hit enemies yet enemy archers have perfect aim. Even melee sucks, you just go next to and enemy and mash attack and maybe hit one third of the time. Hit detection is down right broken.The only class that is worth playing is the Druid because she has a staff that can cast ""homing magical bird missiles"" and summon a golem to fight for you (although don't expect golem to do much, the AI is terrible). Even homing missiles don't hit all the time, they just circle around the enemy and dissipate but it is your only choice if you want to beat this game without losing your♥♥♥♥♥♥over the stupid combat.But even with the Druid and her gamebreaking weapon, the game is still boring. Because the way the game is designed is more like a corridor shooter than anything else. There are no side objectives and absolutely ZERO exploration. In fact it does that annoying thing where if you steer of the road, it counts down and fails your mission, all because you wanted to get out of the linear path and maybe go for a swim.Levels are short and all you have to do is get to the next objective. If your objective doesn't include killing enemies you can just ignore them and go the next waypoint and beat the mission. One guy wrote that this game had varied mission. Phwahaha, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game has only ONE mission: Get to the objective area and kill enemies in your path if they block you from getting to the objective area. Every single mission is this. Even escort missions are like this. I didn't even have to escort the guy I was suppose to protect, I just ignored him and went to the waypoint and he turned out fine.Don't waste your time on this one, there are so many other games to play.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! It is a generic third person hack and slash that is only fun for the first level. Which only lasts about five minutes. To try and redeem itself the third level is... an escort mission. Escort missions are terrible, no one likes them, and this one is the worst. The merchant you have to protect takes insane amounts of damage from one enemy, and you are too far away to do anything about it because you move so slow. If you try to shoot at the enemy, good luck. All of the attacks only hit when they want to, and even then. The basic crossbow barely does any damage to the first enemies of the game.All in all. don't buy this game, even at 69 cents it's not worth anything close to that, and to think they are asking five dollars for the normal price is appalling. During the Christmas sale you can usually get Skyrim for seven dollars.Whatever you choose to do. Do not buy this game. It doesn't take much effort to figure out why this game is on sale for so little.			"

												I cannot, in good faith, reccomend this game to anyone. DO NOT BUY THIS FOR FULL PRICE.This game... It's basically a mixture between click-to-win simulator and resident evil's voice acting. Combine that with crossbows basically asking you to 360 noscope in order to ♥♥♥♥ing hit someone, and you have a jolly old time.Pros:-It plays! Hasn't crashed once...-Enemy variety, you verse literally the same 3 orc things until level 3, then you go up against a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of random people-FMV has gamecube graphics-Music only makes me want to kill someone after an hour-Theres customization? (after level 2, you can spend gold to get better weapons, but via ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu)Cons:-THIS GAME TAKES ITSELF WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. It'd be funny to watch if I wasn't busy--CLICKING TO WIN. This game's combat consists of swing sword until enemy dies, pull out your crossbow to try to shoot someone you can't swing your sword at, and jumping sometimes to vary the combat. Rinse and repeat.-Cutscenes are ""beautiful""-The story consists of Oblivian's ""break out of a dungeon"" trope mixed with doing stuff for the queen-Did mention the voice acting? It's nothing to shake a Jill sandwhich at, I can tell you-Cheap deaths from random♥♥♥♥♥pitfalls cause you to restart the entire level-Enemy AI consists of charging at you, then halo jumping away. Unless you go up against a ranged enemy, then its stay put until they try to shoot you, then spasm the ♥♥♥♥ around until they reload and attempt another shot.Overall I'd give this game aAtleast its not Bad Rats/10 "

												I don't know about the adware other people have been getting, as I haven't gotten it yet. So I will just point out that either the adware has been removed or I have a glitch, so the adware will not have an affect on my review.So, get this out of the way before the rest happens: The menu is ugly. However, that's the menu. In game, the graphics are good for a 12 year old game. Don't expect any nice landscapes, however. You're essentially closed in all the time, and everything is pretty linear.I got the game for free from somewhere. I noticed my friend had the game and asked him how good it was while it was downloading, and he said it was meh. When I got in, I played the first two missions, and thought it would get boring quickly as the only thing that was happening was I was running around with a sword and crossbow. I was hoping that wasn't it, but I uninstalled the game.I came back to the game today because I noticed it had trading cards and I figured I might as well play a bit and get some money. I played the first two missions, but noticed that when I finished the second mission I unlocked a new character called the huntress. I played with her. The only difference between them is instead of having a sword and shield she could have a bow and crossbow, however the knight could already have a crossbow and the huntress could have a dagger. While I was glad there was another character and was expecting more, the huntress really wasn't worth it. And up to this point, the combat has been pretty much the same. I played and unlocked a new character, the druid, which involves magic! She has 3 staffs, of which 2 are the same rapid fire and one is a charge up and summon. One of the rapid fire staves can poison but is very expensive (all equipment you take with you is limited by your money) and you can't either other staff, so it's better to go with the cheaper rapid fire and the summon. However, having the summon and rapid fire shot is interesting for gameplay, as it does mean there are different gameplay styles. The druid, while having massive damage, takes damage very quickly.I just finished playing and to my surprise- there was a boss! The boss can't exactly be damaged just by hitting it, but there is a different way you are supposed to do it. So the bosses aren't just dodge and hit, but they are more zelda style bosses. The only issue is that while fighting the boss there is no indication of wether or not you are actually doing anything until you do it quite a bit, and then he starts changing color so you know you're doing the right thing.I also unlocked the engineer, who seems like he'll have an interesting gameplay style as well!Overall, this game is quite fun. Worth $5? I would say so, as long as you're fine with not-so-amazing graphics (they are decent) and being mostly closed in all the time. If you want something better, an open world game might be more for you.			"

												I have to say... this is really bad. First of all you have exactly one attack. No block, no roll, etc. Just wildly spamming left mouse. Second, this is easy on the hardest mode. Third, this is a TERRIBLE console port. You can't even navigate the menu with your mouse... that's how lazy they were. No real graphics improvements either. Ironically you can't use a controller to play either. They did not make the gold fun to find either, its always just hiding behind the rock you are passing or stairs you are going up. And the saving is automatic at start of level with no checkpoints in between, meaning if you fell off a thin flight of stairs or something, you are stuck repeating the level.			"

There are plenty of times where a weapon doesn't even make contact with my character, yet I take full damage from that attack.Hit detection is poor and that's why I've stopped playing this game.			"

												Scripted within an ancient tome, which lies beneath centuries of dust in the guarded library of Meckalon, is the story of how I began playing this game.I grew up on this classic hack and slash, played it for years. If you're a fan of an engaging lore, descriptive graphics, cool weapons, even cooler characters, and smooth controls, then this game is for you. Yeah sure the graphics are extremely outdated but for a game made in the early 2000s its pretty good. There is an xbox version of this game but compared to that the controls on this PC version are a LOT easier to work with. I do like the walk feature on the xbox though. And you won't have to worry about having certain requirements with a game like this. I ran this on a Compaq Presario CQ62 late last year running Windows 7 on a 32-bit system, before switching to my current 64-bit Windows 8 Toshiba.And as someone who recently bought and played the game, I can confirm that the adware HAS been removed. However I've played this game for almost half an hour and I haven't received any trading cards yet.			"

												All right, Enclave is a very old game, more than 10 years old. But it's a good, old-school, sword-shield hack and slash game. You know, the story sucks, voice acting is meh, graphics are outdated. But that's not what counts. That old-school feeling back when we were playing crappy games (but they were their time's BEST of the best), that feeling of controls being a little clunky but somehow also familiar and nice, that feeling. That's what's in this game.Level design is good. The hitting/shooting/casting effects are satisfying. Story doesn't make sense, but like I said. Killing weird creatures with joy is what counts.It's $5 anyway. I would say it's worth for a couple days of nostalgia.			"

												A classic from my childhood that still held up when i ran through both the good and evil campaigns. Be warned that the graphics are very aged at this point and this is when arpgs were still a fresh idea so combat isnt as smooth as we expect in games now. If you are the type of gamer that does not do well with aged games then this game is not for you. However if you wanna see a blast from the past or experience a early game, go for it.			"

												Fun game, I was pleasantly suprised. You unlock new character classes as you progress and you can equip each character with different items using the gold you collect in levels. Definetely worth the asking price.It has a few issues with hit detection, but luckilly it works both ways (for you and your enemies) so you both miss most of the time :D "

												The Good:- Great visuals for a game released in 2002- Good soundtrack (works well enough for the fantasy themes...)The Bad:- The combat system is pure garbage. Really bad hit detection thrown in with cheap enemies who seem to strike masses of damage while you struggle to even land a decent blow. - Enemy AI is crap (but it often helps me when they jump to their deaths...)- Storyline and voice acting is medicore. - No RPG systems in place whatsoever. Purely gear based (which is not a bad thing), but I am not convinced on its overall execution, as the game's emphasis on combat just doesnt come across as fun. The Verdict - A Polished Turd.Visuals and sound aside, I found little to actually enjoy from the gameplay. If you like this style of this game, go and play Risen, Gothic or Two Worlds instead... They are superior titles.  "

												Nice graphics for the time,♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay for the ages.For it's era it has nice graphics and they knew that. They push the graphics all over your face. Every menu transition has overly elaborate and unnecessary transition animations. But now that it is a decade later and the graphics have aged all of these are just tedious instead. The game is an obvious console showcase title, and I could tell this was originally a console game just from the menu screen without prior knowledge. It just feels like a console game.Music is nothing special, I forget all about it about in 5 seconds as soon as I quit the game.Story is non-existant. Sure there is a huge plot dump with cutscenes and inter-mission logs but it is entirely forgettable. It's the most generic Good vs Evil plot ever. NPCs have no character and neither does the guy you control for that matter. And speaking of the guy you control, you can actually control many different types of classes. They unlock one by one after completing the first few missions. It's rather pointless since they all unlock just a few missions in.So you can choose what class you want to play as and by choose I mean choose Druid or suffer. Why? Because combat sucks. Hit detection is terrible. Picking an archer might sound nice but it is not so nice when you realize it is impossibile to hit enemies yet enemy archers have perfect aim. Even melee sucks, you just go next to and enemy and mash attack and maybe hit one third of the time. Hit detection is down right broken.The only class that is worth playing is the Druid because she has a staff that can cast ""homing magical bird missiles"" and summon a golem to fight for you (although don't expect golem to do much, the AI is terrible). Even homing missiles don't hit all the time, they just circle around the enemy and dissipate but it is your only choice if you want to beat this game without losing your♥♥♥♥♥♥over the stupid combat.But even with the Druid and her gamebreaking weapon, the game is still boring. Because the way the game is designed is more like a corridor shooter than anything else. There are no side objectives and absolutely ZERO exploration. In fact it does that annoying thing where if you steer of the road, it counts down and fails your mission, all because you wanted to get out of the linear path and maybe go for a swim.Levels are short and all you have to do is get to the next objective. If your objective doesn't include killing enemies you can just ignore them and go the next waypoint and beat the mission. One guy wrote that this game had varied mission. Phwahaha, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game has only ONE mission: Get to the objective area and kill enemies in your path if they block you from getting to the objective area. Every single mission is this. Even escort missions are like this. I didn't even have to escort the guy I was suppose to protect, I just ignored him and went to the waypoint and he turned out fine.Don't waste your time on this one, there are so many other games to play.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I gave this game a not recommended not because it is a broken/non-playable game or because it is not good, but maybe because of some features that the game offers which put me off. If this game did not have all the problems/features I complained about in this review, it would of got a recommended from me A real classical game, can't believe this was created by Starbreeze Studios! My favorite game company. The game is really good on first impressions, I like that there are two campaigns. Light and Dark, I highly recommend first time players play it on Easy, as you can die allot! On the whole, the game is really cool, a great RPG experienceBut I must warn you, that the game is really glitchy and really put me off with all of its bugs and glitches, and the game can get pretty boring quickly, so, if you like RPG games like this with some clunky mechanics and glitches, then this is the game for you, if on the other hand, you like RPG's but you want a good solid game, then this game is not for you NOT RECOMMENDED :(  I am not recommending this because the game put me off, with all of its problems, but like I said if you like RPG's with some clunky mechanics and glitches then this game is for you, otherwise, don't bother! There are many other great RPG's like the Witcher series (Which is currently on sale - Summer Sale 2014)  "

												Where should I start about this game.It cost me €0,69 and my life has been changed.It all began in the main menu when I was going to start a new adventure.The game gave me a choice if I wanted to play the light or dark campaign, because I'm an edgy guy I wanted to choose the dark campaign.Up untill this moment I thought the game was fine but then when I wanted to pick the dark campaign I couldn't because it was unavailable for some reason.Well alright I'll go with the light campaign not what I wanted to but oh well.Then I spawned and some random chick got blown up and then just disappeared.The moment I found out that collecting the maximum amount of gold each quest was more interesting then the quests and the whole storyline my whole view of the game was changed.This isn't an ordinary RPG, this game was made to see if you're persistent enough to collect all the gold.But this game does not only have action it also has some Mirror Edge like parkour.So not only can you ♥♥♥♥ up ugly goblins you also run around collecting gold like a maniac.12/10 Would play again for dark campaign gold collecting.

												Changing my review... I was criticizing the publisher choice of including an adware, opening the browser to advertise Ravens Cry- but thankfully they came to their senses and removed it.Enclave is an oldschool action hack n' slash on the similar veins of Heretic II (a personal favorite of all time), Rune, Deathtrap Dungeon and the like- with nice controls, first and third person view, an intriguing storyline and a nice lore and setting that still looks rather nice on modern computers unlike so many other oldies. For me its a newfound classic, a game i hadn't the chance to play on release... so yeah, no nostalgia here. If you like any of the games mentioned, you're bound to love Enclave.			"

												Fun game, I was pleasantly suprised. You unlock new character classes as you progress and you can equip each character with different items using the gold you collect in levels. Definetely worth the asking price.It has a few issues with hit detection, but luckilly it works both ways (for you and your enemies) so you both miss most of the time :D "

												Basically one of my favourite games of all time. Today, the graphics are a bit outdated, but the music is still very awesome and you really get a sense of progression by finding gold. Also, no browser is being opened with me, so no issues there. The game doesn't auto set your graphics, so make sure to set everything to high :)			"

												Having read some of the other reviews, the game has never directed me to purchase another game. That being said, I cannot sit here and play a game that cannot register attacks properly. After attempting to kill one of the early and easily killable enemies near the beginning of the game for a full 5 mins before I accomplished it, I really have no reason to recommend this game. You would be more frustrated at the game instead of being able to enjoy what could have been a really good game.			"

												This game is far better than I expected, when I first bought it on sale I expected a cheaply made, linear rpg.What I ended up getting was a well-made dungeon crawl that keeps me very entertained; with classic graphics, simple controls and easy but fun combat coupled with a complex story and some great voice acting, I find this is definitely a game for the western rpg fan or anyone who wants a return to the classic games of the late 90s and early 2000sIf I had to make a complaint it is only that the game requires some back-tracking but it keeps it relatively interesting with events that only occur when you return to various areas and creating reasons to explore.

												Where should I start about this game.It cost me €0,69 and my life has been changed.It all began in the main menu when I was going to start a new adventure.The game gave me a choice if I wanted to play the light or dark campaign, because I'm an edgy guy I wanted to choose the dark campaign.Up untill this moment I thought the game was fine but then when I wanted to pick the dark campaign I couldn't because it was unavailable for some reason.Well alright I'll go with the light campaign not what I wanted to but oh well.Then I spawned and some random chick got blown up and then just disappeared.The moment I found out that collecting the maximum amount of gold each quest was more interesting then the quests and the whole storyline my whole view of the game was changed.This isn't an ordinary RPG, this game was made to see if you're persistent enough to collect all the gold.But this game does not only have action it also has some Mirror Edge like parkour.So not only can you ♥♥♥♥ up ugly goblins you also run around collecting gold like a maniac.12/10 Would play again for dark campaign gold collecting.

												First off, this game is NOT worth full price.  I bought it for $0.50 with a coupon I got from badge crafting, and might have paid $2 or $3 at most for the content.This game runs fantastically smoothly on my potato and does look fairly good.  However, the controls, especially in combat, feel very inaccurate and inconsistent.  Evclave was basically a hack n slash the way I played it, just attacking continuously except to heal occasionally.  Sometime what you are supposed to do is very vague as well.  I got stuck on the second level because I had no idea what to do, and there weren't really any noticeable pointers toward what ended up being a cannon near me.Overall, this game is worth it with a discount, but has somewhat aggravating controls.  I'd recommend it if it's cheap because it is worth it when cheap.			"

												Yuck.. Just yuck!  I dont even want to take the time to do a proper review, as it was so bad... Terrible combat, and combat controls.. Its old, and  Not in a good way... In the way nostalgia allows Morrowind, or Baldurs Gate, Or Dragon Age, Icewind Dale, or any other childhood favorie/classic to remain playable, and more importantly, enjoyable still today, this does not.. Nor can I imagine this having ever been! Dont let the very misleading screenshots fool you.. You probably wont wanna play beyond the intro..Everything was little more than a narrow hallway.. Admittedly, i barely played an hour..So i couldnt even say if it gets better.. It was just.. I cant even put it into words.. If you tried that really bad Game of Thrones rpg, youll know what i mean by bad.. I have nothing good to say about it..			"

												First released in 2002 on Microsoft's Xbox, Enclave later witnessed a PC release in 2003. Though Enclave is without a doubt not without its flaws, it's still a very enjoyable game that offers a considerable degree of replay value. Enclave picks up after the end of a brutal war between the Kingdom of Celenheim and the forces of the demon lord Vatar, known as the Dreg'Atar. During the final battle between these two warring factions, the wizard Zale gives his life to cast a spell that tears the land asunder, thus preventing the Dreg'Atar from sending reinforcements to aid their main force. One thousand years later however, the rift separating Celenheim from the rest of the land begins to close and Vatar prepares to rise once again to take control of his mighty armies. Although Enclave places little emphasis on character development, the game still manages to present a fairly interesting narrative, driven to a greater degree by the events of the story rather than the characters. Siding with either Celenheim or the forces of the Dreg'Atar outland tribes, you assume control of a collection of nameless characters who are entrusted with important tasks by their leaders, that eventually lead them on a journey across the rift and beyond. Key developments in the plot are depicted primarily through a number of short, in-game cut-scenes. While Enclave's story doesn't do anything spectacular, it does present a few unexpected twists and turns towards the end, resulting in a satisfying and decent plot that gives context to the main characters' actions. After choosing a side, the player embarks upon a number of missions that lead them through various locales, including deserted temples, castles, forested areas protected by elemental guardians and virtually every other setting that one might expect to come across in a typical D&D setting. Each mission usually involves getting from A to B whilst collecting gold and defeating the numerous enemies that block your path, in some cases acquiring several key items along the way.Between missions you'll be given an opportunity to change the selected player character as well as his/her equipment, with the ability to purchase new weapons and armour using the gold collected during missions. Characters are divided into one of three types, including those focusing upon melee attacks, ranged attacks and magic-based attacks. While melee characters are capable of wielding strong melee weapons and shields, their ranged combat skills are somewhat lacking. Ranged characters in comparison are adept in the use of bows, but have no means with which to block enemy attacks, while magic-based characters are able to attack foes from a distance as well as block enemy attacks at the expense of some mana. For the most part this formula works well and the missions feel well-paced with plenty of action, and moments of respite when required. Near the end of the game, the unavailability of checkpoints on the highest difficulty setting can become a minor annoyance, as you approach the final portion of a long mission, only for a key character to die, thus forcing you to restart the mission from the very beginning. None of the missions from either of the campaigns are all that long, but it’s still an issue all the same, if only because it’s a step in the wrong direction: one that’s directed towards the introduction of ‘artificial difficulty’. If you already figured out how to get past a section of a specific level and died during the next section, then why is there any need to repeat the former part of the level? Surely the player should be allowed to re-attempt only the part they failed at, rather than re-doing every area that they already demonstrated they know how to get past. After all, that’s exactly what happens on the default difficulty level. Repeating portions of a mission you’ve already done doesn’t add any extra difficulty – it just adds padding. A greater issue however is the mission design itself. Some missions are clearly geared towards a certain character, which becomes evident after the fifth failed attempt at making it past the third group of enemies encountered, after choosing a character whom the developers didn't seem to expect anyone to choose for that particular mission. A prime example of this can be seen in the penultimate mission from the Celenheim campaign, in which the player is presented at the start of the level with a powerful melee-focused enemy, as well as a minimum of two ranged combatants who can easily whittle down a magic-based character's mana by forcing them to stop incoming attacks, before reducing their health to zero within mere seconds. Hit detection issues are also present, though this is more noticeable when playing as a ranged character.Most of the time the AI does a good job of presenting you with clever and fierce adversaries to fight, but on rare occasions enemies will freeze up and stand on the spot until you move past a certain invisible line drawn on the ground. Other times enemies can be easily fooled into committing suicide by walking into environmental hazards. One mission in which this can be put into practice sees the player coming to shore and arriving on a beach guarded by a few ranged combatants. If the player moves close enough to each one, they'll draw their melee weapons and proceed to follow the player wherever they go – including into the water, which proves fatal for them (though for some reason, not the player). Despite these flaws, Enclave's gameplay is still a very fun and enjoyable experience, and the option of replaying most of the missions as any character from that mission's respective campaign ensures a great deal of replay value, even if this can sometimes present some scenarios that are nearly impossible for certain characters to overcome. Then again, experimenting is fun right? Most of the character models are fairly well detailed, though some of the characters' faces are lacking in areas and look too basic in comparison to the rest of the model. Environments also benefit from a high-level of detail and lighting effects, the latter which often create a powerful atmosphere for each setting. Water has been surprisingly well animated and; from a distance; looks fantastic. A scene that stands out as a prime example of this can be found during a mission titled 'The Sanctuary' while staring out towards a lake set against the backdrop of a golden sunset, as the sunlight reflects of the water. Enclave features a subtle, if well-crafted soundtrack. Each track lends itself to give each setting a unique feel, even though a number of tracks are re-used for certain missions. Dynamic music adjusts to fit the situation, with its tempo increasing and decreasing when the player is in combat and out of combat respectively. The sounds of bowstrings being drawn, swords clashing and explosions going off all sound as they should. The majority of characters have also been well-voiced, though a few characters seem to have suffered in cases where their voice actor/actress has over-exaggerated and tried too hard. Enclave is a game that; despite its flaws; ends up being a relatively solid game with decent gameplay and an interesting plot to back it up. A fun game worth purchasing, even if it is a little rough around the edges.			"

												Enclave is a fast paced and unforgiving game. Imho it is quite underrated and misrepresented. First of all it´s not an RPG game...Basically you have a campaign with a mission after another. Instead of locking you into on character you can swap between them at beginning of any missions. You are not locked into any gear decisions either. So you dont buy and sell stuff. You simply can start with any item combo that correlates with the accumulated wealth so far. After completing certain missions, you unlock new tier of items. This freedom of choice made the game quite enjoyable.In Enclave as most enemies are capable of wiping you pretty fast on hard difficulty. An assasin can simply hit you once in the head with an arrow or a melee charracter can bash you off a cliff. Therefore, you must always be on your toes. Most maps are filled with traps that can kill you instantly. While many whine about these, practically every one of these can be spotted. You just have to be alert.There are many type of maps from simple towns, into caves and hounted houses. Level design is boosted by top notch music. Voice acting is also decent to say the least. Perhaps the most memorable map was Arc Moor fortress in light campaign. It is located in the middle of a volcano with only a narrow bridge leading to it. Naturally you have to get in while dodging arrows while trying to kite those heavy armored melees.There found only 2 major flaws in this game. 1. Swimming with mlook. When you turn, your movement momentarely stops. This makes swimming dreadfull on PC. 2. AI cant find paths in certain areas. Many also complained about no saves. On hard difficulty you dont even have checkpoints. So you have to able to go in, kill your target, pick that expensive loot and get away alive. Makes it way more thrilling.Naturally Enclave Graphics are outdated but for 2,5€ sale this game was a pretty neat bargain. It's actually best buy for me since Psychonauts. While it aint your basic 90 metascore game, it sure shouldn´t be as low as 71.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, sadly it's not the case. For this price I'd say go ahead and try it out but don't expect too much.Let's begin with the good sides :+ The graphics are really nice looking. I'm not being sarcastic^^, it's dated of course but it aged very well+ Lots of secrets areas to discover, exploration while limited is rewarded+ Two campaigns (Light and Dark)+ Multiples characters and weapon unlocked during the game+ The gameplay is kinda fun I guess, when it's not frustrating (we'll get to that in a minute)+ Targeted damages+ Some ideas are really cool like the fact you can shoot multiples arrows from your bow (even if I didn't understand how it works exactly and ended up wasting a lot of arrows), so I'll see which other games this studio has made, they might be cool if they improved from this one (Edit: Actually, they did good games after that! https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Starbreeze_Studios ).And now for the bad sides. These are small gripes that adds up and make the game really frustrating to play in the end :- Combats (especially melee) feels really clunky with no sense of impact. If it wasn't for the damage counts displayed over enemies and player, I wouldn't even know when I hit or being hit. In melee, you just mash your mouse in hope to hit the enemies, there is absolutely 0 strategy involvedWhen ranged, you wait for your bow/crossbow to be loaded, then you shoot to see the enemy move at that exact moment, back to the waiting... It's infuriating when you have to shoot an archer on a roof.Sometimes, when an enemy is too close to you, the arrow pass right through its body without dealing any damage- Switching weapons takes forever- No sense of achievement when you kill an enemy because there's no XP, loot (usually) or anything -> ok, this one depends on your tastes. I feel like the game would have benefited from some minor RPG elements- Escort missions that you lose if the NPC gets killed- Once you lose a mission, you have to restart it all over again, which isn't fun one bit... I'm not against difficulty but the combats feels so random that I don't feel like I learn from my errors or something, it just feels like I have to start over for no reason.			"

												Bought this game at a cut price; such a classic style Action RPG. Great combat, solid controls which are easy to learn and remember. Haven't got a controller to work with it yet, but with programs like XPadder, I don't see why it would be difficult; not necessary, but it shouldn't be too hard if you really dislike keyboard and mouse.The only downside is the low graphical quality; which is understandable when you consider the 2003 release date. Character models are pretty good for the age, but landscape textures are very blurred. Resolution goes up to 1080p, which is awesome, and for a port, the options menu is pretty detailed.I probably wouldn't recommend you buy this game at £3.99, since the game is so old now, that just sounds unnecessarily high. Like I said, I bought this in a sale and it cost me £1.			"

												When Enclave came out in 2003 I was engaged in other pursuits and games, so it came and passed fairly under my radar. I managed to snatch it in a promo campaign so with fresh eyes I gave it a go. Having played first few missions, my first impressions are positive. Yes, even after all this time, after more than 10 years, two more generations of consoles and after unimaginable enhancment in overall quality of graphic, production, but playability also, I can say I can still feel the solid (for its time, of course) design and interesting gameplay mechanics. What's different than current standards is that the game is devided in small separate areas with missions in them, rather than one seemingly conected open world. But the missions are short, have a coherency in the level design and can be replayed ad infinitum, if you left some secret with gold hidden. The combat is fun and diverse, 'cause you can pick one of many characters (classes) which all have several different spots for different equipment, so your options of killing baddies are fairly broad.The story is fairly standard fantasy fare with lots of strange names and metric tones of exposition in the begining. If you like the genre, it seems standard entertainment, but if you find all the apostrophes annoying, you won't like it. So overal verdict: much more things are positive, than negative, so a solid ""yes"" recomendation. If you manage to snatch it in some sale and like the 3d action RPG-light genre, you can find enjoyment in the game. If not, then there's no place for such an old game in todays saturated market.			"

												I've only played 20 minutes, so bare with meIt's alrightthe controls are good and the graphics for a nearly 11 year old game are pretty damn awesomeit's a simple game to run, so my crap computer(dual core 2.9 Ghz, 3 GB RAM, GeForce 210) can run it at max settings with 16x AA at over 150 FPSit's also fairly easy so far. I'm on easy and i just did the first mission. It's simple, but don't get cocky, it'll probably get harder.My big problems are the ladders are a little buggy and the game stutters MASSIVELY! It's on a fine line of unplayability. I've tried the game at bone stock settings and it still stutters, but it stutters at 400+ FPS.i'm not sure how to fix this issue, but i'm going to look it upConsidering the game is only $5.00 USD and plays on a crappy machine at 150+ FPS with max settings, i say go ahead and pick it up, but it might stutter			"

												Not really a lot to it, but considering you can get it for less than a dollar during sales, I'd say it's worth your time. A bit mindless, but the story is decent all things considered, the graphics have aged surprisingly well, and it's got no shortage of action. Decent game for mindless stress relief.			"

												Nice graphics for the time,♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay for the ages.For it's era it has nice graphics and they knew that. They push the graphics all over your face. Every menu transition has overly elaborate and unnecessary transition animations. But now that it is a decade later and the graphics have aged all of these are just tedious instead. The game is an obvious console showcase title, and I could tell this was originally a console game just from the menu screen without prior knowledge. It just feels like a console game.Music is nothing special, I forget all about it about in 5 seconds as soon as I quit the game.Story is non-existant. Sure there is a huge plot dump with cutscenes and inter-mission logs but it is entirely forgettable. It's the most generic Good vs Evil plot ever. NPCs have no character and neither does the guy you control for that matter. And speaking of the guy you control, you can actually control many different types of classes. They unlock one by one after completing the first few missions. It's rather pointless since they all unlock just a few missions in.So you can choose what class you want to play as and by choose I mean choose Druid or suffer. Why? Because combat sucks. Hit detection is terrible. Picking an archer might sound nice but it is not so nice when you realize it is impossibile to hit enemies yet enemy archers have perfect aim. Even melee sucks, you just go next to and enemy and mash attack and maybe hit one third of the time. Hit detection is down right broken.The only class that is worth playing is the Druid because she has a staff that can cast ""homing magical bird missiles"" and summon a golem to fight for you (although don't expect golem to do much, the AI is terrible). Even homing missiles don't hit all the time, they just circle around the enemy and dissipate but it is your only choice if you want to beat this game without losing your♥♥♥♥♥♥over the stupid combat.But even with the Druid and her gamebreaking weapon, the game is still boring. Because the way the game is designed is more like a corridor shooter than anything else. There are no side objectives and absolutely ZERO exploration. In fact it does that annoying thing where if you steer of the road, it counts down and fails your mission, all because you wanted to get out of the linear path and maybe go for a swim.Levels are short and all you have to do is get to the next objective. If your objective doesn't include killing enemies you can just ignore them and go the next waypoint and beat the mission. One guy wrote that this game had varied mission. Phwahaha, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This game has only ONE mission: Get to the objective area and kill enemies in your path if they block you from getting to the objective area. Every single mission is this. Even escort missions are like this. I didn't even have to escort the guy I was suppose to protect, I just ignored him and went to the waypoint and he turned out fine.Don't waste your time on this one, there are so many other games to play.

												I read weird reviews about how the game tries to make pop-up ads come on, but as I saw myself and as someone else who I saw reviewd this game, it doesn't do that anymore. I don't even know why that's a big deal in the first place. Anyway, this game was kind of fun. It had its moments and it was surprisingly difficult. It suffered from a lot of gameplay and level design issues. At times the game mechancis made the experience frustrating, although in the end the hardest levels were not impossible, but required immense precision and determination in order to overcome the questionable gaming mechanics and level design. Like some other people said before; collecting gold is KEY. It's the only way to have good equipment in the game. Thankfully you can replay levels to collect more gold in order to have better equipment before moving on to the next level. Ther are 14 missions and I missed like 2000 gold, but I was able to get the best equipment for each character. Anyway, it's a good time waster if you wait for it to be on 95% off, like I did. Otherwise I don't think it's worth 4.99.			"

												They must have fixed the advertizement that everyone is complaining about, but that still doesn't fix the game. The story is lack luster, the voice actors often sound like they are reading straight from the script, and the hit box is all wonky.The StoryThe game feels like a rehashing of a rehashing, there is no inovtaion to the story its just ""It's time for good people versus bad people."" Right away they open up telling you about the Rift, sort of, all you really get isthe people to one side are the good guys and the other side are the bad guys. Theres some story about a Wizard and a Demon that created the rift but the exposition felt long and the voice over was so terrible it put my dogs to sleep.The voice acting:Good God. It's almost like they decided to hand their script of to family members with no prior training and have them read it. Everytime some one speak I feel like I'm watching the original Star Trek and Shatner is playing all the parts. There is frequent pauses, and enflexions on the wrong words changing the meaning of sentences in the worst possible way, somtimes it even goes so far as to have to characters talk over each other; but hey, there's subtitles right? So if all else fails and you can stomache the terrible hit box you can always just read what they're saying instead.The Hit Box:I don't even understand how some people think this game is even playable.The hit box is minimal and if the enemy is backing up, even if that means they are backing up into a wall, there is no box at all. On top of that if you happen to hit something esle first; e.g. a wall, then it will just pass right through the enemy entirely, which is a problem because most of the game you're in a freaking corridor.

 Enclave [Warning: Long review]  Enclave is a third-person action game in which you can play as part of either the good or evil armies in an epic fantasy conflict. Though you'll begin on either side with a single playable character, you'll later rescue or unlock other character classes with various melee, ranged, or magic-based attacks that they can use to defeat their enemies.But fighting isn't very precise, or very fun, in Enclave, since the game has unreliable hit detection; sometimes arrows and swords will pass right through your enemies, and your enemies' attacks will occasionally fly right through your shield (if you're carrying one) and damage you. In addition, your characters generally don't fight very quickly; most ranged weapons take a while to reload, and most melee attacks consist of a series of slow-moving, preset animations that take a while to conclude and leave you vulnerable to a counterattack. And most of Enclave's characters don't move very quickly either, so you can basically expect to take hits from your enemies no matter what, especially when multiple enemies swarm you (as they often do in later levels of the game). Your character can pick up and drink health potions, but you'll do this just as slowly as you fight, run, or change weapons, so this can be of limited use in small areas crowded by multiple enemies.Enclave was an extremely difficult game on the Xbox, and its difficulty has been toned down in the PC version so that enemies don't kill you with a single blow, but you'll still suffer severe damage when hit by unseen traps for the first time, and you'll most likely find the game's limited save-game system to be frustrating. You can save only at predetermined safe areas, which, in certain levels, are few and far between. Make a wrong move or get mobbed by too many enemies, and you'll be sent all the way back to your previous save point. In addition, Enclave's levels, while not particularly huge, are still fairly big and will often require you to backtrack through them several times. It's safe to say that Enclave would have been a much less frustrating game to play if it had featured both a better save-game system and an in-game map. Enclave isn't a particularly lengthy game otherwise, and since it has no multiplayer options, you may not get much out of the game in the long run.In many of the game's levels, you'll need to backtrack to find a particular item or enemy or to lead a computer-controlled companion to a specific goal area. Unfortunately, Enclave's AI for both allies and enemies is inconsistent and occasionally quite bad. Any allies you must lead or escort through a level will stop dead in their tracks if faced with even a small obstacle. There's no way to issue any commands to your allies, so you'll often have to leave them behind, even if they were supposed to help you fight your way through the level.The enemy AI is usually good about attacking you when you come within range, and some enemies will even taunt you when they have you outnumbered. However, some enemies will get stuck on environmental objects as they try to follow you around them, and other times, if you back away from them a short distance, they'll simply stand still for no good reason. When this happens, they're easier to pick off than when they mob your slow-moving character who's poorly equipped to handle attacks from all sides, but the game's unreliable AI and equally unreliable control make for fights that are mostly unsatisfying.It's too bad that Enclave has these problems, because its presentation is otherwise quite impressive. The game's sound effects and voice acting are passable, but you may be too busy paying attention to Enclave's great soundtrack to notice. The game's somber, oppressive music does a great job of providing atmosphere for Enclave's often-dark, gothic fantasy setting (which consists of dimly lit fortresses, secret passages, and ancient temples of evil, among other things). Enclave also looks extremely good. Though it was originally developed for Microsoft's Xbox console, it holds up quite well on the PC. Even though the game's textures begin to show seams and jagged edges if you play the game at resolutions of 1024x768 or higher, the quality of Enclave's graphics and design is unmistakable. The game's developers clearly put a lot of effort into creating the detailed textures that adorn its levels and its highly detailed characters, who speak with animated facial expressions in the in-engine cutscenes. Though many of the game's levels consist of generic-seeming fantasy locales, such as a dungeon, a temple, and a medieval town, their good texture work and lighting, especially shadows cast from torchlight, make even the most run-down areas look good. In fact, some of Enclave's environments look surprisingly original, even artistic, such as an abandoned sorceress's lair that's filled with both deadly traps and breakable glass cages of fluttering butterflies.Though the game's developers clearly put a lot of work into the way the game looks and sounds, Enclave's gameplay just doesn't measure up to its presentation. If you do pick up a copy of the game, you'll probably appreciate Enclave's sound and graphics, but you may also find that the game itself has too many problems to be enjoyable for long. Enemy AI in this game was quite well done; a challenge to play against and that is what Starbreeze Studios needed to do with this game, is make a challenging AI. The AI is quite clever. Enemy archers will draw their blades for close quarters combat and take cover during reloads. Enemy soldiers will draw their shields to defend against your arrows. Overall the AI provides for challenging opponents in the game. Sorry for this really long review XD			"

That said you can redo any level in order to get more of the gold, and if  you gathered more then the previous time that much is added to your stash.			"

												Enclave is everything you don't want in a game. Don't waste your money on this. 1/10.I give it a bad rating because it had adware. I know they removed it, but just the fact that the devs would do that makes it even more unappealing. It has a dull and barely thought out story, and predictable enemies are all out of place with their difficulty settings. It's not good. Okay graphics for a game made when I was born, but don't waste your money. If you've got a coupon, go ahead, but if not, don't buy it. Not worth it. At least play a decent game.			"

												First off, this game is NOT worth full price.  I bought it for $0.50 with a coupon I got from badge crafting, and might have paid $2 or $3 at most for the content.This game runs fantastically smoothly on my potato and does look fairly good.  However, the controls, especially in combat, feel very inaccurate and inconsistent.  Evclave was basically a hack n slash the way I played it, just attacking continuously except to heal occasionally.  Sometime what you are supposed to do is very vague as well.  I got stuck on the second level because I had no idea what to do, and there weren't really any noticeable pointers toward what ended up being a cannon near me.Overall, this game is worth it with a discount, but has somewhat aggravating controls.  I'd recommend it if it's cheap because it is worth it when cheap.			"

												First released in 2002 on Microsoft's Xbox, Enclave later witnessed a PC release in 2003. Though Enclave is without a doubt not without its flaws, it's still a very enjoyable game that offers a considerable degree of replay value. Enclave picks up after the end of a brutal war between the Kingdom of Celenheim and the forces of the demon lord Vatar, known as the Dreg'Atar. During the final battle between these two warring factions, the wizard Zale gives his life to cast a spell that tears the land asunder, thus preventing the Dreg'Atar from sending reinforcements to aid their main force. One thousand years later however, the rift separating Celenheim from the rest of the land begins to close and Vatar prepares to rise once again to take control of his mighty armies. Although Enclave places little emphasis on character development, the game still manages to present a fairly interesting narrative, driven to a greater degree by the events of the story rather than the characters. Siding with either Celenheim or the forces of the Dreg'Atar outland tribes, you assume control of a collection of nameless characters who are entrusted with important tasks by their leaders, that eventually lead them on a journey across the rift and beyond. Key developments in the plot are depicted primarily through a number of short, in-game cut-scenes. While Enclave's story doesn't do anything spectacular, it does present a few unexpected twists and turns towards the end, resulting in a satisfying and decent plot that gives context to the main characters' actions. After choosing a side, the player embarks upon a number of missions that lead them through various locales, including deserted temples, castles, forested areas protected by elemental guardians and virtually every other setting that one might expect to come across in a typical D&D setting. Each mission usually involves getting from A to B whilst collecting gold and defeating the numerous enemies that block your path, in some cases acquiring several key items along the way.Between missions you'll be given an opportunity to change the selected player character as well as his/her equipment, with the ability to purchase new weapons and armour using the gold collected during missions. Characters are divided into one of three types, including those focusing upon melee attacks, ranged attacks and magic-based attacks. While melee characters are capable of wielding strong melee weapons and shields, their ranged combat skills are somewhat lacking. Ranged characters in comparison are adept in the use of bows, but have no means with which to block enemy attacks, while magic-based characters are able to attack foes from a distance as well as block enemy attacks at the expense of some mana. For the most part this formula works well and the missions feel well-paced with plenty of action, and moments of respite when required. Near the end of the game, the unavailability of checkpoints on the highest difficulty setting can become a minor annoyance, as you approach the final portion of a long mission, only for a key character to die, thus forcing you to restart the mission from the very beginning. None of the missions from either of the campaigns are all that long, but it’s still an issue all the same, if only because it’s a step in the wrong direction: one that’s directed towards the introduction of ‘artificial difficulty’. If you already figured out how to get past a section of a specific level and died during the next section, then why is there any need to repeat the former part of the level? Surely the player should be allowed to re-attempt only the part they failed at, rather than re-doing every area that they already demonstrated they know how to get past. After all, that’s exactly what happens on the default difficulty level. Repeating portions of a mission you’ve already done doesn’t add any extra difficulty – it just adds padding. A greater issue however is the mission design itself. Some missions are clearly geared towards a certain character, which becomes evident after the fifth failed attempt at making it past the third group of enemies encountered, after choosing a character whom the developers didn't seem to expect anyone to choose for that particular mission. A prime example of this can be seen in the penultimate mission from the Celenheim campaign, in which the player is presented at the start of the level with a powerful melee-focused enemy, as well as a minimum of two ranged combatants who can easily whittle down a magic-based character's mana by forcing them to stop incoming attacks, before reducing their health to zero within mere seconds. Hit detection issues are also present, though this is more noticeable when playing as a ranged character.Most of the time the AI does a good job of presenting you with clever and fierce adversaries to fight, but on rare occasions enemies will freeze up and stand on the spot until you move past a certain invisible line drawn on the ground. Other times enemies can be easily fooled into committing suicide by walking into environmental hazards. One mission in which this can be put into practice sees the player coming to shore and arriving on a beach guarded by a few ranged combatants. If the player moves close enough to each one, they'll draw their melee weapons and proceed to follow the player wherever they go – including into the water, which proves fatal for them (though for some reason, not the player). Despite these flaws, Enclave's gameplay is still a very fun and enjoyable experience, and the option of replaying most of the missions as any character from that mission's respective campaign ensures a great deal of replay value, even if this can sometimes present some scenarios that are nearly impossible for certain characters to overcome. Then again, experimenting is fun right? Most of the character models are fairly well detailed, though some of the characters' faces are lacking in areas and look too basic in comparison to the rest of the model. Environments also benefit from a high-level of detail and lighting effects, the latter which often create a powerful atmosphere for each setting. Water has been surprisingly well animated and; from a distance; looks fantastic. A scene that stands out as a prime example of this can be found during a mission titled 'The Sanctuary' while staring out towards a lake set against the backdrop of a golden sunset, as the sunlight reflects of the water. Enclave features a subtle, if well-crafted soundtrack. Each track lends itself to give each setting a unique feel, even though a number of tracks are re-used for certain missions. Dynamic music adjusts to fit the situation, with its tempo increasing and decreasing when the player is in combat and out of combat respectively. The sounds of bowstrings being drawn, swords clashing and explosions going off all sound as they should. The majority of characters have also been well-voiced, though a few characters seem to have suffered in cases where their voice actor/actress has over-exaggerated and tried too hard. Enclave is a game that; despite its flaws; ends up being a relatively solid game with decent gameplay and an interesting plot to back it up. A fun game worth purchasing, even if it is a little rough around the edges.			"

Graphics are on point despite its age, music its also great. Story is good but nothing mindblowing.However, Enclave can be overwhelming sometimes since there is no quick save, only checkpoints. Some mission can take hours if you don't take the necessary care or if you made wrong choices.Still, I found it enjoyable and recommendable. "

												This game is quite old, and yes, it crashes sometimes (Actually now seems fixed by removing v sync) frame rate is embarassing same is the camera angle, but still I think the game itself is quite enjoyable: Many characters to play with, many weapons, 2 different campaigns. The graphics are not that bad for a game of more than 10 years ago, and some effects and plot twists are almost surprising. It has even the right level of difficulty. In particular, it is damn hard to find all the coins in all levels, but doing so is unsuitable and annoying 'cause of backtracking. I am actually enjoying playing it again after so much time. It was one of the first game in bought as a 11 years old :')			"

												The medieval fantasy setting is well done, the levels are short, but well designed, the voice acting is pretty good.  Character classes have distinct styles, visually and functionally.  The money/loot/equip system makes you balance the weapons, armor, and ammo in your loadout, since you can't change it during play, though you can occasionally pick up extra things during a level.Unfortunately, the age and porting shows on this game.  Melee combat is clunky, blocking is randomly effective, ranged combat is an exercise in frustration.  All the enemies are faster than you but the AI is rudimentary. The menus are keyboard navigation only, an artifact of the porting, I presume. There are occasional unrecoverable errors and CTD's, some of which go away if you change to OpenGL, some if you change back to Direct3D8.Overall, it's an average game suffering from a mediocre porting.  For a single-player fantasy action/adventure game, it's brief, but decent.			"

												Very fun game, for what it is. Gameplay is a lot like an early beta of Morrowind or Oblivion, except in 3rd person instead of 1st. Great grab if you can get it for free.			"

												The reviews speak for themselves. The game itself is amazingly beaut, though the graphics aren't that good, but the game's environment, setting and plot are amazing. It is a simple-to-understand game (though the gameplay itself may be confusing and involves a lot of ""active"" searching) that involves both brawn and brains (in a way).For Doges: many beeyooteeful, such awesum, wow, enwironmend gut much omg, sexy♥♥♥♥			"

												I would like to thank TopWare for sending me the Steam Key for Enclave. I am definately not disappointed it's a fun game at an affordable price on steam. I highly recommend TopWare games, and Enclave 5 bucks you can afford that anyway :P			"

												Enclave is a fast paced and unforgiving game. Imho it is quite underrated and misrepresented. First of all it´s not an RPG game...Basically you have a campaign with a mission after another. Instead of locking you into on character you can swap between them at beginning of any missions. You are not locked into any gear decisions either. So you dont buy and sell stuff. You simply can start with any item combo that correlates with the accumulated wealth so far. After completing certain missions, you unlock new tier of items. This freedom of choice made the game quite enjoyable.In Enclave as most enemies are capable of wiping you pretty fast on hard difficulty. An assasin can simply hit you once in the head with an arrow or a melee charracter can bash you off a cliff. Therefore, you must always be on your toes. Most maps are filled with traps that can kill you instantly. While many whine about these, practically every one of these can be spotted. You just have to be alert.There are many type of maps from simple towns, into caves and hounted houses. Level design is boosted by top notch music. Voice acting is also decent to say the least. Perhaps the most memorable map was Arc Moor fortress in light campaign. It is located in the middle of a volcano with only a narrow bridge leading to it. Naturally you have to get in while dodging arrows while trying to kite those heavy armored melees.There found only 2 major flaws in this game. 1. Swimming with mlook. When you turn, your movement momentarely stops. This makes swimming dreadfull on PC. 2. AI cant find paths in certain areas. Many also complained about no saves. On hard difficulty you dont even have checkpoints. So you have to able to go in, kill your target, pick that expensive loot and get away alive. Makes it way more thrilling.Naturally Enclave Graphics are outdated but for 2,5€ sale this game was a pretty neat bargain. It's actually best buy for me since Psychonauts. While it aint your basic 90 metascore game, it sure shouldn´t be as low as 71.			"

												I was playing the demo of this game when it was first released on PC.Then I thought it was a good game.Now, after i've completed it, and even after so many years, i think this game is amazing!Clever and interesting design, surprisingly smart enemies, distinctive player characters - overall feeling of the game - it is just so much more, than you expect.And then, there is the dark campaign...It exceeded my expectations in so many ways and i think it, definitely, deserves more recognition and positive feedback from the players.:enclaveskull:			"
